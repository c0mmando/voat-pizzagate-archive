            That means a lot. Everything has been crazy right now BC of the holidays- I dk if you saw or not but I already got some flyers put out- I am working on the second design right now. As soon as I get a few done I am going to try to find some people that seem up to it/trustworthy and try to mass distribute the designs to people who live in/near big cities and mail them tons of copies to post where they live. That way it wont cost them any money/time to print or copy them and it will be easier for people to distribute. Networking /working together as a whole is the only way we are ever going to be able to get anything done- and especially with the way that the media is twisting/censoring everything re: this - It isn't going to be easy but spreading info in ways other than social media is going to probably have the biggest impact now. They can censor the media but they cant censor real life.

            Could we crowd-source a lawyer? We need someone to start loosening the media's grip. All these pedophile cases are breaking worldwide, and the mainstream is covering it up, this has to stop.

            Great idea — thank you for taking the initiative! One more idea. Kony 2012, although founded on misinformation, was VERY effective at getting people around the globe to take action in a coordinated manner. Could we pick one day in January for everyone to…
• Print posters / stickers / cards  to tape / wheatpaste / pin in cities around the world
• Tweet / Facebook / etc. — Thunderclap helps automate this process
• Buy online ads and target influencers
• Have house parties to watch relevant movies and discuss the topic
• All the other awesome ideas!
Having a target date, coordinating across channels (Voat, FB, etc.), and asking people to make a commitment for that day will help ensure action happens. :)

            More gofundme ideas for online activists . This is a great thing for someone unemployed who wants to help the cause and make a small amount of profit for their time.
-Websites exposing pizzagate 
-billboard rental
-tshirt creation / sales
-posters
-trinkets , fridge magnets, bumper stickers etc.

            Same here, luckily I've got older kids, cause we're doing a "late Christmas" We have had all but one car break down, bought a truck thinking it needed only a transmission. That's turned into a mess. One car=One person working. I can't even LOOK for work until I have reliable transportation. Til I can, this is my work. I can get a hold of transportation when my husband gets home each day, it just can't be counted on at a certain time. So, I can put flyers around. I sent a few posters that I printed myself for the kiddo to put in the break room at her work. I walked around the grocery store with smaller coupon sized awareness cards, and wedged them in and under things, like the couponers do. I even braved the restrooms.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have not braved WalMart yet...Lord give me strength. The stores are the best spots to leave stuff now, because the biggest shopping days are upon us. Christmas Eve (I worked retail) is HELL, the store is so busy you could go through 3x in one day and perhaps reach hundreds. I live in a county that elected Clinton, but the state elected Trump. But the public distaste for her now is ripe for this awareness. And, the internet CAN'T censor it. They'd have to follow us all around finding what we've left, and where before they can censor IRL work :)
           </p>
           <p>
            If we still have to throw money at awareness, my tax refund this year will be quite decent. I'm owed from last year, and we'll have this year's; so I'll be able to donate hefty then if needed. I will try to put $10 in now though. I cancelled my Apple Music subscription to do so....Google Music offered 4 free months, so I went for that. The $10 budgeted aside for that I can put here.

            It does not make sense to use Facebook. They are one of the main censoring agents now for Pizzagate. I quit FB for this reason. There are alternatives for groups and private forums via an internet search. Groupbox is a free website for online groups and may be a good option.

             I dont use fakebook either but the fact remains they have the biggest user base so it is a good strategy to keep talking pizzagate on ALL social media platforms to wake more people up. Critical mass exposure is what will win this battle.

              I very much agree about continuing to useg Twitter and Facebook to expose Pizzagate. But taking things to the next level (phase 2) and exposing PG to the masses will create more of a threat and they will push back hard (look at their long track record). I want to be involved, but prefer to remain anonymous which you can't be on FB. There are other safer options. We have to be smart and protect ourselves.

               I agree with all comments saying that they will push back hard and that FB etc. will censor even more, but so far, I have not been censored, because - and this is the right thing to do at the moment since we don't always have "hard proof beyond a reasonable doubt" - I choose my words wisely, I don't rant, rave and don't deliver hate speeches: I only say what is proven and always give sources, otherwise I use terms like "it looks like / it seems likely, possible / one gets the impression that" etc. This way, I am fine legally.

                I agree. I have a Twitter account and often post about Pizzagate. I'm not worried about that level of exposure. My cautionary comments were about the private group forming for Phase two of distributing materials on PG to the masses. TPTB will feel more threatened and with real names necessary for FB, those in the private group are taking a risk as the group will get infiltrated. I was suggesting a private group that allows us to remain anonymous. We all know about the long lists of people who have been silenced. Prominent Twitter people have been banned and/or given death threats for posting about PG.

               i cant agree more... one of the main reasons i never used fakebook is the massive surveillance. That being siad i am all for anyone who has a fakebook account to expose this as much as possible, everywhere for that matter. Fakebook, twatter, posters whatever, the more the better.

            Don't know if it was already mentioned here, but I was quite successful promoting other important topics to a big audience by doing what I am going to explain here. Luckily, I have a good reputation on FB (am the author of several books) and never let myself draw into silly arguments, so people tend to accept and trust me:
           </p>
           <p>
            I used really big groups on FB to post what I wanted to say. I either used groups I was already a member of, or I applied to other big groups. The topic of those groups usually had nothing (much) to do with my message, so before posting anything, I contacted an admin and explained my "case", asking them to allow me to post. Usually, they were very understanding and allowed my post. If we all do this, we can reach masses!

              I want to worry about it.  I want to give but I'm trying to make a new practice of avoiding supporting those unsavory types.  And  I'd like to also  be a gentle encouragement to those wanting to receive contributions to start making these alternative means more popular so it can become easier for us all  to avoid them.

            Also, keep in mind- the media has already conditioned the public to think Pizzagate is bs.  I feel like a rebranding effort would be in order.  This think is so much bigger than Pizzagate.   Give it validity.  If it were me doing it, I would start if off my saying something like "Did you know that 124 US Government taxpayer payrolled top officials,were all arrested and charged with various child pornography, child rape, etc on government computers for hours on Government time.  Really, Just look it up "               .. yadayayda."    Grab Attention.  To the point.  Shock Value.  Give it some validity.

            Apologies up front if I repeat:     DuckDuckGo replaced my google browser as the Duck doesnt track movements.  Just a heads up if you dont use already.,   I worked TV sales and Radio sales for many years.  I've have a lot of experience negotiating buys, promotions and I always did my own creative. (wrote 100's of ad's).  At one time I have my own commercials rotating on 4 radio staitons in Knoxville TN lol   Anyway, let me know if I can help.  I live in Florida now. :)

             my husband called it duck duck goose the other day, I laughed so hard. I'm proud of him for using it though, and actually listening to me about this whole thing. In Firefox, if you use the toolbar while searching, you can right click Duck and it'll set it as the default search engine.

            I think we've got to add validity... I posted 124 DIFFERENT government, taxpayer paid employees who were busted for child porn/pedo, on my fb page. Yep, sure did... took me a bit but itll get your attention when you see the list... makes you think.  I have 700 fb friends.  Keep on keeping on

            drop the information from the air.... who has a bunch of drones or access to a plane :)  Hey, it's worth a thought.   I have a background in marketing, worked in TV and Radio.  Billboards super expensive.   Mass mailers can be inexpensive and  effective with good creative (postcards), with links to infor online.

            What about hiring graphic designers for to create images people can put on their own sites or print up into posters?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or what about asking the graphic arts community to donate help?  Anyone know any or graphic design professors?
           </p>
           <p>
            Create a nationwide competition for some of the best graphic designs for the net and/or for posters and let people vote on social media for the ones they think the most of.  That creates attention and gets the art community aware.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pedophiles have created revolting artwork, so maybe people would want to fund competitions or art work that helping in getting this truth out.
           </p>
           <p>
            What about graphic designs that expose the (%#^@$&amp;#*@&amp;^$$$$) "helping" agencies that are trafficking kids or working with the CIA and killing them vaccines (UNICEF, Save the Children, etc.)?

            I've seen some cheap billboard ads - check out www.yourbigsign.com - I've gotten quotes for $299 - $399 per week. They do charge more for political signage but you might be able to get around it. (Pretend you're a non profit?)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just for Metro Detroit, Michigan but you could look up "Digital Billboards" and I'm sure you've could get similar rates.

             I usually spend the day talking to people/sharing things online, and at night when I can actually sit down and focus is when I sit down and do hardcore digging/research. For now I think we just have to take what we already know and start doing something with it- so as soon as things calm down around here I will get started asap. I usually stay up til 4-5am reading up on all this stuff, so definitely by the morning there will be the START of something. I want the majority of us to agree on a beginning idea though- and to be able to more effectively communicate we need a better platform. So if a private fb group/page hasn't been made yet for us to be able to discuss this/share ideas on- then that will be the first thing I do.

            DEFINITELY need the private forum. If someone can do that today, that would be awesome. If not I will attempt to make one later tonight once the kiddos are in bed. I dedicate literally at least 7-8 hours a night researching/sharing info lol. I realize I have become beyond obsessive, but christ- it is almost impossible not to.
           </p>
           <p>
            I even dream about pizzagate related shit almost every night now. I dk. I feel like I have some kind of calling to do something about this, as crazy as that seems. Last night's dream was about Queen Elizabeth and her role in all this crap lol. Ughh.

             It's permeated my dreams. Last night's dream, I was in Hawaii trying to find Obomber at the dreamy hotdog stand...There were hundreds of him when I "Found" the stand. I found it beneath the ocean. I was able to swim to a hole, and it was a different world. I"m still tripping on that one.
            </p>
            <p>
             This week,after the attack in Berlin... I dreamed I was walking in the Berlin Christmas shopping area and looking at shoppes. The pope was tending one of the "shoppes" That was friggin' odd. I startled awake and had to have chamomile to calm myself. I always think my dreams are there to tell me something, not straight out, I need to read between the sleep lines. I lucid dream, so I know I can get places, like I did with the Ocean, and exploring Hawaii, and Berlin. Learning as much as I can in awake world, helps me in dream world.

            I think a projector would be a good idea, I saw someone doing this in Toronto one time to advertise a theatrical play. They projected the ad on the side of a building, it was very noticeable.

             my sis actually suggested that. still in the brainstorming stage right now- want to try to reach as many people as possible, the least expensive way possible.

            TV/newspaper ads might be an option but you'll need a lot of money to make good ads (unless some creative person can do it) and then need even more money for airtime. Though if you keep it local (national newspapers/tv) it might be cheaper. Running an ad on ClintonNewsNetwork or some other global channel is possible as long as you pay them enough.

              National newspapers is not too expensive. You could print an ad in EU countries big national newspapers. Just an image of a crying child with #PIZZAGATE under it or something to make people curious to find out more.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another thing that is possible is to ask people to donate their ad-vouchers. Both Google and Facebook give those out regular to people via go daddy and others hosts. You could use them for targeted small campaigns.

            Congrats, you over doublely surpassed your GoFundMe goal!
           </p>
           <p>
            Some advice to everyone who will be putting up flyers: I've printed a lot of posters and flyers for various causes and found that my local college print shop is cheapest in the whole town. Might be worth it to call your local college and see if they print for the public (mine does) and what their prices are.

              Well, my local college already printed about 50 copies of an Anti-vaccine flyer for me with no questions asked. I think it's plausible.
             </p>
             <p>
              And you're paying them. I bet they'd love to make a lot of money in printing.

            Good point.  I can't say if you mean only the pedo issue, but I am also thinking what fbi anon said, CF....    maybe I should be in a different sub.

            And possibly once the poster/flyer is ready, I bet either Christopher Greene at AMTV, or David Seaman would either do a YT video about the effort, or give tips on doing one.

             Don't count on C. Greene too much, cause he said it was true but he believes the elite are using it as a psy-op to discredit us and the Alt-media as fake news and push for censorship... David Seaman, on the other hand, I'm sure he'd be happy to. So would Reality Calls and Tracy D.

              I would agree, but after watching the Mr Cati's video last night, I posted the link in a comment, I am starting to believe the 2nd amendment goal more than I used to.

            OP,  two things, when the poster/flyer is made, you might want a reference or url to voat?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I don't know if people offering or suggesting doing graffiti, are shills or sincerely trying to help.   But you might want to address in your post, whether this IS OR IS NOT part of this effort.  Since it's illegal most places, and we don't need to be SET UP, I would think it should not be allowed or encouraged in this crowd funding project.

                Thanks.  The whole PG thing has gotten me in a dark mood lately.  But I will have more time this weekend, and maybe on more helping organizing.

                I have to disagree about graffitis. I'm not a shill at all here and I'm for graffitis and I'll tell you why. I might be wrong, but I believe that graffitis have always been illegal and it has never stopped the artists from creating them.You don't have to draw them yourself, but ask someone to do it for you. They are an extremely powerful tool, too. Graffitis are the voice of the unheard, the political voice of the persecuted, the unaccepted and the rebellious... Aren't we, PG believers exactly that?

            When we did missing pet posters and 8 1/2 x 11 flyers, it was all in a 50 mile radius, usually.  But even then, it was cheaper for the flyers to print out one, and take to a print shop to get copies.  Or print out one at the print shop then copy.

            I have been lurking for awhile. Awesome idea!
We can ALL pass out flyers! Need a global poster and message! Everyone keep list of businesses and corps that will not allow flyers and posters. Car windshields and placing flyers in free trade papers. Public restrooms, leave in seats of public transportation. Ask truckers to post on their rigs. Go house to house tape on front doors. Go to public libraries and place inside books. Go to bookstores and place in books and magazines. Go to hotels, motels slip them under the doors. College campuses! Department, Grocery, Gaming stores. Ect....

             All good points.  I'll just mention, from missing pet flyering experience, church parking lots on Sunday mornings don't always like flyers on windshields! :).  Or some homeowners and leaving on their door.  Which is why we stuck to local-newspaper-only bins.

              I agree, however when made to remove flyers they will read info, so hit them once and the word still spreads

             As for FB, once a poster is decided on, just searching in FB, by city, type of organization, location, interest group will bring up a gold mine of pages to share the poster as a PDF.  Right on the poster, or in the FB post, could be  mentioned 1) to print, share, hang up, and 2) Contact info if a child needing help or want to report something suspicious.  Maybe a reliable organization could give feedback on the poster.

             I would just ignore them, shill, probably paid shill.  But they do point out that we have to be, and still will be vigilant and extra cautious of them.

            How about something like this for a business card to leave everywhere?  Obviously the hashtag and QR descriptor can easily be changed.  I like the motto "Seek the Truth - Save the Children".  How could one not look.

           </p>
           <p>
            Edit 1: I keep thinking about this more and more.  The business cards can be left anywhere - train, bus, airport, restaurants, shopping malls, etc.  If the same business card starts popping up all over the US, it will garner media attention.  Whomever spearheads this effort (website, etc.) is going to put a target on their back.  If tens or hundreds of thousands of these start popping up all over the US, people will take note.

            I also strongly urge an eponymous Twitter/FB/web domain to 1) build the brand identity and 2) keep people away from Voat.  The serious will navigate here, but we don't need anymore mouth breathers in this sub.

             I do like the idea.  One note to think about, FB, Tw, and YT are blocking entries with the actual pizzagate word in it.  Not all, they haven't stopped them all, but just in case.

            I got a 2 dollar bill back in change with "Jail All Pedophiles" stamped on it. Of course that is not legal but I like the idea of the attractive nuisance.

             Did you know that a young abducted sex slave victim (Franklin Cover-up) by the name of Johnny Gosch reached out to his mother this way? He had written on the front of a dollar bill: "I am alive -- Johnny Gosch."

             Is it illegal to write on your dollar bills?  Always find writing on the notes in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe if it isn't illegal, you could write #pizzagate is real on some of your bills, but if it is, I'm not suggesting it.

            I want to donate to this cause but I need reassurance that it's legitimate before i put money towards it. My financial situation is depressing but this is something I feel a primal urge to donate to. Never donated to anything before in my life. Where is my money going and how is it going to be used to actually spread awareness?

             Dude, I definitely feel you on the "making sure its legitimate" thing. I am just now reading thru all the comments here, this all needs serious thought and careful planning. My first idea was to just generate mass flyers and put them up everywhere, but so far I have read other amazing suggestions as well on here. I am going to do the right thing but I want to make sure that we are all on the same page/agree on the use of funds.

            If you haven't done it already, you should make and add a BTC donation address as well. I can help with that if you need it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also have a Shift debit card that can automatically deduct from a BTC balance based on the current spot price.
           </p>
           <p>
            I even made this vanity address: 1pizza5sNXcUkQAL2cj9V5X6qzzM6EkTY
           </p>
           <p>
            I have the private key saved on a paper wallet and can hand it over or I would happily act as the curator. Or if you'd prefer another method with the BTC I can help.

            Thank you for this! Please spread on Facebook and Twitter, everyone.  We needed a next step as things were getting a bit stagnant, especially with the shills infiltrating Voat. You have given the Pizzagate movement new life and a viable and easy way to expand our power and influence. We can use the same tactics of election campaigns and have volunteers from towns and cities to coordinate efforts.

            Dya think we could remove the Anonymous mask, I think they are discredited and makes this look illegitimate. I think maybe one of the pictures or something visceral that forces people to take it seriously\? Just IMO, great idea tho

             I agree.  Not sure what picture at this point to replace it with tho.   Maybe something like a teddy bear with a tear, or drawing of cold holding a bear, etc.

            I'm jobless atm and couch-surfing due to recent eviction, so I'm too broke to contribute financially -- but I'm 100% dedicated to the cause. I've been relentlessly uncovering and putting together the pieces to this bizarre puzzle. My point is, any research or assistance you need, I'm willing to do whatever's within my means to help. Let me know.

            Its been on my mind for weeks. I too am strapped for cash, but honestly a corrugated political sign which reads: "
            <strong>
             PIZZAGATE IS THE NEWS
            </strong>
            ", put them on the telephone poles at intersections where people naturally stop.

            It would be great if we could set up an image sharing community on a platform, ideally moderated for trolling, so that we can collect the most effective art and design to promote awareness of not only PG but all related crimes and scandals. Print-res stickers and posters, but also meme-able digital designs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am a designer, living in NYC, and I have already been active with my own custom PG stickers in manhattan. We need to escalate the ground level awareness. Does anyone have a good forum/image hosting platform in mind for such a task? Maybe admittance is based on what is submitted to the group?

            Don't ignore the best way to spread the word.  Be a walking Pizzagate advertisement.  Tell the world with shirts and hats that redpill the masses.  Put decals on your car, too.

            I'm caught up on the process of moving, but I'll see if I can drop a few dollars when things settle. Maybe even discreetly print out some flyers at work. Are QR codes really that popular? I don't see a lot of them.

            Yes totally agree - could we also maybe organise in some way by linking people together by which city they are in so they can meet up if they want, or is that too dangerous?

            As has been mentioned repeatedly, here is what I would do with 500.00:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Use a blind registrar to secure a domain name - I liked www.pizzagate101.com - but it was taken (20.00);
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Build simple but eye-catching website.  Not complex.  Solid facts and graphics.  Provide lots of quality links.  The cost will vary, depending on how you build the site and what tools you use.  Or, if you barter with someone who can build it.  My guess is you can figure out how to get this done nicely.  Worst case scenario, you can find someone through graphic sevice portals who will do this for 20.00 per hour.  A simple site if you have the graphics and copy ready to go shouldnt' take more than 6 hours to build.  (120.00);
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Design a simple business card - slice of pizza, WHAT IS PIZZAGATE?  and a QR code which reveals "PIZZAGATE IS REAL.  SAVE THE CHILDREN.  STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING.  WWW.CATCHYPIZZAGATECOMAIN.COM" (Cost - 0.00 - I'll even do it for free)
           </p>
           <p>
            4) ORder business cards through Vistaprint or Cafepress.  But do this from a service where everyone else here can order the same business cards for themselves.  Here - 5,000 business cards, 2-sided, full color, for 59.95 + shipping
            <a href="https://www.gotprint.com/business-cards/standard">
             https://www.gotprint.com/business-cards/standard
            </a>
            (65.00)
           </p>
           <p>
            Total capex: 205.00.
           </p>
           <p>
            Use the balance of the money for another PR campaign.  Keep your powder dry.

             Wow, thank you! I am just now reading thru these comments and I am so pumped, yet overwhelmed at the same time. My sis is dedicated too (and a hell of a bargain shopper as well lol), she is going to help with all this as well. I cant get over how many amazing people there are. I think my faith in humanity may be being restored lol

               my note -this helps me get through this. The info being discovered is like going through the stages of grief. OUR ANGER will ensure the defeat of EVIL! *

              it is clear that protecting children and all who are vulnerable, weak and oppressed is central to God’s character. Jesus demonstrated that children are to be cherished, valued and protected. He taught that they have a special place in his kingdom and his followers throughout history have worked and prayed for a future in which children are secure in the Father’s love.

            Making a video of you putting up posters in your neighbourhood, putting flyers in mailboxes, and chatting people on the street would help convincing us to support the effort. We don't need to actually see who you are, just what you do.

           <p>
            I'll post more about this tomorrow as we're finally getting to the point where we can start revealing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm currently working on a social information platform intending to restore the balance to the news. With the use of A.i. we're changing how feeds are structured. We are creating a dual ratings system for (User ratings, and verified professional ratings. The catagory trees are very complex, and allow for the very best of the best to trend to majors.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also organize by type of post. We have three different post types
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Informative - Articles, publications, informative blogs. We also include video, and podcasts.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Dissucsion - Think like a self/text post. A post that will allow you to ask a question or conversation in a catagory.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Shout - How non serious material, and links will be submitted. Also can be used like a tweet.
           </p>
           <p>
            With our user profiles we will have a general user hierarchy that helps us assign vote weight, bias, and to finally stop manipulation. In addition the verified accounts allow us to sign professionals to their niche.
           </p>
           <p>
            We want to build this into a wonderful platform where armatures and local news alike always have to chance to trend with real journalism. Not to mention we expect the community to hold journalist accountable for their articles with both votes and comments. Journalist who write bias pieces and don't respond to user, or professional critism in anyway will have a bad time.
           </p>
           <p>
            If launch goes well we will begin to design a very complex advertising platform that will allows users to choose which ad type that would like to us, as well as big returns to power users, and journalist so that they can continue their work.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a whole our team has over 30 years experience engineering software, and over 15 years experience in Artifical intelligence specifically. We will get this done. I would love to welcome all open minded critical thinkers when that time comes.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the mean time the best way I know how to help is by stringing together and working with other like minded people. I've been able to find a person I work with now because of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also a lot of opportunity to be had fellas, and for good reason. These people run Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Etc and they are the people who give money to these startups. Peer Thiel, Marc Andressen, Mark Suster, etc. Could go on for days. You can absolutely make a difference, you just may have to bootstrap yourself if you can.

            ANYTHING u can contribute, in whatever form, will be incredibly helpful to I guess what we should consider- reference to WikiLeaks- "Phase 2". We need to start moving ideas in every direction possible- not just keeping this info confined to the web/social media.

            You can not diagnose a dis-ease by examining the point of inflamation to find a cause and diagnoses.This has to be a world investigation and then after roping in all areas can you squeeze down on the sites that have come to the light.Firstly one must understand the powers that be are not from the USA or restrain in her....One must know that the US is the spearhead but she is not the hand that directs it.
                   Then one has to understand the owner of said agencies as the CIA,mafia,knights of malta,UN,TRI-LATERAL...SO FORTH and so forth....taking into hand the fact that the CF only operated in countries were birth certificates were not certified(this says a lot).Then understanding who controls the the ownership of the certified entities and fictions(BIRTHING CERTIFCATES) you will realize that the CF was salvaging.

            The absolute BEST BEST BEST idea came from someone on here - not me. Can't locate it right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Change the name of our wireless routers to #Pizzagate. Then, whenever anyone is looking through the list of available wireless networks, that's always on the list!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The cool thing about this idea is that it:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             takes about a minute to do
            </li>
            <li>
             costs nothing
            </li>
            <li>
             gets wide exposure
            </li>
            <li>
             makes everyone feel as though they are contributing, which they ARE!
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Can you imagine what would happen if thousands of people began to do this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Since I read that idea on here, I changed mine immediately and so has everyone in my family and everyone I know.

              At one time, I named my router "Surveillance Van 002" One of the meth-y neighbors (thank GOD he moved) were trying to get into our wifi. They weren't smart enough to do it, my password isn't easy to figure out AT ALL. I always enter it in wrong when I have a new device. I managed to scare them completely. Being there IS a van that stays parked down the street, it worked so well. That neighbor was so paranoid, he warned me about "the white van" LOL
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, there's a "hot spot" located in my area. I found this out during the PokeGo craze this summer. My yard spawned great things apparently, perhaps there's a way to name it. As I travel down my street a join network box comes up, and I can see at least 6 router names, some are pretty funny. We're close to the freeway, potentially reaching tons of people. When there's a traffic jam it's stopped for awhile. When I'm in a jam, I play on the phone. Being Friday, and so near Christmas there's a few a day, so I'm going to go ahead and do this. If it attracts the fuzz, I'll warn everyone. I think if we think carefully, there should be no issue.

              You bet!  Last time I checked, it was almost twice the initial goal, and just started!  We are DEFINITELY sending a message!  Hopefully twitter/FB don't ban the link; if they do, it might have to retitled a little.  I almost wish we could add some of the child pictures at the GFM page, but don't know if that's legal.  Or if we knew one of their real names, could name it after the child.  Anyway,  we've barely even started!  The MSM (and megyn Kelly for that matter) gave us even more motivation!  Thanks sellout MK.

            Def time and truly a wonderful move from your heart! 
-We'd talked in another thread about the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">
             White March
            </a>
            as well as moving beyond #Pizzagate. Picking a date we all march around the world (more time needed to organize)
- Along the lines of the colored ribbons and safety pins I saw something where it was an arm band- we could all pick a date once a month to wear a white armband and would certainly get asked what that is about. Or if not armband perhaps a handkerchief.
- write letters to newspapers and  other state representatives demanding an investigation answering our questions
-Personally I'm looking at different trafficking orgs I could or would want to volunteer with. Since we all know non-profits are not always what they seem- it might be good if  we had a list of vetted orgs we know are genuine. With Holidays soon - my plan is action at start of year. Which also leads into a pretty large part of me is waiting to see what happens after the inauguration. Can't count on something happening so need to step up action with plan

              If we use red, black, white, pink and blue handkerchiefs for the march, we'd have killed two birds with one stone. We already uncovered the boy girl lover logos... Stealing the pedos handkerchief code to make it a new symbol for pizzagate would mean all pedos of the world would have to find a new one. Do you know how much time that would take? That would be fantastic!

            I can definitely contribute with this, as I am an artist. I've mostly been researching and sharing videos, articles etc. Which is all good and all but we must get creative. People tend to pay more attention to eye catching posters, Infographics etc. This is a must to do. And I have the tools - adobe photoshop, FilterForge, Sketch Up, Autodesk, etc. Which I can use. I will forward any PSD files I make to the designated person in this effort. I will contribute monetarily in whatever amount that I am able to do so. I greatly appreciate everyone's efforts here. Truly this must not allowed to continue on. It needs to stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and yes suggestions, ideas, inputs, brainstorming would be fantastic. We should engage in this effort strategically to get the most exposure and make every penny count.

             if i may throw in my two cents, in regards to content of posters and meme's it would be a nice starting point for skeptics, in my opinion, by showing the masses that this investigation is not partisan, i have said in comments in the past that the msm's attempt to paint this investigation as some sort of alt right conspiracy against the dems is fucking ridiculous. maybe throw in something about dennis haserts, im just spitballing here but anything to let people know that both sides of the aisle are implicated here. to drive my point home i was a bernie supporter and i even voted for obama the first time, and i am as shocked and disgusted as everyone else here. im fully on board with getting as many of these scumbags out in the open as possible, but we need to let the public know this is not a political issue and get as many eyes as we can looking at the evidence
            </p>
            <p>
             tl;dr version: protecting our children should not be a political issue, and political party loyalty should have nothing to do with it.

              Yes good point. We have to effectively counter this partisan nonsense. We need to say it loud and clear. Hmmm I think I have an idea for a message. I will make a mock up and share it.

             And when a group of us searched and found missing dogs, bright neon posters helped a lot.  What also really helped was distributing printed flyers in every possible local newspaper bin.  Not US mailboxes, which is illegal.

             Yes, we need to start thinking outside of the box. What we have been doing has been making a difference, but not a big enough one if we truly want to make a change. We all have different skill sets/ideas/info/etc to contribute to this. I dont know how to describe the feeling that I have- it is something i have never felt before and cant put a name to it, but it feels like my soul has been lit on fire. There is some sort of drive and dedication and something else... I have never ever felt, or knew existed before now. This is our time.

              Good posts and ideas all.  And maybe with the holiday weekend we might have a little more time (hopefully not less) to brainstorm.  And to Isthisreality's point, I had a similar reaction last night, not specifically to PG itself, so I apologize if this is off topic, but I heard Dr. Gorka say 'theyre are now 65 MILLION DISPLACED PEOPLE' in the world, mostly stemming from the unrest in the Middle East.
             </p>
             <p>
              I had to rewind and recheck that, 65 MILLION!!  It hit me like a ton of bricks.  Not only 1) how many DECEASED people, 2) and how much of that was caused by these evil people on PURPOSE, but 3) what a f@cking MESS this adminstration has left for President-elect Trump to have to deal with.  GREAT JOB, BARRY!  Like I said, it's probably off topic, sorry, but certainly is making their evil doings a lot easier.

              I agree and this is a fantastic idea. We have to think outside the box. I can offer some language translations, although I'm still learning. I know people who also know the language. It's mandarin, perhaps that way we can reach a broader audience.
             </p>

              I'll do whatever I can, just let me know.

               thank you for your offer! Brainstorming is obviously in progress right now, we just need a better way to organize/communicate/plan everything.

               Very good point, the language translations!!!   Also, from Norway and Australia, a couple countries who have cancelled or cut back CF donations, those citizens and media might be a good receptive audience to include.

              Just donated. I really wish I could give a whole lot more. This is a noble cause and one which needs dire attention. ☺

               You are amazing beyond belief. God, I appreciate it so much. This is giving me so much hope and inspiration, I can't even describe it. We need to figure out a better platform to communicate on. If someone can make a private fb group for us to communicate on that would be awesome, but if one isn't made my tonight I will (attempt to) make one. I've never made one before, but Im sure I can figure it out easily.

              I agree. Is there a way to set, like for example a google hangout or something of the sort, so as to come together and brainstorm and put together ideas and really hone in on what the focus must be visually - subject, materials, visual appeal, message, shock value, emotional appeal, an organic human appeal which would pull on the conscience of every human being.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think we need something of the sort. Because in order to see a massive success we must be organized and on the same page with one another. There must be a unity in our message and method. This has been proven historically. All movements of social reform succeeded because they were organized.

             So much &lt;3 from me to you and everyone else. I would ideally like for us all to agree on an idea/design before any of the contributed money gets spent on anything. I know others on here have more creative minds, are more thrifty, and have more skills than I do. I have OCD, dedication, passion and time. We all need to work together and offer what we individually have to make this work. Even if it is nothing but emotional support/motivation. We are all in this together.

            I think posters is a good idea, every city has walls where everyone sticks up posters advertising night club events (in the uk anyway) , a few pizzagate posters with a link so voat and the facts could get people taking

             That's what I was thinking as well.

             I'll try to edit my comment in a bit with a list of links containing a handful of places online that you can order hundreds of flyer or poster prints of the different infographics for extremely cheap. Hell, you could even get nearly free business cards printed with just a simple message and a QR code linking to a PizzaGate introduction / informational post, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             If anyone / everyone that could afford the few bucks to order prints (or print yourself at home - but it would end up costing more in ink to print a large amount of flyers / posters yourself - not to mention, the ones you'd order would be professional quality) could do so and spread them around the area they live in - it could help greatly to spread knowledge across all different places!

              Other simple ways to spread the message that I personally use- post-it's on trains/bathrooms/grocery items. Not too big, but I had a lot of them and they're fairly cheap. Just write #PizzaGate is real with voat.co/v/pizzagate on the bottom. You're welcome =) get that wishlist up and edit it into your post so when people wake up it's there. Hide your address from 3rd parties in the settings so people can't find out where you live. You can use a fake name for the address as well.

            Great idea.  Thanks for your devotion to the cause. I believe crowdsourcing needs to happen. In our corrupt world nothing talks action like money. Would be great to eventually see crowdsourced legal action or investigations or whatever.
