<p>Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.</p>
<p>"The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."</p>

<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.</p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.</p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.</p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.</p>
<p>" You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."</p>
<p>http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm</p>
<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.</p>
<p>http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at their lyrics now.</p>
<p>" Infants\' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. "</p>
<p>" The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. "</p>

            Horyshit is trolling for anti-Semites - I suspect TheCovenant is another sign-in or confidant, since it's identical info. key factor in determining this is USING NAMES TO "PROVE JEWISHNESS" - so gtfo.

            Trying to get the entire board blacklisted as antiSemitic. Nice try, but we aint bitin.

            You could say similar things about (The Crazy World of) Arthur Brown for example and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ou0fSPZax4">
             he was even cited on the pedo special episode of British comedy show Brasseye back in the 90s as a slang word for pedophile!
            </a>
            I don't think any of this is of any relationship to pizzagate whatsoever but perhaps I'm just saying this as "a fan of Satanic music" (and indeed Coven). I don't think the political elite nor child traffickers are anything to do with the history of rock music outside of perhaps the business heads of major global record labels/entertainment industries.

             This is Jewish Khaballism.  Pizzagate is Judaism.  You people don't get that or you're just trying to suppress the information.

              Need I repeat "outside of perhaps the business heads of major global record labels/entertainment industries"? Believe it or not, a psychedelic rock band that put out a handful of albums in the early/mid 1970s isn't quite the same level of power or esteem as Epstein, Saville or whoever else. Clearly I "don't get it" or I'm "trying to suppress the information", this hasn't got anything to do with trying to suggest we don't stray off the tracks into a load of drivel about rock bands nobody outside of a niche community give a crap about.

                  Okay, so, a US rock band called Coven started playing about with Satanic imagery. They weren't the first to do this and neither where they the last. They have a 13 minute tune that's meant to be representative of a black mass. Some of em are Jewish and they worked with a Jewish producer (unsurprising in the USA).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What does this have to do with the Clinton Foundation, the Podesta leaks, operation Dark Room, the nabbing of a bunch of Norski nonces and Norway then cutting their funding to the Clintons by as much as 90%, Comet Ping Pong and James Alefantis, his relationship with the Podesta bros and so on? Where into the narrative does this fit, how can you tangibly relate it to pizzagate and how will doing so substantiate the argument? Because from where I stand, what you have said simply appears to muddy the waters and do so unnecessarily. As for your factually sourced information, yea Coven are a rock band with Satanic themes that has Jewish members and has worked with Jewish production staff. None of that needs debunking - it just says absolutely nothing whatsoever.

                 <p>
                  PS: If you can do any of that, great. Otherwise, this is nothing but conjecture upon nothing that says nothing about anything and does not serve to further substantiate the pizzagate argument whatsoever.
