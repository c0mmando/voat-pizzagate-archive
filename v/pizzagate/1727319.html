<p>I don\'t know how feasible it would be to get everyone protesting on the same page, but this would absolutely guarantee the impossibility of compromise. With the right planning and coordination, this could be a very powerful demonstration. </p>
<p>But not everyone lives in Washington or can afford to travel and take time off work for something like this. So what is a simple way we can all get involved in a real way that goes beyond a Tweet or an upvote? </p>
<h1>LETTERS AND POSTCARDS!</h1>
<p>Some of you may have heard about operation postcard, and if you participated, thank you for being a patriot! If you missed the memo, or forgot, it isn\'t too late! </p>
<p>I propose that we should be in a <strong>constant</strong> letter and postcard writing campaign to FLOOD the White House with the message that we are fed up of waiting for an acknowledgement of what we all already know, and what anyone with an internet connection and an open mind can find out. We need an investigation, and public trials or there can be no confidence in this or future administrations.</p>
<p>For every week that passes without acknowledgement, each and every one of us should send them a reminder. It\'s easy to ignore tweets and emails, but cards and letters will add up fast if we can get our shit together. </p>
<p>Anyone from anywhere in the world can anonymously send a postcard (no return address required!). If you send a letter, you will obviously need to include a return address, and the letter will have to be inspected by the secret service, but postcards do not need inspection. I suggest doing both. </p>

            Some great suggestions here and I really think we should rally behind this next course of action as a cohesive community of change bringers.  The idea that those who attend protests/marches are bound to an agreement of passive, civilised and proactive behaviour makes perfect sense as it would give so little ammunition to the MSM, provocateurs and naysayers in general to smite our efforts and malign us as a group.  Anyone who breaches this agreement will be called out immediately and will be made to look pretty obvious that they're not representative of the community.  Above all we need to rise above the parasitic tactics of the media and saboteurs and maintain our emotions.  This will enable us to outmanoeuvre the opposition and make gains.

              I've been doing this so long. You don't understand how big the battle is. These forces were there when our country was founded. They've been around for 2000+ years. At least.

             <p>
              There is an ultra-tight nit "they". They own it all. I still don't understand why they exist, or how. They're so old. I am beginning to believe that this giant syndicate is really a mask for something much more vile.

              Awareness is nice to finally see. I never would have guessed 12,000+ people would be discussing things that got me labeled a fool for so long. We will see where change takes us. I'll send a letter to the Commissioner just for the shits and giggles.

               Thanks for this. It's good to be reminded the scale of this battle every now and then. It's easy to forget when it seems like we are so close to accomplishing something.

               I only became aware of this in October when Wikileaks was dropping bombs every day. That woke a lot of people up, and it felt like an unstoppable movement for a while. I just don't want to see us grow complacent, you know?
              </p>
              <p>
               I feel like the momentum is finally on our side, and I don't want that to change. I guess we'll see how this plays out.

                 For the longest time I was sure WL was compromised, but Vault7 and all the interviews and press conferences had me fooled... I knew something was off with how politicized they became.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is too weird. What are your thoughts on Vault7? It really seems like WL is working with Trump considering the timing of that first release and Trump's wiretapping tweet. We'll see where it goes I guess, there is supposedly more to come. Could this be their medium to stage a false flag Alien invasion? Or "partial disclosure"? Have you heard of the secret space program (Corey Goode/David Wilcock)?

                  They are willing to reveal things that we already know in order to keep people following the Trump train, the controlled faux opposition to the powers that be. Assange's interviews can be easily forged using 15 year old technology, given the computing resources and complacent computer scientists. I'd imagine the Simpsons episode is correct when it predicts Trump dying.

             Not saying it does or doesn't, but I posted this in pizzagatemods asking them to make a bigger point of the letter writing campaign. They then made a sticky about not advertising the current protests, without addressing any of the points I brought up to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were taking too long so I decided go ahead and make the post on my own and see what the community thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             This addresses more than just the protest sticky, the most important thing is the letter/postcard campaign, which is a separate issue, which might explain why it is not taken down.

            A silent protest could be a powerful statement, but only if
            <strong>
             1)
            </strong>
            numbers are significant (1000, 2000...? I don't know.)
            <strong>
             2)
            </strong>
            participants could actually STAY SILENT and follow the rules.
            <strong>
             3)
            </strong>
            Big media covers it. These things are anyone's guess. Note: You can't make people "

             Oh Yes!  I so agree.  We would make them so much more frustrated and angry if we were composed and did not respond to anything they may try to create.  They may try to tempt people by inserting shills start a riot or fights.  Just remember you represent the children and all of us that could not make it.  Please be peaceful.  It says so much more.

             I agree, it would be a challenge without numbers. This is something that would require months of planning and advertising. It would have to be understood to be a silent protest well in advance of the actual protest day. If that understanding is established, then rule-breakers are identifying themselves as opposition whether they are or not, because those are the rules

             The silent protest is something that I think we should get serious about if we do not have a response by late-May/June. I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt for now, since this must be an enormous task for them if they really are draining the swamp.

             In the meantime, I really think letters/postcards are our best bet
