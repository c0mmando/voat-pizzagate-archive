<p>I have no idea how credible the information is, as the source is anonymous, but it comes from someone claiming to have worked at Comet during his college years. Here are the interesting parts - the material in quotation marks is exactly as printed on the GPL site:</p>
<p>&quot;It is a pedophile ring. I am sorry; not everyone there is complicit but the men behind the scenes are. There is also a wicked, genocidal element of Zionism. I am not anti semetic and dated a very kind Orthodox Jew from the place. I have already said too much. Anyhow, I am astonished this has come to light.</p>
<p>The people running this place archive massive files of gay pornography. They pay poor people cash and drugs to destroy their lives on camera. They are depraved drug addicts.</p>
<p>Look how the media berates anyone who tells the truth.</p>
<p>Look out for the pedophiles of SoHo Playhouse in NYC. Remember this.</p>
<p>Understand the higher levels of law are complicit. God help the United States. ...</p>
<p>The basement is a front for &quot;Shows.&quot; Yes, they have performances. But for heterosexual White employees virtually everything is hidden. People are in and out at all &quot;Off&quot; hours. I know because I lived nearby and witnessed it. All it took was a single person knowing I had seen them and they took to writing page long letters of lies for weeks on end to drive me to the point of having to leave because I was getting nervous. Militant, anti White homosexual fascism. I am not kidding. ...</p>
<p>It was a traumatizing thing to be a part of. I was regularly accosted. When the owner and his main people found out I was not going to be photographed having my dick sucked, I was finished. You have to understand that the people involved offered money for men to ejaculated into a shot glass on their birthday, as a present. &quot;The Palace of Power.&quot; Fuck it, I don\'t even care if I get in trouble. This shit needs to be called out and shut down.&quot;</p>
<p>Source also gives a list of celebrities he says he saw come to Comet:</p>
<p>&quot;Kathy Lee Gifford, Edward Albee, Alec Baldwin, Joan Rivers, Lance Bass. They are the creepiest who first come to mind. ... Another name I\'ll add to the list: Avi Adler. Not a celebrity, per say, but a powerful pedophile involved. Also Margaret Chardiet, an occultist. And Alice Mottola, a literal practioner of witchcraft. ... As per Kathy Lee Gifford, I did not get the impression she was there to prey on little girls. She could be very elusive. What I will tell you is that she rolls with pedophiles. Another guest, perhaps the least shocking, is Anderson Cooper, known for anal fisting parties at a gay bar in Lower East Side. He is a pedophile.

             I was a fan of Edward Albee. Hedied this year (Sep 16th, 2016) at age 88. Here's his connection to SoHo Playhouse:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The main floor [of the
             <strong>
              SoHo Playhouse
             </strong>
             ] was transformed into a theater in the 1920's, and in the 60's operated as the Village South, home to Playwrights Unit Workshop under the direction of
             <strong>
              Edward Albee
             </strong>
             ."
  --
             <a href="http://www.sohoplayhouse.com/about">
              http://www.sohoplayhouse.com/about

             , emphasis added
            </p>
            <p>
             The Playhouse's artistic director, Darren Lee Cole, also seems like a pretty normal guy, at least from his twitter account:
             <a href="https://twitter.com/DarrenLeeCole1/with_replies?lang=en">
              https://twitter.com/DarrenLeeCole1/with_replies?lang=en
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             He even seemed to support Johnson/Weld, FWIW.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Playhouse does stage shows dealing with pedophilia, among other "sensitive" topics. I'm not sure how significant that is. Two such productions:

            Its half truth disinfo. He has some facts and the rest is bullshit I imagine. Notice the blatant anti-gay sentiment in his post. This is a way to discredit us.

             Yep, and the post could easily be disinfo, trying to associate us both with being anti-gay AND anti-semitic ("genocidal zionism").  Poster also gave no specific information, nothing we could use to verify.  I say take it with a grain of salt.  There is too much focus on "gay" here, which isn't the issue.

             True. But it's designed to draw in conspiracy interested webizens, so not everyone is a shill there:) But basically, a high quality informer will quickly realize the place's management is rotten.

            You should read up on Godlike Productions. There was a thread about it on

             /v/Pizzagate
            </a>
            . It's part of the conspiracy. Can't recall everything, but easy to find out. It's located in Jersey. Read up on that place. In other words a limited hangout/disinformation hub.

              Assuming that this is disinformation (I am not an expert, by any means), it would be to give us a dead-end trail to spin our wheels on. The purpose of disinformation is to mix truth with lies; with just enough truth to keep us occupied and just enough lies to cause us to question ourselves or to make us look like morons when we go down the wrong path.

              It's already working, here; because I am seeing more and more new people (which is great) who are starting over on leads that have been investigated. Since the investigation has been so fragmented, the subsequent inquiries become more and more polluted with lack of information and the disinformation that has since been introduced. The goal of this is to get us to throw our hands up and quietly go away.

               I see.  It's not easy to discern what is and isn't disinformation when all of what is being stated seems like the truth, at least to me... then it's just confusing. What you suggest makes sense. You're right, it is already working here.  But thankfully there are enough passionate people gathering on here to make a movement in some direction, however disorganized.

             GLP has always had an annoying vibe to it. Hordes of unconscious users - maybe just a high concentration of shills.

             I keep telling folks Hillary 'Caligula with Cankles' Clinton will use 'homophobia twisted to the nth degree' as her dismissal of this. and there is waaay too much ammunition from this investigative community that feeds into that. I think the moderators should ban the use of the word faggot from this sub voat (not on others where homophobia is incidental) - but on this topic its a political/PR chess game and we are like exposing our fucking queen with all the homophobia or failure to distinguish pedo from gay expressions. Cheese and other food references are not used exclusively in the pedo world, we should be mindful of that distinction when making conjecture about the merits of evidence or we can tar an innocent gay with a pedo brush and that will fall RIGHT into hillary's hands

            If the OP of that ama really did witness these things he can come forward as a witness and help actually charge these people. At the very least he can do more than anonymously post vaguely xenophobic conjecture with no corroborating information other than his word.

                Not if you had a smoking gun like those claims, you think the media wouldn't bite if a former employee corroborated the allegations? Much less that then the government would try to kill him, like that wouldn't scream cover up or anything

            It looks it comes out of nowhere, but I think we can investigate a bit these names and see if there is a lead behind them and therefore take this testimony as serious. Good job anyway

             The names are one of the things that inclines me towards thinking that this account might be genuine. It's a list of names I find entirely plausible, particularly what is said about Anderson Cooper, which I'm sure someone told me (verbally) once.

              I may be too out of step with the general public, but last I knew AC has a lot of public credibility and sympathy. That was actually the name drop that made me the most suspicious of this post. Seems like a set up so that if/when CNN gets around to covering this they can bring up the AC smearing and wave it all away as nutty/hateful with their demographic that respects him.
