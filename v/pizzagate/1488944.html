<p>I can\'t come up with much <strong>names of journalists</strong> right now but I <strong>googled some + Pizzagate and nothing showed up.</strong> Why not? They talk right? No honestly <strong>I\'d like to know what they have to say in all of this..</strong></p>
<p>Are they either: <strong>seriously in danger</strong>?;   <strong>possesed by the child abusing devil</strong>?;   <strong>bustn nuts because told to shut up</strong>?  ; <strong>or able to explain all the \'circumstancial\' evidence we find daily?</strong>? - or do they say, <em>\'I just don\'t believe it\'</em> or something along those lines?

          <p>
           Since Pizzagate I've been thinking about
           <strong>
            House of Cards
           </strong>
           , the Canny Podesta/Stamper resemblence and
           <strong>
            using &amp; killing a journalist
           </strong>
           and a hooker
           <strong>
            to control politic nonsens
           </strong>
           .
           <em>
            "One journalist killed and all the others hide and shut up."
           </em>
           &amp; Ms Underwoord
           <strong>
            being raped by militant
           </strong>
           which creates a cover-up controversy,
           <strong>
            but that is beside the point here
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Anyway,
           <strong>
            journalists want to investigate right
           </strong>
           ? Are they really
           <strong>
            all obedient to the narrative
           </strong>
           that is being told currently by the MSM?
           <strong>
            Is the power to cover this up so strong that no one is allowed to question the things we find?
           </strong>
           <em>
            Let's find out, ask em...
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           I can't come up with much
           <strong>
            names of journalists
           </strong>
           right now but I
           <strong>
            googled some + Pizzagate and nothing showed up.
           </strong>
           Why not? They talk right? No honestly
           <strong>
            I'd like to know what they have to say in all of this..
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Are they either:
           <strong>
            seriously in danger
           </strong>
           ?;
           <strong>
            possesed by the child abusing devil

            bustn nuts because told to shut up
           </strong>
           ?  ;
           <strong>
            or able to explain all the 'circumstancial' evidence we find daily?
           </strong>
           ? - or do they say,
           <em>
            'I just don't believe it'
           </em>
           or something along those lines?
