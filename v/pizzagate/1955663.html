But he sure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U">flipped out</a> when his <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateproof/1696971">Pegasus Art Museum</a> was discovered. That tells me Pizza isn\'t at the heart of Pizzagate. Modern Art is. Besides the obvious historical precedent of Art being used to launder money Modern Art plays a much more nefarious part in this story.</p>
<p>In fact Modern Art plays a <a href="https://youtu.be/3xcJejrJyEo">prominent role</a> in this story. You may remember artist Arrington de Dionyso is who painted the aforementioned decapitation murals at Comet Ping Pong. Arrington seems to have a fascination with decapitated heads. Here\'s a painting he drew of a naked woman holding Trump\'s <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-0CdoA-5mLWD7L2879fW_A.jpeg">decapitated head.</a> Arrington is a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">Art Brut School</a> (and he\'s waaaaay hipper than you so don\'t even try deplorable). The problem with &quot;Outside Art&quot; is once the artist is no longer the &quot;outsider&quot; but the main purveyor of moral virtue the whole movement implodes.</p>
<p>On a larger timescale that is exactly what\'s happening to our society as a whole. Washington DC was founded but a bunch of Free Mason\'s who endeavored to create a society who primary foundation is Reason and not Religion. Back then THEY were the &quot;outsiders&quot;. But like Arrington de Dionyso those Free Mason outsiders quickly took over the moral high ground. Now DC is ruled by an elite of Godless Modern Art Fascists.</p>
<p>America has birthed a sea of delusional hypocrites. We deplorables must tolerate a race of viscous hipsters who think their shit doesn\'t smell. Here\'s old Arrington <a href="https://medium.com/@arringtond/how-i-became-a-target-of-the-alt-right-66f14eceaffe">complaining of death threats</a> after knuckle draggers discovered his fascination with painting decapitated heads. Mind you death threats are NEVER acceptable. But complaining about them after depicting Trump\'s decapitated head isn\'t either. The great unwashed are sick of overly enlightened progressives cutting people\'s heads off. Inside every Liberal is a <a href="http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/05/KathyGriffinBeheadingTrumpClean-640x480.jpg">Totalitarian Screaming To Get Out.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gbvSQRHUm6c?t=128">Decapitation Humor</a></p>
<p>So what to do? If you\'re like me and you\'ve spent the past 9 months racking your brain trying to understand how the fuck things got to this bad. Like how the fuck can the U.S. Government now <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2016/01/false-flags-are-legal-propaganda-produced-by-the-department-of-defense/">legally broadcast fake mass shootings</a> like Sandy Hook in the hopes of scaring* the public into more gun control?</p>
<p>Well to answer those questions let\'s go back to the beginning looking for answers. How far back? Not too far, just back to 1750 when Jean Jackque Rousseau and others within the Enlightenment like Adam Weishaupt officially set out to tear down Western Civilization and then build it back up from scratch. The goal in the end has always been to create Order Out of Chaos:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ckDxBhMt2GA?t=7538">Exposing The Illuminati From Within</a></p>
<p>It worked in the beginning but is now on its last legs. The evidence is all around us. Killary Clinton losing the election was one of the first bricks to fall. The pace of the collapse is slowly accelerating. Just recently they started dropping hot and heavy for the first time. The likes of Kathy Griffin and Johnny Depp have the pagan misfortune of finding out those who sow the wind must also reap the whirlwind. In a poetic twist of Divine Justice rich and viscous hipsters are reminded those who live by the dollar shall also die by the dollar. </p>
<p>Muhahaha.  
</p>
<p>Have faith everyone. We\'re winning. They\'re losing........badly. Arrington de Dionyso\'s painting of Trump\'s decapitated head barely registered. Deplorable displeasure fell on deaf ears. But Kathy Griffin\'s recent hull breach shows how much the American Public has woken up. </p>

            Come on, you should know better than ask that question of a European History major. One could spend a life time properly classifying German deaths during WWII. For example how was

            So I've now checked out two posts in this sub, and they both seemed to be Oh Wow, It's Nothing, with bonus whining about either Jews or Hitler at the end. WTF?
           </p>
           <p>
            FYI, Hitler would have hated - HATED - that art
            <em>
             with the fire of a thousand fucking suns
            </em>
            . And he wasn't a genocidal maniac, because he didn't commit genocide or even try. The gas chamber story, besides having a thousand other holes, is simply PHYSICALLY FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE. Lethal gassing is tricky to pull off quickly even when you're doing it to ONE person in a well-designed airtight chamber made for ONE prisoner...it's still wildly unpredictable and often much slower than it's supposed to be. That's the reason gassings stopped being a method of lethal execution in the 90s in the US. (Technically, injections are even slower, but they are more predictable and considered to be painless.)  With
            <em>
             modern
            </em>
            equipment, it's pretty questionable that we could pull off the so-called "Final Solution." The Nazis sure as fuck couldn't have done it, and they wouldn't have had any reason at all to kill people that way during a fuel shortage.
           </p>

            God, what a cucked sub. I haven't been to Voat in ages, and this makes it clear why. Bunch of conspiratards hanging around masturbating, thinking they're so much edgier than Reddit because they're not leftists. Blech.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you people ever manage to trip blindfolded over a smoking gun, I'm sure I'll hear about it.

             I agree. Go back and re-read what I wrote. Hitler would only have liked Art Brut because Hitler was psychotic. (It was kind of a joke too)

            trolling again eh? this argument has no basis! modern art is a MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS! it is not one movement of a bunch of lemmings running towards one end. the simpleton lack of cognition here is astounding. just ridiculous.

I AM A MODERN ARTIST! stay away from subjects you &amp; your idiot friends on here know nothing about. and while i have your attention, why do you stay here when you are subject to frequent gay bashing? i'm a fag hag from way back &amp; let me tell you i'm not gonna stick around here much longer in this toxic environment full of homophobes, racists &amp; misogynists. &amp; i would suggest you do the same! or are you just a masochist?

            The auctions are cover for selling kids. Buyers who are part of the inner circle bid on a painting and they get the painting plus a boy or girl delivered to their home later that night. I am certain this is how they do it. Some of the customers are not part of the inner circle they don't realize what the VIP bidders are paying for these customers are just there to buy over-priced paintings. But the insiders know what they are really there for. There has to be a secret code in the auction pamphlets that tell the insiders what they will get if they are high bidder for each painting. These insiders won't bid on every painting only the ones listed in the pamphlet that have the special code words B for boy and G for girl or however they do it. That is what Alefantis flipped out about when Pegasus was mentioned.

            In my recent travels, I visited some expensive art galleries, all featuring pedo and satanic symbolism.  These galleries were selling Banksy, Koons and others.  I've just made a post about it.

             "NOT HISTORICAL BECAUSE MODERN ART IS MODERN"
            </p>
            <p>
             You
             <strong>
              were
             </strong>
             hit in the head playing Little League. Here I'll break out the crayons:
            </p>
            <p>
             <s>
              Besides the obvious historical precedent of Art being used to launder money Modern Art plays a much more nefarious part in this story.
             </s>
            </p>
            <p>
             Historically art of any type has been a great cover for money laundering. Modern Art is no exception. But there are OTHER REASONS Modern Art plays a nefarious part of this story.

            Way back when Pizzagate started James Alefantis didn't get mad when a couple of guysYouTube went to check out family friendly Comet Ping Pong with its ejaculating space alien and decapitation murals. But he sure flipped outYouTube when his Pegasus Art Museum was discovered. That tells me Pizza isn't at the heart of Pizzagate. Modern Art is.

            WHY WOULD HE GET PISSED OFF FROM THE EXPOSURE OF MURALS IN HIS PUBLIC RESTAURANT THAT HE HIMSELF COMMISSIONED LOL

               If she said that then yes. If Pelosi really said that then it's the Freudian slip of the century. Unfortunately it's just hearsay. And to be honest I find it hard to believe Nancy is that twisted. She's an evil old hag but buying a child sex slave is a whole other gear I'm pretty sure she doesn't have.

            Hitler was evil, then? Do you care to show any evidence of that? When the "Nazis" invaded France the first thing they did was tour the museums of art and history. Hitler found modern art a gross perversion. Come to think of it, you don't find many fascist arryan supremacists behind the modern art movement. But, Hitler is evil I guess.

             Hitler's use of art to control culture was cynical, not idealistic.  When the Nazis staged the "Degenerate Art" show they cynically used the principles of modern art in their display techniques in order to sell their agenda to the people.  Design was purposefully used to strike terror into the human heart by Hitler and the Nazis, in such forms as SS symbolism and uniforms.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes Hitler was evil because his mind had been twisted by racism and he used the state to construct genocide programs, not necessarily because of his taste in art.  Using the state to crush humanity is by definition evil - it exists in almost all modern governments today, the question is only to what degree.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hitler was in fact a pioneer of modernism - the modern expression or art of The State As Instrument of Evil, characterized by the use of technology, propaganda and corporatism combined with unlimited greed, hubris and need for total control (globalism) resulting in fear, repression, war, genocide, destruction and, if left unchecked - total annihilation.

              Even if I'm not 100% sold on your conclusions, I certainly didn't expect such a high quality response. Interesting. My trend has been to absolve Hitler of most of the claims made about him. But I can't automatically dismiss the points you've made about him.

               I really appreciate your measured response.   It is a discussion worth having.   Part of my philosophy is that, like it or not, Hitler was a product of the state of our own collective humanity.

            Even the BBC explores "Was Modern Art a CIA Cold War Weapon?"
            <br/>
            <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20161004-was-modern-art-a-weapon-of-the-cia">
             http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20161004-was-modern-art-a-weapon-of-the-cia
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Answer is yes, according to the UK Indipendent -
            <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html">
             http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Modern Art was seized upon and promoted by the CIA to control the culture narrative - first to "prove" a new kind of US superiority to the Europeans, later to debase tradition and remove meaning from creative human culture, again in order to control that culture.  Along the way, value was able to be created out of nothing for the purposes of money laundering and hidden exchanges of value.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a way, Modern Art and it's trade networks pre-figured the way Bitcoin is useful to underground operators.  (Not to tarnish some of the positive aspects of Bitcoin, just an analogy.  That said, since the government has seized a majority of bitcoin in raids, it is simply another unit of control now and therefore no more trustworthy than the dollar.)

            Many art museums are on the waterfront. Sure, it's a great view, but I also imagine it to make moving people unnoticed, easier. 
Large amounts of money exchange hands; what is it to tack on a little more for a piece of humanity to take home?

               First link I check Tate Galleries New York is not on the Waterfront.   And not even a museum.  You've swtiched from Art Museums to Art galleries.  You're aware of the difference, yes?
              </p>
              <p>
               I agree Tate is major in the art world, but it's not a museum.  And the JFK center is a theater.  It's not an art museum.  You just proved my point.

                 The crazy thing is donkey .. I almost believe it could be the Jews. But the way you go on and on I just don't know. Make a thread. Argue your case. Put in as much evidence you can find. Then copy that link into your argument. What is this crap you spew? Are you an autistic bot? Are you a paid shill? A paedo? Or just stupid?

                   Before getting into this research some 7 months ago .. I believed it was the Jews. Now I am unsure if you could be a paid shill trying to deflect from the SAUDIS.

                   Your attitude takes away from what others feel on this sub. Regardless of if we agree with each other we are still united, kind, caring, respectful and open to any possibility.

             Art in Embassies links to Racine, Wisconsin and the beginnings of the Illuminati with Adam Weishaupt.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Lest anyone start to think so highly of the Republican party – think again! It was started in the early 1850s by Horace Greeley and Charles Dana – both associated with the New York Tribune and regularly published the works of Karl Marx – at the Racine WI Communist Commune! The Racine Commune was one of 50 Communes started by the American Association of Unions – itself Communist, of course. Our present day Republican Party was not named in honor of our Republic but rather in honor of the first Republican party – Started by Violent Illuminist, known as Jacobins!"
            </p>
            <p>
             "It really all begins in May of 1776 – in Bavaria where Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati Order. If you look up the planks of the Illuminati (a bit difficult to do because it is supposedly so secret as to not even exist – we all know the line from the movie “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”; “The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince us he doesn’t exist.”) you will find that those planks mirror the planks of the communist manifesto. Since that set of “principles” came some 60 years before the manifesto, the truth is the Illuminati spawned the commies and Marx – if he actually wrote the manifesto actually softened the Illuminati planks."
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of the Connection to Art in Embassies and Racine
"The Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art ("The Johnson Museum") is an art museum located on the northwest corner of the Arts Quad on the main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Its collection includes two windows[1] from Frank Lloyd Wright's Darwin D. Martin House, and more than 35,000 other works in the permanent collection.[2] It was designed by architect I.M. Pei and is known for its distinctive concrete facade. President Deane Waldo Malott established the original University Art Museum in 1953. The A. D. White House was renovated to house Cornell's art collections.[3] The current museum, constructed in 1973, is named after its primary benefactor, Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr., a Cornell Class of 1922 graduate, head of S.C. Johnson &amp; Sons ("Johnson Wax"), and a former member of the university's Board of Trustees."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In addition to continuing its support of individual exhibits of American art to foreign nations, the USIA and the Department of State also embarked on new programs designed to acquaint the world with American painting. One new initiative involved working more closely with U.S. businesses that owned large art collections in order to facilitate their exhibition overseas. More spectacularly, the State Department established the Art in Embassies program in 1964, which sought to turn U.S. embassies into small art galleries."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In 1962, Edward R. Murrow, who was then director of the USIA, proclaimed a 'new and, I think, significant development' in terms of art patronage in the United States. This was the 'increasing interest of large corporations - Big Business as an institution, as opposed to the big businessman as an individual - in giving financial backing to our performing and creative arts.' As the 'interpreter of America to the rest of the world', Murrow was particularly excited by this development. 'The mere fact that profit-motivated corporations in a price-directed economy find good reason to subsidize the arts speaks eloquently against those who see in our system only the grossest materialism.'
            </p>
            <p>
             "HE WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OFFER BY S.C. JOHNSON &amp; SON, INC. (THE FLOOR WAX GIANT) TO SEND ITS LARGE COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART AROUND THE WORLD, SPONSORED BY USIA."
            </p>
            <p>
             So, in summary, Racine, Wisconsin is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption across every aspect of the network that is directly tied through Art in Embassies, political parties, major industries, freemasons, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Pilgrims Society and other groups involved at the highest levels around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is directly linked to the Council of 13 and Committee of 300 through Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Reynolds and Johnson blood lines with connections to British and Dutch royalty among others. This is why corrupt Boy Scouts Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus yield so much undeserved power. They are the front men along with others like Ashton Kutcher covering up the real true evils that we now know as Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

                 This chart is accurate, and the layers run much deeper in the details. The weak point of their entire network lies in Racine, Wisconsin. This is how we should approach unraveling it instead of starting at some distant and undefinable top layer. We have definitive proof of the rigged system and extreme levels of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption in a small community, with direct links to the top layers of the entire world. We also have definitive proof that these crimes linked to Racine were covered up at the highest levels of enforcement in the U.S. including Loretta Lynch, Jim Comey, Andy McCabe, Peter Kadzik, and many others in the chain. Our system is absolutely broken beyond repair through the broken system.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is the final battle of good vs evil. We need to attack their weak point before it is too late. We need everyone in the world to know how they use Racine as a root and model for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and then use Racine as the root and model to raze that entire corrupt system and restore order to the world. Their power is a facade built on lies. It is time the people pull back the curtain and take back the power.

                 This is the most significant document posted to this investigation I believe. I literally almost threw up reading the names. And that says a lot for me. On that list is world class bankers and leaders but literally the most shocking was Cold War Russian leader Mickail Gorbachev + George HW Bush + Henry Kissinger +  Bill Clinton + Tim Geitner (who at that time was Obama economic secretary what a charade) &amp; the royal family including Prince William (already) with the Saudi Arabian King &amp; the Pope leading one world government. This is so sinister.

              Both of you are spot on. I often wonder why this place didn't explode with Pegasus research after he threatened Ryan and his family.

              I think we have left it too long for there to be any evidence there anymore but that doesn't mean they haven't forgotten to clean something up online? The moving floor also seems key.

               I so much agree with you.  I think there is so much more to Pegasus.  I have always felt they were creating something nefarious to be used  that certainly would end up being criminal.    The moving floor may be the only thing left, possibly.  You are so right that this may have been a missed opportunity because of what happened to Ryan. By the way has anyone heard from him?  Is he OK?

             Actually Donkey I would have loved to reference that post of yours because it dealt with Art and Money Laundering which, DING DING DING, I mentioned in the first paragraph of MY post. I couldn't reference your post because you wrote this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              As a sort of case study, let's go on safari to find a North American Wall Street Jew, generally discernible by their shiny bald pates and diminutive stature, and see how it burrows for shekels.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I don't know where the fuck you're writing from but you never got the memo about Anti-Semitism being the third rail of American Politics for better or for worse. If you want to sink a political campaign or an online investigation into Institutionalized Pedophilia the easiest thing to do is send in some David Duke mother fucker to associate that thing with Nazism. And that David Duke mother fucker IS YOU DonKeyhote you fucking donkey.
            </p>
            <p>
             You never fail to show up and shit Jew hatred all over everything. You're like clockwork. You couldn't do any better in discrediting

              Anti-semitism on the other hand is so esoteric and jews so few that you are clearly trying to misinform nonAmerican readers.

             <p>
              THERES NO ANTISEMITISM HERE AND DAVID DUKE WAS ELECTED TO STATEWIDE OFFICE AND HIS POSITIONS BECAME MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN POSITIONS.  NICE REPUDIATION FAGGOT ITS EASY TO TURN PEOPLE AGAINST YOU WHEN THE ENTIRE JEW MEDIA DEFINES YOU AS KKK, WHICH THEY DIDN'T DO TO BYRD BECAUSE HE WAS A ZIONIST SELLOUT AND DOCTOR DUKE HAS BEEN SENT TO PRISON EVEN FOR AN AUDIT THAT ENDED WITH A $6K REFUND ISSUED TO HIM

            You said precisely NOTHING in that post except propose that the ART in a kid-friendly pizza BAR, A NOVEL CONCEPT, is actually more important than the  inexplicable propagation of such locales all over the MAIN JEWISH CITIES.

               He might be a shill...if you take a look at my comment history from a few days ago you can see a long string where I consistently berate him and he reveals personal info.  He may have been trying to bait me to reciprocate, or he maybe legitimately a lonely loser getting all his info from antisemites on /pol (that's what he is spewing)...I'm guessing the latter at this point.  Either way I will continue to shut him down. I have too much respect for DM

                No word of a lie a week or so ago he was justifying a drunk girl alone in a kebab shop being deservedly raped .. along with girls from single parent families. And then continues on with his inflated claim he's better than any of us.

             Actually Donkey had you read to the end you would have realized the post was an introduction to a 2 hour dissertation on the origins of the Illuminati:

            <p>
             In the highly unlikely event you're not a shill and just stupid the Illuminati are the mother fuckers behind this entire cluster fuck not "The Jews!(tm)".
            </p>
            <p>
             The Illuminati are an amalgamation of several different religions which crystallized out of the Enlightenment's effort to replace God with Man. Minor detail.

               Fritz Springmeier never heard of him. A quick jaunt over to Amazon yields a 1 star comment which includes this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I do believe in the illuminati and their goal of controlling the world. This does not mean however that one doesn't need to have an open mind and use constructive thinking when analyzing the world around us.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would like to list some examples from this book that I think are just absurd without having any data or references to back up the author's accusations.
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Barbara Bush is reading to children in a photo wearing a checkered blazer which obviously shows she is trying to hypnotically control children.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Abraham Lincoln was known to have fathered many illegitimate children.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Gen. Grant was illuminati-controlled.

                  George Bush is (according to the author) a pedophile.

                <li>
                 <p>
                  MacDonald family is satanist. (So, apparently no more cheeseburgers for you)

               <p>
                You, the reader decide, but this is just an absurd book. It does a disservice to the true conspiracy going on in today's world.

               LOL. How many times have I told you Horsefucker you always do the exact opposite of what's required to spread the word about Pizzagate. Far from attracting people to help out our cause you drive them away with your incessant Nazism.

               Yet I still can't believe that this group would countenance burning a child on the left arm and stabbing them under the right arm (ribcage right above where the heart is) as some sort of initiation ceremony. What would be the point,if you are involved in something illegal anyway why do more illegal things to prove loyalty? Unless you're just some silly ridiculous cult that thinks that sacrificing an
