            Just wanted to pop back in and apologize for being so dismissive at first. I wasn't properly considering a few things, which I have reflected upon in a conversation with
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ESOTERICshade">
             @ESOTERICshade
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that there's potential validity to some very odd methods of self defense, with regards to attacks that come from the likes of EMW's and sonic/microwave tech, etc... it's not my place to comment on that department until I brush up on a few things.
           </p>
           <p>
            My experience is mostly with different methods of attack, though, hence my attitude at first.
           </p>
           <p>
            No harm intended.

            If you ever go to the doctor with a problem like this... Never say, that you think you have a chip inside of you.  Instead say that you feel a lump and you want it removed.  That is how Melanie got her implant removed from her throat.  The Doctor assumed it was swollen tissue which was not showing up on the x-rays.

            Yes, I know.. The Doctor and Lab technicians, at first, refused to give Melanie and Katherine the implant. It wasn't until they were threatened with legal recourse that they finally gave up the implant.

            and they work more covertly than this. people watch too much tv looking for cues that don't exist (the real power of tv is to remove your ability to recognize significance in any capacity by continually watching the same tropes, over and over. thus, making it easier to market you new goods).

             Watching too much TV is bad, fucking oath, but from experience, if you know how to watch it and when to walk away after finding what you need(I limit myself to a maximum of a few minutes at a time, when passing by a currently running TV), you'd be surprised what little tidbits the subconscious mind can pick up on and utilize for something productive(especially if you're looking into corruption) or at least to keep up with the current social narrative.

              it also diverts intuition by distorting typical constructs with episodic, and identical constructs.

              if it makes sense to you, it's because you're following a thread laid out for you, not one you've chosen yourself.
its because you've consumered enough pop-culture to latch onto someone's continuing reiteration of that the same thread.

               You're sorely misunderstanding me, I'm in no way dependent on it and very much chose my path, if by no other means, my decisions and constant re-evaluation of myself and my beliefs and etc.

               I understand what you're saying, but, offer the perspective that not everyone watches it without the knowledge of what's afoot and not everyone takes it at face value without questioning it thoroughly.

                thats just obfuscation and codification, which is the exact same issue, front and center, just used for different motives/intent.
you could suggest that an artist's work my reveal unconscious/ethereal communications, but that's not qualified by anything substantial enough to warrant the pervasiveness of the tech.
not publicly.
               </p>
               <p>
                so the real issue is still the same; why would one not overtly state a position about something instead of the dramatic presentation and representation of art?
in most cases, art its the over amplification of basic human instincts and emotions. otherwise, it's just propaganda—for a brand, idea, or product. communication arts versus self expressions, expressions that are over conflations and allegories predicated on our instincts to fortify our habitat and find a mate/fuck—thats about it, on the face of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                so then we're left with the obvious, programming. or it's in the hands of the wrong people.
               </p>
               <p>
                we've exhausted this toy of progress (or whatever).
it's time to move beyond titillations with each new remedial iteration of the same medium.
and move way beyond the iterative economy and onto the authenticity economy.
               </p>
               <p>
                tv isn't the way, at all.
it's overrun by fag and touchies.

                 With respect, again, I agree with what you're trying to get across - to best summarize, I operate mostly through synchronicity, which
                 <em>
                  sometimes
                 </em>
                 includes queues from passing by a tv or a radio or a conversation between total strangers or between/with friends, etc.

              Well, that could well be, as I am finding out.  My information that it was in Berlin I learned on here, and so as I am not trying to verify it online, I am finding that there is hinting at Berlin and Switzerland taking credit for that.  Now you are saying possibly the British.  I have a feeling they are all trying to jockey for that position.  You know, trying to create jealousy with the other bad actors so to speak.  I could be wrong about that, but I am still looking.  I will have to research further.  You may just be right since The Crown likes to control their henchmen.

            Gang-staulking police officers who take a stand against corruption and illicit activities by the CIA or DA's, JTTF etc. is common. It is rare because few take a stand and if they do they will lose their jobs, gang staulked, accused of having mental illness and forcefull locked up, threatened that if they talk they will be found dead, commit "suicide by cop" when they try and tell the truth. Other officers are lied to and told this police officer is armed and dangerous, shoot first ask questions later.
           </p>
           <p>
            Homes invaded by prowler teams and they are found dead with two bullets in the back of their head or some other bizarre impossible way of killing oneself, poisoned but Medical Examiners are often Deputy Sherrifs as well so the autopsy will say what ever is desired. Falsely charged with any staged crime known to man.
           </p>
           <p>
            Love ones (especially witnesses) mysteriously die or committ suicide out of the blue. Tormented by authorities, illegally surveilled, isolated, backgrounds trashed so they can't ever work again, denied medical care.... Should I go on?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the life of whistleblowers. Whistleblower police officers, law enforcement agents, FBI agents etc. are particularly targeted because they know the dirty secrets of the system behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most police officers are hero's, good moral men and women. If you take a stand and especially discover the secrets of the Brass...life is over... A slow painful death, or a quick "suicide" or tragic unexplained accident.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are expert witnesses....no one wants them to talk ever...

            Dr. Katherine Horton PHd former particle physicist at CERN is in the above cited videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            She became a whistleblower of CERN, CIA, M15, and NSA explaining how they work and how they are purposely destroying western societies. She does an excellent job explaining the NAZI beginnings of the CIA and how they create psychopaths from childhood by the torture and trauma they inflict on the kidnapped children they torture through MK Ultra. Now by the year 2017 we literally have psychopaths running these agencies with many having gone rogue and having no hesitation with murder, torture, child rape, etc.

            Gang stalking takes on many forms, also. Chipping isn't always a necessity, though, I don't doubt that it happens.

             I wouldn't knock Katherine Horton's techniques in dealing with Electro Magnetic Weapons. She is probably one of the Foremost experts in this field.   She has a PHD from Oxford and formerly worked for CERN.  And she has recently teamed up Karen Melton Steward (Ex NSA whistle blower) and a Journalist named Romola D and they are working together to expose the CIA chipping and Gang Stalking Program in the US and Abroad.   You really should look at all of her material before you dismiss her.

               Lol, wrath... sorry, but they're fucking pathetic. I'm no expert, but, those doing the gang-stalking these days - in my neck of the woods at least - are woefully amateur in what they do.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't qualify their shit by calling it wrath and giving them more 'power' than they truly have. It's black magic, which in some ways, relies on your perception being warped by fear/superstition. The so-called power/wrath that they do have, is shared by most any other person (except physical EMWs - but even these can be overcome via 'mind over matter' methods, so to speak).
              </p>
              <p>
               When they realize they can't get to you while awake(either due to your fortitude or due to other methods such as seen here), they tend to start coming for you in dreams - which is even funnier when they STILL can't scare you, let alone even make you dream that you're bleeding even after being stabbed in the back twice xD
              </p>
              <p>
               They've also tried shooting me quite some time ago(in dreamland), that one was weird... left me pretty rattled for a while and it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I figured that dream to be a result of gang stalking.

                I guess my disgust with the CIA should really be put towards those that allow them to come after us as citizens in whatever way they wish, namely those at the top of the Heap.  Possibly as you say, their power is magnified by our MSM and those that wish to scare and harm us.  Either way, I wish to be rid of them and the sooner the better.  The money that they receive from those that support them is what is keeping them going, and that contributes to the trafficking of our children and the disgusting operation of organ harvesting.

                 Well yeah, it's all part of the pony show and that much is infuriating, but, as I've said, one of their strongest weapons is fear - on so many levels.

                 The minions carrying out the gang-stalking though... bottom-feeding grubs, rise above their shit so that you can indeed, look for the so-called big fish.

              To be fair, I did look at the second video with a bit more of an open mind.

              She DID demonstrate
              <em>
               something
              </em>
              , though, I would still dare to say (for the moment) that tin foil is relatively pointless - at least in contrast to learning how to actively defend oneself from such attacks(as opposed to wrapping oneself up in a proverbial security blanket). I don't mean to come across as though I'm speaking without experience, by the way, as I myself have been subject to various attacks; the way I see it, if they get you to the point of wrapping yourself in foil, they're beating you - even if you happen to find momentary relief; effectively, it's band-aid therapy, of sorts.

               If you want to see some of the amazing breakthroughs they have made, go to "techno crime fighters forum" on youtube and watch some of the latest episodes.  On one episode Karen Melton Steward talks about how she has learned to destroy some of the Electro Magnetic Weapons (EMWs) used against her.  She has discovered two neighbors pointing EMWs at her home.  One from a bedroom window and the other was mounted in car door.  And she also discovered a third EMW mounted in the top of her neighbors tree.  She was able to destroy all three weapons by using mirrors and reflective blankets to reflect the microwaves by towards the EMW.  Shortly after, she witnessed two EMWs literally smoking.  If Targeted individuals ban together, I believe they were soon be able to stop this Terrorism.

                I generally prefer to take the fight to a different level, but, I'll have a look at "techno crime fighters forum" for curiosity's sake.

                Could be some handy info that I can share with others who need a more tangible solution.
