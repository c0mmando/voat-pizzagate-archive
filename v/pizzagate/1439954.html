            Has anyone tried contacting the parents of the missing girl? I am sure they would definitley want to pursue from the sketch alone, plus all of the other evidence.

            As has been posted many times, these are two renderings based on a description of ONE suspect. An irish couple saw ONE man and said he was 20-40. So the fact that the police renderings happen to look like two different people, who each happen to look like one of the (60+ year old) Podesta brothers, is entirely a bizarre coincidence.

             That's clearly absurd, the face structure and hair is markedly different. The Smiths (the Irish couple) said that they didn't get a good look at the man and wouldn't be able to identify him.

              It's a fact that they are renderings of one subject. You think the police released these two pictures to the media and then bizarrely LIED and said it was two renderings of one man?

              BBC: "The man featured in two e-fits released by UK police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance was seen carrying a child towards the beach.
Police say a family saw the man with a blond-haired child of three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas, heading away from the McCanns' holiday apartment.
The witnesses said the man was white, 20 to 40 years old and of medium build. He had short brown hair, was clean-shaven and of medium height, they added."

                  Yes, facts are facts. The fact is that a husband and wife saw one man in his 20s-40s carrying a child. The police took their descriptions and did two different efit renderings, presumably one from the husband's description and one from the wife's.

                  lol @ the police releasing two images and then lying to say there was only one man. Why the fuck wouldn't they just release one image or not release any images if they were going to lie about it? Use your head.

                   So why would they use different systems for each image? One clearly has higher resolution that the other. The Smiths said that they didn't get a good look at the man carrying the girl, how is is that the efits had detail like moles and a pressure mark caused by wearing classes?

                   Because the investigator(s) produced two images and the McCanns knew that. They didn't want to be implicated in a coverup, so they force-fitted the evidence to match the official narrative. The police sat on those images for years before finally releasing them, and they didn't get published on the Guardian's website until 2013, 6 years after Madeleine disappeared.

                    So somehow the McCanns knew about the two images? The police were forced to release both images for some reason because the McCanns knew about them, but had no qualms about lying about it being one suspect and not two? The McCanns would have blown the lid on the two images, but kept quiet about the number of suspects? And same with the irish couple?

                    lol @ the fucking efit having "a pressure mark caused by wearing glasses", as though that's something ANY witness would notice. You are seeing what you want to see, you could not make it any more clear. Who exactly do you think the witnesses were if not the Smiths? Who were these witnesses that were close enough and studied the suspects long enough to notice a tiny mole and a "pressure mark caused by wearing glasses"?

                      Yes, and it's not an implication. You are seeing what you want to see. If you think the couple saw this guy from two feet away and immediately noticed his "pressure mark" you're high. In any case lol @ the police including that in any case.

             They changed their assumptions and didn't believe it was of one suspect anymore. Your point applies only at the start of the investigation. Coupled with the fact that the sketches were hidden from the public for 3 years, I find this whole thing quite odd. Coincidences of this magnitude and number aren't coincidences anymore.

              They changed their assumptions and didn't believe one man was involved with the disappearance anymore. They did NOT change their "assumptions" about the ONE man portrayed in their TWO efits.

              Telegraph: "
              <strong>
               Mary and Martin Smith, from Ireland, told police they saw a man carrying a child
              </strong>
              matching Madeleine’s description at around 10pm on Rua da Escola Primaria, 500 yards from the McCanns’ apartment. He was heading towards the beach, did not look like a tourist and did not seem comfortable carrying the child, they said.
Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that
              <strong>
               two e-fit images of the man
              </strong>
              , compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleine’s disappearance. He remains a suspect."

             I believe that has been debunked. The police aren't certain that the drawings are of the same person.

              No. While they have changed their mind about how many people may have been involved, this does not mean that they changed their mind about who these two efits represent.

              I mean, this is not debatable. It is stated very plainly. The fact that so many of these sites continue to repeat this nonsense necessarily indicates that these sites are either deliberately spreading misinformation, or are staffed by people who are beyond stupid.

             how do you get such different drawings from a description of one suspect? they have extremely different bone structure.

              The description is from one couple.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean this is public information, why is this even still being discussed?
             </p>
             <p>
              BBC: 
"The man featured in two e-fits released by UK police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance was seen carrying a child towards the beach.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police say a family saw the man with a blond-haired child of three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas, heading away from the McCanns' holiday apartment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The witnesses said the man was white, 20 to 40 years old and of medium build. He had short brown hair, was clean-shaven and of medium height, they added.
             </p>
             <p>
              Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior Metropolitan Police investigating officer, said he could be the man who took Madeleine but there could be an innocent explanation."
