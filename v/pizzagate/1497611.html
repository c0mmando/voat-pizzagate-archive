<p><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION OF PIZZAGATE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This investigation was sparked by strange emails leaked from John Podesta\'s email account, some of which make bizarre references to food.  One such email discussed a handkerchief Podesta left behind at a friend\'s house.  The handkerchief was described as having a &quot;map that seems pizza-related.&quot; Given the common pedophile code phrase <a href="https://archive.is/QsLdx">&quot;cheese pizza&quot;</a>, some readers suspected &quot;pizza-related&quot; may have been a reference to child sex abuse.  <strong>The suspected use of &quot;pizza&quot; as a codeword led us to investigate a pizza restaurant mentioned in one of Podesta\'s emails, namely Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, owned by an associate of the Podestas.  We have found considerable evidence that Comet is a front for child sex trafficking.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit A: Evidence Pertaining to Comet Pizza and Ping Pong</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As demonstrated in Exhibit D, we have connected owner <a href="http://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2016/11/22/James_Alefantis_GQ_c0-7-640-380_s885x516.jpg?7f3880f9901c7d1e0c41d57b33d6f4d35e616946">James Alefantis</a> to accused child trafficker Laura Silsby, who was got off the hook by a fake attorney who was later convicted of sex-trafficking, and who was wanted for sex trafficking in four countries.  Alefantis had a statue of <a href="https://archive.is/J3lUH">Antinous</a> as his Instagram profile picture.  Antinous was the boy lover of a Roman Emperor, and is considered a symbol of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty">pederasty</a>.  On his &quot;jimmycomet&quot; Instagram account, Alefantis posted a <a href="http://archive.is/DLjk7">baby picture</a> and made <a href="http://archive.is/uvDYq">a clear pedophile reference</a>.  The brother of Jeffrey B. Smith (&quot;werkinonmahnightcheese&quot;), who commented on several of the suspect Instagram photos, referred to a friend as <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7Ig">&quot;my favorite pedo&quot;</a>.  
</p>
<p>Listed first on Comet\'s website under <a href="http://archive.is/Yogml">&quot;friends of comet&quot;</a> is the band <a href="http://archive.is/hMfkx">Heavy Breathing</a>, which performs at Comet.  Heavy Breathing leader &quot;Majestic Ape&quot; wears a ski mask and sunglasses, and uses a voice modulator, hiding his or her identity.  Majestic Ape joked about pedophile Jared Fogle and said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m23s">&quot;we all have our preferences, hee hee hee&quot;. </a>, bringing laughter from the audience.  In another video, Majestic Ape <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9itWsqzFMVo">talks about killing a baby</a>.  Majestic Ape also <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7IO">referenced pedophilia in a caption on a music video</a>.  Heavy Breathing\'s website features art involving both <a href="http://archive.is/hMfkx">children and sex</a>.</p>
<p>An employee of Comet posted many images <a href="http://archive.is/mKH6M">portraying pizza in a sexual way.</a>, further fueling our suspicion they are using &quot;pizza&quot; as it is commonly used by pedophiles: a symbol and codeword for sex with minors.  <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7IZ">Another example</a>.  An admitted pedophile on a dark-web pedophile forum <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7IU">acknowledged a trend of pedophiles using pizza parlors as fronts for child sex trafficking</a>.  Convicted sex offender <a href="http://sor.informe.org/cgi-bin/sor/step3.pl?id=4683">Robert L. Robinson</a>, who <a href="http://sor.informe.org/cgi-bin/sor/step5.pl?id=4683">raped a 13-year-old girl</a>, had a  <a href="https://archive.li/iJLY1">Flikr account</a> with five pages of  &quot;favorite&quot; pictures, half of which featured young girls, and the other half of which featured... Comet Pizza and Ping Pong.      
</p>
<p>Please examine these <a href="http://archive.is/vNEnH">symbols</a> designated by the FBI as pedophile symbols.  Besta Pizza, which is <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7IF">three doors down</a> from Comet, <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7Is">had a logo</a> that is a near-exact match of <a href="http://archive.is/PUWFe">the boylover symbol</a>.  Another nearby business, Terasol, had a <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7I7">girl-lover symbol</a> on their website.  No direct connection to Besta or Terasol has yet been uncovered, but the logos seem quite a coincidence.  With that in mind, take a look at Comet\'s logo.   It also resembles a <a href="http://archive.is/vNEnH">pedophile symbol</a>.  
</p>
<p>General creepiness seems to surround Comet.  Alefantis posted a photo of <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/pb0R">a child taped to a ping pong table</a>.  He also posted a photo of a <a href="http://archive.is/oRj63">walk-in cooler</a>, to which he commented &quot;#murder&quot; and to which Jeffrey B. Smith commented &quot;#killroom.&quot; Alefantis also posted a picture of Tony Podesta’s <a href="https://archive.is/LIHTn">sculpture modeled after a Dahmer victim</a> and one of &quot;spirit-cooking&quot; queen <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V7kW">Marina Abramovic</a>.  Comet had a painting of a man playing ping pong, to which graffiti had been added to show him <a href="http://www.ultraimg.com/image/V8Li">ejaculating on the table and wearing a Satanic upside-down cross</a>.  Comet had murals of <a href="http://archive.is/uOy6R">people with heads cut off</a>, and the artist who painted the murals also painted <a href="http://archive.is/UOnP9">adults decapitating children</a>.</p>
<p>Pizzagate researcher Ryan O\'Neal posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U&amp;t=3s">YouTube video in which he claims James Alefantis threatened his life and the lives of his family</a> to bully O\'Neal into removing a video about Alefantis\' &quot;Pegasus Museum&quot; from YouTube.  O\'Neal showed text messages, which appear to be from Alefantis, bullying him into calling Alefantis.  O\'Neal claims that when he called, Alefantis immediately began screaming at him and threatening him and his family.  O\'Neal filed a <a href="http://p2c.websterpd.com/QuickResults.aspx?case=17000111">police report over the alleged threats</a>.  
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exhibit B: Evidence Pertaining to John and Tony Podesta</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>John Podesta is the former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, and was the Chair of Hillary Clinton\'s presidental campaign.  Tony Podesta runs The Podesta Group, a major lobbying firm.
The Podestas are associates of James Alefantis, as detailed in Exhibit C.  They are also <strong><a href="http://archive.is/8F945">good friends</a> with known and admitted pedophile, former Republican congressman <a href="https://archive.is/VJ9Gz">Dennis Hastert</a></strong>.  John Podesta received en email suggesting that Hastert should <a href="http://archive.is/lHCPi">vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island</a> after the news of Hastert\'s pedophilia broke.  
</p>
<p>Now, let\'s discuss the specific emails that led to our investigation of Comet.  John Podesta received an email from Tam Luzzatto saying that children of ages 11, 9, and 7 will be &quot;in the pool for further entertainment&quot; and stating that the children <a href="http://archive.is/lgD3l">&quot;will definitely be in that pool&quot;</a>. </p>
<p>In another email, Podesta was told that he left behind a <a href="http://archive.is/JJC1o">black-and-white handkerchief &quot;with a map that seems pizza-related&quot;</a>.  A handkerchief with a &quot;pizza-related&quot; map?  What the...?  Note that in the gay community, handkerchiefs are sometimes used as <a href="http://archive.is/MfPCc">code for sexual preferences</a>.  It is possible that others have adopted this code as well.  Black symbolizes bdsm/domination in this code; some have suggested that white could symbolize pedophilia, due to the association of white with innocence and purity.  Furthermore, as discussed previously, &quot;cheese pizza&quot; is a common code phrase meaning &quot;child pornography,&quot; so &quot;pizza&quot; could be an adaptation of that.  
</p>
<p>In another suspiciously cryptic email, a friend complained that Podesta had changed &quot;strategies that have long been in place&quot; and remarked that Podesta sent him &quot;cheese&quot; instead of &quot;pasta,&quot; asking if Podesta thought he would do better <a href="http://archive.is/JBft7">&quot;playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta&quot;</a>.  Why would Podesta regularly send this person pasta, why would there need to be a strategy long in place for doing so, and who plays dominoes on cheese or pasta?  
</p>
<p>Tony Podesta sent John Podesta an email titled &quot;Last night was fun.&quot; The email read simply <a href="http://archive.is/9PcWi">&quot;still in the torture chamber&quot;</a>.  One could argue this could have been a metaphor, but consider it in light of the fact that Tony Podesta collects art by Biljana Djurdjevic, which references or depicts <a href="http://archive.is/xyW2L">extreme physical and sexual abuse of children</a>.  He also collects <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">photos of naked teenagers</a>, and he has a taste for art portraying cannibalism and murder, such as his <a href="http://archive.is/9aq42">headless Arch of Hysteria statue</a> which seems to reproduce <a href="http://archive.is/tAsqV">one of Jeffrey Dahmer\'s decapitated victims</a>. John Podesta also likes artwork portraying cannibalism, such as <a href="http://archive.is/LEKyL">this piece is in his office</a>.

           Pizzagate researcher Ryan O'Neal posted a

           to bully O'Neal into removing a video about Alefantis' "Pegasus Museum" from YouTube.  O'Neal showed text messages, which appear to be from Alefantis, bullying him into calling Alefantis.  O'Neal claims that when he called, Alefantis immediately began screaming at him and threatening him and his family.  O'Neal filed a

             Exhibit B: Evidence Pertaining to John and Tony Podesta
            </strong>

          </ul>
          <p>
           John Podesta is the former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, and was the Chair of Hillary Clinton's presidental campaign.  Tony Podesta runs The Podesta Group, a major lobbying firm.
The Podestas are associates of James Alefantis, as detailed in Exhibit C.  They are also
           <strong>
            <a href="http://archive.is/8F945">
             good friends
            </a>
            with known and admitted pedophile, former Republican congressman
            <a href="https://archive.is/VJ9Gz">
             Dennis Hastert
            </a>
           </strong>
           .  John Podesta received en email suggesting that Hastert should
           <a href="http://archive.is/lHCPi">
            vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island
           </a>
           after the news of Hastert's pedophilia broke.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, let's discuss the specific emails that led to our investigation of Comet.  John Podesta received an email from Tam Luzzatto saying that children of ages 11, 9, and 7 will be "in the pool for further entertainment" and stating that the children
           <a href="http://archive.is/lgD3l">
            "will definitely be in that pool"
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           In another email, Podesta was told that he left behind a
           <a href="http://archive.is/JJC1o">
            black-and-white handkerchief "with a map that seems pizza-related"
           </a>
           .  A handkerchief with a "pizza-related" map?  What the...?  Note that in the gay community, handkerchiefs are sometimes used as
           <a href="http://archive.is/MfPCc">
            code for sexual preferences
           </a>
           .  It is possible that others have adopted this code as well.  Black symbolizes bdsm/domination in this code; some have suggested that white could symbolize pedophilia, due to the association of white with innocence and purity.  Furthermore, as discussed previously, "cheese pizza" is a common code phrase meaning "child pornography," so "pizza" could be an adaptation of that.
          </p>
          <p>
           In another suspiciously cryptic email, a friend complained that Podesta had changed "strategies that have long been in place" and remarked that Podesta sent him "cheese" instead of "pasta," asking if Podesta thought he would do better
           <a href="http://archive.is/JBft7">
            "playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta"
           </a>
           .  Why would Podesta regularly send this person pasta, why would there need to be a strategy long in place for doing so, and who plays dominoes on cheese or pasta?
          </p>
          <p>
           Tony Podesta sent John Podesta an email titled "Last night was fun." The email read simply
           <a href="http://archive.is/9PcWi">
            "still in the torture chamber"
           </a>
           .  One could argue this could have been a metaphor, but consider it in light of the fact that Tony Podesta collects art by Biljana Djurdjevic, which references or depicts
           <a href="http://archive.is/xyW2L">
            extreme physical and sexual abuse of children
           </a>
           .  He also collects
           <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">
            photos of naked teenagers
           </a>
           , and he has a taste for art portraying cannibalism and murder, such as his
           <a href="http://archive.is/9aq42">
            headless Arch of Hysteria statue
           </a>
           which seems to reproduce
           <a href="http://archive.is/tAsqV">
            one of Jeffrey Dahmer's decapitated victims
           </a>
           . John Podesta also likes artwork portraying cannibalism, such as

            STAY ON COURSE KEEP ASKING ELECTED OFFICIALS OR AUTHORITIES TO GIVE ANSWERS NOW!
           </p>
           <p>
            Demand for answers from Authorities / President Trump on FACTUAL EVIDENCE found by concerned people who were vigorously researching the DNC email dump released by Wikileaks and found strange emails using what seemed to be a coded language. The researching of emails eventually led to the coined term for this unprecedented citizen investigation now known as PIZZAGATE.
           </p>
           <p>
            PIZZAGATE / PEDOGATE is not just a "USA citizen" investigation, it's not a DNC witch hunt, NO!! What the findings are bringing to light is that the problem of Human Trafficking, Pedofillia and a Satanic Culture seems to be running rampant across all forms of power positions, cultures who condone and or religions who are complicit or turn away the issue. The Pedofillia aspect is a Human Societal issue that needs to be addressed as is the Human Trafficking problem. The thing is all the positions and overseer's of these issues are CORRUPT and seem to be complicit on the same crimes they're supposed to be eradicating or keeping in check-from our society. Again, to be clear it is the PEOPLE of all parts of this Earth who are genuinely asking 'What's really going on here...on this Earth and why are the elected officials/authorities who are supposed to stop this blowing smoke in regards to ALL questions being asked about PIZZAGATE / PEDOGATE! Maybe the most important findings of PIZZAGATE is the OCCULT aspect!

            Hi everyone, I am new to this website as I wanted to post a question. I will have a look through this thread as it seems to have loads of information. I'm not sure if anyone has mentioned this before so I'm sorry if someone has. I looked on Google maps and on some property websites and I don't think that Pegasus Museum is actually 3518 on that street. I think it is the house behind Pegasus that is 3518. The house with a blue painted front that also has the word `Kids' spray painted on the wall to the front of it. The plot of land for 3518 stretches all the way back to Pagasus so I wondered if perhaps the basement stretches back all the way to Pegasus?

           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at the Redfin page at the link below. There is a Google image. Zoom in and you can see the demise for the property and it pretty much touches the rear of the Pegasus building.

           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I noticed about that house is that there is a big splash of red paint on the kerb directly in front of the house. I wondered whether these could possible be to help people identify which house has the kids inside when they visit for their fix of hotdogs with walnut sauce.

            Pizzagate is real. I firmly believe that. I broke my shoulder back in October 2016 and it was around the time Kanye West had his melt down so l went on you tube to get more on it. I was neither a Kanye West fan or a you tube user at that time but he was calling out the illuminati and google facebook etc so l became avit obsessed with what was happening around him at that time. That obsession was rapidly taken over by the wikileaks emails and the US presidential election.
There was this tsunami of sickening information about peadophilia and satanism within the elites. There had already been the British peadophile scandal about Jimmy Saville who was very cosy with the establishment so it came as no surprise but it made my blood boil. Though sad, l had resigned myself to the knowledge that as people, even though we are 6,000 years, give or take, from the Egytian pharoah and slaves set up, that we haven't moved very far in those 6,000 years, but the kbowledge that these elites who are in power were doing this to young children filled me with rage. I absorbed as much as l could off you tube. I wnt on my facebook and wrote a rant. I got 6 likes 2 of which were family. Anyway l'm sorry for prattling on but l just wanted to explain l have been following this since it went off as l was off work on sick.
I want to say a huge thanks to all the hard working real investigators out there. I am in awe at what has been uncovered by everyone relevant regarding pizzagate. There is no doubt in my mind how real pizzagate is. The evidence is overwhelming and the push back from the establishment is another indication of it being real.
But l have just watched a video by a guy on you tube called Pizzagate is REAL and Also a Trojan Horse and in it he suggests that it may have been purposely leaked by the elites as a means to shut truthers down and he genuinely states how much of a push back some of the major pizzagate true journo's are getting. With the track record of how ruthless and murderous the elites have been l can imagine these men and women on the front line being scared for their lives so l again l want to thank the truthers out there for what they do.
I want to go back to this guys other claim that maybe its a lure to out the bad apples in the elites bunch which got me thinking....the abduction/killing of Julian Assange, Wikileak being compromised by the CIA and the email leaks were all around the same timeframe. As l said pizzagate is real. To me undeniably real. But and please dont flame me too much about this as l honestly have never been so involved in something like this before and only posted now and then on a game forum before posting this. Oh and my facebook rant but could they be behind the leaks? Even though l firmly believe pizzagate to be real could the elites be the ones who leaked these emails from Wikileaks as they had compromised it? Please be gentle or l ain't coming back :-P

            Peter Newsham is a dirty cop that has a history of violent abuse of power in DC, vilifying victims, beating his wife, and tampering with evidence...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now he stands with Comet Ping Pong and maybe the next permanent Police Chief of Washington DC... anyone else seeing a pattern here?

            Erin Moriarty with the CBS show 48 hours has been wearing a giant silver colored boy-lover charm on her necklace on many episodes created over the past 24 months. A recent episode updated a case from the early 90's called 'Innocence Lost' that she was the original correspondent on and in the update she is wearing the silver charm, on the older footage from the 90's she has a large gold stitched boy-lover symbol emblazoned on the lapel of her sports jacket.

            Amazing research and compilation of others hard research- you are doing fantastic work and pizzagate is getting HUGE right now - especially after Hillary's tweet and Joe Rogan podcast with Alex Jones. Very much looking forward to seeing the big names investigated...

             Careful here. Not sure this lady's on the up and up. Saw a comment on the youtube video Listen at 29:36, she says "trafficked" like traffick-ed. Was she reading from a script?

              Nope. She is real. Us Anons found her facebook. Notes: Her accusations go back to 2015 ( check post 'Napa is not a safe town')
Mother vigilante IMO. Not a troll. Our sense is there is some sick cover up going on in the county of Napa and we are doing more investigation as to why the DA Gary Liberstein suddenly resigned and is telling media he "retired" . Check it out yourselves.

               That's what I'm asking, is for the research to be thorough. This entire process has to be irrefutable for it all to stick. The rabbit hole is deep and there are so many trolls and implants trying to throw us off the trail. Well done.

            **Norwegian Airlines Trade Deal, Bangkok Crews, and High Level Norwegian Pedophile Individual: Pizza in Norway? **
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed the Obama-Norwegian Air International trade deal that allows the airline to employ Bangkok-based flight crews under short-term Singaporean or Thai employment contracts. Obama's Bad Plane Deal With Norway Southeast Asia of course has a huge sex-trade industry, including the prostitution of children for pedophiles. Although Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam have tried to crack down on child sex abuse, kids are still easy prey. In Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, for instance, the airport is plastered with posters warning against pedophilia....Source: Thailand Catches a Predator-Time Magazine. Is there a high-level Norwegian connection to this? Well, yes there is. This researcher has compiled a list of convicted pedophiles Pattaya, Thailand. This list included Jimmy Seville's chauffeur and Norwegian Mr. Oystein Larsen. Source: The Pattaya Pedophile Problem A quick Google search turns up a Mr. Oystein Larsen, is VP sales &amp; technical support, W. Giertsen Services AS Source: Lankhorst announces Deepwater Tethers Norwegian Sales Agency Agreement Although not connected to the airline and Thailand pilot link at this point, it could be a link to the overseas shipping of children. However, what is even more interesting, there is a Mr. Oystein Larsen who worked at Norwegian Public Roads Administration Centre for Road and Traffic 42 De N-0033 Oslo, Norway. Source: European Cooperation in Science and Technology I'm not sure if it ist he same Mr. Oystein Larsen, but he is also in charge of sales and rentals of ....relocatable buildings. O.B.

            So today's the day I finally created an account here- I've been lurking since before Reddit banned the original pg sub. I have been on the fence about being involved, largely in part because I feel the religious perspectives and satanism accusations really discredit any legitimate concerns. 
These are the kinds of traits that lead to the assumption of this being a literal witch hunt. Those who are willing to throw objectivity out the window in order to prostheletize or make emotional accusations beyond what can be proved are the ones who will sink this ship any any hope of this investigation being taken seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which leads me to my point- thank you so so much millennial, for making this post so clean and leaving out the irrelevant garbage we see constantly polluting this topic. 
Child abuse is evil enough all by itself, let's focus on the criminal activity we can track down and prove, and not this hysterical satanic cult mythos.

            Heres something interesting i found on the internet, its a letter a guy wrote to the Clintons when Bill was president.
Its about a band that played in the whitehouse, which is part of a bigger cult called "The Family" where pedophelia is a common thing.

            This subject IS the MOST IMPORTANT thing facing our ENTIRE GLOBAL society....
I'm/we are not trying to make money, we give our music away for FREE... We think music is an extremely POWERFUL, yet underused weapon and if we can get people singing about something,  MAYBE it will lead to changes... I KNOW it can't hurt. So if you disagree or (admins) don't "allow" this to post, PLEASE just remove me, I don't want to waste anyone's time. Thank you, we made this with LOVE and the DEEPEST sympathy for OUR children, we hope you understand and HELP US reach as many ears as possible! And if ANYONE denies this AT LEAST deserves investigation, they are GUILTY and trying to hide...

            FYI: The author of Secret Pizza Party, Adam Rubin, was working for an ad agency called Firstborn when the book was published in 2013. The CEO of Firstborn is a man named Daniel LaCivita. He may be related to Chris LaCivita a known colleague of Podesta. I am hoping someone will investigate this possible connection to Comet Pizza.

            Hi guys,
           </p>
           <p>
            I just found some really obvious child porn network pages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please see:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://facebook.com/Asparagus-Lover-237836772910495/">

             https://www.facebook.com/Asparagus-104766680159/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Why I think this are child porn networks:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) They talk about Thailand and Vietnam.
2) Many photo's of children. 
3) They talk about hunting asparagus. 
4) Many posts don't make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea what to do with these pages. FBI  perhaps?

            LOOK CLOSELY at how the red mask is ALWAYS away from this chin and lower neck.....thats his beard pushing it out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, when he says he's been in the music business for years in the video....Thats because ol' "Joshey Boy" or Joshua Ryan Voglesong OWNS "The Black Cat". A MAJOR Tranny gay club in DC.....you guys should go check out the vids from there.
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW This man... is one of alefantis's closest friends, and as fucked up as he is....has MAJOR ties to buzzfeed, cnn, and msnbc. GO LOOK THROUGH THEIR FRIENDS TO GET THE BIG PICTURE!
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Factory" another of alefantis's friends....has a lucifer leater coat on in from of a satan stage on his instagram. Also have vid from him (With the lucifer coat on) at the womens march yesterday, and The DC Black Bloc that happened during the inauguration!

            I would really appreciate it, if you would look at the larger context of Pizzagate, which I am exploring, and tell me what you think.

            I just had an idea: We all know the instagram pictures are too "strong" to show in TV shows etc. What about
            <strong>
             reactions videos
            </strong>
            of regular folks seeing (in the street, for example) cardboards or an ipad with the photos and being asked: "Would you bring your child to this pizza place?"
           </p>
           <p>
            That would sparkle some interest or curiosity on the viewers.

             From the above, Amanda Kleinman might have some familiarity with "Eli" and may have been to the one to make his costume. Anything beyond those two things is supposition, but extremely creepy supposition.

            COHERENCE AND RELEVANCE OF INFORMATION, FACTS AND EVIDENCE
Quote: Exhibit E: Media Coverup Efforts ... Prima facie, the media have no basis for labeling an ongoing investigation, which is entirely rooted in real evidence, as "fake news." In fact, Pizzagate is not an allegation of a specific, individual crime (e.g. the abuse of a specific child on a specific day and time). Rather, it is an investigation into the possibility of certain individuals being involved in certain kinds of criminal activity. End Quote. ...
In short, Pizzagate is not an allegation of any crime; rather, it is an investigation of possible crimes. Nevertheless, any potential allegation of a crime requires a prior INVESTIGATION of the facts of the potential alleged crime. To help insure coherence in the information and facts collected in the investigation of the complete fact setting of possible crimes, one must know what facts are RELEVANT to specific possible violations or offenses of the appropriate Criminal Codes (Federal, State and District of Columbia, and Criminal-Law Offenses and Civil-Law Offenses) for all appropriate law jurisdictions (National, State, D.C., County and Municipal). The relevance of information and facts used as evidence is determined by RULES OF EVIDENCE (Federal, State and D.C.). To know what facts are relevant to specific violations or offenses, one must know the ELEMENTS of each OFFENSE, as contained in the relevant Criminal Codes. Otherwise, much if not most of the potential evidence may be irrelevant or dismissed due to violation without exception to Rules of Evidence and Rules of Procedure, such as hearsay, lack of proper Chain of Custody, and dozens of other objections that can be made by the counsel for defense. For example, Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) is a criminal offense listed in some state Criminal Codes, and its precise elements and their definitions may vary across state jurisdictions and over time. The following link provides an overview of the SRA offense:
            <a href="http://www.cultwatch.com/satanicabuse.html">
             http://www.cultwatch.com/satanicabuse.html
            </a>
            ... and SRA Calendar:
            <a href="http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm">
             http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm
            </a>
            ... and Investigator's Guide to Allegations of "Ritual' Child Abuse, January, 1992:
            <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/136592NCJRS.pdf">
             https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/136592NCJRS.pdf
            </a>
            ... and U.S. Code Title 18 Crimes and Criminal Procedure Chapter 110 Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children:
            <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-110">
             https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-110
            </a>
            ... and
            <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2251">
             https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2251
            </a>
            Section 2251 Sexual Exploitation of Children. Lastly, some crimes have a statue of limitations in some jurisdictions for reporting and laying of charges or complaints. One effective way to guide the collection of relevant facts as potential evidence is to begin with a hypothetical Jury Charge that lists each of the alleged Offenses and its Elements.

             I have been making minor edits since then (actually removed a few minor things due to being unsubstantiated), but nothing major added since then.  Been busy moderating the forum, and no truly solid connections have emerged yet since Dec. 29.  The Dyncorp connection is still quite loose.  I would classify it as a potential lead at this point.  There are some minor pieces of evidence I have yet to add, but I will get to them in due course.

            No, Herb Sandler said that.  He is talking to Podesta and Podesta's wife.  Also, maybe innuendo, maybe not.  What is clearly weird about this email is the stuff I pointed out in the summary.

            I think the only way we would ever know is someone breaking silence about it. I don't understand what dominoes mean, and why they do talk in code, they must have been told verbally - that's why all of this does tie into weird cult shit.

            PFLAG doesn't "tend to kids."  The Parents can refer older parents of adults.   The Pink Triangle was a originally a symbol used by the Nazis to indicate homsexuals.  It was later reclaimed by gay groups. PFLAG is basically a gay rights group that is not made up of homosexuals but people who have a loved one who is homosexual.  It was started by the mother of a gay son.   So the logo is a heart intertwined with a triangle.  It indicates a straight-gay alliance.   I had never seen the logo before, it was very clear to me what message they are going for.

            Actually Besta Pizza does have a connection to the Clintons. Its registered agent Andrew Kline was appointed as attorney of Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit of the DOJ by Bill Clinton back when he was president.

            Thanks for the input.  I will revisit the handkerchief bit when I get a chance.  I was aware the link lacked a reference to white meaning pedophilia, but I had opted to leave it in, because others claimed to have found reference to white meaning "virgins," and because it makes sense.

            This was a great, thought provoking contribution. I find myself wondering about the connection between pederasty, hedonism and corruption and how they contributed to the downfall of great civilizations like Crete, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and the European monarchies/Empires. I wonder what this means for America.

            A few things jumped at me, that are not included:
Didn't Bill Clinton himself fly to Haiti to get Silsby free?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is of highest importance to understand the media complicity to mention the strange connections.
The Reddit CEO is mentioned, but why is it not mentioned that he was posting in a cannibal forum and that he himself has eaten human flesh?!
To understand that, it would be important to show the pics about canibals cooking and eating babies in the left "art"-scene.
That this CEO deleted pizzagate-subforum, but left cannibals and pedolovers untouched?
That no one in the media has a problem with such a CEO.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Jimmy Saville cover-upperer BBC boss Thompson now CEO by the Carlos Slim owned NYT and NYT already publishing articles claiming pedophilia was not a crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also Breitbarts tweet about Podesta being a child sex trafficing cover-upperer is a very important fact that is missing. And that Breitbart died three hours before he could publish his announced videos about Obama.
And that Breitbarts coroner died on the same day, when Breitbart's autopsy-papers were published is missing, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            No mentioning of Madeleine McCann and the Podesta-brothers looking like the official search pics?
           </p>
           <p>
            All that IMO is very important for newbies to get a glimpse what is real no normal people can imagine.

            But it dawns on me now that Herb Sandler used those words because he'll be getting a reward for sacrificing a child to Lucifer, and he's wondering if sacrificing cheese (which he didn't order &amp; isn't enthusiastic about), will get him a better reward than pasta (his usual/favorite).

            After complaining that Podesta sent him the wrong package, he's asking if it's a more valuable sacrifice in an attempt to alleviate some of his disappointment.

            ...it’s collected as a souvenir after being placed under the victimJPG. Black and white symbolize bdsm/domination and pedophilia, respectively. Furthermore, as discussed previously, "pizza" is a common codeword for child sex abuse. The meaning of "map" here is unclear.

            Just further fact-checking and I cannot find a verification for white handkerchief meaning underage sex. It could just as well mean safe sex or voyeurism.

            The show poster with "Teen Mom" and "Teenage Aviation" compared to the old painting of the child being abused with an apparent white handkerchief is actually some of the most damning evidence for that conclusion and for Comet Ping Pong. But research links that demonstrate where both pieces of art come from would be really good here. If someone has provided that and I didn't see it, please pardon this comment, but I may need to be pointed to that work. Thanks.

            This is excellent. I would add those killed for looking into pedo rings and prominent people and a context/history section. I have made a hodgepodge of the two. It is very intriguing for people who know nothing about the subject in general:
           </p>
           <p>
            Andrew Breitbart -
-video of him "fuck you Podesta" "What's in your closet"
-Calls Podesta pedo child trafficker on Twitter in 2011
-Zeros in on "ping pong" being brought up on news in interview.
-Dies a year later after threatening to release Obama college tapes
-assistant coroner also dies
           </p>
           <p>
            Context History
-Nancy Schaefer and husband killed after threatening to expose Child Protective Services
-Boys Town pedo scandal (Lawrence King, Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner, private investigator's plane blown up when returning with photographic evidence)
-Johnny Gosch kidnapping case (links into Bonacci and Boys Town and possible Jeff Ganon the White House press secretary/male prostitute [mother thinks Johnny may be Jeff!]. Bonacci claims to have taken him and provides unique and corroborated proof)
-Jimmy Saville sadistic pedo (covered up by BBC, head of BBC to NYT - still covering it up)
-Jeffrey Epstein confirmed pedo (ties to various politicians including Clintons and possibly Trump although Trump allegedly threw him out of private club for pedo reasons)
-Ted Gunderson, former head of FBI in 3 major cities, claims elite satanic pedo rings (interviews Bonacci and Boys Town prosecuting lawyer DeCamp. Also died recently of possible arsenic poisoning)
-Very recently a massive pedo ring in Norway busted (includes prominent people. Nature of evidence extremely sadistic. Includes infants)
-Max Spiers recently killed after investigating pedo rings (specifically Michael Aquino, who was named by Bonacci as head to brainwashing satanic government program, which is not denied and verified mainstream)
-Jill Dando killed for trying to expose pedos at BBC
-The husband of Camila Wright, assistant attorney general, crusaded against child sex trafficking in Georgia shot dead

            There has been a lot of talk about the ejaculating man wall mural, and my current understanding is that it was never in CPP.  JA posted a photo of it and it seems that people just assumed it was in CPP.

              Sorry; I didn't record any sources for this.  The matter of this particular mural is something I've run into a lot over the course of PG though, including a challenge from someone who asked where all the complaints from parents were over seeing this in the bathroom there.  It's a logical question, forming one part of why I think this graffiti was never in CPP.
             </p>
             <p>
              A better question is can any source be found documenting it as being in CPP?  It is connected via JA on IG, but that only means that he saw it; it establishes nothing about where the image was.

                There is lots of imagery showing the below mural of the antler-headed people holding severed heads.  That one is definitely there, and there has been some controversy about it.

             Personally, I think they are possibly an example of parallel construction, but I'm not ready to include that part yet.  I need a source connecting the Podestas to Clement Freud.

              What about Lucian Freud?  Lucian was  Clement Freud's older brother, also a grandson of Sigmund Freud. He died in 2011, age 88. Probably the Podesta's knew Lucian and/or his artist daughter Annabel. There are scads of: 30 children?  He was an artist, and painted his own daughter, Annabel, when she was small, bottomless, lying on the floor by a window. He painted his other daughter Annie nude at 14.
Annabel Freud is also a painter and Bella Freud, fashion designer, is well known in the UK.  I'm sure Tony would know some of the huge family and prominent members of them.

               OK, I looked into it, and the source is an anonymous NYPD leaker, who says this was learned through Weiner's laptop.  Admittedly, proof would be preferable, but I'm operating on the assumption that at least the first "FBIanon" thread was posted by a genuine leaker, and this fits with his claims.

            Under "Exhibit A: Evidence Pertaining to Comet Pizza and Ping Pong", it seems significant to also note that Comet Pizza hosts children's birthday parties (

             http://www.cometpingpong.com/parties/)

            One of her pieces depicts a child performing oral sex on an adult.  It's all in a very primitive abstract style, but it's as clear as could be the act which is being depicted.  I saw it in that long excellent video by kiwigirl, I think, on YouTube.

            Good Job!! I'm glad to see someone willing to put in the efforts and weed through all the proposed material. I know it's a lot of work when you have people who may be misinformed or shills who are trying to get you to revise your posts while at the same time be willing to listen to the community for suggestions. It was too much for me and I'm happy to see this sticky. Keep up the good work!

             I have yet to be able to verify that whole thing.  The last time someone posted about it, I requested proof of the hacked emails, and OP send me a screenshot of four 4chan links, all of which 404'd.  He then said he would contact two researchers, Titus Frost and someone else, for the archive links, but he never got back to me.  I messaged him the next day and asked him if he had the links, and he never replied.  I'm not going to include something I can't verify.  If someone can get me links to the archived threads (i.e. proof that emails were hacked), I would be grateful.

             We don't have enough evidence on Rao to include him at this point.  "Liking" a picture of kids is not abnormal behavior in itself, so it's not enough.  Too witch-hunty.  I agree there is a lot yet to be included, though.  It's a work in progress, but I wasn't going to wait any longer to get a better sticky posted.

            I've been trying to get more information on why there is so much of this pedo abuse in the elite circles, specifically what they partake in it for. I don't believe it's to keep each other in check by potential blackmailing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe it's something more sinister with roots tied into the occult. Just the destruction of pure innocent human consciousness for sacrament to dark forces. Can anyone point me in the right direction because it's driving me insane that we have all this evidence yet we don't know why they do it

             I have no idea where I saw the theory that there is some genetic anomaly which is evident by misshapen pupils. David Rockerfella is said to have it and quiet a few of the children posted by JA seem to have strange eyes. 
If you listen to 'Why Johnny Can't Come Home', Noreen Gosch (Johnny's mom) says that there are catalogs of children not yet abducted which sickos can order from for a price.

            Hmm not really, in my opinion. The P.E.D. thing is surely done on purpose though, but that's also just my opinion. This is a quite common ping pong logo:

            Great summary so far.  Well done.
I would add the "bucks" and "camping" connection to JA.  I saw a topic on that.   If it's true that bucks going camping to rape kids is common parlance in that community, that's as damning as anything.  By itself, it means very little.  But with the rest of the evidence, it's a big deal.

            First, the movie IS a piece of shit movie, I totally agree with you (it was almost painful to watch), but I'd have to disagree on the second part of your comment. It's not as common as you'd think. The handkerchief

            is much more meaningful in Hollywood and in the world of satanist pedophiles than one would think. In these minimalist pieces of 'art', notice how Kim Noble (which is a survivor of satanic rituals and MK Ultra) not only puts the emphasis on the dissociation process that occurs as a result of this kind of abuse, but also on the handkerchief placed under the victim.

            First I want to applaud this. I have been trying to piece together a narrative that strictly includes verified sources without excessive conjecture. This is a good model for that. But here is something nobody has actually verified: The Food Code. So concerning your points above, I think you need to verify those. Nothing outside of this theory has proven that pasta means anything, or dominoes, or hot dogs, etc. Only pizza. Because pizza leads you to everything else, seems like all other words are conjecture and unnecessary to build the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone want to verify the food code?

             My feeling is that pizza and hot dogs are analogous to '[getting some] ass' and 'dick' respectively. Hot dogs specifies male, while pizza could be either. So it's general sexual activity, especially with prostitutes/sex slaves/trafficked individuals. If you say you're flying in pizza and hot dogs, it means you're flying in male and female hookers/sex slaves.

             The Food Code was described in a YouTube video at

             PizzaGate is just the tip of the iceberg, posted by SGT Report on November 27, 2016, at [13:55] to [14:30]. The host said the Wikipedia leaked Podesta emails used certain words in the manner of a code. 
The Child Sex Trafficking symbols were explained in a document prepared by the FBI for use by law enforcement persons in the USA. The FBI webpage address is included in the following article about the Child Sex Trafficking Food Code:
             <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/conspiracy/13-essential-data-points-pizzagate-pedophilia-allegations/">
              http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/conspiracy/13-essential-data-points-pizzagate-pedophilia-allegations/
             </a>
             at Data Point Number 3. 
The relevant Podesta emails with the Food Codes are shown at the following webpage address:
             <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/the-disturbing-disgusting-pedophile-code-hidden-in-the-john-podesta-emails_112016">
              http://www.thedailysheeple.com/the-disturbing-disgusting-pedophile-code-hidden-in-the-john-podesta-emails_112016
             </a>
             The cited videos and related documents provide an interpretation of the apparent Food Code, but that interpretation is not as strong as an admission or confession by someone on the inside of the alleged Child Sex Trafficking Ring or Satanic Ritual group. 
Hope this helps.

             Just saw on another thread that "Domino" In both English and French, earlier denoted a long hooded cloak worn together with a mask during carnival season or at a masquerade. Could playing dominos be like the S&amp;M scene in Eyes Wide Shut?

              Google, Wikipedia, no results. So Obama could actually be flying in $60K in dogs and pizza to the white house. That seems more plausible than bringing in boys and girls to such a high profile environment.

               Outside food is not allowed in the White House. The Potus has to have everything cooked by his own cook. For obvious security reasons. And there is no way you can spend $60k on dogs and pizza, so what world do you live in to consider that?

               Yeah, I haven't included that email as evidence.  Supposedly, it would violate White House rules, though, not to mention that flying pizza and hot dogs from Illinois to D.C. would be pretty odd.

                It is against WH rules to bring food in.  It is not against WH rules for POTUS or staff to order outside food from approved vendor. He could have ordered hot dogs from Chicago if vendor was known.

                 They have very strict rules there that the food must be made there. No food can be flown in. It's dangerous to the president so they avoid that. Who gets it through a channel?

                 Someone's blog on a honeypot for pedos had a guy with an email called jetspizza. I saw somewhere else something about pizza on the nambla or whatever's website.

                  My feeling is that pizza and hot dogs are analogous to '[getting some] ass' and 'dick.' Hot dogs specifies male, while pizza could be either. So it's general sexual activity, especially with prostitutes/sex slaves/trafficked individuals. If you say you're flying in pizza and hot dogs, it means you're flying in male and female hookers. Cheese = young child ('extra cheese' = extra young). Pasta = adolescent/preteen. Dominos = BDSM sex. Walnuts = [genitals of] young girl

            This is such awesome work and If I could upvoat you a million times I would! A summary of the events like that is so important for helping new comers understand what is going on. I was talking to my girlfriend the other day about pizzagate and I had some trouble explaining everything in the correct order. She was overwhelmed and didn't understand everything. I had so much to say but I didn't know how to say it and where to begin. Next time I have to explain pizzagate I'll make sure to give them the link to this post. Thank you!

            I have found information to other businesses and partners of Alefantis. He's on film here defending contriversal art show- read comments he is board member of Transformer

            Might want to add Monica Petersen to the Haiti part. I think it's relevant since she was investigating the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, wasn't there an email that asks specifically if Laura Silsby was "the only one bbeing held"? To prove more about the Clinton/Silsby connection.

            Might also want to mention Alefantis lying about having a basement.
           </p>

             We have no proof Comet has a basement.  They store their tomatoes in Bucks basement, which is however in the same building, so in a sense he was being dishonest, but not outright lying.

            The hivemind thats been created around this is amazing  but i wonder if things are being missed because of the nature of an open source investigation. Has anyone discussed bringing people together in groups and organizing and dividing up the workload? That way all bases get covered and you dont have things like a bunch of random people all investigating whatever the "newest lead" on

             I've said before it would be helpful for people to make private subs to investigate leads. So for example if someone finds something interesting, posts about it and there are a few more people interested, they could make a private sub, talk all they want shill-free, and report back to us if it goes somewhere.

            I believe when he refers to MAP, it means traces back to the "illicit" activity the handkerchief was used for. The real estate mentions nothing
about a map. This is what I think in this context. Good post ! I'll definitely share this to the skeptics.

            Nice work. I think your summary should include the email about obama spending $65 k taxpayers money on pizza / hotdogs imported from interstate for a WH party, in contravention of WH kitchen rules
Even if anyone is to argue its not conclusively referring to children, it is a smoking gun of misappropriation of taxpayers money for whatever clandestine indulgence is being referred to in code.

            You may want to consider adding the case of Robert Richards, heir of DuPont corporation, who was convicted of raping his 3 year-old daughter, yet was never sentenced to prison because the judge said "he would not fare well" behind bars.

            It's not pizzagate related, but it certainly adds credibility to the idea that, like Epstein, being rich can make you immune to child abuse laws.

            I just want to urge a bit of reservation with respect to what appears to be one of the most damning bits of evidence presented here. I'm talking about the email about the Luzzatto kids, ages 11, 9, and 7 going to a pool party for John Podesta's "entertainment."
           </p>
           <p>
            I did a search on Voat and followed a number of links with references to outside sources about these kids, their parents, their relationship to Tamera Luzzatto, and the Clintons.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/search?q=luzzatto&amp;sub=pizzagate&amp;l=true">
             https://voat.co/search?q=luzzatto&amp;sub=pizzagate&amp;l=true
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not beyond reason to assume that reference is innocuous and is legitimately a relative dropping their grandkids off at the home of a family friend. Yes, it's worded very weird coming from the perspective of someone who's been investigating this for a while, but as a parent, it's not unusual at all to refer to kids as "entertainment." Remember, the mother of these kids blogged their youngest daughter's home water birth.
            <a href="http://mamasmidwives.com/maeve-chaim/">
             http://mamasmidwives.com/maeve-chaim/
            </a>
            Parents who have home water births are very heavily invested in their kid's well-being. Learn about water birthing and tell me it isn't a sign of an excellent parent? I doubt someone who cares enough about their kids well being to water birth them at home would be reckless enough to put them in a position to be raped by a politician.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all the research I've done on these kids and that reference, I was not able to find anything. Others have also researched these kids and their connection and hit a dead end.
            <a href="https://amp.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bnd83/the_case_of_tamera_luzzatto_and_the_lovettsville/">
             https://amp.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bnd83/the_case_of_tamera_luzzatto_and_the_lovettsville/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying not to investigate this potential lead. What I'm saying is that this could potentially be very easily explained, yet heavily used against us, so try not to weigh it too heavily as "evidence" until we understand the connection between the Luzzattos and Podesta, while keeping in mind that the Podestas are some of the most well-connected people in Washington and Luzzatto was HRC's Chief of Staff while she served as Senator of NY. Luzzatto and Podesta likely became good friends while working for HRC. It's very possible that this particular evidence is innocuous and could blow up in our face.
           </p>
           <p>
            As FBIanon has stated, Pizzagate is just the top of the iceberg, and we should focus on the Clinton Foundation, as they are likely the center of the international child sex trafficking ring.

            I posted this about the potential meaning of dominoes. I use the term "Dominoing":

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498072
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, notice that  you corrected the term to "dominoes", which is the correct way to spell the term, but they spelled it "dominos". These are usually pretty intelligent people that make few spelling mistakes. Domino's is how you spell the pizza joint, so if one was referring to dominoing (I never see this term spelled with an "e"), they would be more likely to cut off the "e" in the term "dominoes".

            Actually, I have something very relevant to show you. It seems that this ritual (putting a towel or handkerchief under a sexual act to recover the semen and fluids) is a common practice in Hollywood. How do I know this? I was searching the Wikileaks files and stumbled upon this Sony picture movie script called "Sausage Party". I was reading the script and I was shocked at how all this was eerily relevant to PG. Anyway, if you scroll down to line 637, you'll see mention of this ritual... which doesn't appear at all in the final drafted movie, because I watched it myself. Here it is:

             Yeah, that was made early on and I don't think it is accurate. PIzza = Sex or Sex act... something sexual. A general term.  Cheese = Child. Pasta = prostitute. These things have been widely used.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rest is slang from their own social circle that morphs over time.

             In the Stratfor emails, Kimdotcom alluded to pizza = weapons and ice cream = money.

              When you see dozens and dozens of pictures of pizzas covering girls body parts and slices of pizza's made to look like a girl's private part, you have to conclude that it means "pussy". Especially when you see a meme that says "Pizza for president!" under a photo of HRC. Or two guys saying they're going to order 2 "stripper pizzas." I'm just using logic here, but of course, my opinion is just that. It's not FBI stuff.

               So, you are saying it is a "pussy" related map.
              </p>
              <p>
               That a slice of "pussy" is going to be shared amongst a group of people.

               That Tony invited John to get "pussy" for an hour.
              </p>
              <p>
               Tony could bring "pussy" home.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Pussy" extravaganza.

              <p>
               David Brock seemed to admit that John Podesta was in a relationship with Alefantis, who sent an email, in this time period, with an XOXO.
              </p>
              <p>
               Alefantis is regretful that he couldn't make John a nice "pussy."
              </p>
              <p>
               I mean, I can see how someone could see it that way. I just feel strongly that it is a more generic term than a specific word.
              </p>
              <p>
               If Kimdotcom is right, then the whole community is using pizza as ubiquitous term for anything illegal.

            The laura silsby thing: you say that puello was Clinton appointed but is there evidence of that? Also is there any citation that says he got laura silsby released? One of your sources says the opposite.  Apparently a man named drew ham hired him who is one of the pastor's of the church. Also he was not a convicted sex trafficker until after this event

              This is a bad source, it is written in a confusing way and doesn't properly cite it's sources.  This is from the first link:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               A Harvard Law School Journal article titled Owning Laura Silby’s Shame claims that getting Silsby off the hook was one of the first things Clinton did after arriving on the scene in Haiti.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The link that it cites doesn't mention this at all.  But if you go to
              <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">
               the source it says it's citing
              </a>
              (the harvard article) it reads:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In the course of a month, President Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              If you end up going to the harvard article (which is what most of the sources cite which claim hillary helped silsby) do me a favor and Ctrl-F "hillary". I can't find a source that supports what you're saying.

             He was wanted though, which is why the judge kicked him out. Given that he was wanted for such serious crimes it seems very strange that he would pop up in Haiti for that specific case with so much media attention.

             Chevy Chase has a history of teenage boy/political connected prostitution.  Barney Franks boy prostitute ran his prostitution ring out of two places for a time.  One was Barney Frank's apartment.  The other place was Chevy Chase School just down from Comet Pizza.  Also interesting is the location of "The Finders" warehouse.  Information in the actual FBI report has the warehouse where they held the children (for their satanic rituals and sexual abuse) very close to the Whitehouse as well as Comet Pizza.

             If you look at Arun Rao's Instagram you will see Voo Doo Donut sign which has the blue counter clockwise spiral. (He is a fan of jimmycomet's baby pics specifically on Instragram.) 
It's the 31st pic on the third row counting down.

             Rolandmois1 has a photo on his Instagram in front of a mural of the VDD logo holding up a chocolate penis.

             Here is a VDD Instagram site w/weird pics and the pedo emblem for little boys

             The Austin location has very sinister donuts and clear pedo symbol and penis shaped donuts, the 52nd photo on 3rd row depicts the gay pride movement in Texas.

             If you Google Buck's Fishing and Camping- click images you'll see the creepy steak pic with 2 donuts stacked in the very front with a single candle.
One of the mottos for VDD is "Where the Magic is in the Hole"
             <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/voodoo-doughnut-in-portland-or-the-magic-is-in-the-hole/">
              http://laughingsquid.com/voodoo-doughnut-in-portland-or-the-magic-is-in-the-hole/
             </a>
             The photos in the link show a collage with a donut w/pedo symbol and another with a pentagram, actually this place is morbid. Their sacks have pentagrams on them too.
Urban dictionary describes donut as being "idiot" "dumb" and a "love hole".
             <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=donut">

             WOW! So I Googled donut pedophile and clicked images and VDD popped up and I hit the mother load!

            Great work. We will need to tie in more from the Clinton Foundation. We also might think to reorder to show the strongest evidence first (prior censorship is conclusive and shows what we are seeing now)...rather than following the chronology of how we got here. In other words, while a lot of the investigation started with the pizza code, people get lost with this as it is more challenging to convince. If we lead with the strongest pieces, people will explore further. Thanks again!!

             Actually, I did organize this in part based on strength of evidence.  It's somewhat of a hybrid between chronology of discovery and evidence strength.  But I agree that there is much more to be added.  I have been working on it for days, and decided I needed to go ahead and post what I have, because the previous sticky was not very well-written or well-organized, and it included some things I consider to be disinformation (i.e.Ted Gunderson), although I sure appreciate the poster's efforts, as it laid a lot of groundwork.

              You are awesome. My only thought is that the very strongest entry point is to show how this has happened before and been censored from the news, which is so obvious for anyone that arrives in our platform. That helps to disarm people who have been fed the "fake news" propaganda by the MSM.

            I made this comment in the last thread but never got an answer so I'll post it here:
Is it misleading to say that Antinous is a symbol of pederasty and not mention that
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Cultural_references">
             in the modern era he is a well known gay icon
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I've never seen any evidence that that one painting of the decapitated kid was actually ever in Comet

              Is it misleading to say that Antinous is a symbol of pederasty and not mention that in the modern era he is a well known gay icon
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I don't think it's misleading.  The fact is that he IS a symbol of pederasty.  We don't need to provide a defense against our own case, and mentioning that he's also associated with homosexuality would be (1) redundant and (2) make us sound like homophobes.

              Also I've never seen any evidence that that one painting of the decapitated kid was actually ever in Comet

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I would be grateful if you would look into its exact association with Comet.  Try reverse image search.  I'm really busy atm.

              I have actually reverse image searched it. The artists website doesn't say anything about it and comet and the other sources I have seen are pizzagate related and most of
              <em>
               them
              </em>
              simply say it's another painting by the same artist who did a mural in comet.

               The mural does actually have decapitated heads. It has been removed and painted over however, but you can tell it's the same location in comet ping pong. Here is the image of proof:

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A purported FBI leaker posted claims on 4chan's "/pol/," an anonymous political forum.  Admittedly, the forum he chose is not exactly reputable.  However, this fits with his claim that he wanted to surround himself with noise in order to prevent his FBI superiors from detecting him, and it fits because he knew many in that anti-Clinton audience would take him seriously and investigate, employing what the forum's users call "weaponized autism."  The alleged leaker's central claim was that the NYPD and FBI had discovered immensely scandalous information about Hillary Clinton through Anthony Weiner's laptop, but the FBI is not yet acting on the information for reasons we will not discuss here.  For our purposes, the relevant allegation is this:  The purported leaker alleged that
            <strong>
             the Clinton Foundation is a front for human trafficking, including child sex trafficking.
            </strong>
            He told us, "Dig deep and you will find it. It's sickening."  Well, we've been digging, and we seem to be finding it.  Summaries of the leaker's claims can be found here:

            <strong>
             The same establishment elites who try to control politics also control the mainstream media (this includes Fox News).  They do not want corruption of this magnitude to be exposed.
            </strong>
            As soon as word of Pizzagate went viral, the mainstream media began a coverup campaign.  They began denouncing the allegations as "false," "hoax," and "fake news," without directly addressing the evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prima facie, the media have no basis for labeling an
            <em>
             ongoing investigation
            </em>
            , which is entirely rooted in real evidence, as "fake news."  In fact, Pizzagate is not an allegation of a specific, individual crime (e.g. the abuse of a specific child on a specific day and time).  Rather, it is an
            <em>
             investigation
            </em>
            into the possibility of certain individuals being involved in certain kinds of criminal activity.  Therefore, labeling Pizzagate "false/hoax/fake" is patently absurd and dishonest, especially considering the media's refusal to address the evidence directly.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Washington D.C. Metro Police Department claimed it investigated Pizzagate and concluded the allegations are false.  However,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omlQHWrgmd4">
             a response to an FOIA request demonstrated that no investigation was conducted
            </a>
            .  Therefore, the position of the DC Metro Police must be based on (1) the dishonest media coverage of Pizzagate, (2) willful complicity in the coverup, or (3) some combination of both.
           </p>

            <strong>
             Reddit CEO Steve Huffman banned the Pizzagate research community from Reddit on bogus grounds
            </strong>
            , accusing us of engaging in a "witch hunt," even though we only used publicly-available information, and never called for vigilantism or harrassment of any kind.  While we understand Reddit may have had legitimate concerns of legal action, there is plenty of reason and evidence to believe the decision was politically motivated.

              Comet Pizza
             </strong>
             is a pizza place owned by
             <strong>
              James Alefantis
             </strong>
             , who is the former gay boyfriend of
             <strong>
              David Brock
             </strong>
             , the CEO of
             <strong>
              Correct The Record
             </strong>
             . It has been the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff.
             <strong>
              John Podesta
             </strong>
             has had campaign fundraisers there for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. John's brother and business partner
             <strong>
              Tony Podesta
             </strong>
             has his birthday party there every year.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also a dive that according to reviews and photos has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals. The bathrooms in particular have murals exclusively of nude women, as well as a great deal of graffiti relating to sex. Reviews of the restaurant are bizarrely polarized. Websites describing it positively note that there are regularly "unsupervised children running around". Their menu include a pedophilic symbol, as do the signs and decorations of other neighboring businesses.

            <p>
             The music acts and the posters promoting same acts are bizarre in their presentation, content, and lyrical focus, but are still promoted as being "for all ages". The overtly sexual content would suggest otherwise.
The same has taken place in reference to videos recorded inside Comet Ping Pong by people that frequent their establishment as well as video referencing Comet Ping Pong positively from the exterior.
While initially not the central focus of the investigation at the onset, Comet Ping Pong is a much more overt and much more disturbing hub of coincidences. Everyone associated with the business is making semi-overt, semi-tongue-in-cheek, and semi-sarcastic inferences towards sex with minors. The artists that work for and with the business also generate nothing but cultish imagery of disembodiment, blood, beheadings, sex, and of course pizza.

             James Alefantis' instagram late 11/5/16. by morning of 11/7/16 it was set to private.
            </p>
            <p>
             We recently found the instagram account of James Alefantis. The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.

              Dennis Hastert
             </strong>
             where they both taught students.
In his first year of graduate school, Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program.[29] One of Hastert's fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).

            <p>
             They are known for purchasing "awkward" works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. "It's easy to store them, but difficult to display them," says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show "very complicated video pieces" on all four walls.

              Alefantis has a Berlin partner, Dr. Pong, that has very graphic/bloody art.  He was partner in a restaurant w/Dr Pong owner in past &amp; seems to be connected in some way still. I'm hearing connected through net...servers? One image shows a woman that appears in shower maybe naked beaten and bloodied like she was raped. She looks like she could even be dead with her eyes open.   Blood is running out of her mouth.

              In the party video, Amanda Kleinman references "secret pizza". This same term comes up in the description of a film about a "private island" that was produced by Jame Alefantis.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a whim, Eve, a young Swedish traveler, accepts an invitation from Peter to vacation on his family's private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of the island gives way and Eve finds herself trapped in a state of surreality punctuated by bizarre visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza.

               More on MAP and Dizin: I just finished reading your Pizzagate summary and did some investigative research online.

               Would the reference to Map in the Podesta email have anything to do with Map Financial Group, Inc.? Could MAP be a front or one time front for the traffic ring?

               • In January 2015, the
               <strong>
                ASANTE Board
               </strong>
               was informed of allegations of serious misconduct against
               <strong>
                Mr. Amon Munyaneza
               </strong>
               , Asante’s founder and former executive director.
              </p>
              <p>
               The allegations were referred to an attorney and an independent professional investigator. The investigation included numerous interviews and an opportunity for Mr. Munyaneza to address the charges against him. The investigation also brought to light similar misconduct by Mr. Munyaneza, in 2009. At the conclusion of the investigation, the ASANTE Board had no choice but to terminate Mr. Munyaneza’s employment as executive director and called upon him to relinquish all engagement with the ministry worldwide. He has not done so. Mr. Munyaneza went back to Africa and became the leader of the Africa partners, as Board President of Africa Mission Alliance Rwanda.
              </p>
              <p>
               • For 18 months, the ASANTE Board has attempted to rebuild relationships with the Africa partners – Africa Mission Alliance Rwanda and Asante Ministries Uganda– to improve communications and program accountability. However, the board was met with little or no cooperation from the African partners, due to Mr. Munyaneza’s influence.

               I didn't type the the rest of the statement out but the bottom line is the 2 companies pizzapacket followed that I researched are seriously shady which leads me to believe the emails from Podesta insisting to donate to

               The phone number if googled indicates that the business moved to a new location, and the owner of that business probably failed to remove the awning before relocating, so that lead is a dead end. The ownership of the 762 park place address is currently unknown and cannot be confirmed as legitimately associated with Pizza Packet.

               Pizza Packet, though a legitimate company that does deliver an actual product, doesn't seem to have a legitimate business location that can be tied to it. It operates entirely out of two Post Office boxes in two different states. The owner of the company also is posing himself as a doctor in what used to be a medical supply business location, while not having any type of medical license.

               <p>
                Viewing images of Alexandra Tydings in which you can see her right arm visibly, she has the same exact tattoo in the same exact spot:

                Former Georgia State Senator,
                <strong>
                 Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS)
                </strong>
                .
               </p>
               <p>
                Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following: “…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 The Adoption and the Safe Families Act
                </strong>
                , set in motion by
                <strong>
                 President Bill Clinton
                </strong>
                , offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as
                <strong>
                 The Second Mile
                </strong>
                , procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.
               </p>
               <p>
                Schaefer and her husband died under very mysterious circumstances at their home in Georgia in March of 2010.

                 Hi all...first time poster and independent researcher: Haiti trafficking....those that came back to the U.S. "They were immediately flown back to Miami on a US Air Force transport plane. Laura Silsby-Gayler and Charisa Coulter, were held over for more questioning.[15]-New York Times, "Judge Releases Eight Americans Jailed in Haiti"    So citizen missionaries are flown back on a US Air Force transport plane?? Shouldn't they have had to [purchase a normal flight ticket to get home?

                 ...quantity of available financial information about KS/BE (the trust) is amazingly limited. Even the court-appointed master compared his attempts to get information from these trustees to trying to get it from the CIA. The usually mild mannered master was "outraged" by the trustees' "specious rationale" for not properly disclosing vital information. He called their excuses "so pathetic as to border on the ludicrous."

               CARDS - "Child Abductions Rapid Deployments" - The FBI established a rabid response force for human trafficking and child abduction cases. The outcomes after the teams are deployed and their actions will likely be of interest.

               It appears that the deployment itself will help in connecting other dots.

                 No problem. I've been following all of this pretty closely and validating theories / findings. If you have questions, message me. I think a bit too much is deliberated openly, leading to really off the mark angles being public before being flushed out. I suppose 'thinking out loud' has some merit when working as a group / collective. But can be hard to follow.

               Agreed. This is an FBI-run investigation around the time of the Weiner Scandal, so it's worth mentioning. It's really the FBI's involvement that is of interest. Don't you think it's a little strange that suddenly pedophiles are being busted all over the world and a lot of it comes back to US-tips, especially by the FBI?

               Most CMS embed publication and revision date(s) even if a style doesn't show it. So I right clicked -&gt; view source, after a moment found:
              </p>
              <p>
               meta name="Search.Update" content="Wed, 16 Mar 2011 20:28:55 GMT"
              </p>
              <p>
               Well, that's strange. Okay, maybe that is a CMS glitch? So I googled: "Operation Rescue" Peter Davis

               <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=70000%20member%20pedophile%20ring">

              <p>
               It was late August/November of 2016. It's so large that it's definitely worth mentioning as it could be connected to #PizzaGate, even if we don't have a direct connection right now. This is similar to you mentioning the Norwegian pedophile ring, but that doesn't have a direct connection to #PizzaGate just yet. Still, it's worth mentioning.

               Reading this article, I think this is actually a Belgium one, but it apparently ties into other countries as well, such as the Netherlands:

                It most certainly is worth mentioning, Please Don't let the mods response dissuade you from mentioning things like this in the future.

                , I'm wondering what your justification is for labeling this, "Not related to pizzagate"? I'm not saying that in a douchey tone... I'm genuinely wondering.

                Any posts that have to with pedorings being exposed within the last few years, are going to be connected to pizzagate. If they aren't connected, they are still relevant to the big picture...

               <p>
                That's like saying "How  is 9/11 related to the war in Iraq." .... Kinda, You know what I mean.

                Fuck Pizzagate... I don't mean the movement, I mean Fuck the name "pizzagate."   I can't believe we are still fucking using it... Pizzagate has nothing to do with pizza... Well not nothing, But its basically nothing compared to what everything else entails.

                 An Internet pedophile ring with up to 70,000 members — thought to be the world's largest —has been uncovered by police, a security official said Wednesday.
The European police agency Europol said in a statement that "Operation Rescue" had identified 670 suspects and that 230 abused children in 30 countries had been taken to safety. More children are expected to be found, Europol said.
