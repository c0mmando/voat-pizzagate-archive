            I know people are busy.  I can see that if you are only out early in the morning and late at night for work  OK.  But to see kids looking through a can for food.  Idk, that is a little odd.  Well, my new post about there being another woman held captive years ago is an eye opener for that area.

            Yes there's a chance they can be abused further in foster care, however the more immediate problem I see with this is how traumatic it must be for these kids to be separated from their siblings at a time when they need each other the most. I guarantee those older kids have been essentially the parents to the younger ones so this is going to be soooo hard on all of them. Imagine feeling like you have lost your child/ or lost your parent? These kids will likely have more of that type of bond/relationship than your average group of siblings. These kids need to be together!

              It's so very sad what they have been through- and sad still for what lies ahead for them. I don't see how they can go on from this and have a normal life. It's dispicable what those parents did to them

                 It is good to know we are all trying to keep on top of things, but then again it makes you realize how much there is.   I mean, the fact that we are all going at such a pace.  Just seems so much stuff coming out.  Maybe that is a good thing, in a crazy way,  that things are surfacing.  More so than we use to have.  It is at a break neck speed almost.

            I work in social services and this is not as bad as it sounds though I am not defending the system by any means.
           </p>
           <p>
            The adult children have gone to an assisted living center to assess what they need for further care. This is standard treatment and is not permanent. Once they establish the level of care each adult needs, they will address the case as a whole with the adults most likely moving to a special "group home" style setting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The children are in foster care but it is not regular foster care. Each state is different but all have levels of care. Where I am, the foster parents who would take in children who were in horrific situations are retired counselors and therapists. They only take in children who have seen the worst of the worst and need intensive care. This is done because not only is there abuse but there is also not proper mental progression and likely regression to toddler or even animalistic behaviors. Normal people cannot deal with this type of behavior and it is trying even for the most experienced people at times.
           </p>
           <p>
            The children are with people who can properly care for them and also help build the case against the parents. They will gently interview them without the children realizing it over several months and are able to make clinical notes which will then be admitted to court to be used in the case against the parents. The people caring for these children are not your average foster parents. They are the best of the best.
           </p>
           <p>
            This family will be properly looked after by professionals who have decades of experience. Everyone working their case is on their side. This is the exact opposite for other children who get placed with shit foster parents are are horribly mistreated. It makes me sick to think that every care is not treated the way this case is being treated. The difference I see in the level of care between criminal abuse cases where the child is taken away and placed with clinical foster parents and the cases where shit parents lose their kids and those kids get placed with whoever is disgusting. Truly horrific in the extremes regarding the care they receive.
           </p>
           <p>
            On another note, the fact that the parents ran a registered "school" out of their home is interesting. That would require inspections and audits where I am. I want to know of those are required in California and if they were done. Anyone know what religion/cult they belong to? I have seen a few cases in my career that remind me of this case and it may lead back to a cult like religion and leader.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, not defending foster or state care, it is an awful system full of abuse and horror stories. It is an extreme. Some of the most wonderful people I have ever met are foster parents and some people I would not trust with house plants are also foster parens. Complaints against them, even by officials are  not followed up on. There are not enough good parents and then one shit foster parent is one of many.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cases I have worked and know of that have numerous kids involved for the same family end up with the state purchasing homes and setting up a group home just for that one family to keep them together though the younger ones may be able to adapt better but will be kept together.

             Great input and I hope none of the closed minded trolls around here hassle you for your disclosure! They bitch and complain about the system being broken and needs changes, yet assume everyone working in the system is evil! We need good people in all of these systems so thank you!!!

             I hope your accounting of the type of care they will be receiving is correct.  I know there are some areas where there are things done as they should be and have caring people in charge, but as you know there have been many horror stories.  We hear then on the news, although they are are far and few now because of a block.  I am glad you are out there also for those in your area and care are very fortunate.  Thank You for your comments, we will be watching with open ears and eyes.

               Thank you.  You are doing the right thing, as hard as it is.  I worked volunteering at a school for years just doing the lunch time playground and I hated leaving.  The kids mostly just need someone that cares.  They don't ask for much.  How many kids came without socks and gloves in the winter time was sad.  I bought them used and washed them and always had some with me.  You never knew.

            This is so disgusting ! This unfortunately is the only place they can go . I'm hoping CPS has been overhauled and that there might be some decent people helping them . Everything about this story is a shocker ! Right down to the fathers haircut and the wedding videos ! And why in the heck didn't  the neighbors who noticed the kids were pale and skinny say something then? I'm sick of people just ignoring stuff!

             Me too.  If I saw this stuff going on, you can bet I would have said something to those parents.  Baloney they never saw them.  They never called police when they saw how emaciated those kids were on the front lawn playing, that time?  How about when they were digging for food in the cans?   I just think they must have the dumbest people living there.  OR, could there be others in the neighborhood that could be doing nefarious things?  Come to think of it, I saw something on the news last night that I had forgotten.  If I find it on the internet I will post it here first and then maybe do a post, idk.

              Normalcy bias. I'm not trying to excuse the neighbors or others who saw these kids and didn't act, but people living in a nice neighborhood get lulled into assuming that their neighbors are just normal families like their own. I know I tend to think that abuse and neglect goes on in " other neighborhoods" and I have worked with victims for years so i of all people should not become complacent and think his way, but I sometimes do.

             It never stops.  The turn over is disgusting.  They are disposable to the elite.  The elite use their own children to gain power and wealth, so why not the children of others.  My mind cannot even process this stuff anymore.  It just stops at a point now.  I can't even.  The people that are not speaking out about this should live a life of hell and then burn in it.

            That’s what I was afraid of too. The kids have already been put thru hell. Now they are torn apart. I can’t imagine how scared they must be. I hope nobody abuses them. 🙁

             I am afraid my thoughts are not of a peaceful life in their future.  I am so hoping I am wrong.  In the back of my mind from the very beginning, there has been a thought of more sinister things going on for those children.  There was too much money available for those parents.  They had a good life.  The children were there investment. That is why they had them insured.

             Yes.  This is my feeling too.  I have no proof, of course, but I can't help thinking the children were kept small to pass them off as minors even they were grown.  Pass them off as minors to the pedos that they sold them off to.  Now the Raping Continues.  I can't help but feeling there is so much more to this story.  Pedo Ring.

              you know... where are the Foundations in a situation like this?  Where are the bleeding hearts stepping forward to provide care and counseling and rehabilitation for these victims?  Suddenly, nothing but silence from these despicable charities on a national story?
             </p>
             <p>
              These victims are at very high risk of being hurt further.  Dividing them up is a tactic to turn them against each other and corrupt any potential testimony. These kids have seen the faces of their abusers.  Where is the video evidence I'm certain exists?
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a living nightmare.

               Yes, they also know as we do that there is Strength In Numbers.  By splitting them up they are weakening their strength.  Also they know that there are probably one or two that are stronger than others.  They will be separated accordingly.  I had hoped for a Fund that would buy them one big house where they could all be together.  The stronger ones could help the others and there could be a Caretaker for them.  Maybe even a trusted relative., if there is one.  This is So Sad.  It hurts me to the core.  The last I heard on the news was that the police are bringing in Cadaver Dogs to search for bodies, possibly of other children. Good God.

                 Well, I know it is horrid to think of, but at least they are investigating.  They could be ignoring it.  But we shall see what plays out.  Read the comment I just posted with a link about a woman that also was held captive in the same town.
