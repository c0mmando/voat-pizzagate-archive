            Check out this article on a transgender children documentary, criticising an expert for daring suggest that it's unhealthy to encourage children to live as the opposite gender if they want to.  I never saw the film myself by my mum watched it and said there are parents featured who actually support hormone therapy for little kids.

            I get the way one might view todays episode in that way. Please. Also try and see it from a different way. I watched it. I have also seen on other episodes within the last week, Dr. Phil be clear about the problems in foster care, take political action stressing the need for reform, address human traffikking, pedophilia elsewhere and more. It very much appears to me that he is offering a soft sell education. One that allows people to see, 'yes there are this types of pedophiles and this type of traffikkers. But this...this is different. And you will see why'. It's as if he is laying the groundwork for people to be receptive to more.
           </p>
           <p>
            One reason I point out that he is giving a soft sell...if you research the story he featured today, you read a lot about what his foster daughter claims he did. In her own words, on the show today, she was clear. She has no memory whatsoever of this man abusing her. She just knows someone did. There is no accusation against him in that. Dr. Phil could have been all over that. He did not try and discredit her because of that. I respected this in the presentation.

            Look, let me speak of this from a psychology degree perspective.  An attraction to children is often not something anyone can control, any more than can control their attraction to men or women.  If this attraction has any reduction for an individual to live a normal life, then it would fall under some measure of mental illness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, we as a society should not punish thought, what we punish are actions.  Yes it is weird and creepy for someone to have an attraction, whether they can help it or not, but we can hold the accountable for what they do.  This is where you cannot loop together all people with attraction towards children.  Of those attracted to children we have several different categories.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Other children, of the same age, and may have some degree of sexual contact
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Other children, of an older age, and may have some degree of sexual contact
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Adults, who find children attractive in addition to adults, but have no intention to touching a child and never have
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive exclusively, but have no intention of touching a child and never have
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive in addition to adults, and have touched a child
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive exclusively, and have touched a child
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive in addition to adults, have touched a child, and do not want to again if they can help it
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive exclusively, have touched a child, and do not want to do it again if they can help it
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive in addition to adults, have touched a child, and plan on doing it again repeatedly
            </li>
            <li>
             Adults, who find children attractive exclusively, have touched a child, and plan on doing so again repeatedly
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Between these categories you have a wide swath of people.  Some know it is wrong to touch a child because they know the damage it causes and do not have any urge to ever complete it, these individuals exist and would probably never talk about it given the taboo around it. Generally the considers anyone who has an admitted attraction to children to be an offender even if they haven't, given the high recidivism rates and no one wants to error on the side of caution given the stakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few more who still know its wrong, but can't help themselves to have the urge to do so.  These individuals often to seek help and at my time at the university there were many who were desperate for some type of therapy, but given that funding for study of this is extremely extremely impossible to get (like I think the only federal funding of it goes to small study of those under 18 and who haven't offended).  Though there had been some minor success with giving these individuals medication given to those with obsessive compulsive disorder, but for some the only answer is to do a voluntary chemical castration to shut down their sex drive completely.  These individuals pretty much have to destroy a part of their body in order to prevent themselves from hurting innocent children.  There are a few in this category who do end up offending and reoffending.
           </p>
           <p>
            After this you kind of jump up into a different category of people, those who either know its wrong and don't care, or think it's right in some strange justification that makes it sound like because they have an emotional attachment to the children it is ok.  In all, they have no remorse, they don't want to get help, they don't care about the lives they destroy or the horrors they inflict.  They are the producers of child porn and spread it all around for those like them, and those in the previous category who try to give into their desires through means that they don't directly hurt children.  Even though that those who make CP do hurt children.  Given succinctly these people in this group are evil, they are psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissistic, devoid of empathy, etc.  While the previous group are generally normal people who have a problem and don't want to be the way they are, this group embraces the evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is a group beyond the above, the one that is the foulest vile group of individuals to ever walk this earth.  Those are the ones we talk about in pizzagate, the ones who are like the last group, except while the last group are recreational users, these are your hardcore villainous scum suckers who create a master plan to abuse millions of children, take them all over the world, bring them to other people, use them for blackmail and power, torture them, sacrifice them to some vision of a deity, and eat them.  Who use all measure of power to satiate their lust for the innocent and the power the above gives them.  They don't just enjoy fucking and abusing children, they love the power that comes with getting away with it, by using it in front the world and laughing how you are untouchable.  How you can corrupt and control anyone in your path, and if they get in your way they can die beneath this massive wheel you have constructed.  The rape and torture of children become second nature and a thing of no consequence.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the evil we face in pizzagate, the absolute horror that is so unbelievable most don't even think it could be true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's be real, until society decides that is worthwhile to study why people have an attraction to youth, there will always be those who are attracted to children, and those who abuse them.  Whether it is a gene, a matter of upbringing, or some combination of both (most likely) we will never understand it, nor be able to stop it and there will always be new people born.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, having compassion, logos, and understanding for some groups afflicted with this disease does in no way detract from the horror of the evils perpetrated by other groups who commit these heinous acts.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the end, are they trying to "normalize pedophilia"?  I don't know, I wouldn't put it past them, but you are never going to lose your shock or disgust in what's going on, don't let them make you conflate the groups above and say they are the same, don't let them con you or anyone else to think what is going on in pizzagate are just a group of poor people who can't help themselves because its a fucking lie.  What they do is far beyond "I have an attraction to kids and I can't help myself".  They know exactly what evils they are doing and do it with glee.
           </p>
           <p>
            And never lose your hatred for villainous and heinous evil commit on the innocent and corrupting the world with it.  This is why we are here, this is what we are trying to stop.

             Don't get lost in the academics of it either.  Most of us are quite clear about why we are here.  It's to shine a light on that final group you described and take them down.  We have never had a moment like this in history.  Focus and act speedily...time is of the essence.

            Unfortunately, in this case I side with the pedophile, he seemed very genuine, and the girl seemed dishonest, or at least she didn't appear to completely believe what she was saying.  I hate the concept of a virtual pedophile because it's a misnomer.  There is nothing virtuous about having an attractions to children whether you act on it or not.

             He's probably protected and an "actor"
He may actually be a Pedi but his powerful buddies picked him to be the one to come out and try to push the agenda because they will protect him.

            I've never watched his show but often pick up the ending and there's something really REALLY creepy about Dr Phil. When the show's finished he's always joined by his teeny tiny wife who's dressed like a little girl. He leads her off by the hand with her trotting along looking up adoringly at him. 
Blech.

            So are you wondering what could be next on the normalization menu after pedophilia? One would thing that would be the last horizon they would cross but no, its just a stone on the way to the real goal. Another thing they are trying to normalize which hasn't gotten too much traction lately is children don't belong to the parents.
You see, pedophilia is pretty low down but by itself pedophilia does not hurt anyone. At least that is the idea they are pushing and that is why they may get away with it. Because being something is not infringing on another person so people will grit their teeth and bear it.
After that they will want to get all children away from parents so they can have their pick of every and any child they want. That is the bigger picture.

              As the ultimate private institution, the family is a stubborn obstacle to the great collective effort. Insofar as people invest in their own families, they’re holding out on the state and unacceptably privileging their own kids over the children of others.

             Gee, there's that word privilege again.

            <p>
             What's backwards is the elites themselves seem to hold the idea of family/bloodline sacred. They keep royalty within the family and sons and daughters matter a whole lot. But the family of everyone else doesn't matter apparently.

              Well the fucked reality is people believe this. Why and how do the elites get people to do this? I have no idea. But it works. We are gonna have to go to bloody war to prevent insane people from killing us all with them to serve our oppressors.
