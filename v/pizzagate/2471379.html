<p>From March 2017,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/30/paul-dacre-theresa-may-private-dinner-daily-mail-editor-no-10">Theresa May held a private dinner for Daily Mail editor at No. 10</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theresa May hosted a private dinner for the Daily Mail editor, Paul Dacre, at 10 Downing Street last year, the government has disclosed. Dacre was the only media figure to receive hospitality from the new prime minister in the first six months she was in post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various elements within that article caught my eye including the concluding paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prime minister was given a raft of gifts held by the department, but purchased two pieces that she wished to keep in line with the ministerial code: a <strong>£225</strong> piece of clothing from Lady Jubie Wigan and a <strong>£344</strong> piece of jewellery from Nadja Swarovski. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Odd details don\'t you think?  Seemed completely out of place within that article. Who cares?  But I\'m now sadly aware that our press speaks in code... so I played a little game with those numbers:  225 = 9  and 344 = 11. That\'s <strong>9/11</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, who is Lady Jubie Wigan?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jubie and her husband <strong>Charlie, a consultant at PR firm Bell Pottinger</strong>, are raising Aliena and their son Caius, one, in a chocolate-box village in the Cotswolds.  </p>
<p>Little did she know these skills were soon to be put to a very different use: in November, she raised over £200,000 – and put type 1 diabetes firmly on the map – with a gala dinner for 310 people at London’s One Mayfair venue, attended by Pippa Middleton, Julian Fellowes and <strong>Home Secretary Theresa May</strong>, who also suffers from the condition, plus a who’s who of London society.  </p>

                 Yes and Jimmy has links with Newcastle.  That's where Alefantis went to spread his 'ping pong' culture..

                        consultation on court sittings that solicitors in Newcastle and the north-east feared could spell the end of the city’s magistrates’ court has been rubber stamped by the government, despite opposition from practitioners and the local law society.

                        The MoJ sent a consultation document to judges, solicitors’ firms and magistrates earlier this year, which proposed a shake-up of six magistrates’ courts across the north-east. The affected courts are: Newcastle, North Tyneside, Northumberland, South Tyneside, Gateshead, and Sunderland Magistrates’ Courts.

                        Newcastle upon Tyne Law Society and local solicitors warned that the proposals would impede access to justice and result in the eventual closure of Newcastle’s Magistrates’ Court.

             In a similar vein one Julian Fellowes, himself the son of a senior British diplomat, wrote: ‘Thoroughly revolted as I am by the Paedophiliac Society with all its professed aims, I feel I cannot be alone this week in being almost as disgusted by the spectacle of a Tory MP dangling his victim over the slavering jaws of the media.

            </p>
            <p>
             ‘It is particularly depressing that Salem-like justice should be meted out by a Conservative Party (MP) . . .  their one faintly convincing battle cry has always been the importance of championing the rights of the individual against the so-called good of the faceless, heartless state.’

             Why Downton Abbey creater Julian Fellowes ignored the rumours over Harvey Weinstein

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has broken his silence about disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, with whom he worked on his ITV drama, Doctor Thorne.
            </p>
            <p>
             Speaking for the first time since the Hollywood producer was accused of sexual harassment last year, Lord Fellowes admits he deliberately overlooked rumours about Weinstein's behaviour because he wanted his show to be successful.
            </p>
            <p>
             'Did I know what was going on? I knew the rumours and I think the reality exceeded the rumours — if what everyone's saying happened, happened,' says Fellowes.

              By the time of his retirement from ‘the Diplomatic’, the Stowe and Oxford-educated former Rifle Brigade officer had been a Home and Foreign Office mandarin, working closely with the intelligence services at the height of the Cold War: it has even been suggested he was a senior figure in MI6.
