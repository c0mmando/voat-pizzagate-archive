            - You may have noticed, I think this sub has great value. One big illustration of how tough it is to get these people. So much manpower, time, effort... decent human beings required to watch this horror for hours on end. Not to mention, the expense, to save this one little boy, must have been staggering. Thanks for posting, this deserves many more upvoats.

             Thank you rooting4redpillers. I was actually surprised when I searched voat/pg not to find a previous submission. It was a difficult to watch the "safe" version of their actions with this little boy.  I can only imagine how hardened an officer has to become to watch the videos to locate these children.  It would be nice if their assets could be seized to repay every dime spent to find and prosecute them.

              I'm surprised too. And surprised this story received so little publicity everywhere. The scant reporting on this case began only six years ago, and was still making news, less than three years ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              This video version you posted is perfect, without any overly-provocative images, and zero breathlessly-dramatic language. Just the facts, and excellent organization of a complex story. A++
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding those
              <strong>
               <em>
                assets
               </em>
              </strong>
              ... My second linked article says,
              <em>
               Mark J. Newton, 42, was sentenced to 40 years in prison, and was ordered to pay
              </em>
              <strong>
               <em>
                $400,000 in restitution to the child.
               </em>
              </strong>
              Because Newton is "Adam's" legally (?) adoptive "father" (one of two fathers), I have so many questions about THAT. And questions about what ever happened to ALL of the rest of the criminals who were implicated/arrested because of THIS case. The stories online die out after 2014. Maybe I gave up too quickly, but I've been looking for these things in all my spare moments today.
             </p>
             <p>
              This story doesn't have a nearly-satisfactory ending. Those two
              <em>
               "SUPERSTARS"
              </em>
              of the "Man-Boy-Rape-Community" were sentenced to, and serving, 30 and 40 years. The news reports that I found, report a few additional related convictions. But, there were MANY other people implicated, and the online info about them is scattered and incomplete.
             </p>
             <p>
              This whole story could use a compilation, with a CURRENT status update for every single one of these proven child molesters - the ones in prison, the ones with trials pending, and the ones who still walk around in the world. With Charles Manson-celebrity-style, ongoing attention. Since I found
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              , I've been watching more on the VICE channel. I'd love to see VICE make an episode about THIS story you've brought to us - making it contemporary by relating it to the current pizzagate phenomenon, and specifically mentioning THIS extraordinary CITIZEN investigation HERE, on VOAT.

Pepper first heard about the child pornography charges against Powell in 2011. Powell was officially charged in 2012. "For about a year and a half, this case was completely under the radar for the entire country. ... what is even more surprising is that not even the attorneys who knew Powell best had any idea what was going on. ... Powell and the two other men used a high definition camera to video record the sexual acts. "This man was literally a criminal mastermind," said Pepper.

               Very well said and so true. I think we all need that positive reinforcement, thank you. 
Regarding the video,  thankfully there were family members to step in and care for the little boy. 
I still maintain this is exactly what JA is doing with his "goddaughter". I sincerely hope I am wrong for that little girl's sake.
