You must try and tie in Pizzagate, I will have to delete it if you cant. Also, you need some more information, try doing a "Discuss" post which allows you to present more info. Thanks!

            Bill Binney is not technically qualified to determine this.  He retired from the NSA 16 years ago.  His firm is not a computer forensics firm. In short, if this ever was his specialty, he has been away from the game a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is part of the group VIPS that put out an open letter on the DNC emails, but Binney did not do the analysis. and they relied on other people.  He is quite clear in the video that he is relying on somebody's else work.
           </p>
           <p>
            That someone else is ignoring a lot of other possibilities.   One giant assumption he makes in the date on the files is the date they were taking from the DNC.  Rather than simply the last date they were copied.  For example if the hacker was passing off the documents to someone else, it would much safer to do this by USB than over the internet.  So that date could months after the original hack. So the last modified date on the files can absolutely not be used to determine the date of the hack, just the last time they were transferred and you can also monkey with dates and metadata if you know how.
           </p>
           <p>
            The date the guy is using is actually unlikely to be the date of the hack.  Why?   Remember the DNC was just one of many, many, targets of professional hacking team.  The hackers established a DCLeaks.com domain in April and started tweeting in June.
           </p>
           <p>
            The DNC already had forensic investigators monitoring their computer system for months and months after determining they were hacked.  Their determination that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear or the FSB and GRU were in the DNC's system was backed up by other independent firms and later by the US Intel Community.  This public notice was week before this USB date.  So the hacking happened way earlier than July 2016.  There is a ton of evidence on this hacking campaign which went way beyond the DNC and way beyond Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            OH, and this claim that these speeds can only mean USB transfer only applies to consumer internet.  Not to commercial internet which is easily fast enough to accomplish this, even going halfway around the world.
