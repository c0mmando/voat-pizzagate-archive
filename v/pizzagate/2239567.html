            I perceived Hollywood's sexism 2B so pervasive as to not even be noticed-it was class based discrimination, with racial undertones based in anti-semitic sado-spiritual necroPedoism.
           </p>
           <p>
            She lost me with 'anti-semitic'.  Who the Fuck runs Hollywood?

            I can almost guarantee either: Roseanne has an agenda to launch the 10th return season of her show or....this is her boyfriend Johnny 'speaking'.
Roseanne is a practicing (kinda) Jew with two gay siblings and hundreds of gay, tranny friends. So if she wants people to remotely think she is conservative then people deserve to be treated as imbeciles.
I'm not saying she doesn't support Trump (as I do) but that woman always has a self-serving agenda (like when she ran for POTUS).
Not the most sincere person in Hollywood. Just sayin'......

            Same ol nonsense as last year. The bottom of the page list unrelated unproven apeasement arrest for traficking as if Trump has been taking them down. A Hollywood asset sells us that Trump is fighting them and things are about to change. The site looks bare bones with little facts or any good source material.

            Since when is Roseanne Barr a "conservative" ... or former "progressive" ... ???
           </p>
           <p>
            Child Trafficking is going to be one of the biggest to crack -- way beyond the nation
coming to terms with even organized pedophilia.  Our military is allegedly involved,
which means of course some part of our government, as well.
            <br/>
            All of it probably parallels drug trafficking and add in organ trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I notice that as banking regulations on consumers rise, money laundering
by our US banks and offshore accounts by the wealthy rise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same with corruption of our government -- as the right wing rises so does crime 
of every nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wasn't Trump annoyed enough with Jeff Sessions not so long ago that it
looked like there might be a serious split between them?
           </p>
           <p>
            What Roseanne is talking about is what a sane person would do with knowledge
of pedophilia and child trafficking.  All signs point to the reality that Trump isn't sane.
