<p>HALFMOON — The FBI raided the Saratoga County residence of NXIVM Corp. co-founder Nancy Salzman on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The hours-long search of Salzman\'s single-family residence on Oregon Trail in Halfmoon was taking place a day after Keith Raniere, the leader and a co-founder of the secretive Colonie-based organization, was arrested in Mexico on charges of sex trafficking and forced labor. He was sought by the FBI based on a federal criminal complaint filed the U.S. attorney\'s office in Brooklyn, which opened an investigation of Raniere\'s organization last fall.</p>
<p>Salzman has been a powerful figure in the organization since it was set up more than two decades ago.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed recently in connection with an ongoing federal grand jury investigation the Eastern District of New York, alleges that Raniere, known as &quot;The Vanguard,&quot; took part in forming a secretive group within NXIVM that coerced women into joining a slave-master club. The women were also branded on their lower abdomens with a design that included the initials of Raniere and Allison Mack, an actress and NXIVM associate who is referred to in the complaint as an unnamed co-conspirator.</p>

<p>As for Salzman\'s membership in <s>The Hellfire Club </s>... The Clinton Initiatives, here\'s another article from 2007. It was long before pizzagate and when Tony and John Pedosta were hammering pizza for about an hour and leaving map-related hankies for real estate agents to find. </p>

<p>A purported pyramid-scheme operator who was run out of Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor has reinvented himself as the head of an upstate group accused of being a “cult” – and his devotees have pumped thousands into Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential run.</p>
<p>Executives and top associates of the Albany-based NXIVM group – along with their family members – donated $29,900 to Clinton’s presidential campaign, according to federal records.</p>
<p>On March 14 and April 13, records show, more than a dozen contributions poured into Clinton’s coffers from NXIVM, an executive and group-awareness training organization led by Brooklyn-born Keith Raniere, 47. Most were from first-time political donors, each giving the $2,300 maximum…three of the March and April Clinton pledges came from Raniere’s most high-profile followers: Seagram heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman, and Pamela Cafritz, daughter of D.C. A-listers Buffy and Bill Cafritz. Cafritz shares a condo with Raniere.</p>
<p>The Bronfman sisters are also deeply involved with NXIVM and, according to a 2003 article in Forbes magazine, have loaned millions to the group and provided use of their jet. Their father, Edgar Bronfman Sr., once took NXIVM classes but soon severed ties, telling Forbes, “It’s a cult.” </p>
<pre><code>Hillary isn’t the only Clinton NXIVM officials are attracted to.
</code></pre>

<p>At least three of them – group President Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters – are members of Bill’s charitable organization, the Clinton Global Initiative. Membership is by invitation only and requires at least a $15,000 donation per person for one year. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s hilarious, but the following was taken from the NXIVM\'s website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>NXIVM is a new ethical understanding that allows us to build an internal civilization and have it manifest in the external world. It allows us to explore our most fundamental nature and to begin to redirect our power of creation, a power that we all possess in a very human sense. It is a place where humanity can rise to its noble possibility.</p>

            Research question: Why went Sara Bronfman to Libya in the first place (trip where she met her future husband)?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Sara Bronfman first became involved in aiding Libya after traveling as a delegate with the Independent Libya Foundation in November 2011, during the Arab Spring and after the death of Muammar Gaddafi.
            </p>
            <p>
             The delegation was headed by president and founder Basit Iglet and consisted of multiple humanitarian experts, including Adam Hock and Joseph Hagin. They toured post-Gaddafi Libya and presented their "multi-phase re-integration program," which was accepted by the local authorities of Benghazi, who were appointed by the Libyan National Transitional Council.

             That "independent" deep state "humanitarian" work in Libya, is a very explicit military intelligence connection to the cult. Also, with so many very prominent and influential women as "slaves" to the cult, one wonders whether its activities included yet another "compromise and control ring". Along the lines of Jeffrey Epstein's operation, or the Clinton Foundation, or Jimmy Savile's activities. Again, all suggestive of military intelligence, including the very slick cult mind control techniques.

             I am pretty sure we covered that on this channel. When Qgaddafi left for Zimbabwe on his way to destinations guessed, they set up a fortress in Tripoli much like the one exposed in South America recently. This was manned by Mossad and took children. Same operation, different country. They also killed dissidents and journalists who told the truth.  It was Gaddafi who kicked out the fake jews in 1969 even though he was reportedly tribe by his mothers birthright.

             And we know the charges being made about the collusion between ex-French president and Skankles in ridding Libya of Gaddafi. And there's Benghazi and the set-up for the tragedy to follow.

              Not a good week for Hillary, especially since the newsoutlets will point out that she received money from the Bronfmans for her campaign and that the Bronfmans and Salzman were members of CGI.

               Well, the evidence continues to pile up against her.

               You know, I had a big question though. Not about Skankles, but about this cult sex ring. What was the point? That's what's missing here. Think about it, they tortured, molested, and branded girls, but where's the story about the agenda/purpose behind doing this? Just for Ranieir's pleasure? Doubtful.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you notice in one of the links, it says that these slave members needed to upload video or whatever to the server. Upload what? Were these girls programmed to seduce and collect blackmail on politicians? Or corporate leaders? Were they gather information? I mean, come on ... they had to be being used for something because this was a huge, well-connected operation.
              </p>
              <p>
               It occurred to me last night before I fell asleep and I'll ask it here .... what were these girls doing?

            This should be wayyy more up voted...I have a theory that...just like on Reddit, people sit on new posts to down vote them and it puts some kind of algorithm whammy on the posts...and all it takes is one. In a few days this will be just another post that no one will see unless they go searching for the right terms. :-(

             Thanks and I think it's due to the title. It reflects the major story the first link contained and not what I only suspected was a huge lead. Now that think-, Vindicator, DarkKnight are digging in, that hunch turned out to be true. I would have included the new direction in the title had I known. I sort of had a feeling to make a new thread that centered on the new evidence so members won't miss what's tucked inside the Salzman story because it leads to much bigger fish to fry.

              Maybe make a summary post in a couple of days with the new info? Also someone suggested to do a summary post 'for normies' on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/news">
               v/news

               v/politics
              </a>
              . Maybe the wnd.com article someone linked (as a link post today) would be good starter for that. Has major info, but the rape of minors allegations are missing.

               Just coincidentally, The Kenyan launched a ten-year project studying the brain. Wanted to aid in the development of artificial intelligence.

                Obama Seeking to Boost Study of Human Brain
               </p>
               <p>
                he Obama administration is planning a decade-long scientific effort to examine the workings of the human brain and build a comprehensive map of its activity, seeking to do for the brain what the Human Genome Project did for genetics.
               </p>
               <p>
                The project, which the administration has been looking to unveil as early as March, will include federal agencies, private foundations and teams of neuroscientists and nanoscientists in a concerted effort to advance the knowledge of the brain’s billions of neurons and gain greater insights into perception, actions and, ultimately, consciousness.
               </p>
               <p>
                Scientists with the highest hopes for the project also see it as a way to develop the technology essential to understanding diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, as well as to find new therapies for a variety of mental illnesses.
               </p>
               <p>
                Moreover, the project holds the potential of paving the way for advances in artificial intelligence.
               </p>
               <p>
                The project, which could ultimately cost billions of dollars, is expected to be part of the president’s budget proposal next month. And, four scientists and representatives of research institutions said they had participated in planning for what is being called the Brain Activity Map project.
               </p>
               <p>
                The details are not final, and it is not clear how much federal money would be proposed or approved for the project in a time of fiscal constraint or how far the research would be able to get without significant federal financing.

             I never knew what to think about the Dalai Lama. I had misgivings, but would hate to criticize a religious leader that was actually trying to help people attain peace of mind. There were all these doubts about him doing that, though. And here's why.

               A new review of 65 studies about Facebook and mental health suggests that the platform is linked to negative effects on areas of mental well-being including Facebook addiction, depression, anxiety, body image and disordered eating and even alcohol use.
              </p>

               Facebook has “1.13 billion people actively using the service daily,” researchers Rachel L. Frost, and Debra J. Rickwood, PhD, from the University of Canberra, Australia write in their review, published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior...

              <p>
               While the findings are complicated and show that more research needs to be done, the authors told me via email that they were surprised about “the extent of mental health problems associated with Facebook use.”

                 So, basically, it's when our ego is leveled we become human. I'd agree.

                 FB, Microsoft, and Amazon are from the same litter. I changed the quote from Assange a bit because it fits. They never were what they purported to be. They served a function, but the bigger function was hidden. Same with Google.

                 Until someone finds out and uncovers where the money came from to birth these entities, we'll remain in the dark as to the origins. Someone with very deep pockets was behind Bezos -- someone that didn't mind losing millions and millions each year until they starved out competition. So who was this person Bezos parternered with?

            <p>
             The chief fundraiser and senior adviser to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who played a critical role in the rise to power of the charismatic politician, was involved in the movement of millions of dollars to offshore havens, the Paradise Papers reveal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stephen Bronfman, heir to the Seagram fortune, who was instrumental in Trudeau’s successful bid for the leadership of the Canadian Liberal party in 2013 and the premiership two years later, engaged through his family investment business in a complex web of entities in the US, Israel and the Cayman Islands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Multimillion-dollar cashflows between the three jurisdictions might legally have avoided taxes in the US, Canada and Israel.

            Sara Bronfman is married to a Libyan businessman and aspiring politician, who opposed Ghaddafi:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Igtet said he considers himself a devout Muslim, and he’s married to a Jewish woman, Sara Bronfman, a daughter of wealthy liquor magnate Edgar Bronfman.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mezran said having an American wife is another liability for Igtet’s political career. For now, Sara said she’ll remain in New York to care for their infant daughter, Safia, but supports her husband’s work in Libya.
            </p>
            <p>
             Igtet believes he’s got the technocratic prowess to transform his country of six million people from the brink of civil war into the crown jewel of northern Africa. But skeptics say his status as a longtime expatriate and his lack of national security experience leave him ill-prepared to grasp control of deteriorating relations among warring rebel factions, police and the army.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Benghazi native, Igtet fled the country as a political exile, finding refuge in Switzerland, where he became a successful businessman. He recently enlisted the law firm of foreign policy heavyweight former Sen. Joe Lieberman in a deal likely to broker him meetings with Obama administration officials and members of Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I have been part of this revolution from day one,” Igtet said.

             <em>
              The Wikipedia article gives an overview about her work in Libya:
             </em>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Sara Bronfman first became involved in aiding Libya after traveling as a delegate with the Independent Libya Foundation in November 2011, during the Arab Spring and after the death of Muammar Gaddafi.
             </p>
             <p>
              The delegation was headed by president and founder Basit Iglet and consisted of multiple humanitarian experts, including Adam Hock and Joseph Hagin. They toured post-Gaddafi Libya and presented their "multi-phase re-integration program," which was accepted by the local authorities of Benghazi, who were appointed by the Libyan National Transitional Council.
             </p>
             <p>
              She has been involved with the U.S.-Libya Chamber of Commerce since its founding in November 2011 with the purpose of developing viable economic links between American and Libyan enterprises.
             </p>
             <p>
              The chamber announced that Sara, who was then a member on the board, would be the new president after the conclusion of a vote conducted by the organizations board members on February 20, 2012.
             </p>
             <p>
              The announcement occurred after Adam Hock resigned as president and board member to pursue private ventures within the country. In a press release Sara stated "as I am able to devote my efforts to the development of the Chamber to support bilateral trade between Libya and the United States, it is a privilege to take on this significant role as the President of the US-Libya Chamber of Commerce."
             </p>
             <p>
              In an interview with the National Journal, Bronfman stated that the situation in Libya provides an opportunity for the State Department to change their tactics, and "rather than enforcing our ways on them, we need to understand their ways, learn from them and discover which of our country’s many strengths we can (use to) best support them."
             </p>
             <p>
              Sara Bronfman is also involved with the Canada-Libya Chamber of Commerce, which was founded on March 12, 2012. Bronfman and fiance Basit Igtet are the inaugural president and chairman of the board respectively. Positioned to provide help and advice to the people of Libya, the Chamber of Commerce discourage continued business with groups such as SNC-Lavalin, who allegedly did business with the Gadaffi regime. The group is one of several working to restore the economy in the region.

               While the Wikipedia article was a bit tame, the Frank Report has all the goodies about Sara Bronfman's husband:
              </em>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <strong>
                One of Igtet’s top backers though is John McCain
               </strong>
               – a man who has been photographed shaking hands with almost every extremist in Libya and who was a major figure in the plot of the invasion and destruction of the country in 2011.
              </p>
              <p>
               Igtet denies he is an Islamist – yet he has courted support from some of the most extreme Islamist figures. He has met with Ahmed Abu Khattala – charged with the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya that killed four Americans – including its ambassador, the gunrunning Christopher Stevens.
              </p>
              <p>
               Igtet has known a senior Libyan Muslim Brotherhood leader, Emad Elbannani – since they both lived as businessmen in Switzerland. The latter introduced Igtet to Islamist politician Rachid Ghannouchi – leader of Tunisia’s controversial Ennahda party.
              </p>
              <p>
               Tellingly, Igtet is also an oilman – he founded an oil and gas exploration entity called Athal Energy in 2011.
               <strong>
                No coincidence that 2011 was also the year of Nato’s war on Libya and it is clear who Igtet intends to give the oil profits of Libya to – and it will not be the Libyan people.
               </strong>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               Of course, all info needs to be checked. (The article is clearly biased.) Here's what it says about Bronfman's husband and John McCain:
              </em>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The Bronfman family was the king behind the throne of the organised crime empire in Arizona – a crime empire that spawned the political career of John McCain.
              </p>
              <p>
               A man named Jim Hensley was well known in mob circles as a gangster in Arizona and was exposed in the seventies – by a man who was then killed in a car bombing in 1976. Hensley’s daughter married John McCain and the Hensley family was a key sponsor of McCain’s political career. Like the Bronfmans, Hensley was also 
involved with alcohol – as owner of the biggest beer distributor in Arizona. But what the media never mention is that the Hensley gangster fortune that backsMcCain is, in fact, a branch of the same bootlegging and racketeeringfortune of the Bronfman dynasty of Canada… [This is a bit unclear.]

             NXIVM has a strong presence in Central America, and Clare Bronfman has testified that about one-third of the corporation is in Mexico.

            It's getting better and better....

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Clare W. Bronfman, an heiress of the Seagram Company business empire, allegedly implanted a "key logger" virus on the computer of her late father,
             <strong>
              Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., so officials with the NXIVM corporation could secretly monitor his emails, including his exchanges with world leaders and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to court records.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Last month, the Times Union reported that Keeffe, in emails attributed to her, claimed top officials in NXIVM paid a Canadian investigative firm to sift the financial records of six federal judges and U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Keeffe, NXIVM officials also used the Canadian firm to obtain financial information on Edgar Bronfman and other officials with the Jewish World Congress, which Bronfman headed from 1981 to 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to federal court records, in March 2009, the Canadian investigative firm, Canaprobe Group, sent an invoice to Clare Bronfman for $10,000 for "banking sweep services" of Rick A. Ross, who said he is a "recognized expert" in cults and who is being sued by NXIVM in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Keeffe said she processed the Canaprobe invoices and that the company was paid "well over a million dollars."
            </p>
            <p>
             Keeffe, in the telephone conversation attributed to her, claimed that Clare Bronfman and Pamela A. Nichols, who is a shareholder with the Albany law firm O'Connell &amp; Aronowitz and one of NXIVM's attorneys, were involved with the Canaprobe transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keeffe claimed that Raniere was involved in the plan and taught a young woman who was a Mexican immigrant and NXIVM member "to be a hacker."
            </p>
            <p>
             [the] woman "then spent like a year reading
             <strong>
              all of Edgar Bronfman's emails, including emails with Hillary Clinton
             </strong>
             and involving world leaders with the World Jewish Congress,
             <strong>
              then reporting on the contents to Keith and to Clare
             </strong>
             ," Keeffe said. She did not provide any details in the telephone call about what sort of information was allegedly gleaned from Edgar Bronfman's emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Times Union could not independently verify the computer-hacking allegations.
            </p>
            <p>
             A person who was close to Edgar Bronfman, but did not want to be identified for this story,
             <strong>
              said it's very likely that Clinton and Edgar Bronfman communicated through email. They became friends after meeting in the late 1990s
             </strong>
             when Bill Clinton was president, the person said, and Hillary Clinton supported Bronfman's successful efforts with the World Jewish Congress to get Swiss banks to pay billions of dollars in restitution to relatives of Holocaust victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Bronfman, who was 84 when he died, was a financial supporter of Hillary Clinton's candidacies, including her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign. Clinton sat next to Bronfman at his 75th birthday celebration at Seagram Company headquarters in New York City in 2004. In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded Bronfman a U.S. Medal of Freedom.

              Yes, they could, but I doubt that they will.....but still, look at all these people who will likely get charged.....Bronfman is still on the run in Mexico, but hopefully they will get her.

              Keith Raniere is accused of raping girls as young as 12
             </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Raniere is also alleged to have forced women attending one of his classes to wear fake cow udders over their breasts while people called them "derogatory names", put women in cages as punishments...
            </p>
            <p>
             Raniere...is accused of having a "decades' long history of abusing women and girls" - including "repeated sexual encounters with multiple teenage girls" as young as 12, according to the document.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I would estimate that more than a thousand people have deeply hurt by him - and about 200 women have been abused physically, sexually, coerced, black mailed, hypnotized and brainwashed on a basis that was so severe it affected adversely the rest of their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The authorities are asking that bail be denied and Raniere could face his whole life behind bars - he may never see freedom again and in my opinion this is absolutely deserved."
            </p>
            <p>
             Raniere is due to appear at court in Texas on Tuesday on charges of sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to commit forced labour. Authorities have requested that bail be denied as he is considered a flight risk and a danger to the community.

             The thing is that this story hit the news in 2007. The NYT actually even reported on it ... must have been the last time they did a real story. And nothing was done until now?

             This operation would have never been shut down if it weren't for our POTUS getting elected. Skankles wouldn't have touched this with a ten-foot pole. And the thing is it's got that ''global'' aspect with fake visas and illegal aliens taking key positions. And Salzman and Bronfman connecting themselves to The Clintons is troublesome and not surprising.

              Bronfman is a variation of the Bauer surname like Newbauer, Bower, Burr, ect. Yehuda Bauer tells you a little more about the origins of this family of many names. Andrew Burr was arguably involved with the the formation of the Republican - Democratic party along with George Clinton and others. I am talking 1790 on, here.

              You obviously missed the front page Times story on this cult six months ago:

               Inside a Secretive Group Where Women Are Branded.
              </em>
              It was mentioned here on VOAT.

              What a ridiculous statement.  So you not only missed the fact that the NY Times did an article on this cult six months ago, but you missed the fact that this article is what caused the cult leader to flee to Mexico and got the US attorney in Brooklyn to start investigating.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               A number of women came forward for an investigation published in the New York Times newspaper in October, which led to the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn opening an investigation into the group.

              This is the same NY Times article mentioned in Keith Ranieres arrest warrant.
             </p>
             <p>
              This story of branding of women was not known until 2017.  It was not known in 2007.  In fact the "sorority" where this went on was a secret within the group.    The first accusations of branding outside the group were made in June 2017 on the blog of a critic of the group.  This is probably where the NY Times learned of it.

               Great idea. The thing is that Clare Bronfman was used as an idiot attack dog using her billions to persecute those who left. I'm thinking those that left might be a good source of those pics. Bronfman had the nerve to sue someone on 3/24/18. I have to post a cached link. A lot of these articles about the operation are disabled, but that's probably a coincidence:
              </p>
              <blockquote>

                 https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7Mu1U3-C9QkJ:https://artvoice.com/2017/08/17/clare-bronfman-files-criminal-complaint-against-sarah-edmondson-with-vancouver-pd/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us
                </a>
                Multiple sources tell Frank Report that Clare Bronfman filed a criminal complaint against Sarah Edmondson for “theft, fraud and mischief” with the Vancouver Police Department.
               </p>
               <p>
                No arrests have been made.
               </p>
               <p>
                Miss Bronfman’s complaint is on behalf of Executive Success Programs Inc. [ESP], a cult-like group that is headquartered near Albany, New York.  Miss Bronfman, 38, is Vice President of Operations for ESP – and, in that capacity, she oversees and manages all of the company’s  litigation.
               </p>
               <p>
                ESP was founded by Keith Raniere, who prefers to be called “Vanguard” by his followers. The company operates as a multi-level marketing company that sells high intensity, high demand, life coaching and behavioral modification seminars known as Intensives. ESP’s Intensives cost from $2,100 to $10,000; students are encouraged to take several Intensives per year.
               </p>
               <p>
                In her complaint, Miss Bronfman alleges more than 125 students in Vancouver left ESP because of Miss Edmondson’s “mischievous and fraudulent” activities.
               </p>
               <p>
                Miss Edmondson, 40, in addition to being a popular Vancouver actress and voice talent, was an independent contractor who provided training in Vancouver for students of ESP. She recently stopped teaching ESP Intensives – and the storefront on Georgia Street in downtown Vancouver where she taught was then closed.
               </p>
               <p>
                The exodus of Vancouver students coincides with revelations, first reported on Frank Report on June 5, of a secret women’s group called DOS [Dominant Over Submissive] whose membership is comprised of ESP students.
               </p>
               <p>
                Reportedly more than 400 students left ESP during the last few months, thereby causing the company to close its training centers in Los Angeles and San Francisco in addition to the one in Vancouver.
               </p>
               <p>
                DOS is one of several multi-level marketing companies founded by Mr. Raniere.
               </p>
               <p>
                Clare Bronfman, daughter of the late billionaire, Edgar Bronfman Sr, and one of the heirs of the Seagram Liquor fortune, funds DOS operations and describes Mr. Raniere as her “mentor’”
               </p>
               <p>
                According to former members, DOS members are subjected to 24-hour/7-days-a-week monitoring of diet, sleep, travel, hygiene, exercise, study and sex life by a coach whom they call “Master” (DOS students are called “slaves”). Members pledge to keep DOS practices a secret.
               </p>
               <p>
                To ensure secrecy, DOS women are required to upload “collateral” to a cloud account that is controlled by Miss Bronfman (She also heads the Raniere-group’s IT department).
               </p>
               <p>
                Collateral consists of graphic nude photographs and videos of DOS women, as well as confessions to criminal, adulterous, or scandalous activities – and, in some cases, the assignment of assets to the Raniere-controlled organization.
               </p>
               <p>
                When sufficient collateral is held, a DOS “slave” is branded with a white-hot cauterizing iron with Mr. Raniere’s initials on her pubic region. Women are told that their collateral will be released to the general public if they ever reveal the existence of DOS or its practices.
               </p>
               <p>
                What sparked the criminal complaint was that Miss Edmondson was reportedly disgusted by DOS practices of blackmail and human branding. When she left, other students bolted from the company.

                Vancouver Police are expected to investigate the matter thoroughly before making any arrests and are likely to interview students who left ESP and DOS women who have been branded to determine if they felt coerced by Miss Bronfman and others into giving collateral.

               Of course, Ms. Bronfman may well have been addled by the 500-calorie diet she and the rest of Raniere's

                Super skinny Clare Bronfman on 500 calorie DOS diet — running half marathons – is she branded too?
               </p>
               <p>
                In the photos Miss Bronfman appears to weigh about 100 pounds and her lower body seems to be not dissimilar to a child or an anorexic person.
               </p>
               <p>
                This conformity with the DOS slave women training indicates that Miss Bronfman, the funding source for Mr. Raniere, has either joined DOS or set up a compatible type of organization, possibly with slaves of her own.
               </p>
               <p>
                In combination with the low cal diet, Mr. Raniere likes women to train in the half marathon, a 13.1 mile run. Runners typically train by running 15 to 25 miles per week.&gt;

             Some more info about the Ethical Science Foundation:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Internal Revenue Service records indicate the Ethical Science Foundation acquired more than $145,000 worth of computers, medical equipment and brain-activity monitors several years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             A 2015 IRS form filed by the nonprofit listed its "charitable activities" as "Tourettes study — studying the effects of a specific and innovative method has [sic] on individuals with Tourettes syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder." The 2015 tax form said its expenses were $32,620.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The State Health Department faced scrutiny last year when it was reported that the agency had brushed off complaints about the brain studies and the branding, which was done by a licensed medical doctor associated with NXIVM.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The office of Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it was reviewing the Health Department's handling of the complaints, but so far has taken no action publicly.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              [So anybody can just conduct illegal human experiments and the Health Department doesn't look into it when notified?]
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Times Union reported previously that Porter — who abruptly resigned from St. Peter's Hospital last year when his involvement with the brain studies became public -— had apparently not published a scientific study in a number of years, and there is no indication his private research was being overseen by an independent review board.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...the complaints initially brushed off by the state Health Department was filed in August by a woman in Vancouver, British Columbia, who was associated with NXIVM and said
             <strong>
              she was traumatized by a bizarre experiment in 2016 in which Porter showed her videos depicting graphic violence.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Kobelt said she was recruited for the study by an assistant of Nancy Salzman (...) and that she knew of at least four other women who took part.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kobelt said she was not told what the study was for or what would take place, and that she was not asked to sign any documents indicating she had been informed what the study was about and consented to take part.
            </p>
            <p>
             Porter drove Kobelt to the building that day, she said, hooked her up to an EEG machine that monitors brain activity
             <strong>
              and showed her terrifying images and videos of murder, rape and mutilation.
             </strong>
             She described her ordeal to the Times Union last year and also detailed her experience in a complaint filed with the state Department of Health last summer.
            </p>
            <p>
             In response to the complaint that Kobelt filed with the state Health Department last summer, the agency sent her a letter saying that what she described was "not medical misconduct."

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In a follow-up session with Porter, she said, he asked her how she felt about her weight, what part of her body she obsesses about,
             <strong>
              and about "murder, harming myself, harming others and other more depraved topics

            Nancy Salzman claims to have 'expertise' in mental health:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Salzman, who records indicate has been a licensed nurse in New York since 1983, described herself as a "psychotherapist," while acknowledging that it is "not an earned degree ... it's a descriptive term." She also testified that beginning in 1985 and continuing through 1992, she had taken "neurolinguistic programming courses."
            </p>

              A reader makes this call out to Janie Jeffries, the wife of Dr. Brandon Porter, M.D.
             </p>
             <p>
              Janie, if you’re reading this: YOU KNOW THIS WEBSITE HAS SO MUCH TRUTH IN IT. Go home to your family, take your kids and get out. Do not let them end up being victims to this because you were too afraid to leave. Please, you have time. Your kids are young. Don’t let this brainwashing fool you: you are a smart woman. So many people will love and support you if you leave. I know that you have questions, I know that you have always doubted and tried to ask questions…why do you think they are never answered? Why do you think you are just asked to take more intensives? To keep you in line, to keep you obedient. Wake up. Get out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Frank Report wrote about the relationship with Dr. Porter, his master, Keith Raniere, and his patroness, Clare Bronfman, who is a committed slave to Mr. Raniere.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have been  told that Dr. Porter “operates” the Ethical Science Foundation, which is owned and controlled by Clare Bronfman, [which means it is owned and controlled by Mr, Raniere] as a front for Rainbow Cultural Gardens.
             </p>
             <p>
              If what our sources say is true, Dr. Brandon is the “face” of a money laundering operation and an illegal immigration scam. ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Miss Keeffe: Some people were just flat out illegal like Cami Fernandez. And, some
people were in the country on fraudulently obtained visas. This also goes to another
point of impeachment for Clare [Bronfman], because, Clare was involved with every aspect of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Matt McMorris signed those tax returns so he’s on the hook….  Rainbow has hundreds of
thousands of dollars running through it in tuition. Because, when I left, there were
seven kids just in Albany doing five or six languages. Paying twenty five dollars an
hour for these teachers. Right? Rainbow is owned and controlled by Loreta Garza,
who lives in the country on a management visa for NXIVM….
[I]t’s totally fraudulent. She’s in the country on a fraudulently obtained
visa, she’s not a manager for NXIVM. She’s the owner of … Rainbow {Cultural Gardens} but she’s not claiming it. I’m sure Rainbow’s never filed taxes. And, all of this goes through Clare. Clare oversees everything to do with the finances, and the personnel, and the management of Rainbow. And, then when you get into Rainbow you get into issues
that play back into each other.

              For example, Danni Fernandez and her mother, were living imprisoned in the room while illegal alien, Cami Fernandez [Danni’s sister], is downstairs teaching the children [whose parents] are paying …  twenty-five dollars an hour – in the same … house [12 Wilton Court]. I mean, it’s crazy; including even Jennie Ose’s kid, Steve and Jennie’s kid. [And Dr. Brandon Porter and Janie Jeffries children] And Clare and Nancy [Salzman] own the house.

               Wouldn't it to see what effect it had so the torture could be more effective? You start with a baseline of how they normal brain worked when they walked in. Then you subjected them to images. Now they're hooked up, so he could see which particular images were doing the most damage ... and what genre of images. Then you see how their brain works after the bombardment ... and you see how long the variation lasts. In this way, they could see at what interval it needed to be repeated.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then there's the whole ''normalization'' and ''desensitizing'' that they might have wanted to follow up on. In other words, how many times do the images need to be repeated to produce a flat line response ... or ... a pleasurable response.

               </p>
               <p>
                Remember - all regimes that practice torture actually employ doctors who are often present and monitor the torture (to make sure the victim stays alive, so that they can torture him/her a bit longer).
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, medical professional help with figuring out what kind of torture to employ so that it will leave minimum traces.

            Unfortunately I can't remember where I've read this today, but someone said jokingly Scientology should actually sue NXIUM, because NXIUM stole so much of their propaganda. Wonder what the connection is here.

            The Bronfman's are also in trouble:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Albany Times Union reports that the New York State Attorney General’s office is actively investigating the Ethical Science Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Clare and Sara Bronfman.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             State investigators are looking into illegal human experiments sponsored by Bronfman money and performed by Dr. Brandon Porter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Porter conducted brain-activity and other human behavioral studies  on various women without their consent and without having an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in place to oversee his “research”.
            </p>
            <p>
             A state Supreme Court justice signed an order directing Bronfman and Porter to turn over all documentation associated with the research, including written communications, videos, conclusions, consent forms, and names and addresses of individuals associated with Ethical Science Foundation, as well as financial records, budgets, bank account numbers, and names and addresses of board members, trustees or employees.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was reported that Catherine Oxenberg met with the attorney general’s office in November to bring information and evidence about alleged criminal activities of NXIVM.
            </p>
            <p>
             Several women told Frank Report they were victims of human experiments conducted by Dr. Porter – who, among other things, may be in danger of losing his medical license.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reportedly, a grand jury is seated and indictments of Raniere, Nancy Salzman, Lauren Salzman, Rosa Laura Junco, Emiliano Salinas, Clare Bronfman, Allison Mack, Alex Betancourt, Karen Unterreiner, Dr. Danielle Roberts and others may be forthcoming.
            </p>
            <p>
             Raniere and Bronfman fled the USA and were last spotted near Monterrey Mexico.

            Illegal human experiments? It gets weirder and weirder....
