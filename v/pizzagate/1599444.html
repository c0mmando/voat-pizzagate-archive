            You guys are tinfoil hatting this.  Omaha is the last place I'd be looking for pedophile rings - the city is so wholesome they'd be out with torches and pitchforks if there was even a whiff of actual pedophilia.

             This is the either the patient portal or the doctor portal. This hospital is a specialty hospital so your personal doctor would refer you and that doctor could a hundred miles away. The portal allows doctor's to communicate with the child's regular doctor and allows for all medical records to be consolidated into one file for viewing by a team of doctors. There would also be a patient portal for families to communicate with the team of doctors after the child returns home.
            </p>
            <p>
             I work with these portals at my work and this is not anything to be alarmed by. Chances are your doctor's office has a patient portal you can get results on and send messages for refills. I work in mental health and we use these to request refills and get med orders sent. It says not secure because you have to register and the site recognizes your ip as an approved up and allows for log in. We have 4 computers in my office and only one is approved for the patient portal at the doctors office out residents use.

            I am going to say this is a coincidence. This is a cardiac clinic of course they would have a heart logo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a heart problem and wear a small blood pressure cuff when exercising on my wrist. The symbol that shows heartbeats is a heart within a heart. When my heart beats, it fills in the outside heart and in between beats fills in the smaller heart. The symbol is identical to this hospital's logo. It is a common indicator to show heartbeats on medical devices and is not related to PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either that or Garmin and the other heart monitor makers are related to PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good looking out though. I would think the same thing if I was not a heart patient myself. This is just a common way to simplify a heartbeat on electronics.

             I'm going to say that you have not checked out George Webb's series and have not been following along, generally,  but Webb is revealing a world wide system of organ harvesting and child trafficking.  The logo may be incidental although the FBI has already flagged it as a known pedo symbol.   Excuse me if I dig further.

              I have been following along. I do agree with Webb and his series though I admit I am a few days behind. Please note, I am curently at work and wrote this in several seperate sections then edited it all together. It may not flow well but it is difficult to edit this on mobile.
             </p>
             <p>
              Having dug a bit deeper, the Omaha children's hospital attached to the cardiac center has a spiral as it's logo. I am not saying you are wrong by any means, just pointing out that logos can mean different things in different settings. In other words, I think the cardiac unit using this heart logo is appropriate but the spiral is not. I thought I had updated my prior post to reflect that but received a call and my edit did not go through.
             </p>
             <p>
              I work in mental health and am familiar with the medical billing and insurance side of medicine. I have been looking into how insurance profits and coverage could apply specifically to organ harvesting and transplantation of organs.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have found a significant increase in child and young adult (those under age 26) organ donation/transplants in the last several years and am currently cross checking that with states with high numbers of missing children.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you are onto something but are looking at the hospital end of it where we should be looking at the missing children and social services side of it. Hospitals have too many state agencies and regulatory boards to deal with to be directly involved in organ harvesting. The social services end of it has oversight but a huge lack of follow through.
             </p>
             <p>
              In looking at the stats on children in social services and foster/adoption agancies, those receiving services have a death rate nearly 4 times that of children living with the parents. That is taking into account that many of the kids in social services have severe disabilities that may shorten their lives. The actual rate across the board is 12 times the average death rate when taken as a whole and not accounting for those with severe disabilities. These disabilites, though serious enough to not allow for the child to live a normal life or even walk or speak, does not prevent the organs from being used for transplants. This is my WTF moment that has been messing with me since I made the connection several weeks ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about it. Retarded or severely developmentally disabled children are taken from parents or given up and used as donor organs. You keep it above board, social services becomes the legal gaurdian, admits them for treatment, things don't go right, pull the plug and harvest organs. Fucking sick shit.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am not to the point where I think the hospitals, specifically the cardiac children's hospital you posted about, are in on this yet but it is clear state social services is in on it. They get the funds to care for children admitted to their care, send kids to the hospital so they are not using funds for care from the social service side but rather the state medical care side and social services is running under budget giving the execs bonuses for being under budget.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason I am wary of saying the hospitals are in on it is because of the rate of transplants for children. It is very, very low in cardiac cases. Low across the board for all organ transplants due to it being easier to repair a child's heart or other organ and have them get through childhood and into adulthood before a transplant is needed in 92% of cardiac cases. I do not have stats on other organ donation. Sadly, the child is often too sick for transplant or the child dies of cardiac issues suddenly. In that case, organ harvesting is not possible except for tissue and cornia donation. There is very little need for cornias from children and in most cases, the tissue is not viable from the child due to sudden death from an unknown cause or due to medications and treatment that prevent the tissue from being used. The hospital in question from your link, is a specialty hospital meaning that these children are referred to them for care and have been sick for a long time which affects organ growth and organ viability for donation. I would say without a doubt this cardiac children's unit is in the clear because of the medical logistics involved with treatment vs organ viability vs need for organs for small children.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other side of this is the Omaha children's hospital. They would have access to all children. Children who are at the beginning stages of illness and a big pool of children of all ages, up to age 26 or so. This is where I feel the social service children being placed in hospital care could be used for organ harvesting. No parental oversight, in state care, very little oversight from the state and they are easily mistreated and lost in the system. You could harvest every organ depending on the severity of the disability. For downs children, every organ could be harvested but the heart due to downs affecting heart tissue. So a kid with a severe form of palsy, there are numerous forms of palsy, could be in state care, taken care of until they cost too much to care for, sent to a hospital for care and die. Organs harvested and transplanted. No oversight because a kid with severe birth injuries is expected to die young, sadly in most cases, before their 25 birthday. You now have adult sized organs from a disabled though otherwise healthy adult available for transplant into adults or teens from ages 14-65 or so. The need for adult sized organs is far greater than the need for children sized organs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another side to this is the need for organs and tissue,as well as bone marrow from people who are not white and mixed race. Bone marrow in particular had to be very precisely matched and there is a huge deficient in donors who are not white and an extremely small pool of donors who are mixed race. Where is the pool of children highest with non white children and mixed race children you ask? Ding ding ding! The social service children. Depending on the state, the percentage of kids who are white in state care ranges from 15%-35%.
             </p>
             <p>
              The cardiac unit is dealing with very sick children who are not viable organ donors. The bigger hospital network with the spiral symbol is dealing with sick but very viable organ donors. Look at the bigger network not the specialty hospitals. The specialty hospitals are not included in many state medical programs that the kids in social services use and they would be way too ill to be used as donors.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will continue to look into social service agencies and their relation to organ trafficking. We are both on the right path here and just need to make the connections.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry for the rant. I deal with state regulatory agencies with my work every day and did not explain myself properly in my prior post and edit that did not go through.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have you been able to spot anything else related to hospitals, maybe on the east coast or New England? This is where I am located. I have been researching through data and through my friends in DSS/DYS/foster care settings as well as through my own knowledge of the mental health system. So far, no good connection but my research group will continue to look.
