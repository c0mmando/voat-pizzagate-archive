<p>Here it is, folks! Definitive proof of why the genitals and the sexual organs are referred to as \'\'pizza\'\'. We learn this from the masters of the art of perversion and there\'s video proof. Of course, as we all know this video is fake, just like all the emails are fake, and the code words fake, and our speculation fake. Nonetheless, here it is ... spirit cooking exposes it all. Thanks to Abramovic for being such a publicity-hungry pepperoni for handing us this. </p>
<p>It starts at :30 where some normal everyday average Joe takes a bite out of the cake genitals that are designed to look like a woman\'s private parts. Then at :34 the slicing begins and naturally it\'s in the shape of a slice of pizza. Why didn\'t we know that? All the cool cannibals know, but we were left to surmise ... until now! </p>
<p>Notice how from the rest of the video that that area looks exactly the way a pizza does. One can imagine that if there were human organs/tissues beneath that skin, it would be an exact duplicate of what you buy in pizza shop. </p>

Has anybody seen the movie "Chinatown" and the plot the entire film is centered around?

            The pubis is triangular because of thighs.  Your insistence to make it all about cannibalism is not helpful, like everything else a woman does on her feet.  But then, this is the bitch who said that Trump is a prophet sent by God, so it's not surprising.
