If any of you were younger when the show was a hit the teenage crowd adored this. Hot Topic and all of these stores carried Invader Zim merchandise. Many people to this day still where clothes that have Zim related content on it. We\'ll I was looking into his other big piece of work. The comic Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. </p>
<p>The comic which is being turned into a movie, is about a serial killer named Johnny who loves to murder and torture anyone who even slightly bothers him. He loves in his own words, to find different and creature ways of bringing pure pain and torture to someone and new ways of doing it. If someone call\'s him a loser or wierd looking or even looks at him wrong in a public place he is most likely to go on a brutal mass killing and kill everyone in the establishment. He has a curse where the police can never arrest him no matter how much carnage he does. He can just get away with it. The name &quot;Johnny&quot; is a play on words of his real name Jhonen. The full comic is here.</p>

            With its dark humor and gothic settings, the Emmy-winning show was clearly meant for older kids, and that became 100 percent clear after "Dark Harvest" premiered. This episode creeped me the hell out as a kid (and continues to as an adult), because it was all about Zim harvesting his classmates's organs in order to appear more human.

            Never knew about anything beyond Invader Zim, but I knew a kid who really liked that guy's stuff in high school. He was creepy and ugly as fuck, actually looked like that character, now that I actually know what that comic was and seeing this in hindsight,
            <em>
             holy fuck
            </em>
            it makes so much more sense when he turned out to be a fag.
           </p>
           <p>
            I actually feel like looking at those comics puts me on a list, and these comics were this kid's
            <em>
             jam.
            </em>
            Fuuuuuck.
