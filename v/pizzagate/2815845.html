            Hello everybody,
           </p>
           <p>
            Very possibly the message is to to spread this events like "the seeds of the tree". To my eyes all recent events are a propaganda counter attack from the Cabal.
           </p>
           <p>
            For everyone understanding.
TREE OF LIFE MEANS TWO THINGS (DUALITY, AS ABOVE SO BELOW) 
1) ABOVE: IT IS THE ESSENCE OF NATURE IN THE WORLD. ITS NATURAL LAWS AND EQUILIBRIUM. THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE ATTACKING. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT YGGDRASIL OR THE EGYPTIAN TREE OF LIFE, IT IS ALL THE SAME.
2) BELOW: IT IS HUMANITY UPON WHICH THEY FEED AND PREDATE. AGAIN YOU ARE GOING FROM THE UNIVERSAL TO THE PARTICULAR. THE SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENCE SERVES AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE WHICH GOES MUCH BEYOND PLEASURE OR LONGEVITY.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL THEIR PLANS SERVES ONE SOLE PURPOSE. TO INVERT THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS, FIRST SIMBOLICALLY AND THEN IN REALITY. AS ABOVE SO BELOW.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY THEY WANT TO THIS?
           </p>
           <p>
            TO EXCHANGE OUR PLACES WITH THE REAL (((THEM))). WE GO TO LIMBO, THEY GET THE THRONE OF THE KINGDOM.
           </p>
           <p>
            SPREAD THE WORD. GATHER YOUR ARMS. WE MUST BE CONSCIENT OR BE LOST.

            Remarkable how Gab, a platform, can be held responsible for the actions of one of its users yet Twitter, which hosts child pornography and white genocide propaganda and Facebook, which facilitated the livestream of the gang rape of a Swedish woman by Muslims and the torture and assault of a mentally handicapped white man by four blacks and remain untouched.

            "Jared Loughner is Still Jewish: A response to the JTA’s weak arguments.
by James Buchanan"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Shortly after the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and 19 other people, a reporter from the left-wing Mother Jones magazine interviewed a classmate of Jared Loughner, Bryce Tierny, who knew Jared in both high school and college. Tierny told Mother Jones that Jared Loughner’s mother was Jewish. The only reason the ethnicity of Jared’s family came up was that Jared had claimed Mein Kampf as one of his favorite books (not to mention the Communist Manifesto). Tierney explained to Mother Jones that Jared liked to push people’s buttons and had likely listed Mein Kampf to annoy his Jewish mother."
           </p>
           <p>
            An individual at the Jewish Telegraph Agency however appears determined to contradict Mother Jones. Does he accuse Bryce Tierny of being a horrible anti-Semite, making up a false accusation of Jewishness? Strangely, No. In fact, the JTA individual suggested that Jared Loughner himself may have been lying to Bryce Tierny."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The most important point is the statement by Jared’s friend, Bryce Tierny that Jared’s mother is Jewish, followed by the fact that all the names in Jared Loughner’s lineage turn up in Jewish surname databases..."

November 6, 2007 10:00am
A Jewish college student who reported swastikas on her dorm door drew some of them herself."

            "“I wasn’t looking to create this, sort of, insanity,” Marshak told The Hatchet, where she works as a reporter. “I wasn’t looking to become a media darling. I was just looking for acknowledgment from University that someone drew a swastika on the door.”"
"Marshak could face federal charges. She will appear before the Student Judicial Services."

            youre such a faggot, and you cant spell for shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            False flags is a well-known Jewish technique both historically and now as revealed in former Mossad officer's books.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why "the Jew cries out in pain as he strikes you" is a Polish proverb from the 16th c., well before mass-education and entertainment could enshrine lies like the Holocaust.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's so cringe how you pretend you predicted something so regular like Jews demanding gun control after a shooting or employing fake neo-Nazis.  The fucking John Birch Society had a leader who turned out to be a Jew., as was the leader of the infamous Skokie, Illinois Nazi march.
           </p>

            now you wanna blame me although literally this entire site is anti-Semitic.  LOL

             Thank you. Wasn’t sure what to think given that Tree of Life can be used innocently as a mythology reference (Norse mythology and the legend of Yggdrasil, known as the tree of life).

            Whoever you are blaming faggot you can fuck off.  The people who try to shut sites down are the bad guys, don't get it wrong.  Self censorship (pre-censorship) is the absolute worst, and you suck for suggesting it

             Sorry, I don’t follow when you talk about self censorship.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless you’re saying that self discipline and self censorship are somehow the same thing...but that’s absurd and illogical. especially at a time when “they” are actively trying to frame conservatives in order to shut down their social media.

             In a battlefield, you don’t paint a target on your head and you don’t give your enemy ammo to use against you. Which is why anyone who paints a target on our heads needs to be regarded as our enemy.

             I understand your argument. “They” need to be taken down, that we agree on.

            <p>
             The crux of my argument is on how we can be FRAMED as justification to get us shut down.

             This is a bunch of images of the culprits writings before the incident. Compare and contrast to what the media is saying and this being a false flag to frame conservatives and justify shutting down Gab will be blatently obvious.

            Look at google maps around that synagogue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only is it called "Tree of Life", but it sits at the corner of a road named Shady.

            Most people will never get that multi-lingual joke.

           <p>
            "Lord Shady" is in the news lately. (Philip Green). Does he have any connections to Pittsburgh or that synagogue? Not to say he is in any shape, fashion, or form involved, but just pointing out some of the twisted humor involved in false flags. Heck, even the shooter is named Bowers. That's a version of the original Rothschild family name, Bauer. Rothschild, being the owners of the bank of London and being jewish themselves, just adds more of a twist to this.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then again, it could all be coincidental and just natural. We can read much into little, I know.

             Since Israel is a Rothschild state, and U.S. taxpayers regularly send them billions in "aid," I recommend viewing this enlightening video conversation between an Israeli citizen (also a political speechwriter) and an American Jewish representative of the "Diaspora" (any Jew that does not live in Israel). Lengthy, but well worth your time!

              Speaking of censorship, MEGYN KELLY SHOULD DRESS UP AS AL JOLSEN for HALLOWEEN!
             </p>
             <p>
              "Al Jolson aka Asa Yoelson (May 26, 1886 - October 23, 1950) was a Jewish American singer, comedian, and actor. He is considered the "first openly Jewish man to become an entertainment star in America".[1] His career lasted from 1911 until his death in 1950, during which time he was commonly dubbed "the world's greatest entertainer”."
             </p>
             <p>
              "He enjoyed performing in BLACKFACE makeup – a theatrical convention in the early 20th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences."

             Honestly, I don’t know regarding “Tree of Life”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its as I keep saying. Context is everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             On one hand, “Tree of Life” DOES get used for some nasty occult shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, “Tree of Life” could be an innocent reference to mythology. For example, Yggdrasil (from Norse mythology) roughly means Tree of Life or gets refered to as the Tree of Life IIRC.
            </p>
            <p>
             This can be a pretty interesting discussion depending on the context. Maybe its a lead, maybe not.

              Yes it does. The "Tree of Life" is a complicated concept and it can be strewn into many different concepts.

              This one minute video is worth looking at. Mother nature has a very planned design.

                You are welcome. There are a lot of things going on behind the scenes. It follows a pattern of very arcane language. Flipping nature backwards against us is what the perps do. They turn everything upside down an backwards and use it against us. Once a person figures out this pattern they can fight against it. We can't fight what we cannot see. Sight is crucial. Understanding this is the key.

              'Tree of Life' is a Cabbala concept, if I recall it correctly, it's at the centre of Cabbalism.
             </p>

              This is why it has been interesting that
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2777433">
               @EsotericShade called
              </a>
              himself a '
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2094591/10331374">
               shade tree Talmud scholar
              </a>
              ' when he was new to the board. At the time, he also cautioned against calling out specific groups or races.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you google 'shade tree Talmud scholar' you get several links to a story from the Talmud, where a Talmud scholar rests under a 'shade tree'. When asked what he could possibly do to thank the tree for the shade, the tree replies he should spread the seeds of the tree in the world.
             </p>
             <h1>
             </h1>
             <p>
              Then Esoteric did an u-turn and started anti-semitic rants.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now he says he meant that he read the Talmud - but there is no way someone who is anti-semitic would call himself a 'Talmud scholar'. So I suppose he is on the same payroll as Donkey, and when he was new, he didn't know yet how he should operate.

               You are smart but you are wayyyy over thinking it. "Shade tree" also means "half ass" as in, not an expert. There are "shade tree" mechanics, plumbers, etc....My user name means "the hidden light" which is darkness. Its really simple but very complex at the same time. Do you know that the word "uniicorn" is used in the Bible eight times? A unicorn is actually a Rhino. There are double horned Rhinos and single horned Rhinos. They have "horns." A "horn" is a branch of a family that starts a nation. You might want to watch Walter Veith's videos. Its an eye opener.

                isn't me.  I try to mock legitimate users by claiming all they say is "nigger faggot kike shill", but it's obviously a joke because everyone laughs at me when I do it; I know this, but I continue to try to make that one stick, because I'm a JEW.  Jews just don't have the capacity to understand why our lies don't work, so we just keep doubling down on the same tired cliches."

               Seriously? When I realized that the Talmud was the Bible our enemy uses I immediately began to try to understand it. We can't fight what we can't see and understand. Maybe you should read "Sun Tzu's Art Of War" and it will become clear to you why I would try to understand our enemy's game plan. I doubt you believe what you just wrote, I think you are just blustering because you don't like me. Understanding how our enemy operates is crucial, which is the main problem Vindicator has, because he claims not even understand Zionism, which seems almost impossible to me.

               Vindicator told me one time that Jerusalem becoming the Capitol of Israel was a fulfillment of biblical prophecy. I wanted to bang my head on the wall when he said that because THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE TALMUDISTS SAY.

                - would you call yourself a 'Talmud scholar' after reading the Talmud?
               </p>
               <p>
                Or maybe rather not, just in case someone might wrongly assume you are Jewish?? Could I get some feedback from you guys, please?
               </p>
               <p>
                And would you add you are a 'shade tree' Talmud scholar, so in fact identifying even more with it, alluding to the Jewish tale of a Talmud scholar who is asked by a shade tree to spread the seeds of this tree?

                And a friendly reminder that you warned us to call out certain groups or races, before you went on about four weeks later, and started bitching about muh Zionists, muh Jews. (

               <p>
                You also said that you didn't want us to talk about Satanic Ritual Abuse, not talk about the Rothschilds, not discuss suspicious companies and their Instagrams - so basically, didn't want us to talk about everything at the core of Pizzagate.

                Then you took an 180 u-turn. I guess your handlers weren't sure how you should operate at first.

                 You are a disgusting piece of shit for what you did to some members of the community here
                </strong>
                , and even more so for saying that you didn't give 'a frickin' shit' for hurting them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Even still leaving comments proves you are a liar, since you said a dozen times you would leave, but obviously never do.

                 I can lead a person to knowledge but I can't make them think. You seem very angry. Your little rants are meaningless to me. You realize that don't you? None of us are that important to the world. Calm down.

                 No. I've read the Bible and recently read the Koran, it's important to understand when debating people (especially those about their own religion) but I am not a scholar in either subject just because I read a book.

                 's worry that they will shut us down: they don't need evidence of "hate speech", they will make up a reason and shut us down. Just like that. Like they did for FPH on plebbit. They know about us already.

I try to mock legitimate users by claiming all they say is "nigger faggot kike shill", but it's obviously a joke because everyone laughs at me when I do it; I know this, but I continue to try to make that one stick, because I'm a JEW.  Jews just don't have the capacity to understand why our lies don't work, so we just keep doubling down on the same tired cliches."

                You are the dude that said "israel never attacked anybody, unlike Iran" and you calling people Jews. Thiis is rich. Tell us more about how Israel is not the aggressor country. Tell us how Israel is kind and gentle. This site has gone to the dogs.

I try to mock legitimate users by claiming all they say is "nigger faggot kike shill", but it's obviously a joke because everyone laughs at me when I do it; I know this, but I continue to try to make that one stick, because I'm a JEW.  Jews just don't have the capacity to understand why our lies don't work, so we just keep doubling down on the same tired cliches."

                    Excellent.  I'm guessing it was a "street cred strategy" which led him to make such a statement?  That's quite an evolution in 18 months.

                    I could envision his (Donkeyhole/ES) nebbishy-looking little frame, flailing and rabidly foaming uncontrollably, as he pounded out his explosion on his Alienware keyboard.  Skeletal little fingers clicking away maniacally...

                A lot of this mythology, in more modern times, is tied to "Odin" and funny or not Odin has an eye closed, sort of.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do an image search for "Odin" and see what you see. An "eye" is missing.

                Yep and Trump, in his own words, said he had a "cabbala teacher." People need to understand that Trump's father left a lot of his cash to the Chabad Mafia. Trump is part of the Chabad mafia. What we are watching is a huge artificially created theatre. Those folks want a race war. They are flooding this country with foreigners and they want us to fight each other. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FUTURE LOOK AT EUROPE. They flooded Europe with foreigners, pitted them against each other, and they watch the blood flow in the streets.
               </p>
               <p>
                The United States will follow Europe. Trump says he will stop that shit from happening. I doubt it, but I would like to believe it. "Belief" is a dangerous thing. We have to be careful what we "believe."
