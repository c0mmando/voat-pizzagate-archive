            So I wanted to share a small anecdote I heard over 5 years ago, long before I had any knowledge of the trade. Not really related, and it only seems off to me now, but you all know The Lovely Bones, right? A 2009 film, based on a fiction book, set in the 70s about a young girl who was kidnapped, raped and killed by a local paedophile, and the story of the protagonist in the afterlife. A weird interest for me since I've never actually seen it, but I could tell you a lot about behind the scenes and the co-stars involved. Because it was an international co-production between the US, UK and NZ, it was labelled under DreamWorks despite Steven Spielberg having no other involvement (exec produc). Here is a clip of the moment I'm referring to:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOSekoUP6c">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOSekoUP6c
            </a>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Starts at 00:52. Spielberg makes an unexpected visit to the production set early on, and director Peter Jackson talks about how he probably interrupted the focus of the cast by his appearance: "
            <em>
             Steven came to visit, which I think was a little difficult for the actors; they didn't know he was coming and um... threw them for a little while. - Things just didn't really click, and Steven was sitting there watching... it not click (chuckles)
            </em>
            ."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I have no reason to suspect anybody in the cast or crew; Stanley Tucci was notably very reluctant and uncomfortable with playing the villain, his personality and interest in other projects like Spotlight lead me to believe in his good character. And Saoirse Ronan is a girl I've known a lot about for ages, she was brought up by very well-meaning, very protective and level-headed Irish family of Catholic background. They never bought into the materialistic thing and were always standing by the set with their daughter, on every one of her jobs. But something about it now makes me think maybe Steven had an interest in the subject matter more than he should've. All speculation, of course. Who wouldn't be thrown off-key by a renowned director? But it's just something that strikes me as odd now.

            The set where the men masterbated to the 12 year old and took her to another section to gang rape her. Several commenters believe this is the set where Jeopardy is still being filmed to this day as the set has theatre row seats for the audience to watch.    I HAVE brought this up before and have always wondered if this would implicate Alex Trebeck.  He just had some surgery on his head or brain.  Hmm.  Could just be OK, but if they are still filming there and were then as well.  Well, come on, this must be looked at.  Does anyone know anything about this?

              If you had ever watched the actual show, you would know that there are NO CHILDREN ON THE PEE WEE HERMAN SHOW. The actors are all adults, and he talks to the audience directly to the camera.

                Yeah, now it is mudslides.  Oprah was on tv telling what damage it did.  I was not fully awake enough to hear it and shed the proper tears.  But next I noticed there were people living in Montecito and how horrid the mudslides were.  Gag me with a spoon.  I am hoping one of the disposals will will be SS.  Please let it be.

            I'd argue this wasn't a very necessary repost, but I can still very much sympathise. Something about this story hurt me hard when I first read it, and is what started my more recent spree on PG research, since I usually can't afford the insomnia. This one was a bit different, just from reading the anecdote.
           </p>
           <p>
            Little disappointed that you never mentioned the writer for the article, even if it is a pseudonym and the story mediated from an anonymous sender. Main reason being that the story is still completely unverifiable. Just something I wanted people to be mindful of, as entertainment gossip is rife with lies and rumours. I am still taken aback by this one for several reasons though.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Even for CD&amp;N, this one is unusually sickening and incriminating. Claims like these are what re-open investigations, if only the sender went forward
            <em>
             (and as if there even was an investigation to begin with).
            </em>
            There's something else about it, though. What broke me was how suggestive this claim was, causing me to connect the dots myself. How would you create this from those most subtlest and coincidental of details? Something about how that story is told, the way the clues are given and the unbelievably big people it accuses.
I have to believe in this one, and I'm trying really hard to be impartial. The dates and explanations offered just fits in. O'Rourke sustaining a ruptured colon,
            <em>
             that's
            </em>
            **** what they missed, and
            <strong>
             that
            </strong>
            high profile-status is how they got away with it. To me it seems to fit perfectly, but none of us can do anything to confirm it. It's not like the JonBenét Ramsey case and all the revelations around that.
           </p>
           <p>
            So given the implications, I believe that Spielberg at least had to know about it in some incriminating way. So I can't help but rejoice in some deep place when I visit Spielberg's twitter page just now, for the first time ever, and see what kind of feedback he gets these days:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/steveberg1946/status/870172816909377537">
             https://twitter.com/steveberg1946/status/870172816909377537
            </a>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            That is beautiful.
I only knew about Heath O'Rourke through her death, I never grew up with her, but I'm comforted to think that this is finally some way to redeem her fate and aftermath. And to whoever anonymously submitted that story, Odessa, my most heartfelt apologies, regrets, gratitude, and regard for your experience and bravery. You and Leto are awesome guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            To quote Gorillion from the original voat thread:
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <em>
             that's the (guessed) RDJ insider Hollywood scandal site. He or somebody very similarly placed as him has obviously just had enough of Hollywood degeneracy and is spilling all the beans. I think choosing O'Rourke as the latest victim story is helping frame in people's minds that this stuff isn't a recent phenomenon. And by comparison, creeps like Weinstein are amateurs at the abuse game.
            </em>

              WOKE! Carm, I hope this story never dies. I hope there will be a lynch mob out for blood, to get justice for Heather. I keep having flashes of Heather screaming out for help in a back room somewhere and nobody, not even her parents are there for her.

               We must keep fighting for all the poor tortured souls out there, justice for all the Heather O'Rourke's  and Corey Haim's out there. We WILL eventually get justice for them all. We must fight for them not to be forgotten and the thousands of victims/potential victims out there. We must fight for them

Keep researching, communicating, posting your feedback.
We are far from hitting critical mass, but the awakening taking place these past months is far beyond my feeble attempts spanning several decades.
Fight, fight, fight .

                I would be easy to spot in a crowd if anyone were to mention the name Heather O'Rourke. I'd be the one bursting into tears and sobbing like a baby. Maybe she represents all the tiny, terrified children, famous or otherwise, that have been tortured by evil, that we have now spent months helplessly reading about. Also, the raw description in that blind of how Heather was tormented by those HWood devils has given me nonstop nightmares. But you are all correct. I know in my heart that we will get justice and must keep up the fight.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thanks guys. In our lifetime it WILL happen.

                 Yes, I believe it too.  I think it has been a long time coming for those Scumbag Perverts to get their Due Justice, but I do believe it will happen.  Yes the raw words of the pain and abuse she suffered was an abomination. I don't even know if there is a word horrid enough to describe it.  All of this is so very horrid, but I could never not want to know.  I never was one to bury my head in the sand.
