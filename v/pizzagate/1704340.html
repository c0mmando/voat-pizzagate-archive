            I don't doubt Facebook did this.  I am just a little suspicious about BBC taking the moral high ground and reporting these CP images.  BBC has been covering up this stuff for years!  Why now are they concerned with exposing it.  And why did Facebook throw them under the bus for it.  Hmmmm

            Nice to finally see some decent journalism from the BBC on

            it only took 4 months.  Still hate the Bastards though and won't ever pay my tv license again but still good job bbc you shower of absolute twats.  As for facebook I never had an account and never will and I hope it withers and dies and takes zuckerberg with it but I can't see it happening soon due to the apparent abundance of moronic narcissistic fuck wits who populate it.

            Here is an excerpt of the "orangmen" doc on the doc links on Wikileaks written by Anna G:
This is the organization of the Monarchies that is also in cooperation with the Freemasons that our police, judges and politicians allow to molest and murder our children and extort our properties. They murder witnesses and police cover it up. It is destroying happiness &amp; freedoms for the majority so that a few can have child rape parties. The police enforce these crimes against us by these criminals and makes our laws worth nothing and due to this, when we pay tax, we are forced to pay for the molestation and murder of our own children. Further when we vote in Canada for a person that will not declare themselves a true Canadian in writing as illustrated in the Declaration of undivided leadership, this fool is voting for the molestation and murder of their own family. No politician in Canada has answered the questions in the Declaration posted on my wall. They all ignore it like a psychopath would.  When a politician is able to answer it, you will know about it  as I will tote there name proudly.  I am a true Canadian, not a Monarchist.

             Sorry no. Right when you mentioned Trump is her handler and trained her daughter to kill you lost all credibility. I 100% don't buy it. There are people claiming false shit for attention and there's a number of red flags on this one. Sounds a lot like the Twitter woman ranting and raving about being captured and victimized by MK Ultra yet as soon as she posted the story on here she's mysteriously back on twitter saying she's okay and safe. Come on.

            Zuckerburg needs to be gassed.  I mean he should be kidnapped, tied up, beaten and forced to breath his own carbon dioxide in the form of a plastic bag over the head.

            I find this story so disturbing on so many levels that its almost beyond my ability to describe, but one thing I know is it the reason that Facebook has made this decision and is unwilling to deal with this is because all the people at the top are pedophiles and perhaps the Satanist themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            When people truly understand no one is allowed to be successful wealthy and well-known , especially to the degree of someone like Mark  Zuckerberg and the guy at Twitter, until and unless they have sold their souls. What does that mean? We know what that means that they're involved in child rape and very likely at that level torture human sacrifice and cannibalism themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm on my phone right now or I'd look for it and at the link but I know it's on YouTube if anyone wants to check it out. It's a short clip that involves an interview of Mark Zuckerberg. The interviewers are a man and woman kind of older and they're talking about asking him to take off his hoodie. at that time I guess he wore a hoodie and notoriously never ever took it off.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the woman asked him to take it off he just said he wasn't going to do it. Then the male interviewer asked him about privacy and it's almost like he would do anything to avoid the question avoiding so he quickly that he said okay I'll take the hoodie off. As he took it off, the woman took it from him and realized there was a symbol inside the back of the hoodie. she held this sweatshirt to the audience so they could get a clear view of this symbol and she said, oh, it's an Illuminati symbol. I don't think he said anything but looks really really uncomfortable.
           </p>
           <p>
            The symbol was very large so you could get a good look at it. while it was not a pentagram or Baphomet that was easily discernible it certainly was a symbol that made me sit back and wonder whether the woman was right. she certainly didn't hesitate to identify it

            1) you can't delete your account, it only deactivates.  Facebook still retains all of your information
2) facebook is the most efficient platform to keep in touch with my vast number of acquaintances (distinguished from friends), I don't need but the benefits outweigh the cons in my case.  I'd like to remove my history and just retain for announcements as needed.

            Something similar happened on Twitter. Someone at the Pizzagate Reddit found a large pedo trade ring on Twitter consisting of thousands of accounts. Some accounts existed for more than 5 years. Twitter banned the user that discovered this, nothing in the media (which should have been a big story) and at the same time (but probably unrelated) the Pizzagate Reddit got banned for doxing (also
            <em>
             note
            </em>
            how the meaning of doxing changed in the last 6 years which at first only meant publishing private information about a person). As of today, even after Twitter closed many of the accounts, the ring still exists and grew back to its old proportions. Like the weird stuff happening at Youtube the people reacting to this are mostly Arabic and Chinese as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing how all this is real I am actually pretty scared to look into it more / report it because of the same reasons as what seemingly (what the article pointed to by the parent does not even mention) happened to the BBC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look inside the archive of the PG Reddit just before it got banned to get more information about the Twitter discovery. I advice everyone that wants to do more research to use Tails + Tor and disable images (or zoom-out inside the browser so the images are too small to see anything shocking but clear enough to verify what is being shown).
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Also. Is it just me or do many comments look like bots responding to specific terms mixing it with unrelated (and possibly meant to be discrediting) content? I've written NLP algorithms myself and recognise some of the patterns.

            However, Gavyn announced his resignation before the meeting. As we left, I reminded Simon Milner, the BBC secretary [for governance and accountability] of what Gavyn and I had told him of our talk. It was Milner's job to tell the governors that if I was to go on, I needed their public support.Sarah Hogg had her last chance to settle old scores. I now know that she arrived determined to get rid of me. I waited in my office for maybe an hour and a half before Milner came to say Pauline and the deputy chairman, Richard Ryder, wanted to see me.

            Inspired by friends
Simon Milner, the UK policy director at
Facebook, told the BBC: “This is about
making it easier for families in that highly
emotional time as somebody dies, that they
know this person is a registered organ donor.
“The second thing is to encourage
people who may have thought about it in
the past, but have just not got round to it
or who might be inspired by finding out
that 10 of their friends are organ donors, or
100 of their friends are organ donors, that
they want to do it too. We think there’ll be a
double benefit from this.”

            SIMON MILNER REFUSES TO REMOVE INFANT ABUSE VIDEO 2013
            <a href="https://mic.com/articles/120212/the-surprising-reason-facebook-won-t-remove-a-disturbing-video-of-child-abuse#.m9AcZ69kZ">
             https://mic.com/articles/120212/the-surprising-reason-facebook-won-t-remove-a-disturbing-video-of-child-abuse#.m9AcZ69kZ
            </a>
            according to the Guardian, Simon Milner, director of policy at Facebook U.K., said the video should stay up to make the abuse public so that more people would see it and be able to help the baby in distress. "Our response has been it does not breach our terms, but it is a disturbing and distressing video," he said on BBC's Radio 4. "And therefore it's right that we put up a warning ... and only if it is shared in the context of condemning it."
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of this baby video, Milner hopes the child's abusers can be exposed and the baby will be protected.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We have seen from experience that when things like that are shared on Facebook it can and does lead to the rescue of the child," Milner said, according to the Guardian. "We hope very much that this will happen in this case."

            Simon Milner  - Facebook and Instagram safety
Facebook users are bound by rules- most importantly cannot harm others but offence and causing offence is more difficult to police as is highly subjective.
Real name policy -have to be yourself- “more safe” than others including anonymous like ask fm. Is this the case though? Children and young people are willing to lie to deceive Facebook to gain access.
Help centre  Reporting can be done here- not the only place- can be reported from anywhere on the site (mobile and desktop)
Every single report is looked at by an individual Reports are prioritised by age or harm or immediacy eg. Suicide
           </p>
           <p>
            Social reporting ability to report someone outside of Facebook helpful in school community- could be sent to safeguarding group in the context. All that is needed is an email address and can then send a copy of the whole report- even blocked Facebook institutions can use this feature.

            Global safety advisory board Eradicating CEI from Facebook- proactive in removing this material photo DNA- scans photos on Facebook against a database- although the software cannot spot new images- which is a problem in Sexting Sextortion cases as images so quickly appear and disappear and are saved elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also Facebook is working to tackle grooming by trying to look at patterns and language and users Instagram is easiest to change privacy settings can make posts private and chose followers etc and able to block unwanted followers No nudity allowed on Instagram which is safer than other social network platforms.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simon dealt with a barrage of questions following his presentation that ranged from very technical questions regarding privacy (which we have dealt with in our previous blog post “protecting your digital footprint”) to questions about the ‘real name’ policy which fails to stop underage users signing up- which seemed to be the biggest concern of the conference audience.

You have been warned. If you search on the wikis that SIMON MILNER is involved in it appears to be reffering to secret societies. may just be role playing but with the language and the strange name of the site itself I find it suspect. DIG.

            David Hill had done what I had originally done. He 
had asked questions and began to dig into who pulled the strings in this country. Both 
David and I discovered the names of some of the more obvious powerful families. For 
instance, in David's notes he writes, "Yes, it is a fact: the Mellon' s, Carnegies, 
Rothschild's, Rockefellers, Dukes, Astor's, Dorrance's, Reynoldses, Stiliman's, Bakers, 
Pyne's, Cullman's, Watson's, Tukes, Kleinwort's, DuPont's, Warburg's, Phippses, Graces, 
Guggenheims, **MILNER's, **Drexel's, Winthrop's, Vanderbilt's, Whitney's, Harknesses and 
other super rich Illuminated families generally get along quite well with Communists, 
who supposedly want to take away the wealth of these men and give it to the people.

            he Balfour declaration was a letter from Lord Balfour toLord Lionel 
Walter Rothschild. Researchers say that the letter was in fact 
WRITTEN by Lord Rothschild and his employee, the banker, Alfred 
Milner. Now get this. One of the most important secret societies of 
the 20th century is called the Round Table.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alfred Milner was the Round Table's official leader after the death of 
Cecil Rhodes, and the Round Table was funded by..
           </p>
           <p>
            OXFORD CONNECTION: The Fabian Socialists dominated 
the staff at Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars began arriving. These scholars 
then received indoctrination and preparation to become part of an international 
socialist New World Order. (38) The Round Table Group developed from the inner 
executive circle of Rhode's secret society. The outer circle was established after 
the start of the 20th century.

            From the same article regarding Bill Clintons Ties to Oxford and his CIA connection
Clinton's ties with the C.I. A. began when he studied at Oxford. Clinton's 
reign as President has been noted for numerous scandals, including the 
unexplained deaths of more than 50 of his associates by means of bullets and 
plane crashes.

               Damn, he pulled that move at a moment of maximum distraction. Made sure he was leaning away and talking to the brother. But it's obvious as fuck he was zeroing in. She elbowed his arm away instantly.

               That whole pedo narcissism thing. The "duper's delight" of having to wave it in everyone's face, but in a manner that can be totally denied as an innocent accident. Be curious to see how litigious he or his manager is. How often he goes after people for slander or libel for even suggesting he drifts into the territory.
              </p>
              <p>
               That look he gives the male interviewer is bone chilling. It was like that public mask of his dropped away and revealed a dangerous dead-eyed animal. Like he was challenging the guy to dare to push further.
              </p>
              <p>
               Alephantitis pulled a similar "sudden-change-of-affect" on that other interviewer.

            Well, good on the BBC for taking the exploitation of children to Facebook.
           </p>
           <p>
            But stop a moment and consider what the BBC is directly associated with.  When the two decades of Muslim Child-Rape gangs were going on, did the BBC ever once choose to send reporters in to investigate?  NO.  Never once.  There was lots of smoke but the BBC did not care to point out the fire in the midst of Islam.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, with regards to Rotherham, it took the lawsuit of a child victim against the civil servants in Rotherham for the BBC to finally join all the other News Agencies in bringing this horror to light.  And now everyone knows that EVERY larger Muslim community has their men involved in grooming gangs of nonMuslim children.  And it is always with great reluctance that the BBC reports on this, usually, if not always, as a second hand account.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, the BBC is implicated now in countless coverups and under-reportings of anything involving the misdeads of Islam or Muslims.  You can count on the BBC to give a pass when possible or spin any Muslim related crime toward the notion "...but it's society's fault!".
           </p>
           <p>
            And when it comes to Muslim countries that have completely gone off the rails like Turkey or Saudi Arabia, forget about it.  The BBC will even let the wife of Prime Minister Erdogan sing the praises of that beautiful institution of learning, the
            <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35773208">
             Turkish harem
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Read the value neutral nonsense of the BBC when it comes to Islam and then realize that they are so steeped in identity politics that they would cast a blind eye to the rape of a British child by a Muslim gang because "it's just their culture".

            It's the same thing with Twitter and YouTube and Instagram. They all advertise, sell, and swap material with provided protection by these website officials. This seems to be how they are able to take care of the people who try to report their communities. They are accusing their accuser and getting the upper hand on it. It's a creepy little maneuver they got going on here

            It's time to face facts. Go cold turkey on Facebook. Delete your account which is hard, but just keep digging, allow hours. But of course FB probably never really deletes any accounts at all so -- yeah, go cold turkey. Tell all your friends &amp; family and stop using it. Stop watching all MSM TV. Get rid of every gadget that starts with the word "Smart" especially those your children are carrying around. NEVER FORGET: #Vault7 revealed that the pedos in the CIA Mafia can easily watch and listen and masturbate to our kids all day long and sell the footage.

             Looking back, the past few yrs have been life-changing in what I believe now vs then. And I'm a full grown woman, not a 20-something who may not have realized the charade yet.

             actually ditching social media is very good for you mentally. its been shown by psychology, science and common sense to be very bad for you, as an individual, as a family and as a society.

             I think a better option is for the public to stage a mutiny and strike against the corporate establishment government a-la-south korea (we could never be that united as a nation though). If we could manage to organize and all collectively be on the same page, we could overthrow the government, seize facebook and all their assets, and infiltrate all manufacturing of 'smart' devices and eliminate any potential for fuckery. Why should we pay the price because some power hungry asshats cant use technology responsibly and ethically? By choosing not to participate and essentially boycotting and eliminating the possibility of yourself and your family being spied on doesnt do shit to address the root cause of the issue.

              Yep. Facebook is terrible and useless now, it's only real purpose is to spy on and brainwash people. You know something is dying when the teenagers won't use it because it's for "old people".

             I haven't deleted it since I still use it for dating (women want to check your shit out these days before giving a number) but checking my FB feed is hilarious. It's like a ghost town where only the "justified" and "educated" and "moderate" and truly incensed by Trump HRC heads think they're leading some sort of #resistance without realizing that it's not just the conservatives that have logged off but many of the non fanatic Libs as well. The other funny thing is when ever I post an opinion (not about PG but about censorship,mainly, as well as Syria; I only talk in person about PG if I'm trying to convince) I get passive aggressive  replies, meaning the replies are not directly attached to my post but on their own wall without mentioning my name but clearly attempting to attack the point of view and content I just posted (usually by referencing the all knowing "fake news" meme that's supposed to tell you what's real or not in the media) and of course issuing my POV a label through lesser of 2 evil rational, which is sad--MSM and their framing of others POV rather than establishing their own is all they got left. Edit: I tried (it was shadow banned until I asked a friend to share it) to post a link to the Stanford paper about how there was more fake news coming from MSM and HRC's camp than Trumps, and immediately my feed was filled with the fake news meme. I mean, I know Stanford's not on the verified news meme, but it's an actual academic source. How the hell could it be defined as fake news. When I talked to one those people in person, they claimed I had misread the paper (even tho she did not read the paper but a summary about it from a "real news" outlet). Fucking unreal

               Completely delete your profile, it's better. To fully get rid of it, you have to delete every picture on your profile, otherwise it won't actually be deleted.

              I left mine a year and a half ago. Best decision I've ever made. The only time I hear people talk about it anymore is when they are talking about massive polarized arguments they have gotten into. And most of the time both sides are completely misinformed.

               I deleted my facebook about a month ago.  I have no idea what narratives are right now, mind you.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had a co worker today tell me that she can't believe what's going on with Donald lying about Obama's wiretapping and that Donald's work with the Russians  is going to put us in another world war with North Korea.  I asked her where she's getting this information, because I am all over current events and I haven't heard any of these things.  She told me the stuff was all over Facebook.
              </p>
              <p>
               I proceeded to explain to her, very carefully, what about each of her claims were incorrect.  And what is happening.  And what may happen in the future.  What Trump is doing right now.  She was argumentative at first, but I kept very calmly reassuring her that I know what I'm talking about.  Eventually I got her to hear me and she
               <em>
                sort of
               </em>
               understands just how manipulated she is being.  And that, of her claims that she made to me, none of them turned out to be true.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's gotten to the point where I am not even all that willing to respond to people who spew a facebook narrative at me.  I can smell bullshit when it's right in front of me lol.

                Same! Thankfully my coworker who gets her news in the same fashion is always willing to have an actual discussion rather than an argument. Unfortunately whenever I prove a point she just says, well I just have an emotional view of the world. 
Yup! Ya sure do honey! And that is how you get manipulated!

                 I told her that she needs to stop letting these big networks and entities
                 <em>
                  scare
                 </em>
                 her.  I said "if the only thing the news did is scare and confuse you today, then you haven't gotten all the news."  Let's be real, we live in an ugly world.  We even live in an ugly world that is slowly but surely being improved by the whitehats around us.  But the only thing that comes from this world isn't ugly.  Yeah, I make fun of Buzzfeed because their journalism is just wretched, but shit sometimes I really do need to read an article about how dog lovers are generally happier than cat lovers.  Parallel to that, MSM outlets aren't
                 <em>
                  only
                 </em>
                 putting out things that scare us.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I explained to said co-worker that we are reaching a new age of investigative journalism.  We have reached a new age of crowd-sourced datamining and compiling.  I explained to her that the MSM is absolutely not to be trusted, citing the
                 <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-24/obama-signs-countering-disinformation-and-propaganda-act-law">
                  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act of 2016
                 </a>
                 , and I saw that she was very receptive to that.  It's a lot easier to tell someone who is controlled by the media that they're being lied to by said media, if you can pull up a document that states that the powers that be tell them to lie sometimes.

            Facebook is completely incompetent at deleting horrendous material in time, or even at all. They had beheading videos on for days in October 2013, livestreams of gangrapes recently, the BLM kidnapping video for days and now this. Terrible!

             Yes, that is rich, isn't it?  Facebook is rampant in online censorship right now.  They are deleting and banning folks based on factual comments concerning Islam or principles criticisms of Islam and Muslim culture.  For many citizens, there is no other venue for them to even hear about these real concerns, many of which are not just of terrorism, but of Illiberal and supremacist doctrines that set Islam apart as being a dangerous Political ideology.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our society and civilization depend on citizens understanding the threat from other cultures and nations like Islam.  Yet the ignoramuses of Facebook and their founder, Mark Fuckerberg,  are documented in agreeing to silence these crucial and enlightening critiques.  An off-mic conversation with Angela Merkel documents this sometime ago.  And Angela Merkel is, herself, a Cultural Marxist who denies the right of her own citizens to speak freely and is bent on breaking German society with the importation of Islam.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, still, Facebook can find the time and chutzpah to hide behind "Free Speech" in order to suggest that images of child exploitation/crimes might fall under that category, "Free Speech"?  How laughable.  What a truly Post-Modernist, moral know-nothing position.
            </p>
            <p>
             We all either need to ditch Facebook (not going to happen, me thinks) or we will need to impose Free Speech monitoring and fines on Facebook under the understanding the Facebook is the defacto public square by dint of its social media monopoly.  Impose the 1st Amendment onto Facebook or BREAK IT UP.

              Of course they are banning muslim crap.   That is part of the plan of the vultures.  Islam will infiltrate everything and everyone, but will have to be protected in order to do so.
For example:

               I have never used facebook, always felt something would go awry, but nothing like this.  We need to spread the word.  Before you leave facebook, let people know what is going on and why you are leaving.

            This is Pizzagate related as pedophiles may be using not only YouTube but Facebook as well to not only share and distribute materials, BUT ALSO to comb through kids/parents profiles and target weak children or children of troubled parents. Facebook would be like an old fashioned Montgomery Wards catalog for pedos.
