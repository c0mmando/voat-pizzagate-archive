            TLDR:
           </p>
           <pre><code>The fact that "Domino's Pizza" has two of the Podesta codewords, could it be that the guy who chose the name did it on purpose and understands the same code? Could he be a child molester or somehow be connected to child molesters?

Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan is a Catholic devout and activist. He is the founder of Legatus, and is a close friend of Cardinal Bevilacqua, who was for many long years his ecclesiastical advisor. He still calls him "invaluable" and a "dear friend".

Cardinal Bevilacqua was found by a grand jury to have excused and enabled the sexual abuse of dozens of priests on hundreds of children at the Philadelphia Archdiocese between 1987 and 2003. He covered up and transferred an extremely dangerous predator, Father Romano J. Ferraro, who is now serving a life sentence. Three priests and a parochial school teacher were arrested for the rape and assault of young children in their care.

Is this a coincidence? Is the domino/pizza codewords that old? Are there other old anecdotes?

I got all the material summarized and linked below from this guy (amazing, he was doing a pizzagate-style investigation in 2011 into all this) and his own linked material.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Domino's Pizza founder, Tom Monaghan, founded Legatus — a Catholic rich business men's club, which claims "To study, live and spread the Faith in [their] business, professional and personal lives." Shortly after founding Legatus, Monaghan asked Cardinal Bevilacqua to become ecclesiastical advisor on the recommendation of the apostolic nuncio to Washington. “It is difficult to summarize the importance of one who has filled an invaluable role,” Monaghan said about his "dear friend" Cardinal Bevilacqua.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is Cardinal Bevilacqua? You guessed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cardinal Bevilacqua is one of America's best known Roman Catholic Cardinals. He is also considered to be one of the most notorious protectors of dangerous sexual predators, in the history of the Catholic Church in America.
           </p>
           <p>
            This "prince of the Church" served as Archbishop of Philadelphia from 1987-2003, after having served as Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh from 1983-1987.
           </p>
           <p>
            Memos reveal that during Bevilacqua's tenure as Auxiliary Bishop at the Diocese of Brooklyn, he covered up and transferred an extremely dangerous predator, Father Romano J. Ferraro, who is now serving a life sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a Final Grand Jury Report regarding the sexual abuse of children in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, The Grand Jury recommended that three priests and a parochial school teacher be charged with the rape and assault of young children in their care. This resulted in the arrest of 68 year old Fr. Edward Avery, 64 year old Fr. Charles Engelhardt, 47 year old Fr. James Brennan — and 48 year old Bernard Shero (the teacher). All were charged with rape, indecent sexual assault and other criminal charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Grand Jury also voted to charge another priest, 60 year old Monsignor William Lynn, the former secretary to Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, with felony child endangerment. The Grand Jury report describes how Monsignor Lynn endangered children, including the victims in the most recent cases — "by knowingly allowing dangerous priests to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children."
           </p>
           <p>
            This final Grand Jury report, dated January 21, 2011, is the culmination of the first Grand Jury Report of 2005, which exposed the horrific history of sexual abuse of children in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The final Grand Jury report accuses Cardinal Bevilacqua of covering up many of these horrific crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            INTRO:
           </p>
           <pre><code>This report contains the findings of the Grand Jury: how dozens of priests sexually abused hundreds of children; how Philadelphia Archdiocese officials — including Cardinal Bevilacqua and Cardinal Krol — excused and enabled the abuse.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            EXCERPT:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Even in 2002, Cardinal Bevilacqua continued to mislead the public and give false assurances. Cardinal Bevilacqua continued to try to hide all he knew about sexual abuse committed by his priests even in 2002, after the scandal in Boston drew attention to the problem nationally." (Page 53, Grand Jury Report, September 15, 2005)
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Page 60, Final Grand Jury Report, January 21, 2011:
           </p>
           <pre><code>On July 24, 2008, Ms. Hagner notified Ben that the Review Board could not substantiate his allegation. Less than a year later, Ben committed suicide.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Another excerpt:
           </p>
           <pre><code>We would like to hold Cardinal Bevilacqua accountable as well. The Grand Jurors have no doubt that his knowing and deliberate actions during his tenure as Archbishop also endangered thousands of children in the Philadelphia Archdiocese. Msgr. Lynn was carrying out the Cardinal's policies exactly as the Cardinal directed. In most of the cases we reviewed from the previous grand jury report, Cardinal Bevilacqua knew substantially everything that Msgr. Lynn knew about the danger posed by the accused priests.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            The 2005 Grand Jury report mentioned Cardinal Bevilacqua's name 784 times. This final report mentions Cardinal Bevilacqua's name 102 times.
           </p>
           <p>
            The horror story isn't over:
           </p>
           <p>
            Father Thomas J. Euteneuer. is an exorcist — and a favorite in Monaghan's Legatus circles. Fr. Euteneuer also took on the role of ambassador for the defense of the unborn at Human Life International (HLI) where he served as president, until he became involved in a major scandal. He stepped down because of "a particularly complex situation" which "clouded" his judgment and led him to " imprudent decisions with harmful consequences," the worst of which was violating the boundaries of chastity with an adult female who was under [his] spiritual care. "
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the response from the parents of the victim:
            <a href="romancatholicworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/renew-america-father-thomas-euteneuer-beyond-the-grave-a-fathers-and-mothers-statement-about-euteneuer-and-their-gravely-harmed-daughter-feb-21-2011.pdf">
             "Beyond the 'grave'..."
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This "particularly complex situation" and "imprudent" decisions appear to have taken place during Euteneuer's practice of "excorcism" (ndlr hermetic/satanic ritual).
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a screen caption of his book on sale.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the end, the Grand Jury "Reluctantly" Decides Not to Recommend Charges Against Cardinal Bevilacqua, stating :
           </p>
           <pre><code>Cardinal Bevilacqua's health is also a consideration. William Sasso, his long-time lawyer, told the Grand Jury that the 87-year-old suffers from dementia. Mr. Sasso testified that Cardinal Bevilacqua requires "24/7 nursing care" and rarely leaves the seminary where he lives. He said the Cardinal has failed to recognize Mr. Sasso when he visits. The attorney testified that he has not seen the Cardinal at a public event for nearly three years — not even at the installation of Bishop Senior in July 2010.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            In spite of Cardinal Bevilacqua's "dementia," he is still "publicly active" as described on December 3 2010 by Tom Monaghan's Legatus Magazine.
           </p>
           <pre><code>Although still publicly active on the cusp of his tenth decade, His Eminence Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua, 87, has been retiring from official capacities in recent years — most notably in 2003 as Archbishop of Philadelphia, which he led as one of the most prominent voices of orthodoxy in the Church in America.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            So who chose the name Domino's Pizza? According to Wikipedia, "one day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965."
