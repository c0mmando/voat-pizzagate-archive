<p>The above summarizes what\'s taking place on Twitter. All Attention is being turned on Jarrett. Call it the Trump Effect or part of Q\'s \'\'Setting the Stage\'\' post [yes, a Tweeter theorized that], I can\'t believe what they\'re finding! Including the email where Gov Rendell asks for help in getting 60 orphans out of Haiti! </p>
<p>Here\'s the Wikileaks tweet:</p>

<p>Look at the response! A lot of cases brought up where orphans were illegally snatched! Like:</p>
<p>I do know there are heart broken biological parents whose rights were stomped upon &amp; it involved #Minnesota\'s #AmyKlobuchar peddling her influence to obtain Haitian children from an orphanage not licensed to place them for adoption! #R2P <a href="https://twitter.com/DebMatheny/status/951752187155243009?s=20">https://twitter.com/DebMatheny/status/951752187155243009?s=20</a> … #Haiti #Clintons</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe Roseanne went to the trouble of reviving and locking in a TV show deal all to call out Jarrett and lose it only to call attention upon Jarrett. I mean, she could have done that without the convoluted route. </p>

            The involvement of "Fast Eddie" Rendell in anything pedophile related should not come as a surprise.
When Sandusky ran that organization for troubled boys, it was reported early on that he -Sandusky - was a major provider of young boys to wealthy Pennsylvania boy lovers.
High up politicians, such as Fast Eddie, were in s position to provide cover.
Local prosecutor Ray Gricar was killed for his investigation into the Sandusky operation.

             Has any law enforcement agency ever done a follow up on those 60 orphans to find out who they were and where they are now? I'd like to hear from these ''orphans'' about their charitable rescue and what exactly happened to them when being cared for in these do-gooder's hands.

              According to Georg willeit, who runs the SOS Children's Village outside Port-au-Prince, Laura Silsby was scoring $10,000 a pop:  "As far as we know they would have been, I say it clearly, sold for $10,000 each," said Georg Willeit, who runs the SOS Children's Village outside Port-au-Prince. "That's what one of the policemen told us. Every child was very desperate, hungry, thirsty. They all were in a bad condition."

              "One of the elder girls told us, 'I'm not an orphan. I still have my parents,'" he added.

              I guess it just makes me really frustrated. There's not a lot you can do to help the situation and I don't like feeling like that. I know people personally that are intelligent, good people, have "learned" certain things from MSM, and absolutely refuse to acknowledge that what they think is false even when faced with evidence. They will just shrug and say, I don't really care anyway then continue thinking the same way.
It's maddening :(

               It is.
              </p>
              <p>
               But in addiction, there is such a thing as ''hitting bottom.'' It's often the saturation point and when addicts face the truth and start to get clean. They quite often remember this moment in startling clarity.
              </p>
              <p>
               If we take that and apply it to this situation and those blue pillers out there, there's commonality. To begin with, their identities re wrapped up in being this globalist, benevolent activist trying to bring on a worldwide KUMAYA. Problem is they're backing pedophiles to do it so you and I know it ain't going to work. But one of these ''discrepancies'' may arise. Yes, you see it as evidence ... proof ... but is someone going to really shift their ''identity'' for that? It means pulling away from a group that they gain their power ... and reversing their stance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Try to see it from that perspective and then you'll be able to calculate exactly how much is needed for them to change their minds. It has to be a monumental happenstance.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's what I keep in my head to stop myself from getting worked up over these blue pillers not acting how I think they should. It took a lot for me. I was the prototype for liberal democrat, and I remember my ''awakening'' moment. I was like, "Holy shit!" when the light broke through. So once it happens, there's no turning back, but we have to be patient for the solid powerful evidence is released.

             She's said enough to show what she's like.

            <p>
             And why is she living with The Kenyan? This has come up before and there's no good reason. I'm wondering if she's'' Mike's'' sex toy. The Kenyan has ''Wendy'', and Mike has Jarrett and Huma? God not, Skankles!!!

                I wonder if they would show it on the internet.  It would be considered hard core porn actually.  If there is anything with a child, well then it would be CP.  It would be heavily redacted.
