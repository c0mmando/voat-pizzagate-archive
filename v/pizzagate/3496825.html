<p>Terry Bean,  
</p>
<p>gay rights activist was bailed out of jail the same day he was arrested Wednesday afternoon . His lawyer, Derek Ashton – who was arrested hours earlier – also posted bail and was released from jail.​</p>
<p>Court documents say the men arranged a $200k  payment to a 15-year-old boy to make sex abuse charges against Bean go away. ​</p>
<p>Bean was arrested on a warrant accusing him of 2 counts of 3rd-degree sodomy — both felonies — and a misdemeanor sexual abuse charge on a case that was first filed in 2015.</p>
<p>Ashton represented Bean in that case.​ Ashton was booked shortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday into Multnomah County jail in connection on a Lane County warrant on suspicion of violating Oregon’s computer crime statute.​In court records PPB Detective Jeff Myers said Ashton and the boy’s lawyer worked on a civil settlement. ​Myers detailed an elaborate scheme to keep investigators from finding the boy. The boy told the detective his own lawyer helped him hide. ( omg-are you kidding me?).“She told me not to talk to certain people, she told me to go on the run at a certain point,” the detective quoted the boy as saying. “So, if I did testify I was told I wasn’t supposed to get my money. So that’s why I did not testify. And that’s why my attorney told me to go on the run.” ​Myers wrote the boy’s lawyer gave him a “burner” phone and cash, and worked to hide him in a cabin in the mountains outside of Portland.​ Over the summer, one of Bean’s lawyers filed court motions to try to convince a judge to make prosecutors turn over evidence. </p>

<p>Court motion in Terry Bean case, August 30, 2019</p>
<p>In that defense motion, the lawyer revealed Deputy Lane County District Attorney Erik Hasselman told a judge in June he had evidence of wrongdoing by Bean and Ashton, along with the teen’s lawyer, and another attorney for a prosecutor’s witness.​</p>
<p>“…committed the crimes of bribery, witness tampering and ‘possibly’ money laundering.</p>
<p>olm wrote that Hasselman told the judge the statute of limitations had likley run out and would prevent Lane County from charging Bean or Ashton with the crimes involved in convincing the teenager to take a civil settlement.​“Bean can move to exclude any reference to settlement, including trumped-up allegations of bribery or tampering, from his criminal trial,” argued Volm in the ongoing case.​</p>
<p>It is clear from the new arrests prosecutors believe they can still move forward with some charges. ​</p>

            From para below: "Terry Bean: Democratic Bundler with Multiple Sex Crime Allegations"
           </p>
           <p>
            " Bean was a major bundler, or “super fundraiser,” for Obama — a position also held by Tony Podesta. A bundler is someone who solicits, collects, and consolidates donations for political candidates. They’re a critical tool for candidates to finance their campaigns, and according to NPR, “rank high in the power structure of American politics.” In another source, Bean himself is referred to as “indispensable to players at the highest level of politics.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Ed Buck of West Hollywood is also described in passing as a "bundler" but that's glossed over as if he was some minor Democrat who "just happened" to have his pic taken with Hillary and Schiff.
           </p>
           <p>
            The owner of CPP in DC was not described as a bundler by GQ magazine, but strangely as, "The 49th most important person in DC," right up there with Herr Doktor Kissinger and that bunch. Perhaps he was in charge of passing out party favors.

            Parallels the strange case of Ed Buck, gay Democratic honcho from city of West Hollywood, good friend of Hillary and Adam Schiff, bundler of Democratic donations, Hillary's elector to the Electoral College in 2016

            It might lead one to believe that political fund-raisers are often perverts and paedophiles. Who would be in a better position to know who to blackmail and extort than their fellow miscreants in the community? Like Hillary's fave Hollywood fund raiser, the CIA dude that pursues 15-year-old boys on a motorbike and causes them to drive off a cliff.
