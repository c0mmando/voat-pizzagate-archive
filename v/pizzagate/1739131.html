            I think Steele wants to make sure that the folks (guilty or not,) that are involved don't suicide or are knocked off. Think about it. What do we have if all the people we have called out suddenly drop dead?

            Interesting interview. For me it's just more evidence Trump is in over his head. He's lost. He's either been compromised or he really is a complete fucking idiot. My opinion of Trump worsens every fucking day. I'm at about %75 sure he'll do nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope somebody from the Trump camp is reading this because I think it's safe to say people are losing faith in The Donald rapidly. The honeymoon's over Trump. Put up or shut the fuck up.

             I spent days talking with Steele during his reddit AMA. We talked about everything from Antarctica to Jon Benet to aliens to Nazis. He's cryptic, but he's not full of shit. Tell me something he's said that bugs you. Let me see if I can tell you my perspective.
