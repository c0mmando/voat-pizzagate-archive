<p>&quot;A Serbian Film (Serbian: Српски филм, translit. Srpski film) is a 2010 Serbian horror film produced and directed by Srđan Spasojević, in his feature film debut. Spasojević also co-wrote the film with Aleksandar Radivojević.[2] It tells the story of a financially struggling porn star who agrees to participate in an &quot;art film&quot;, only to discover that he has been drafted into a snuff film with pedophilic and necrophilic themes. The film stars Serbian actors Srđan Todorović and Sergej Trifunović.</p>
<p>Upon its debut on the art film circuit, the film received substantial attention for its graphic depictions of rape, necrophilia and child sexual abuse. The Serbian state investigated the film for crime against sexual morals and crime related to the protection of minors.[3] The film has been banned in Spain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Norway, and South Korea, and was temporarily banned from screening in Brazil.&quot;</p>
<p>This movie has multiple scenes of child rape. The first time it\'s implied when they show a woman give birth to a baby, then a man smiles at the camera and takes off his clothes and it switches to the main character who is horrified and you can hear the baby screaming. </p>
<p>&quot;Miloš sees a young woman being physically abused and scolded by her mother, having disgraced her deceased war hero husband\'s memory by becoming a prostitute. In a dark room, screens show Jeca, a girl of indeterminate age, seductively eating an ice pop, while Miloš is fellated by a nurse. Then, Miloš is instructed to receive fellatio from the mother, while Jeca watches. Miloš refuses, but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former psychologist and has worked in children\'s television and state security. Miloš meets with Vukmir, announcing that he is retiring and dropping out of the film, but Vukmir explains to a hesitant Miloš his artistic style of pornography, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn baby, a baby which is then immediately raped by Raša, much to the joy of the mother. The disgusted and horrified Miloš storms out and drives away as Vukmir boasts to him that this is &quot;a new genre&quot; and that he terms it as &quot;newborn porn&quot;. At a road junction, being in a disturbed state of mind, he is approached and seduced by an attractive woman who, unbeknownst to him, is Vukmir\'s doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>Second time it shows it. The father in the movie is an ex pornstar who has retired and had his own family. He is drugged and and tricked into doing every horrific thing possible to woman and children. In one scene he rapes a woman and tortures her as he does it. At the end of the film in a drugged state he rapes his wife then proceeds to sodomize his 8 year old son in graphic detail. The movie shows the man raping him and blood and shit going everywhere. Then it shows the boys face dazed out with cum on him.</p>
<p>&quot;At the warehouse, Vukmir\'s doctor administers more drugs to Miloš, who in an angry outburst sticks a syringe into her neck, rendering her unconscious from the overdose. He is then taken into a big room, where he is conducted to have intercourse with two hidden bodies placed under sheets and with bags on their heads. Miloš furiously begins penetrating them while keeping them restrained, and as he swaps from one onto the other, the masked man from Lejla\'s film enters and begins raping the first. Vukmir then reveals the masked man to be Marko, his victim to be Marija, and finally, that Miloš is raping Petar. At this moment, the agonizing female doctor enters the room, with her crotch entirely covered in blood and a bloody pipe on her hand, attracting everyone\'s attention before collapsing dead. Snapping, an enraged Miloš lunges at Vukmir and repeatedly smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bites off a piece of Marko\'s neck, then bludgeons him to death with a sculpture. Miloš wrestles with the guards and seizes one of their guns, shooting both of them and injuring the one-eyed Raša, whom he kills by ramming his erect penis into his empty eye socket. During all of this, a dying Vukmir praises Miloš\'s actions as truly worthy of cinema.</p>
<p>The father finds out what he does and kills the traffickers and rescues his family. In horror when he gets home they all decide to kill themselves the whole family. Traffickers come in the room and begin to set up and he tells one of them &quot;start with the little one&quot;</p>
<p>Despite saying it was fake and done with digital effects and not a real child it sure looks like it. The movie features multiple instances of pedophilia and child torture. It is banned in multiple countries. </p>
<p>This is the interview with it\'s sick director Srdjan Spasojevic.</p>

            I think this movie was banned in a lot of places, naturally I watched it, and curiosity got the better of me. It is one of the most disturbing, grotesque, movies I have EVER seen. Its scary, because now that pizzagate and pedophilia has come to light, it's terrifying knowing even more so that stuff that was depicted in this movie, actually happens in real life.

            That is so disgusting! What's truly sad is every sick thing depicted in that film has undoubtedly happened time and time again to innocent children. I hate pedos and want to see them all suffer horrendous deaths.

            Sexual energy is very important to humans yet not many understand it, normal people can gain it from nature, fun, sex with love , if you don’t want that you are playing Illuminati game then they are raping babies for this
           </p>
           <p>
            When man and woman have sex, man is transferring 100% of energy to woman, woman can then
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             keep entire energy for her
            </li>
            <li>
             Return some back to man IF she loves him
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I guess it’s easier to rape than be loved and get energy

             😦 That sounds like a big load of gobbledygook... People get energy from food, not sex. Sex consumes energy for both parties.

                   First of all, criticism need not be a "personal attack". It just means someone didn't agree with your ideas. Don't be so prone to getting your feelings hurt. It inhibits personal growth. 😘 Second...I was right wasn't I?

             seriously man... the text alone is chilling... like, I don't even want to know if it's real. Because I don't want it to be real so bad. Now that this shit is coming to light, like, for real? Fuck dude, it literally makes me sick to my stomach to imagine what people are going to feel when/if this is ever revealed.

            I watched this movie years ago, it's pretty brutal. If you can stomach it you'll see a FUCKTON of occult and mkultra symbology throughout the film. There's white rabbits everywhere, black and white checkerboards, and a lot more. The creator definitely has a very deep understanding of the material and the underlying occult aspects of ritual sexual abuse.

            IIRC, 'newborn porn' isn't only fictional, I vaguely remember that it was mentioned in a news article posted here some time ago about seizing cp. In another article posted here it was mentioned that a forum (?) for pedophiles had a sub-forum featuring only the rape of infants and toddlers.

           <p>
            <em>
             The Irish Times
            </em>
            reported some time ago that ten percent of cp seized (it was downloaded by Irishmen, but hosted on US servers) featured infant and toddlers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I made a post about it some time ago:

             Years ago through work I attended a conference with women who worked in the field of sexual assault. I was sickened when they told me that they had seen a lot of cases where infant girls were raped. It was sometimes difficult to prove the rape took place because when babies are born they have a lot of estrogen circulating in their bodies from their mother. This estrogen is present for the first 6 months and makes their vaginas very pliable. They said pedos who rape babies know this!

             Yes. If any movie or mention of a movie ever deserved the “NSFW” tag, its this one. Never saw it but heard about it years ago. Surprised none of us have thought to analyze it until now but maybe it’s a good thing. This movie isn’t for the faint of heart by any stretch of the imagination.

              I know.  I could not read it all.  Notice we have not banned it nor France.  Kind of telling.   There are no words for this.

              Yeah, thanks.  Nothing against the post.  Some can read, I read about half.  Notice it's not banned here nor in France.  France harbors Roman Polanski and we have our Woody Allen.  Two artistes of movies that are still revered.  Are these snuff artists revered here too

              Welcome - you can do this yourself by hitting the 'toggle NSFW' button when or after submitting a post, when you think it might be appropriate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, you can always add a 'very graphic - trigger warning' at the top of a post, if you think it's appropriate. :-)
