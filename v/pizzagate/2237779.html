<p>According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Ahr was arrested and charged on Oct. 11 with several felony counts. According to investigators, Ahr sent and received hundreds of child porn images since 2014 — some depicting infants and toddlers as well as “sadomasochistic abuse and abuse involving children and animals,” the Inquirer reported.</p>

<p>After retrieving the iPad and analyzing it, authorities said they found additional illegal images on the device. Investigators said Ahr tried to delete the pictures from the device.</p>

             Don't know if it's the same woman because they only posted her story. Gibson had her photo posted, but Dourif? Oh, if she turns out to be this skanky actress ... ????? And did you notice the salary The Kenyan family is paying her and her husband for "housekeeping" duties? Damn! Why is it so much more than the going rate? Are the Dourifs doing anything special to warrant the extra cash?!!!!

            This has to be a mixture of intergenerational satanism and mutation of inbreeding genes. 
All the men I have encountered in my life were obsessed with all things mature female (no need to elaborate) The idea of infant being made subject of anything but teddy bears and wholesome love is beyond anything I can conjur and I may not even want to take a glimpse. Again, I am 44, and all the friends I grew up with, all the blokes at the local gym - we all talk about women, period!!!!  PG is a special kind of sickness that needs to be eradicated from this earth.

             It's INCEST.  And the most common forms are a Father sexually abusing daughter,
Step-father sexually abusing daughter and Brother sexually abusing daughter.
Females are most often the victims -- more than 80? -- Males about 12%.

             Freud knew this when he told his lies in the "Oedipus Complex" and made the outrageous
suggestion that it is infants, toddlers and young children who are the sexual aggressors 
against adult males in their families. Freud's patients -- females and males -- confided to 
Freud their sexual abuse by adult males in their families -- fathers, grandfathers, uncles,
male cousins -- and male friends of the family.

             You should look up studies on Pedophilia and INCEST --
Also realize that CIA's MKULTRA is very much involved in what is happening today.
Also keep in mind what John Stockwell (former CIA and long time whistleblower/YouTube)
says of the CIA -- i.e., "Catholics In Action."

             Think about that, plus information which seems to suggest that the Vatican
invent ISLAM.  In other words, all of the religious violence of the world was
pretty much carried out by the Vatican ---
2,000 years of persecution of Jews, Pope Pius XII catapulting Hitler to power,
Crusades, "The Inquisition" and "The Hammer of Witches" which all the way to 
actually burning women they labelled "witches" at the stake.  After filling the soil
of Europe with bloodletting ....
            </p>
            <p>
             Columbus considered it his most import duty here was to spread Christianity ..
Papal Edicts called for the "Enslavement or killing" of Africans here and native 
people here whom they labelled "pagans" ... "who were only fit to be fed to dogs.".
Genocide was carried out on 112 million native people here and on the out islands.
And their land was stolen.

             The Old World Religions -- which came thousands and thousands of years before 
organized patriarchal (male-supremacist) religions.  The Old Religions were centered
in NATURE.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is Organized Patriarchal religions which invented "Satan" and the "Devil" --
"Heaven" and "Hell."  These are the boogey-men used to control members.
"The World is Meant to be Afraid."
            </p>
            <p>
             That does not mean that violent rituals aren't carried out -- 
It simply means that even the cover of "Satanism" is intended to 
frighten people away from investigating.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.
Patriarchal religions underpin Elite Patriarchy.
"Manifest Destiny" and "Man's Dominion Over Nature" were granted 
as licenses to Elite/wealthy to exploit Nature, Natural Resources, 
Animal-Life --- and even other human beings according to various myths
of "inferiority."
            </p>
            <p>
             What we see still going on today with disrespect for females is very much
related to the teachings of these religions.  The Vatican today still does not
recognize the full personhood of females as it recognizes the full personhood
of males and bans them from participation in ritual and church authority.

             From what I've read, studies show that MALES are our sexual abusers of children.
Even right wing women's groups agree with that -- Family Research Council.

              Good luck getting the males on here to care about male on female violence statistics. It's probably the biggest example of the cognitive dissonance of Voat, and one of the only statistics I wish they'd acknowledge seriously.

               The primary example is smoking, yet when the Congress began to be clear
about the lies of Big Tobacco and the reality of CANCER in America, then
so many gave up smoking that it became possible for Americans to actually 
be see counter-advertising which exposed the severity of the health risks.
               <br/>
               While smoking hasn't been banned, indoor smoking pretty much has been and 
the costs of cigarettes is now something like $7 a pack, I think.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the most common exposures to "male on female violence" has also been
domestic violence which can affect the lives of children well into their adult years.
I know many males hold those memories as a negative impact on their childhood.
               <br/>
               And while it doesn't work as well as we might hope it would, we now have more 
involvement of police in domestic violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think males also have lived under the belief that exposing sexual abuse -- whether
INCEST by a father or another male family member -- would be a waste of time and
make him look weak.
And that has absolutely been true as Freud lied to the public in "Oedipus Complex."
Children weren't believed and somehow or other it seemed to be even more of a 
taboo for a male to admit that he was sexually abused.
               <br/>
               But I think we have to agree that times are changing on that score as well now.
              </p>
              <p>
               The organized pornography industry -- especially as it has spread over the internet
providing tens of billions of dollars in profits for Comcast and Verizon - does great 
harm to females of every age.
Comcast and Verizon are also very obviously seeking to move pornography into 
more mainstream programming.  As those watching the industry note, it is easily 
available to males as young as 8 years old. 
It's also being made clear that male addiction to pornography has grown to be a 
very serious problem where it has caused loss of their jobs and loss of their 
families as their wives discover the addiction.
While it continues to be almost impossible for females to respond to organized 
pornography and to defend themselves from the harm being done ... at the same
time many more males seem to be aware that the females performing in these 
videos are victims, themselves.  Usually of sexual abuse and often under threat of
violence to appear in the videos.  The sexual violence in these videos is also 
limiting the time that females can spend in the industry -- think it's down to something
now like three months -- because it is doing such harm to women's bodies.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's also beyond hypocritical for males to fume and rage here about sexual abuse of
children when perhaps at the very same time they are watching the sexual abuse of
females on internet porn channels.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here a quote I picked up along the way ...
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                "Pornography consumption -- both violent and non-violent --
is associated with verbal and physical sexual aggression."
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Many males are changing the identity of manhood - every day we see 
more and more males pushing baby carriages and nurturing children -
and dealing with the difficulties of handling a few kids at one time.
And they're doing a good job of it and proud of it.  (Thankfully)

              We live in the age (and have lived in the age of misandry) It has always been the norm for women to exploit men for material gain. All the hazardous occupations are performed buy men and suicide rate among males is 7 times higher than in women. The thing about male brain is that it is always born a female begore hormones seep in and start to restructure it and during restruvturing things go wrong that is why we see mos of the defects (all kibds, and yes homosexuality is a defect) in males. Men are disposable. But at the same time men are equipped with the most noble qualities that are frankly alien to our female counterparts. With respect to PG I had expected outrage from mothers and women in general but what I am seeing is actually outrage and fury from men for pure men without defects do not seek positions of power and do not use power to oppress. Perhaps we need to reform our social system where such men will run governments. As for a woman in power, the only thing that Hillart Rhodam Clinton has proved to us is that a woman in power can be every bit as corrupt as a man.

               OK ... I've had a chance to check your story of Countess Elizabeth Bathory . . .
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Elizabeth Báthory in popular culture
               </strong>
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory_in_popular_culture">
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory_in_popular_culture
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               This story rises in 1729 as told by a JESUIT scholar ...
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Modern historians Radu Florescu and Raymond T. McNally have concluded that the theory Báthory murdered on account of her vanity sprang up from contemporary prejudices about gender roles. Women were not believed to be capable of violence for its own sake. At the beginning of the 19th century, the vanity motif was first questioned, and sadistic pleasure was considered a far more plausible motive for Báthory's crimes.[4] In 1817, the witness accounts (which had surfaced in 1765) were published for the first time,[5] demonstrating that the bloodbaths or blood seeker for vanity aspect of Báthory's crimes were legend rather than fact.
               </p>
               <p>
                The legend nonetheless persisted in the popular imagination. Some versions of the story were told with the purpose of denouncing female vanity, while other versions aimed to entertain or thrill their audience. Some versions of the story incorporated even more elaborate torture chamber fantasies than recorded history could provide, such as the use of an iron maiden, which were not based on the evidence from Báthory's trial. Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, whose name inspired the term masochism, was inspired by the Báthory legend to write his 1874 novella Ewige Jugend ("eternal youth")[6]
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Let's also recall that the RCC set new precedents of torture/violence in their "Inquisition" which
included the "Iron Maiden."
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not saying this story isn't true -- but 650 victims by one woman hardly compares in
any way with the violence done throughout the ages by males.  One victim would be too many.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, how many males have lost their lives on battlefields where they were sent by other males
of authority and power to serve in wars which only benefitted Elites?
              </p>
              <p>
               One common link between Stalin and Hitler is the number of deaths they each totaled up ...
but also the fact that each was severely beaten by their fathers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mafia figure, Sam Giancana, also tells a story of vicious beatings by his father --
in one example relating that his father would tie him to a tree in the backyard,
beat him and then leave him there.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over and again, we see that violence only breeds more violence and we
all need to continue to move away from those who act out in violence or use
it for their own profit.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sadly, that pretty much describes our own government in its insanities --
and in it's "illegal wars of aggression."

               The ironic part is that misandry as a word didn't exist even 10 years ago. It's such an accepted thing that there was never a word for it until quite recently. Male disposability has always been an accepted part of life.

And the word Patriarchy was never examined - it is in fact a sociopathic/psychopathic male ruling class who subjugates its own gender - regular men have never benefited from Patriarchy - only women have - taking them to divorce courts and fleecing them to feed the Cabal! Bet they don't teach that in Feminism class - how on earth do we expect them to grasp sonething as mindboggling as Pizzagate?

              <p>
               Wow, you're understanding of life is really turned upside down.
Where did women ever run "Crusades" or "Inquisitions" or Burn Men at the Stake?
              </p>
              <p>
               Where is it anywhere in the world where females have been oppressing males for 50,000 years?
              </p>
              <p>
               When was it that females barred males from higher education or the professions?
              </p>
              <p>
               Additionally, the only way that males get here is through the body of a woman ... women love their daughters and their sons and nurture them equally.  And families have certainly always supported their sons -- and let's hope that today they also support their daughters ... but in earlier times they certainly did not.
              </p>
              <p>
               BECAUSE it was the norm for Patriarchy to suppress females -- most especially after so many males had died in the Crusades and women began to inherit their property and wealthy -- women were forced into marriages and prostitution in order to support themselves.  Those who weren't being accused of being "witches" that is because those women were being burned for their knowledge of Nature and plants which are our medicines.
              </p>
              <p>
               Women have NO control over the professions ... Elites patriarchy does. 
If men go to war, then it is because Elite patriarchy has dictated that ... but remember that can only be accomplished if they first break the bond between males and women and children.  And, yes, they have done that successfully ...
as you are making clear in expressing your feelings and thoughts on women.
              </p>
              <p>
               Men are the weaker sex -- more males die in miscarriages and more die of other causes up until about the ages of 2 years old.  Males also die earlier -- that's always been true.  The model for life is female.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, I think science still today wonders whether the Y is actually only a broken X.
              </p>
              <p>
               Homosexuality is no more a "defect" than heterosexuality is ... Nor is bi-sexuality a defect.
               <br/>
               I'm sure you don't consider your heterosexuality a defect.  When did you decide on that choice?
In between homosexuality and heterosexuality there are differing degrees of feminine/masculine balance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Men are NOT "disposable" .... but their fears and paranoia make them think that they are....
mainly because of what they see in the domestication of animals which is animal-abuse, actually
              </p>
              <p>
               Women/parents see children as spirits, personalities, human beings -- not something disposable.

               Most of our history is propaganda written by white males.

              <p>
               We live in the age (and have lived in the age of misandry) It has always been the norm for women to exploit men for material gain. All the hazardous occupations are performed buy men and suicide rate among males is 7 times higher than in women. The thing about male brain is that it is always born a female before hormones seep in and start to restructure it and during the restructuring things go wrong that is why we see most of the defects, physical as well as psychological (all kinds, and yes homosexuality is a defect) in males. Men are disposable. But at the same time HEALTHY men are equipped with the most noble qualities that are frankly alien to our female counterparts. With respect to PG I had expected outrage from mothers and women in general (exceptions such as Melissa Zaccaria, Liz Crokin &amp; others)but what I am seeing is actually outrage and fury from men for pure men without defects do not seek positions of power and do not use power to oppress and more importantly loath abominations such as pedophilia. Through our complacency we have allowed weak degenerate men to run our institutions. Perhaps we need to reform our social system where only the healthy noble men alongside healthy noble women in perfect balance will run governments. As for a woman &amp; corruption, the only thing that Hillary Rhodam Clinton has proved to us is that a woman in power can be every bit as corrupt as a man. As for the macabre it should not surprise us that the title of the worst serial killer belongs to a woman - Wealthy Countess Elizabeth Bathori in a quest of finding eternal youth, had bathed in blood of the 600+ kidnapped girls ranging from toddlers to early teens. It is time let go of prejudice and come together to fight evil in all of its incarnations.

                Pedophilia and Homosexuality go hand in hand. The globalists are playing divie and rule. Men and women complement each other. Men and women are both virtous and are capable of vice but they manifest it in different ways. You are playing right into globalist paradigm who want to demonise nuclear family.

                 Elite patriarchy -- which is the source of our problems -- is difficult for the average person
to comprehend as to the extent of its evil.  These are people who wake up every day trying
to figure out how to gain control over other people -- and they will easily use violence to do it.
MKULTRA is one indication of all of that in its efforts to gain Mind Control over others and in
the sexual abuse and torture it was willing to use -- and did use -- and is probably still using --
in its efforts to control others.

                 I do agree with this is best explained by Royals having morphed into corporations.

                <p>
                 True, men may think they benefit from Elite patriarchy, but of course they don't.
They would benefit themselves by re-bonding with women and children.

                 It's amazing to see right now that Iranians and Iraqis on the border of the earthquake
are helping one another.  And yet, our president is still ignoring the situation in Puerto
Rico where citizens need help and are still without power and necessities.

                <p>
                 And don't know where you got the statistic you're alleging in regard to gay men
(500 to 2000 partners in a lifetime) but I see nothing which validates that claim,
except one website which seemed to be religious.

                 <strong>
                  Here's the Guardian on that subject ....
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  There is only a one percentage point difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals in their promiscuity: 98% of gay people have had 20 or fewer sexual partners; 99% of straight people have had the same number. Tellingly, OkCupid found that it is just 2% of gay people that are having 23% of the total reported gay sex.&lt;
For the first time we have a statistical glimpse into an unreported truth: that your average gay person's sex life is every bit as dreary and unremarkable as a heterosexual's. But that a tiny proportion of them are freakishly promiscuous. Sex, it would seem, is distributed as unevenly as money.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 And yet, that is not the narrative we have been fed. The idea of the rampaging predatory homosexual is so ingrained in the western psyche as to inform not only fear, hatred and abuse but also policy and laws. Part of the justification of Bill Clinton's risible "don't ask, don't tell" policy, preventing gay people in the military from coming out, was fuelled by the belief that in doing so their straight colleagues would either feel at risk or actually be at risk of unwanted sexual advances.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  And here is where these online statistics get even more interesting. Gay people, apparently, don't even want sex with straight people. Just 0.6% of gay men on the site, for example, have ever searched for straight "matches". And just 0.1% of lesbians have. The theoretical idea of the heterosexual male might be appealing for gay men – a tryst with Brad Pitt or George Clooney, perhaps – but in practice we are making no efforts to turn the theory into a reality. There wasn't even one single gay user of the website who predominantly searched for straight users. Not one. Straight men of the world, you are safe.

                  The article closes with these thoughts ...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  With the recent spate of teenage gay suicides in the US, our media needs urgently to tell a new story: that of the happy, everyday gay person, who is largely accepted for who they are, who leads a life of dignity, value and meaning but whose love life may not always be very exciting.

                 I'd also challenge your statistics based on the fact that PEDOPHILES have many
victims ... but generally the highest numbers I've heard even for RCC priests who
have widespread access to young children in their parishes has been 100 victims
over their careers as pedophiles active in the church.

                 And, coincidentally, this is all happening at a time when Trump wants to end abortion/choice
and we have new attacks on emergency conception and birth control/contraceptives.

                 I'd say that those who speak the sanity of population control in order to lessen the impact
on the planet still have LESS power than those Elite Patriarchs who still work to ensure that
doesn't happen.

             I so agree with you. It has to be. The subject never even came up! Yeah, lots of my friends had pics of nude women, but they were women as in adult!

             It makes me wonder if they start out like that, or it's a matter of getting a bigger and bigger thrill/adrenaline rush. Maybe that's where the layers and layers of depravity set in because just a pinch of it doesn't work anymore.

             The authorities have to weed these sick-o's out and give them sentences that will protect society. Of course, LaLa Land has already passed legislation that makes it impossible to give a life sentence to a pedo. What can you expect from a place that houses all that demonic activity? But let's keep this going. Tons more left to come out.

            Make no mistake about it.
            <strong>
             This
            </strong>
            is also a part of what they are trying to normalize.  If i had told you 20 years ago that the Supreme Court of the United States would rule that men marrying men is a guaranteed provision in the U.S. Constitution,  you would have said that i belong in a mental hospital.
            <strong>
             This
            </strong>
            is next in line.  Read the writings of the great occultists of the 20th Century.  Love, compassion, empathy, and all the other redeeming characteristics of Humanity are silly wastes of time and energy.  They are to be replaced by strict Luciferian utility.  If you want to do it, and you can get away with it,
            <strong>
             do it
            </strong>
            .   It is being implemented degree by degree
            <strong>
             daily
            </strong>
            .  Think i belong in a mental hospital for thinking this could ever happen?  Look back 20 years.  And anyway if you have
            <strong>
             love, compassion, or empathy
            </strong>
            ,  you belong in the mental hospital with me. You admittedly have what is a
            <strong>
             firmly established
            </strong>
            mental disorder.  We both suffer from codependency.  Geeze i get sicker by the minute.  20 years ago i was only homophobic.  Go figure.

             It's funny how it's Christ who says to show mercy to those who commit a sexual sin.  What about love, compassion, empathy and other redeeming characteristics when he hasn't actually raped someone.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's Christ who pointed out that the worst in us would use religious ideas as an excuse to harm others, and that that isn't his doctrine.

               I'm not suggesting people should sin.  I'm only suggesting we should stop grandstanding on how tough we want to punish other people.  It's ironic when people virtue signal their own morality doing that, in an expression of "christian" values when it's clear what Christ's teachings are in regard not to the sinner but to the prospective enforcer.  I agree with you in his teaching to the sinner but the enforcer needs to learn that is not vindication to himself.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember that Babylon and Asyria destroyed Isreal for its wickedness but that Isiah talks as much about the punishments for them for having done so as much as it rebukes Isreal.  Should you attempt to destroy the sinner in a form a righteous judgement you also will be destroyed.  The sinner will be destroyed but don't set yourself up as Babylon.

                Who is suggesting to "destroy" anybody?  Are laws against pedophilia an attempt to "destroy" the pedophile, or is it to protect children and maintain standards of societal behavior?  We all see articles sympathetic to pedophilia starting to appear in mainstream newspapers and magazines.  It is clearly the same approach that led to what was an unthinkable ruling by the Supreme Court recently about constitutional guarantees of same sex marriage.  Before his recent death Justice Scalia noted that it was a decision with no underlying basis in any law of any nation, in any philosophy or religious system, or any societal norm or teaching.  It was a decision not taken out of even thin air. It came from a total vacuum of supporting basis.  I condemn no one, and I seek not to destroy anyone.  The question is what norms and values do we support or reject as a society, and what
                <strong>
                 behaviors
                </strong>
                do we teach our children are acceptable and unacceptable.  I am a libertarian.  I care not what any consenting adults practice as long as they harm no other person.  But that extends to everyone.  You have absolute right to your opinions, values, and beliefs.  But everyone else has the same rights that you have.

                 The issue is that the child pornography viewer statistically has no cross over with the performance of contact crimes.  The basis of punishing someone who has viewed cp is reflexive of disgust rather than a protective imperative.  In fact it is at odds with the protective imperative because it implements the same policy as copyright just with different intent and facilitates the coordination of supply and demand which would not happen without artificial conditions.  Media markets require artificial conditions to operate.  The variable cost of a duplicate of a file is zero so the supply curve is hugged against the x axis and no demand (price x quantity) can be generated under normal market conditions.  Demand being generated is necessary to convert 1st order demand into 2nd order demand via an NPV of expected inflows.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In essence, keeping with austrian principles we need to avoid being positivists who believe that the intent of the policy effects the outcome.  In the case of copyright the person who did not patronize the market is punished.  This is the initial effect, the one we caused.  The secondary effect is that a commercial market can operate.  This secondary effect is the knock-on effect we are looking for.  In cp prosections the person who did not pay for media is punished.  The secondary effect that we are looking for is that child pornography as a practice ceases.  The tertiary effect is commercial markets can operate and production costs and risks can be offset.

                 CV/CR &gt; FV/FR.  Because risk and all other elements of that formula are on distributions there is always some number of people on the frontier of that inequality such that any shift in FR will lead to a number of people for whom the inequality because true, meaning the contribute to a demand curve.  The formula for copyright is CV/P &gt; FV/FR, where P is price.  This is the value conversion efficiency formula and is the same one the dictates investment selection and really all selection in business (most common being ROI or Profit/Investment, converting one set of scarce resources for another).  CV/(P+CR) &gt; FV/FR, solving for P is P &lt; CV
                 <em>
                  FR/FV - CR.  Admitting another price formula P &lt; CV - CR, meaning we can know the contribution to the demand curve is P = CV
                 </em>
                 min(1,FR/FV) - CR.  It is important to note that these are all distributions and not variables.  The second FR gains an above zero value market demand is allowed to operate as it is a multiple of our only positive term.  The CR component is very ineffective because subtracting a distribution from a distribution makes very little progress.  It is essentially the same as creating a market then implementing a prohibition on it.  We can't keep drugs out of prisons while all people have cameras on them at all times and all goods moved in and out are under tight control and nothing goes through the pod's airlock style doors without searches.  An attempt at prohibiting commercial child pornography is impossible when it implies having control over people across the world in remote regions and controlling the control of encrypted data.  The only way to prevent commercial child pornography is to not allow it's development in the first place as was the case before these laws took off after the kylie freedman case.  We reacted to an anecdote and got back statistics and this problem is growing because people do not see that their intent does not have an impact on the effect of a law.

                 This is what I think Christ means by resist not evil.  Because the people who are most zealous to resist evil often think emotively rather than consequentially and they often make things worse, as often is the case in the drug war or the war on poverty.  The media wouldn't even exist to be exchanged if we hadden't made these mistakes.  The recent case of the guy who ran the most notorious ring so far was able to get reduced sentence due to mitigating factors of having both autism and schizophrenia.  He apparently could not feel any sense of empathy in any case and had no attraction to children was acting purely on market factors.  The guy essentially conducted the production of child snuff films in the Philippians from America.  FR is going up currently because of increase sentencing and increased enforcement on p2p to the point that the current trend is to put all content (even prior pirated content) behind paywall.  This means that while in the past 1/1000 would be a participant in a commercial coordination of supply and demand and that was enough to motivate the worst commercial action seen in history, the participation rate is going to be closer to 25% now that low hanging fruit has been unwisely plucked by law enforcement.  The NPV of 25% participation rate is going to be huge.  Every dishonest creep is going to be chasing that money, when prior there was none.

                 In minimum wage policy the original advocates were eugenicists (early progressive movement) and felt that minimum wage would price out the least competent and make them even poorer and keep them from developing enough to marry and form families.  Today others argue to use minimum wage to lift the poor out of poverty.  The same policy cannot serve two outcomes based on our intent for it.  If you wanted to be a really evil person and say we want to implement copyright so we get maximum child porn production you would do the same things that are being done today.

             You are spot on. That's exactly what is taking place. I really feel like a fool in being pro-gay rights. The Christian right had it correct. It opened a floodgate because it was all part of an agenda, but it was never presented that way. And because the alt-left Luciferians control PedoWood and the entertainment industry, the Christians that spoke out were RIDICULED and harassed for being zealots! The comedians would tell jokes about them, then go home and rape children. If only we knew.

              What used to be the go-to example for explaining the slippery slope fallacy is now reality. I no longer know if the "slippery slope fallacy" even exists.

                It's sick to me people joke about shit like that and then call those who dislike sick jokes like that pussies. Those type of people work in kitchens though, so you know they are already without souls.

If I had told you that a gay porn director and a homosexual pedophile named Terry Bean would be flying on Air Force-1 alongside gay president with a fake birth certificate and his tranny look alike wife would arrange an actual tranny dressed like a demon to be reading to children at a public library you would have told me to stop drinking kool aid! This is where we are!

            Because I don't want to be misunderstood, I'm giving a small disclaimer to my comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying that there's reasonable doubt here in this case. While I 100% believe that Pedogate is real and that many politicians (particularly on the left) are vile sickos or have somehow been compromised to be controllable,
            <strong>
             it's also a bit scary to instantly believe every single digital accusation in an era where Snowden/Assange have been verifying that the CIA has an infinite number of backdoors and hacks in the last few years to get into any commercial computer system
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Just playing devil's advocate and I think pointing out the obvious.

             The point is well-taken and you are correct. But the other thing to be aware of is that demanding justice is not hysteria. Nor is it a conspiracy. We have a lot of opposing forces trying to create a dissonance so let's keep focused. Remember, McCarthy started to clean-up PedoWood and was stopped by turning the spin around on him. So he became the outcast and the sweeping out of the socialists was never completed. I wonder if he knew about the rest of the corruption, and I'm sure he did. But the point is that it can't happen again. We only know the tiny bit that's come out. We really don't know what's done in those underground chambers where they hold rituals or do whatever the hell it is that they do.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, yes. You do have a point.

            The site makes sure to mention that he's a Democrat quite a few times.  You have to go to other articles to find that he's nothing but a township board president.  His identity is hardly "Democrat."

            How about not using toddler porn to score political points.  We should all know by know this issue goes well beyond political parties.

             I tried to warn the OP to rise above the political dualism. The truth bomb will sting less. This problem is in both parties and it’s high up in both so many from both sides will go down.

             In fact in 2006 a pedophile scandal was being swept under the rug that has come to be known as Pagegate which was a mirror image of PG involving republicans. Dennis Hasterd played a prominent role!

            When I hear talk of alien life on earth, including our DNA, I attribute horror like this to something non "human", or whatever "normal" people are comprised of.  There is no refrom, punishment, etc. - take the POS out back and put a bullet in its head.  That's the only recourse.

             Remember last year? A mega child trafficking bust in Norway codenamed Operation Dark Room, around PG broke - they found toddlers being tortured and raped! 51 arrests were being made,... and strangley enough it made it to WP and was pulled down the last minute!

               Well, if you read occult literature, there really is a case made for some people not having souls. Don't know if you're into esoteric stuff, but there's this HUGE delineation between hu-man and man. One has the breath of spirit, the other does not.

                But at which point would people loose their souls? When touching a child, when penetrating it, when they repeat the offense? And what about those who prefer raping adults? And those who don't rape anyone, but severely harm them in other ways?
               </p>
               <p>
                As I see it, there are different degrees of degeneration, but I believe all humans have souls. I'm always open to suggested readings though - any book, website or video you'd recommend?

                 I really don't remember the books I've read. Usually the whole subject of souls came up even though the book was marketed as such. Just buy old books written on the subject of spirituality. Even The Cathars, a religious group that was marked for extermination, divided people into three groups. Only one group was considered capable of receiving illumination.

             Here's a study on pedophiles --
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Focus on the Facts" -- Sean Cahill, PH.D
             </p>
             <p>
              A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
             </p>
             <p>
              Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
              <br/>
              A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
             </p>
             <p>
              Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.
Footnote 65 -- p.123
             </p>
             <p>
              A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."
              <br/>

             <p>
              In an earlier study of convicted male child molesters in Massachusetts, none of the 175 men were found to have an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation or to be primarily attracted to other adult men.

                It's the Vatican -- one of the most violent and secretive male-supremacist organizations --
which continues to try to push that story in their continuing war on homosexuals.
The Vatican was only interested in males willing to produce children with women for new
members.  And, in fact, the war on homosexuals over 2,000 years was so fierce that 
homosexual males were forced into marrying women and many actually had children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also keep in mind -- that the Vatican also created ISLAM -- in another deception which
continues to work for their benefit and confuse citizens everywhere.

                In other words, pretty much all of the religious wars/persecutions were the work of the Vatican/RCC...
Crusades, The Inquisition, The Hammer of Witches where they actually did burn women they had 
labelled "witches" at the stake.  1,500 years of persecution of Jews. All of the Islamic violence.

                And here, the Papal Edicts to "enslave or kill" were followed by the invaders ... and the Africans enslaved here - and native people here they labelled "pagans ... only fit to be fed to dogs" (112 million of them) were killed.
And what was behind it all, except conquest and stealing of land and free labor.

               There are many statistics that contradict this claim. Here is one; According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS 2005) Personal Safety Survey, 12 percent of women and 4.5 percent of men in Australia report having been sexually abused before the age of 15 years yet only 1.6% of men in Australia identify as homosexual.

              <p>
               Any male who rapes or molests a boy in my opinion is gay or at least bi. However many of the men who do this are not openly gay and many are even married to women as a cover for their secret life. BUT you cannot by definition of their same sex attraction to male boys call them straight. This is how they come up with their numbers of abusers by only counting pedophiles gay if they are 'out'. This is part of the coverup. Listen to abuse survivor and whistle blower David Shurter who happens to be gay himself explain what really goes on.

                The above says nothing about WHO our sexual abusers of children are.
                <br/>
                They are MALES which even the right wing women's group confirms (Family Research Council).
               </p>
               <p>
                Your statistics do confirm that the majority of VICTIMS are female.

               <p>
                But then you add this:  &gt;yet only 1.6% of men in Australia identify as homosexual&gt;
               </p>
               <p>
                First of all, what this this have to do with sexual abuse of children.
As I said in my post, &gt;heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child.&gt;
               </p>
               <p>
                Additionally, not all homosexuals are willing to acknowledge being gay.  In many areas, it is
still dangerous to be homosexuals.  I guess the most lasting myths come from "Christianity."
After 2,000 years of preaching the "abomination" of homosexuality by the RCC we can't 
expect it to be reversed overnight.

                Many people believe that but it's not what statistics show.   A true pedophile is labelled 
according to the AGES of the children they molest.  That's what pedophilia is about ...
the AGE of the child.
               </p>
               <p>
                Basically, from what I've read pedophiles have no actual sexual orientation.
               </p>
               <p>
                HOWEVER, in the case of "situational" pedophiles, they are men who prefer a relationship
with a female, but when there is no female available, they will rape a child -- an infant, toddler.
               </p>
               <p>
                Many homosexuals were forced by persecution of them into the "closet" ... and many did marry
females and some even had children.  But that doesn't make them pedophiles.
Homosexuals have fought to end their oppression in order to be able to come out of the "closet"
and to form open relationships with other adult homosexuals.

                Not really familiar with David Schurter -- but if he's gay it seems odd that he refers to gays as "living a 
gay lifestyle" as most homosexuals (and heterosexuals) think that sexual orientation is a "lifestyle" or choice, but something we came into the world with.    We don't consider being heterosexual a "lifestyle."  And many of know at very early ages what our sexual orientation is.  But, I am taking a look at what Shurter is saying ... and he's discussing the 80's which was also the beginning of AIDS/HIV. In US cases were being reported in June 1981.

                 If 4.5% of Australian men have been molested (yes by men I agree totally on that) out of a population of 20mill people thats approx 450 000 boy victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If 1.6% of Australian men are gay thats approx 160 000 gay men in Australia. Lets say 1million to be sure. So 450 000 boys have been molested by 1million gay men.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Straight guys dont want sex with other males old, young or infant- that is the very definition of straight.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On the other hand there are over 9million straight men and 12% of women are  molested as children thats 1 200 000 female victims. More overall but not relative to the size of the potentional pool of perpertrators(9mill).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Based on these figures gay men ( or bisexuals) have a much higher likely hood of offending. Gay/Bi 50% chance straights a l0% chance. It sucks either way and I'm not anti gay Im just doing the math.
                </p>

                 I believe David Shurter is talking about the 'promiscuous gay lifestlye' and what he saw as part of that crowd ( for example one person hasving 1000s of sexual partners not uncommon) but he clearly states in that video not all gay people are part of the 'lifestyle'.

                 I feel really sorry for all the good gay men who get unfairly labelled. I know a lot of them would never harm a child but as a society we have to face that statistically this community harbours a higher percentage  sexual predators. 🙁

                  First problem you have with your estimate is that FEMALES are 82% of the victims and males 12% 
according to studies/statistics.
That would mean that the 4.5% only represents 12% of the victims of pedophiles.
The number of Australian victims if you add in females would be vast.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Second -- usually estimates of homosexuals are underestimated -- 20% is more likely.
In fact, I've read that any heterosexual couple has a 30% chance of having a homosexual child.
Obviously, Nature sees a need for diversity -- and perhaps also for some control on procreation.
Also to provide someone to care for the many children who are orphaned.
In fact, in Hawaii before the coming of the white man, homosexuals were held in high esteem
and honor for their care of orphaned children there.

                  <strong>
                   Straight guys dont want sex with other males old, young or infant- that is the very definition of straight.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Actually, if you recall the song ... "My Buddy, My Buddy .. your Buddy misses you...."
you'll find that it's a song about heterosexual males in wartime.

                  In our US prisons we have 200,000 male on male rapes every year ... certainly NOT by
homosexuals who are most frequently the victims.
And what studies show is that immediately upon release from prison these men will
rape a woman ... "in order to prove their manhood."
                  <br/>
                  So likely, many of the victims are also heterosexual.

                  It's pretty clear that you don't like the studies and statistics .... 
but clearly MALES are our sexual abusers of children.
Freud knew this long ago but liked to the public -- and presently Freud, himself,
is under suspicion of being a pedophile.
At that time, it was well understood by FREUD (from his victims/both male and female)
that those who had sexually abused them in their childhood were fathers, grandfathers,
uncles, male cousins and male friends of the family.
Most of them likely to be heterosexual.

                  The "promiscuous gay life style" seems largely fiction to demean and degrade homosexuals.
However, certainly they had to seek out lovers in secret -- fearful of any encounter with another male.
Let's remember, it was highly dangerous for these men (and women) who were regularly beaten and
often murdered because of their sexual orientation.  All in the name of "Christianity," actually.

                  Haven't really been able to see or read anything more of David Shurter who seems to be some
kind of a journalist.  But I'll keep him in mind for further review.  So is Shurter himself saying he
also had 1000's of sexual partners ... or that he was just in those places reporting on what was
happening?  Did he watch these activities out in the open?

                 <p>
                  And ... Catholic Church certainly active in both nations ... and very much a part
of the story of sexual abuse of children, both here in US and in Australia.

                  (I've loved some of the Australian movies on the RCC -- think one was

                 <p>
                  Studies seem conclusive on this issue -- but obviously it isn't a subject that the powers
that be want explored in any very specific ways.
                  <br/>
                  Nor do they want to discuss bi-sexuality.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Just think of it -- most people in the population (parents) haven't even been told that it 
is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children.

                   A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.

                   Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.

                   Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
                   <br/>
                   A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

                   Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.&gt;

                   A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

             I know. It's appalling.

             This is just a glimpse of the sickness we're fighting. These people are devoid of any redeemable value and as soul-less as any demon in hell. And this perv is at the periphery. You can imagine how horrific the more you penetrate the rings to get to the real power. They must be absolute abominations. They've got to be exposed, tried, and thrown in prison ... forever.

             There is no cure for this.
