            As a spiritual lightworker I have seen demonic possession first hand. This isn't going to be a war against some corrupt politicians folks. This is a war against Satan himself which has infiltrated these puppets all the way to the upper eschalon of control. What do you think is happening when they do all those Satanic rituals? They are farming energy and also inviting in demonic possession. Again, these aren't "people" as we see them, they are compromised hosts to this Satanic "virus". Demons can't manifest in our wavelength, so they have to use people as hosts to have a physical effect on our reality. Our reality has been hijacked. Christ is returning soon, but not in the physical form either. Christ consciousness will soon envelop this planet and anyone having the right frequency will gain higher consciousness to fight Satan. I suggest you read the book of revelation and pay close attention to: The Whore of Babylon and Satan the beast which deceived the whole world. We are living in prophetic times. Things are about to get real. One Love is the only way out of this now.

            Reality is the state of things that exist and not a notional idea of reality. We can use critical thinking using things that exist (leaked emails/website/photos/symbols/evidence etc etd) or we can use conjecture and things not based yet in reality (David Ickes opinion). So for now, let's not dig too deep until we get stuck in cloud cukoo land. Focus on what there is. Otherwise you just lose focus.

            As an atheist/skeptic, I have considered that possibility (despite my inclination to not believe it), that we are dealing with real occult magic here. Perhaps atheism/skepticism is itself a conspiracy to keep the existence of real black magic under wraps, so that only elites can use it. However, without further evidence I just find the existence of actual magic really hard to believe. The satanic rituals could serve other functions besides just blackmail, without needing to assume that they're working with real black magic. Rituals establish group solidarity and can even be enjoyable in their own way. Certainly, rituals have been a central part of human cultures for millenia, and you could argue that our modern-secular lack of ritual (or at least lack of spiritual rituals, however you choose to interpret "spiritual") is a historical anomaly and not the way humans were meant to live. Even without assuming anything supernatural, satanic rituals could release bestial/carnal/lustful "energies" within the human body, which are connected to pedophilia and human sacrifice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, as someone who is interested in aliens/UFOs, I think that if there is any "black magic" at play here, it is probably some kind of alien supertechnology that is kept hidden from us by the elites. It is well known that Hitler was seeking these occult artifacts which he believed would help ensure Nazi victory. Perhaps instead they were lost pieces of alien technology. I have heard that the nazis were constructing flying saucers towards the end, before they were defeated (not sure if that's true). But I digress, sorry.

but in all seriousness: i'm an atheist/skeptic to and i found if you look at the world with only the scientific method; you blind yourself in one eye and lose your depth perception (Figuratively speaking).
