<p>So, I\'ve been researching the issue of transgenderism in children, connected with the UN and other public bodies and I was looking at this video <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezdux0CEqV0">Transpocalypse 2019: The Beginning of the End</a> . I have a number of comments to make arising from the subject matter but for this post I\'m going to focus on the subject of medication.</p>
<p>In this article <a href="http://archive.fo/1WgeQ#selection-2055.0-2055.87">Chemical castration for autism: After three years, the mainstream media finally notices</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I first learned about the <strong>Geiers’ Lupron protocol</strong> (to my horror) back in Februrary 2006, when I first read blogger Kathleen Seidel’s account of their activities. Somehow, some way, the Geiers have managed to inject autistic children with a powerful drug that suppresses sex hormone production for over three years now. How did this all get started? First, let me explain what Lupron is.
Lupron is the trade name for a drug called leuprolide acetate, a synthetic analog of a hormone known as gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH, a.k.a. LH-RH). After causing an initial stimulation of gonadotropin receptors by binding to them, chronic administration of Lupron inhibits gonadotropin secretion, specifically leutenizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The end result is the inhibition of the synthesis of steroid hormones in the testes in men and in the ovaries in women. In men, testosterone and androgen levels fall to castrate levels, and in women estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal levels.</p>
<p><strong>This is a drug that doesn’t have very many uses. Perhaps the most common use is in men with metastatic prostate cancer</strong>, because prostate cancer is an androgen-dependent tumor. Back when I was a surgical resident, such patients were treated with surgical castration. These days, they are usually put on Lupron or a similar GnRH agonist, and this treatment works quite well to suppress the growth of prostate cancer for a while. Such tumors will inevitably develop androgen-independent growth and become resistant to hormonal suppression with Lupron, but in the meantime chemical castration with Lupron can provide excellent palliation. <strong>Another use for Lupron is in women with estrogen-dependent conditions, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids.</strong> One troubling side effect of its use in women is the onset of menopausal symptoms, often quite severe, a problem that sometimes causes women to stop taking it. The other major use of Lupron is during cycles of in vitro fertilization, in which it is used to suppress ovarian function completely in order to allow complete control of hormone levels and ovarian follicle development through the use of hormone injections. Without Lupron or similar drugs, it is very difficult to get multiple ovarian follicles to develop and mature at the same time, allowing the harvest of many eggs.</p>
<p>But we’re not talking about adults here. We’re talking about children. Are there any medically accepted uses of Lupron in children? Yes, but only one: Precocious puberty. Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of secondary sexual characteristics before 8 years old in girls and 9 years old in boys. It can be the result of tumors, central nervous system injury, or congenital anomalies.</p>
<p>...Thus even if mercury were the cause of autism, there would be no biochemical justification for the shotgun approach of using Lupron to suppress steroid hormone synthesis in boys. Remember, Lupron doesn’t just suppress testosterone production; it suppresses both the androgenic and estrogenic pathways.</p>
<p>..Once again, if you’re going to propose doing something as radical as shutting down steroid hormone synthesis in children, you’d better have damned good evidence to justify it, and the Geiers didn’t then and don’t now. The best piece of clinical evidence that suppressing testosterone might help autistic boys they can muster is a case report in which a 24-year old autistic man exhibiting severe frequent inappropriate sexual behavior who frequently masturbated in public and became sexually aroused around young children was placed on Lupron. Surprise, surprise! His inappropriate sexual behavior decreased markedly. Chemical castration will do that. This case report said nothing about what treating children with Lupron would do. (It also raised some seriously touchy ethical questions.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read the article. Basically it says that this drug was originally developed to treat prostrate cancer in men and doctors found that it can also be used to suppress the sex hormones and thought it would be an effective treatment for autistic children. Ironically, it starts off as an attack on the anti-vaccine lobby but highlights the use of the drug Lupon as a treatment for autism and possibly leading to transgenderism.  Is this why there has been a ridiculous rise in children saying they are transgender? </p>

<p>As well as prostrate cancer Lupron is used as a treatment for women who have uterine fibroids ( a common condition).. Have any studies been done about a possible link with transgender children?</p>

<p>Leuprorelin is marketed by Bayer AG under the brand name Viadur, by Tolmar under the brand name Eligard, and by TAP Pharmaceuticals (1985–2008), by Varian Darou Pajooh under the brand name Leupromer and <strong>Abbott Laboratories</strong> (2008-current) under the brand name Lupron. It is available as a slow-release implant or subcutaneous/intramuscular injection.</p>
<p>In the UK and Ireland, leuprorelin is marketed by Takeda UK as Prostap SR (one-month injection) and Prostap 3 (three-month injection).</p>

            Gyno here. It's a very short-lasting drug, a nonapeptide. It is so short lasting that they have to either put it in a special matrix to administer 28 days treatment or else you take it (or related drugs) by nasal spray. I can almost guarantee that there is no fetal effect for this reason (nothing is every 100% but it seems highly unlikely).
           </p>
           <p>
            However, you are spot-on about the autism. Absolutely no way is this a treatment for autism. What it will do is neuter your child. Autism, ADD and ADHD are more commonly in boys and so this treatment may mitigate them but it is using a pneumatic drill to crack a nut (it might work but it's much more likely to cause major damage).

              The advancement in contemporary physics has considerably improved such that roughly between 1924 and 1930s, there was an entirely new theoretical approach to dynamics developed to account for sub-atomic behaviour. Quantum mechanics or wave mechanics was popularized with the works of

              Transgender began with the Tavistock Institute.  they started with the degradation of Woman (sexual revolution/pornography/increase in sex trafficking).  Feminized men (its only ever homosexual men who make 'fashion'??  Why ? They hate women.. how can they make women look good?  Ah yes  By shoving them into men's clothing..https://www.elle.com/fashion/g8897/women-in-suits-menswear/?slide=23  - Weaponised feminism that became feminazism.. 
If you want to ask someone about the transgender agenda, may I suggest you contact :

              The OCSE chose WHO got sent to Bosnia/Yougoslavia..Resumés were collecterd and studied and only the finest pedophiles were sent..
In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments. No employee of either firm has ever been charged in these incidents. (read

              Which are very good works.. They can also be used to synthetize what the current real situations are and show what legal tools are being emplyed to combat the traffic..  certainly interesting info for someone involved in human trafficking.

                oh.. thank you in turn.. I didnt know that....
Here.. read this..

                it shows how they instigated the degredation of women through pornography and even through feminism (but that more to do with screwing up everyone's Praarabdha Kharma through role reversal but that's another thread..)
                <br/>
                Go back to Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford who was Marquess of TAVISTOCK.
His father donated the building that would be used by the Tavistock Institute to study the effects of shell shock on WW1 
troops.   He was a nazi sympathizer.. The Russels and Hamiltons..  Are they connected to the Theosophical Society as well?  I've come to understand that the eugenics movement cuts into the herrenvolk gestalt from the Thule Society, but I thought that they'd just misunderstood the Avatar principle.. the ultimate human being etc..

            , can you add a line to your submission spelling out that this is related to sexual abuse of kids by the global elite both because it demonstrates the medical establishment abusing the sexuality of kids with drugs, and also because it may point to an organized attempt to fuel a movement to lower the age of sexual consent by increasing the number of trans kids which can then be used to justify kids being able to choose their gender, launching the slippery slope to kids being able to choose to have sex with adults?

             "Her mother, the pretty daughter of Russian immigrants, suffered from childhood encephalitis, which caused a brain disorder that wasn’t diagnosed until she reached middle age. “The parts of her brain that control reason and judgment had deteriorated,” Feinstein explains, “and she could be very violent. She would periodically attempt to take her own life.” Much of Feinstein’s childhood was shadowed by her mother’s illness. “It left deep scars on the family,” she says. “It’s very hard when someone’s behavior is totally unpredictable."

             "Kennedy was instrumental in convincing Dr. Zimmerman to document his remarkable claim of the government covering up his true expert opinion on vaccines and autism. Dr. Zimmerman declined our interview request and referred us to his sworn affidavit. It says: On June 15, 2007, he took aside the Department of Justice—or DOJ lawyers he worked for defending vaccines in vaccine court. He told them that he’d discovered “exceptions in which vaccinations could cause autism.” “I explained that in a subset of children, vaccine induced fever and immune stimulation (encephalitis) did cause regressive brain disease with features of autism spectrum disorder.”"

            <p>
             "Vaccines have saved untold millions of lives, and the vast majority of people who get them suffer no major problems. But there's a trade-off: occasionally, vaccines cause injury or death. Very rarely, patients are left with what's known as "encephalopathy", the medical term for brain damage. In fact, CBS News has found nearly 1,300 cases in which vaccine-related brain damage has been compensated in court over the past 20 years."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Children who end up with autistic symptoms or autism have won vaccine injury claims over the years-as long as they highlighted general, widely-accepted brain damage; not autism specifically. But when autism or autistic symptoms are alleged as the primary brain damage, the cases are lost."

I know that's been a problem with birth control metabolites, and that some have surmised the massive rise in estrogen-related cancers is due to it not being filtered out at sewage treatment plants, as well as being added to factory-produced poultry to create plumper chicken and turkey breasts.

              It wouldn't matter - it's too unstable. Hence why it can't be given as an oral medication
