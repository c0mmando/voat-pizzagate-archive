<p>This happened Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;El Chapo is sentenced to life behind bars and told to forfeit $12.6 BILLION to the US government...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Among his complaints was that he has not been allowed contact with his wife - a strict condition that has been imposed since before the trial began and will remain in place. 
Witnesses during the trial said she helped him escape Mexican prison in 2015 by acting as a liaison between him and his associates. She was also accused of smuggling a cell phone into court during the trial to communicate with him. 
His 30-year-old wife, sporting a new hairstyle and at least $75,000 worth of jewelry, watched from the packed gallery. It was likely the last time they will ever see each other since she has been banned from visiting him. 
The drug lord\'s statement did little to sway U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan who said the \'overwhelming evil\' in the case was \'so severe\' that he should be punished to the full extent of the law. </p>
<p>He was jailed for life on drug trafficking offenses and given an additional 30 for firearms offenses.&quot;

            Stupid woman.  Anywhere someone digs a tunnel is pizzagate now?  Even if he transported Mexicans in addition to drugs, are you aware Mexicans arent human so it's not human trafficking?
