             Usually Francis would protect a pedo, but Pell had apparently fallen out of favor.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              ...there was already a creeping sense that Pell, during the tenure of his investigation into the Vatican bank (also known as the Institute for the Works of Religion, or IOR), had quickly become persona non grata. When he signed on to the 13 Cardinals Letter expressing concern about how the Synod was being conducted — something Francis was reported to have taken rather personally — his fall from grace accelerated.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...the pope seems to have a tendency to surround himself with compromised men. From Msgr. Battista Ricca (also involved with the Vatican bank reform) to Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia to Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio to Cardinal Reinhard Marx,
              <strong>
               some of Francis’ most noteworthy associates are men with skeletons in their closets that could easily be taken out and put on display if they become…inconvenient. If Pell were a man with sexual abuse in his background, it could certainly be used against him if necessary
              </strong>

             pedophilia is a tool as well as a goal, whereas pedophilia conviction is either a punishment on an innocent person that has made powerful enemies, or the pedo groups sacrifice a pedo of low-importance to draw heat from them as a whole or to remove a troublesome member.
            </p>

             also im aware that in the UK at least, globohomo forces politicians to rape a child or some other destestable act in order to ensure their loyalty before they are given any real power.

              Pell , I just keep getting mixed messages as why he went down.  What u say makes sense but doesn’t.
              <br/>
              So now that he’s convicted he will turn on the Vatican in exchange for a lighter sentence so to speak.  He worked with the Payseurs whom trump wants to take down.  Idk

               I think they asked Pell too fall on his sword. Clearly a political last ditch effort to take the sting out of the upcoming shake up/down.

            I can recall a time in the early 90s,my brother in law rolled around a park,where one of his players on his baseball team said a man exposed himself to him in the bathroom ,all the dads were in on the park patrol,my dad even  was in on patrols.....they did this until the guy was caught,with the blessing of the community,cops and parents.What the hell happened? Hey internet,it will never be ok,to harm a kid,never. Even if you become legally a protected class.....you will never get my compliance on this subject. I'll help you with the cure,on bat swing at a time.
