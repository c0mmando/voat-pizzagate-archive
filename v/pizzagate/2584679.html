            I just spent an hour and a half gathering the information to explain to people why our sick overlords really drink blood. It will be slid off the front page with about five more stupid Bourdain threads.

             In the French quarter of New Orleans, John Edgar Browning is about to take part in a "feeding". It begins as clinically as a medical procedure. His acquaintance first swabs a small patch on Browning’s upper back with alcohol. He then punctures it with a disposable hobby scalpel, and squeezes until the blood starts flowing. Lowering his lips to the wound, Browning's associate now starts lapping up the wine-dark liquid. “He drank it a few times, then cleaned and bandaged me,” Browning says today.
            </p>
            <p>
             To Browning’s bemusement, he was not quite to his host’s taste. “He said my blood was not as metallic as it should have been – so he was a little disappointed,” he recalls; apparently, diet, hydration and blood group can all make a subtle difference to the flavour. After they had cleaned up, the pair went to a charity dinner in aid of the homeless.
            </p>
            <p>
             A self-confessed “needle-phobe”, Browning had not been looking forward to the feeding. “I’m actually pretty fearful of anything sharp approaching my skin,” he says. But as a researcher at Louisiana State University, he was willing to go through with it for his latest project: an ethnographic study of the New Orleans “real vampire” community.

            <p>
             There are thousands of people drinking blood in the US alone

            This forum is slowly turning into the National Enquirer. There are answers to some of the most profound questions. Some people are posting posting Tabloid Tier Junk too often. I just posted something above with profound implications, the sort of shit that answers questions, real questions.

             His stupid ass does not deserve to junk up six threads in a forum about child abuse and slide the whole front page off the forum. Every one of these threads could have been put in one thread. EACH NEW DETAIL DOES NOT DESERVE ITS OWN THREAD.

            They're memes; ignore them. Just how like millions of people could (and do) write the same comment, about whatever topic, then others will make posts. Ignore the repeats, whatever. You're giving them more power, by engaging in it. Downvoat and move on. People are circlejerking about some fat kike's death; whatever. The less attention it gets, the quicker it dies.
