            The other thing that's weird, is that at first the swimming activity is apparently not conceived as limited to just the children, per the "we will be heating the pool" , but a "possibility" for the "We" . As far as the children swimming are concerned , the wording  "not optional" for the  as they "WILL be in the pool FOR SURE."

            Littman makes reference to "announce my candidacy for speaker of the house"...yet he is not in Congress. The context: Denny Hastert, former Speaker of the House and close friend of Tony Podesta, was arrested and charged with pedophile-related charges in May 2015. It all makes sense with this context.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, in this email(
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39509">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39509)
            </a>
            ), Littman brags "I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test." This is a reference to Walter Jones, known for a squeaky clean image.

              The emails referenced are linked directly above, from Wikileaks. The interpretations are mine as his comments are strange...so what do they mean?
Drew Littman wrote: "Thanks for remembering me, as I was planning to use the farm as the backdrop to announce my candidacy for speaker of the house." He is not a Congressman, so why did he write this in response to the planned pool party with kids as entertainment?
             </p>
             <p>
              A plausible explanation is that he was referencing Denny Hastert, the disgraced former GOP Speaker of the House who was charged in May 2015 with pedophilia and pleaded to financial schemes trying to bribe his victims to stay quiet. Given that context, Littman's statement starts to make sense, essentially that he will piddle kiddies just like Hastert. He is basically making an inside joke that we can understand with this context.
             </p>
             <p>
              His other statement, after he had planted the flag about wanting to engage in the pedo party, was: "I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test." What would that mean? In researching, you will find that Walter Jones is a Congressman from who has an impeccable reputation as clean. He is considered by some to be the gold standard of an honest politician. “Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina's 3rd congressional district; in DC he's regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.” [source:
              <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1148311/pg1">
               http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1148311/pg1
              </a>
              .] Now this statement makes sense: "I've never had an affair, so who would suspect me of what we are planning to do with these kids?" Ask yourself: What could he possibly have meant by each of these comments. He was communicating, making a joke. We are trying to understand given the bigger picture of what we are uncovering. Why, for an innocent party at a farm, would this guy write, "I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test"? Now you know (or at least have a pretty good guess)!

            Not saying he is guilty, but we should dig. I think we need to go back to the wikileaks emails that were suspicious and reseach everyone that was part of the email chains. This was the fist one I did and it was a hit.
