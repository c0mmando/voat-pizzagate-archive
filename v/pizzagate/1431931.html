<p>There is a connection between Bushwick Brooklyn and Satanism
Possibly the street art scene is involved. There is a mountain of
imagery that reflects child abuse. There is a mountain of imagery 
that connects pizza to Satanism. First started with <a href="http://robertaspizza.com/">Roberta\'s Pizza</a>
artist and that lead me to investigate the Bushwick Brooklyn\'s occult
art scene. I was also lead to search Etsy for &quot;Satanic Pizza&quot;, which
lead to many artists selling this stuff. All their friends are really into 
pizza and satanism for some reason, like it\'s definitely an inside joke. After searching
Etsy, I realized it\'s all over Tumblr and Instagram. Everyone that leaves a 
comment, seems to be really interested in Satanism. </p>
<p>Roberta\'s Pizza artist <a href="http://www.andrewsteinerstudio.com/">Andrew Steiner</a>, member of the group Secret Handshake
Eat Pizza Not People is one of his slogans for Roberta\'s that alludes to cannibalism.</p>

<p>Pizza Pentagram Etsy - Artist from Brooklyn New York
<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PizzaPentagram?ref=l2-shopheader-name">PizzaPentagram Etsy Page</a></p>
<p>Pizza Pentagram\'s favorites include a shirt designed by another Brooklyn
artist named Daniel Zender. If you go to Daniel Zender\'s website,
you can see a lot of art that resembles Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA). One
of his pieces is titled Escape Route and features what looks like are two
children. His pieces are really disturbing and share a common theme
with that other artist. His art features those Changeling creatures
that represent children that have been abused. </p>
<p><a href="http://danielzender.com/">Daniel Zender</a></p>
<p>Finally, the most disturbing artist is a Pizza Slime. Just look at his work
and you\'ll see all the symbolism and it will all connect. He also implicates 
possible celebrities that might be involved through this art motifs. The most
interesting thing is that he has a password protected part of his site
disguised as a store that is invite only. There is a lot of pedo symbolism 
in this guy\'s art. </p>
