<p>They would LOVE for one of you guys to start sperging out and calling for a racewar or threaten to shoot up some random place you suspect as being part of some pedoring conspiracy and then debunk it and call you a radicalized domestic terrorist. You guys need to understand that these people are ISIS, &quot;terrorism&quot; is a fucking meme. Every single goddamned &quot;ISIS&quot; video comes from the Mossad front SITE intelligence run by Rita Katz. There is no such thing as ISIS, intel agencies don\'t even waste their time with ISIS because they rather shift the narrative over to &quot;DOMESTIC TERRORISTS&quot; and you know who they are going to frame the most? White. Fucking. Nationalists. Just you wait, the next big false flag is going to be another Dylan Roof kid, they\'ll probably say that he frequented known honeypot websites like the Daily Stormer, 8chan, 4chan or wherever else that Jews and their pets in the CIA/FBI use to radicalize kids online.</p>
<p>This is a concerted effort. They spam BLACKED threads on /pol/ and socially engineer disenfranchised young men/(maybe some women) to the point where they snap and go postal. I\'m sure that a lot of these shootings are straight up actors but I wouldn\'t be surprised if they do manage to make a couple anons go postal. Go skim through 4chan\'s politically incorrect board and you can easily see that it\'s a PSYOP and a half, meant to break you, and make you cold and bitter. These people don\'t care, the mods don\'t care, they look down upon you guys, they wan\'t one of you to SNAP so they can use you as a weapon to finally SHUT. IT. DOWN. Think about this forum. Think about how we\'re all here because we splintered off from reddit after they SHUT. IT. DOWN. They did this on purpose, this was calculated and planned. They know where memes/ideas form, they know how shit starts here but eventually trickles down to more mainstream websites. They are BALKANIZING the goddamn internet. They think that they can compartmentalize us slow down the flow of information by keeping us bogged down in our own echo chambers. We need to remember that information dissemination is absolutely the MOST IMPORTANT THING. Staying here is pointless, you need to dilute the information into bite sized pieces and then spam that shit like you\'re emptying a fucking clip into the ZOG machine. Fuck these people, they\'re all going to hell for this. We\'re the good guys, we\'re morally superior, remember that!</p>',

            Yes, but arguably all social media will be compromised. If not by design, by ignorance. And the_son is compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, its absurd what ((they)) have to do keep up. Trump, Syria, pizza gate, cnnblackmail, podesta, Epstein, info wars, etc. Even milo and as range. Never mind bannon works for trump directly.
           </p>
           <p>
            During occupy wall street, some ((people)) took the lead and lead to hundreds of arrests by derailing the protest and moving it in directions the police were not prepared for.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seamen is such a type. A leader into loss. But really, what's the point of a leader? We operate better as individuals. But everyone should have access to good advice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most importantly, we have videos of Skippy torturing a kid at comet ping pong. There could be no better smoking gun. If the powers that be decide to so the right thing, great. But let's not bear too much blame and shame for not securing the desired goals.

            Amen.

             Bitch, are you retarded? If you look at my previous posts you'll see a lot of paranoid forewarnings about potential false flag terrorism. Why would an anti-gunner worry about false flags? Do you know about Port Arthur? Do you know who Diane Feinstein is? Do you know about the history of the Jewish Lobby and their anti-gun crusade?
            </p>
            <p>
             A shill would encourage violence, not warn about false flag terrorism. By the looks of the current fragile political climate, It looks like another fake shooting is just around the corner so you should hop into the nearest oven and shut the fuck up

            In real life, almost never does somebody go postal. All extreme theatrical news reports are the alphabet agency creations. Warn yourself not to go postal. We don't need it.

             There are literally too many false flags attacks to even bust them all. You can't even keep up with it if you try. It's Operation Gladio on steroids.

            Listen..FEAR is food..so getting everyone whipped up about the FBI and CIA coming to "get us" or mind control us is a bit extreme.  I think we need to be AWARE that they would love for a false flag with a voater to happen...but we have already stopped it by addressing the possibility and increasing awareness it could happen.  Consider if a voater came unglued and shot up CNN now...we would just point back to this post and say..."We saw it coming..we are smarter than you..." and they cannot abide GOYIM being smarter than them...consider LOVE is also food, but in a different manner.

              Yeah, we don't all have to agree with your points - but, from my POV, you are safely exercising your freedom of speech and taking a stand against the actual shills. We may not see eye to eye, but, you are good to go from my POV. I'd suggest chillaxing a bit on the racial slurs and focusing more on the facts - but, do what you want bro!

            I agree with most of this...no point in doing some silly minor random violent attack.  Save your energy and bullets for when the mob finally starts.....we will need to you help storm the Jew/Masonic power centers.  Little shit here or there does nothing.  Save your bullets for the big push.

            Well, if they're interested in what you might call "Jew-baiting" by anti-Semites here, we have loads of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            But on the side of getting this information out, we all know that this is a story which many in MSM would very
much love to cover if they weren't being stopped from doing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, another thread here makes clear that 3,100 kids every year are taken from social services and foster
homes and end up being trafficked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like the government knows where to put police power and who to watch!

               I told him he was being a shill in THIS THREAD after he had just posted, giving us a pep talk, reminding us what we're fighting against. Then, he was the one getting others worked up. I don't dislike him. I haven't really noticed him until that freak started saying we should kill Jew kids. He's nowhere near as bad as you. Not like you who is a shill in almost EVERY thread. But, I bet he's a big boy and can stand up for himself.
              </p>
              <p>
               Reading that shill handbook made so many things about you stand out. You're the worse one here. People always bring up
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Darkmath">
                @Darkmath
               </a>
               but I'm beginning to like him. He doesn't usually get mean unless someone is mean to him first and you're usually the first to pounce on him every time he comments. Even after being called every name in the book, he replies calmly. A lot of times it makes me laugh because he's being calm where you are flipping out like a crazy person. So, you end up looking like the crazy one. Not him. He may be a little different. But, I'd take that any day over your daily bullying.
              </p>
              <p>
               I could point out many things from the shill book. But, I'll just suggest you and others read this one now so that everyone starts seeing the pattern.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Number 5 in the shill handbook
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary ‘attack the messenger’ ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               It also says that they use titles such as ‘kooks’, ‘right-wing’, ‘liberal’, ‘left-wing’, ‘terrorists’, ‘conspiracy buffs’, ‘radicals’, ‘militia’, ‘racists’, ‘religious fanatics’, ‘sexual deviates’, and so forth.
              </p>
              <p>
               That didn't apply to you because you usually go with bitch, cunt, retard, anything that bashes Jews, and soooo many other names which are much worse.

            Outside of having to insert the ZOG crap in there, everything else you said is completely plausible.  From what I know, this is the only cohesive forum dedicated to the topic.  Reddit is good for ADHD rapid fire stuff, but not for things that require a modicum of journalistic and investigative standards.

            I just hope whomever is running this fucking place has it backed up and bounced and mirrored all over the place.  I'm actually shocked that the downtime and DDOS-type attacks have been very minimal.  A few in the early days, but since then, nada.

            Word to the wise - What what you say and disavow all else which could be construed as a threat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, your post reeks of confirmation bias as it pertains to the "ZOG machine".  You act as if you've discovered some sacred scroll which lays out the grand planAs I've said before, there are omre Jews in positions which require high intellect beause they are better educated and generally smarter than the average person, from the ones I know.  Just like you can say other races you are familiar with are dumber than average.  Not a stereotype, just a fact.  Just because a group may be generally smarter than you, doesn't mean you pin your problems on them.  Just like other races do to white people.  Just sayin'...

             Jews are not smarter than whites.....on average.  This is why they hate whites the most.  Asians are perhaps even smarter than whites but they are more domesticated.  The are a subservant race that loves fitting in.  Whites are crazy smart and also more violent.  It makes for a dangerous combination for the Jew to control  It is why they want us to have no white homelands and want to breed us out of existence.  The blacks are no threat to the Jew.   They are easily lead.  Read the early progressive writings...Get a couple of Black Ministers on your side and all the blacks get in line and do what you say.   Simple.  Whites on the other hand are dangerous as fuck and must go......we have to die.

              "The Pew Research Center study published Tuesday found that Jews worldwide have four years more of schooling on average than the next-most educated group, Christians, who average about nine years of schooling. Muslims and Hindus are the least-educated religious groups, each with about 5 1/2 years of formal schooling. The global average is less than eight years."

              You can try and parse this with whatever BS excuse you come up with but the result is still the same.  Smarter people = Better educated = Important jobs = Money/power.  There is your cause and effect.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do agree with the rest of your statement.

               You misunderstand the difference between education and intelligence.  They are not the same thing.   In fact the more educated you are the more you likely believe the Jew propaganda system......

                You forget to add common sense as a third measure of intellect.  Stupid people don't get educations.  Uneducated people may be intelligent. Jewish propaganda?  Like 2 for 1 corned beef sandwiches?

              He used to hang out with Roy Cohn, the J mob faggot and CIA attorney who was the "pedo ring leader."  That's enough for me.

                Not true. I've only lumped you into the anti-semitic category... which, technically, is perfectly fine in accordance w/ 1st amendment. There are really only 2 or 3 on here professing actual violence based on a specific religion/race.
               </p>
               <p>
                My concern is that this trend is emerging on other channels as well. Almost as if it was coordinated.

              Wait one second... I was the OP that pushed the post earlier about the anti-semitic verbiage paired w/ violence being used for prepping a false flag. While I do not agree w/

              and his stance - his point above is valid. I'm not so sure he is a shill. I think he legit believes that Jews are to blame... but, he raises a good point above about anyone "going postal" despite his beliefs re: Jewish involvement.

               That thread I created was long ago, before George Web went bat shit crazy and it really has nothing to do with Web. It's about DIA and the potential that it's a hub for importing kids from around the world to distribute through the US.
              </p>
              <p>
               I called you out for your blatant Jew shilling. Anyone blaming a whole "race" of people is an obvious shill with an agenda. For instance.. Should we blame you for the Edgar Welch false flag because you're white? Or should you be responsible for BLM because you're an American? It's already been proven to you clowns many times that the Rothschilds, the kings of your Jew propaganda, are Roman Catholic and hold the keys to the Papal treasure, yet you insist on blaming the people they're begging you to blame. So, you're either a shill or a fucking moron, either way nobody wants to hear your retarded bullshit.

For the Order controlled the infamous House of Rothschild since no later than the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, after which Jesuit-led Crusade the Rothschild family was surnamed the “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury.”

                  “The Treaty of Paris of 1763 designated King George III “Arch-Treasurer and Prince Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.” And “according to the Encyclopedia Judaica [sic] the Rothschilds bear the title “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury.” The Vatican Treasury, of course, holds the imperial wealth of Rome. Imperial wealth grows in proportion to its victories in war — as the Jesuit empowerment Regimini militantis ecclesiae implies, the Church-at-War is more necessary than the Church-at-Peace.

                  According to H. Russell Robinson’s illustrated Armour of Imperial Rome, Caesarean soldiers protect themselves in battle with shields painted red. Since the soldiery is the State’s most valuable resource (the Council of Trent admitted this in preferring the Jesuits to all other religious orders), it is easy to understand why the red shield was identified with the very life of the Church. Hence, the appropriateness of the name Rothschild, German for “red shield.”

                  The appointment of Rothschild gave the black papacy absolute financial privacy and secrecy. Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of the Roman Catholic Church? I believe this appointment explains why the House of Rothschild is famous for helping nations go to war. It is fascinating that, as Meyer Rothschild’s sons grew into the family business, the firm took on the title Meyer Amschel Rothschild und Sohne, which gives us the notariqon MARS. Isn’t Mars the Roman God of War, whose heavenly manifestation is “the red planet”? There is powerful cabalah here, and there’s hardly an acre of inhabitable earth that hasn’t been affected by it in some way.”

                  The famous banking family of Rothschild traces its origins back to a Meyer Rothschild, born in Frankfurt in 1743. As to what this family were called prior to this time is unclear, but it is almost certain that Rothschild was a name adopted by them. Prior to this date they would almost certainly have been refugees from the Turkish Empire or Middle Europe. Early examples of the surname recording taken from surviving German church registers of the period include: Simon Rothschild, who was christened at Bantrupe evangelical church, Lippe, on April 29th 1714, and Edmund Rothchild, christened at Burgsteirfurt katholic church, Westfalen, on July 14th 1813.

Some say the Rothschilds (who are Jewish) caused the Holocaust, while others say they were the true power behind the creation of Israel. They would, and continue, to do anything for money. In fact one of the earliest and most influential Rothschilds, Nathan, is claimed to have said:

                 <p>
                  I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne of England to rule the Empire on which the sun never sets. The man who controls Britain's money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply."

                   Show me any record of a Rothschild attending a synagogue before 1900 and I might consider that they're Jewish, but it's still irrelevant. The Rothschilds answer to the papacy. Did you even read my reply to you? Even, your source, the Jewish Encyclopedia tells you that. Keep ignoring the facts of you want, but that just makes you a useful idiot, or worse.

                 The Bush family arranged 9/11 and they aren't Jewish. You're a tool and typing in caps doesn't change that. There's no such thing as a "crypto Jew", you idiots had to make that term up because everyone realizes that these people aren't Jews. Anyways, now you know how everyone knows you're a shill.

                   Where's the proof for this? On stormfront, the CTR front? Here's the truth...

                    This is not only one of the earliest of all recorded surnames in the "Old World" (see below), it is also one of the very first in the "New", John Bush of London, being recorded as living at "Elizabeth Cittie, Virginea" on February 16th 1623, in the reign of King James 1 of England and V1 of Scotland (1603 - 1625). The name origin is either Norse-Viking, deriving from the pre 9th Century "buskr", or the Olde English pre 7th Century "busc"; in both cases it is topographical for one who lived by a particularly distinctive copse or thicket. The variant spellings include Bushe, Busk and Buske, and the early recordings include: Roger atte Buske, also known as Roger Del Bushe, in the Suffolk Pipe Rolls of 1305, and Roger Bussh, who may be the same person, in the Fines Court of Suffolk, 1309. Other early recordings from London Church Registers include: Agnes Bush, who married William Harnson on June 26th 1568, at St. Dunstan's Church, Stepney, whilst on December 16th 1629, one George Bush was christened at St. Giles' Cripplegate,
                    <strong>
                     perhaps a forebear of the American President, George Bush, who is of original New England stock.
                    </strong>
                    The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Richard de la Busce, which was dated 1181, in the "Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire", during the reign of King Henry 11, known as "The Builder of Churches", 1154 - 1189. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.

            Agreed. But Voat's capacity for sniffing out shills is unparalleled. Imitation rage posting, nonsensical diatribes and inciting violence or civil unrest is quickly downvoted and mocked as the diversionary shilling it is. Even if they are genuine they are treated the same because they are harmful, immoral or unethical attitudes that will damage the country and our path to liberty.

             TBF, it's not so much unparalleled as it is eternally pervasive. Even a hint of so much as farting in the general direction of a kike will get you at least four messages (usually from Kikes) talking about how obvious of an FBI shill you are.

             The retardation here is unparalleled.  You idiots can't research your way out of a wet paper bag, and you sure as hell can't spot the FRIENDLY MOSSAD, CIA, ADL, JIDF, RNC and DNC shills right under your noses whom you are "chatting" with.

              you tell em' bro. These kids are lil niggas who need to earn their place. This forum represents a counterculture, these people have been trying to engineer and control this shit for DECADES. These people can literally print money out of thin air and employ a necessary amount of disinfo shills.  Of course shills dominate these subversive online echo chambers. They are the same goddamned people who ENGINEERED this fucking pizzagate psyop in the first place

            Who are you really? Your the one who is trying to rile everyone up. This forum has patiently researched massive corruption and unspeakable evil. The only physical aggression was a false flag and we uncovered it quickly. Any other false flags will also be exposed. There are more people watching than you think. Hell CNN can't even pull off a doxing threat without the Internet sleuths catching them. The only people threatening anything are the legacy media, some black hats in alphabet agencies, and their paid trolls.

                   The problem with your bullshit is that the people you call crypto jews have nothing to do with this story and they aren't Jewish. You change the meaning (mad up a new word) to fit your propaganda.

                     Right, but none of the people you call crypto Jew fit into this box you're putting them in. You and your shill buddies are creating a whole new meaning for the term crypto jew. It's now anyone you can't prove is Jewish.

               Lol, if that's what you think, great. I've never ever said one thing that promotes actual violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Being jew aware and wanting to smash jew heads with sledgehammers like that Daleeaston guy are two completely different things. I want them dealt with through legal means, never once said anyone should kill Jews themselves. Being aware of the problem allows us to make them (the government) do something. If they don't, when faced with unquestionable proof, then the questions of a revolution come. Revolution does not equate to ham fisted vigilante murdering. No where in there is any ADL agitation to violence or JIDF honeypot shit. But if I'm a jew shill then great, good critical thinking.

                Even non violent anti semite comments get used to "Plant Evidence".

                Evidence planting is "False Flag 101". Plant evidence to blame your intended target for your crimes so that the victim gets attacked and shut down.
