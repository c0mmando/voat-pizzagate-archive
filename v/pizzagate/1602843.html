            why doesnt someone actually ask laura in a public forum. Questions that arent directly accusatory, like 'Laura, ar you aware Jorges Torres now has chid trafficking convictions? Were you aware he was not a lawyer? If so, what motivated you to chose this man to represent you? Would you let him represent yu again? etc

            The photo is completely different from Jorge Torres, though. Sure, he could be using a fake photo, but I don't see any reason to because he uses another Twitter account and Facebook account with his real photos. But you're right, there are legitimate allegations this child-trafficker once acted as an informant for the FBI. He has connections allover the place, as he grew up in the Ramos Mafia (all of the heads have been sentenced for life).

            He has a habit of posting allover random blogs that speak about him. Note how he loves to add "1977", his birth year to his username. He claims to be in New York on November 2015.

             I thought they kind of looked similar but now after you shared me that facebook of him I have to bring it down to 50% sure. Do you have any information on Jose Hidalgo? He was the real estate agent that helped Laura Silsby.

              His full name is Jose Altagracia Ovando Hidalgo, if I remember correctly. He works at DRREBA.com with his business partner Robert Scott/Schoot Chenvert (who was originally a dentist who worked in VT and Nantucket. There are some claims that he is a pastor, however that may have been a mistake spread by the media. We really need someone who can speak Spanish to look into him, as there is a pastor called Jose Hidalgo in the Spanish newspapers that I've seen (except I can't read Spanish).
             </p>
             <p>
              Jose Hidalgo is VERY well known in Dominican Republic, however. I recall someone from a forum mentioning that back in 2010. Further, Jorge Torres had lived in Santo Domingo for 4 years until the Silsby case, and been a prominent figure within the tight-knit Jewish community of DR, making it entirely possible that they've bumped into each other at one point.
             </p>
             <p>
              Interesting note: the missionaries apparently stayed at Santo Domingo overnight at some point during the Silsby mission. Maybe they met up with Jorge Puello Torres.
             </p>
             <p>
              ANOTHER NOTE: JORGE IS AN ALIAS FREAK. A couple of his aliases (he has around 20 more, I just can't be bothered getting them at the moment): Yoram, Jorge Torres Jr, Jorge Puello, Jorge Orellana Torres, Jorge A Torres. His former wife said she had no idea what his real name was.

                Hi.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here are two articles that mention a pastor called "Jose Hidalgo":
