<p>I. Jeffrey Epstein was only charged with <em>one</em> count of <strong>solicitation of prostitution from a minor</strong>.</p>
<p>II. Sex trafficking in the United States is a federal crime not subject to the Statute of Limitations with a minimum of 20 years sentence. It is defined as thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sex trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purposes of a commercial sex act, in which the commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age (22 USC § 7102).

             Naomi Campbell was a frequent guest. She's a smaller time competitor of Epstein. A couple famous Black comedy performers were regular guests too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein made a point of not wanting to hire Black "hostesses." Perhaps he had access to much less expensive ones originally living near Pedo Island.

            It's time people stop waiting for Justice, no big names are being locked up, all we have are endless rumors to keep us quiet and accept the evils that happen to these children. How do we even know what happens after a pedophile bust? Do we really know if people are charged &amp; locked up? Do the people getting busted have connections to the top?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm really fucking tired of waiting for Justice. If people start getting close, they will likely crash the stock market. I wonder why Soros has moved his money.

            We the people are going to have to physically remove these people from their positions of power, how is there any other way?

            .  I'm still surprised how many people have not seen this video, which I consider an essential backgrounder to all discussions Epstein.

           <p>
            Anyone who has not seen this video needs to invest the 5 minutes.  Why we haven't dug into the Clothing Shop Network yet is unknown - I've not been able to get too far.  This is what sent me lurking down this rabbit hole 14 months ago:

             It's totally possible Trump didn't know about the Virginia Roberts/Mar-A-Lago incident specifically, but Trump was a known associate of Ghislaine Maxwell and is also named in some suits against Epstein as a material witness or abuser.

             The main point with #VIII and #IX is that Epstein's influence and circle of friends includes all sides of the political spectrum. He's not just a pawn of the Clintons or any single organization like folks generally assume.

            He's too big to jail he's a Mossad asset they could have killed him but they still think he's valuable. Crazy it would have been much easier too just overdose him and kill him that way.

            Rebel, did you catch the latest about the hacker who DID find CP on the Comet Ping Pong server?

             wait, so the CP on CPP-Srvr was true? I didn't necessarily not believe it(certainly didn't call "LARP"), but, interesting if verifiable.

              Yep. There were two different exposures -- the first one by Bigfish and then very shortly after the two guys who claimed to have found a menu where you could order kids, which was disinfo. Listen to the Titus Frost interview and judge for yourself whether the guy is lying. After I watched it, I reached out to Bigfish on Twitter. He saw the CP, and alerted authorities and then couldn't believe the amount of disinfo and false flag stuff that went down. He has tried to get every media outlet known to man to investigate; to at least FOIA the DC police to confirm his story but they wouldn't touch it.

                 Flak is one thing. Having to install an expensive, high level security system to protect your family, repairing your truck &amp; replacing tires, etc gets expensive. Poor honorable man found out the same jerks that try to destroy escapees from Warren Jeff's polygamy group were the ones who infiltrated his property to harass him.

             prosecutor's argument
            </a>
            was that victims were not going to testify.  I don't know if that is dubious or not, but I think they prosecutors could argue that getting him convicted and registered as a sex offender helped the victims's civil cases against him and avoided the prospect of a long drawn our trial.   The Civil Suit against the Government for Violation of Criminal Victims Rights Act was filed in 2008 and is still pending, I believe, it was definitely still pending last year.  That prosecutors argued the were dealt a bad hand and played it as best they could.

             For instance, she said, most of the young women were extremely reluctant — or simply refused — to testify against Epstein, who had paid them to give him sexually-charged massages at his mansion.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the women who is now suing the government insisted Epstein never abused her, Villafana wrote in a sworn affidavit.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “I hope Jeffrey, nothing happens to Jeffrey because he’s an awesome man and it would really be a shame,” the woman, identified only as Jane Doe 2, told FBI agents in 2007.

            Essentially, the CVRA only applies to federal crimes and you have federal crimes if you can prove federal crimes and get a conviction.  Given uncertainty in the case and normal prosecutorial leeway in deciding if they can win a conviction, I think it's very unlikely that a judge declares the CVRA was violated.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also interesting that you take Epstein's word for VIII.

             <em>
              is
             </em>
             a federal crime and by all accounts these cases, including the original criminal case, fit the definition provided by U.S. law. Even if victims are hesitant to testify, as they often are in trials involving organized crime, this still doesn't negate the evidence gathered by the Palm Beach Police Department's 11-month investigation which indicate a federal crime indeed took place.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for #VIII I did note that this is "self-proclaimed". Even if it were a complete lie it's rather peculiar he would make such a claim in the first place. In either case this demonstrates an intimate level of comfort with the Clinton organization which he did maintain regular contact with during his trial. There is at least circumstantial evidence that this connection might have helped with his light sentencing as well (ie. Epstein donated to the Clinton Foundation one month before the NPA was drafted and while he was still under arrest).

            I think Epstein received a sweetheart deal because he had the goods on many high profile people he could torch.  I bet you he brownstoned many in Florida residence and NY as he did at Lolita Island.

             Police did find hidden cameras in his Palm Beach home and victims state he had them in all of his homes. Victims like Virginia Roberts also directly claim that he used such cameras for blackmail purposes. This is definitely a strong candidate for a "Brownstone Operation".

            Rebel -- Thanks for the info which seems to confirm that Epstein is being protected
-- perhaps by CIA agreement of some kind.
If Hefner was running a "honey pot" in US -- 
was Epstein doing the same internationally?

            If Epstein is tied in with the CIA they will continue to protect him.

             That's why he was protected. All sexual activity was always recorded with the latest high tech for blackmail. Girls were instructed as to how to extract more info from clients. Top level arms sales merchants, drug cartel manipulators, etc begged for an invite. There's reasons Epstein's pleasure palace isn't located in the US. Many guests wouldn't have stepped on US soil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Notice Epstein doesn't publicly discuss the underage boys that were quietly provided. He also implies the underage girls were in their teens and not inexperienced in sexuality before hooking up with him. You aren't told that there were pre-teen children available.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nor do we know what happens to those whose young bodies cannot handle the overly aggressive sexual activities of some of the worst of the worst jerks. Apparently one celeb was repeatedly warned and then permanently banned. If the perv was into multiples who couldn't speak any English that still leaves plenty of victims alive but bleeding. Would Epstein cover medical if they were unable to work for a period of time?
            </p>
            <p>
             Does anyone want to know if either those with US citizenship or the foreign born were ever able to escape Pedo Island? Or was heavy drug use encouraged.

              Great question and presume few answers...
The interview with former Det. Rothstein by Jim Fetzer is interesting on
NY/International stuff cause NYPD does international, as well.
He says over 50 year period at least 3 investigations stopped -- one which
went all the way to Albany Hearings ... but always when they get to names
of higher up's involved.
At end, he also mentions involvement of our military in trafficking.
That very much widens the protection and opportunities for traffickers.
             </p>
             <p>
              In other looks at what happens to children involved, seems very clear that
their bodies are so ravaged that they are killed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Additionally, in MKULTRA Mind Control/torture/sexual abuse ....
seems that at about age 30 the mind will begin to pull together 
all of the personalities and the host becomes aware.  At that point,
becomes very dangerous for survival of the victims.
             </p>
             <p>
              Clearly, there is no plan to protect these youths at any age.
             </p>
             <p>
              Can only hope that in one way or another the research going on is succeeding
in ending all of this.

             That's definitely a strong possibility and a big obstacle. My hope is that by showing he also violated international law that action could still be taken even if the U.S. court system continues to flounder on the subject.

            Thanks for this excellent post!!!  You would think it would really do a job waking people up, but I'm often reminded of just how hard it actually is to accomplish that.  You can show people verifiable facts and they just turn their noses at it if the truth is more pleasant.

            Thanks so much.  This makes me realize how much we have missed you.  Epstein only spent 3 mos in jail though being a level 3 sex offender.  This incarceration consisted of his leaving during the day.  It sure pays to have friends like the Clintons and Prince Andrew.   Not This Time.  No.

             It's an incredible case that I think exposes so tons of holes in our legal system which allow this behavior to continue. These victims have been through utter Hell, both during the assaults and years later, so I think it's time people started standing up for them.

               That would be interesting indeed. For instance I know Alan Dershowitz was on major MSM news programs almost every day discrediting victims and witnesses. He also wrote this peculiar line in one of his books,
               <em>
                My Life in Court
               </em>
               , alluding to the use of civil lawsuits when one feels they have a weak legal case:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                If you don't have the law or legal facts on your side, argue your case in the Court of public opinion.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I cover Alan Dershowitz's methods to in-depth in the documentary so that'll be something to look forward to!

              I agree. I think this case goes so much deeper with much more to it, stuff that possibly includes murder as well.    I would love for someone to get a warrant to search Little St. James.

             It was re-categorized as a "Dead-end lead" since at the time the team couldn't come to an agreement on the strength of the evidence. I'd like to hear a compelling case for that though, personally.

               I understand the frustration when it comes to trying to convey difficult information to folks, but at the end of the day the Wiki at least is a completely volunteer effort. It's not always easy keeping tabs on
               <em>
                every
               </em>
               single lead and we're not totally perfect, plus a lot of us have jobs and lives to keep up with too, but it's still the only project of its kind. Contributions and feedback are always welcome and I've always appreciated yours!

                 Well thank you kindly. I like when people have different opinions and the spine to express them, I just don't see the reason to insult folks that I guarantee still have the same general goal as you.

              Bro. no. that is my Post. some random additional information.... You debunked way before my post... So why? What was your reason&gt;? Becasue you listened to the interview with the retard William usher?  ? who fucked up every fact and mentioned nothing of relevance&gt;? who has since been implicated as colluding? Like what the fuck...Your reason for the original debunking,,, was, "This is isn't admiral flibtstone in the wikileaks." are you denying thats the reason it was debunked? if so, then why was it debunked in the first place?

               We listed it there during a period when investigations were splintering in every which direction and overall we just couldn't prove it was entirely related to the subject at hand. We still kept his page up for any further discussion and contributions to the contrary though.  Part of the reason for the Wiki is to encourage healthy debate and the best source material possible, so just because something might be categorized one way now doesn't mean it can't be changed when more information is available.

                 Oi, now you're just insulting but it was just a sincere attempt to be critical about a lead which divided a lot of people for its relevance. It was never  a personal attack. We all just want to get to the truth at the end of the day.

                 I vaguely remember some school that was involved and some counselor at the school being charged with sexual abuse of boys and it was horrible.  The boys had to go to him for help and he abused them.  Flinstone had some kind of metal drums in that place.  It's been a while now and it's kind of foggy but I think it also linked to Inouye (spelling).  I highly agree there this was a very important opening that we needed so much.

                 We're not a law-enforcement organization. Just some volunteer researchers, most of whom are just other members of this subverse. Do you really think the Pizzagate Wiki of all things was the reason people didn't research it further? Why would we even have a page for him at all if that's the case?
