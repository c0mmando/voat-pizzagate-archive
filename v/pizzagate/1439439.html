<p>Judge Ronnie Abrams (wife) + Greg Donald Andres (husband)
* Greg Donald Andres—Parents: Nancy and Donald J. Andres
* Nancy and Donald J. Andres (retired from Ernst &amp; Young in Manhattan)—Business owners of Crystal Gallery in Hilton Head, S.C.</p>
<p>The Crystal Gallery site shows the following contact information: Crystal Gallery P.O. Box 487, 17-26, 533B, Al Shafar Building, Al Aweer Road, Ras Al Khor, Dubai, U. A. E. Tel: +971 4 3331660/3333632 Fax: +971 4 3331990 In regards to Judge Ronnie Abrams, her mother-in-laws businesn filings in South Carolina are as follows:
CRYSTALS, CANDLES &amp; CHIMES, INC. was first registered as a South Carolina corporation on 05/18/1998, then dissolved on 06/08/1998 (no longer a corporation).
After CRYSTALS, CANDLES &amp; CHIMES, INC. was dissolved, THE CRYSTAL GALLERY, L.L.C. was registered as a Limited Liability Company in South Carolina on the same date (06/08/1998).
* Nancy Andres (the mother-in-law of Judge Ronnie Abrams) was the registered agent of both business organizations.
* Corporations filings show the initial registered office is in a residential area. Presumably their home: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hampton+Pl,+Sun+City+Hilton+Head,+SC+29909/@32.2837941,-80.9670388,183m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88fb8e15a5299053:0x6ceaca57b4657638!8m2!3d32.2837941!4d-80.9670388">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hampton+Pl,+Sun+City+Hilton+Head,+SC+29909/@32.2837941,-80.9670388,183m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88fb8e15a5299053:0x6ceaca57b4657638!8m2!3d32.2837941!4d-80.9670388</a></p>
<p>There is also an amendment in the filings and says “CH FR/ CRYSTALS, CANDLES &amp; CHIMES, L.L.C.” I don’t know what the “CH FR” means, but I want to.</p>
<p>Side note: I don\'t know how many people know this, but the lawsuit was voluntarily withdrawn @ 5:59pm the Friday before Election Day.  Strategic withdrawal or what?  <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/19421595/v_Trump_et_al">https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/19421595/v_Trump_et_al</a></p>',

            The lawyer said that her client withdrew because she was receiving death threats.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that Katie Johnson is a pseudonym. Also, according to Politico:
"Subsequent news reports raised doubts about who filed the suit. Johnson claimed she had just $300 in assets and that she was living at a home in Twentynine Palms, California, but Radar Online reported neighbors said the home had been foreclosed upon and vacant since its owner died last year."
            <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dropped-230770">
             http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dropped-230770
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Her lawyer (Lisa Bloom) is the daughter of the same lawyer (Gloria Allred) who just happened to represent all the other accusers of Donald Trump. She happened to drop the case right before she was supposed to speak at a press conference.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, just to clarify, she alleges that this occurred in 1994. If this occurred, it happened a LONG time before most of the things related to pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked into it a while back and came to the conclusion that the allegations were probably fabricated or exaggerated. Why wait for 22 years to file such a serious claim? It seemed like too much of a coincidence that she decided to do it the same year of the election. I'll let you come to your own conclusion but it's hard to research her because she chose to be anonymous in the lawsuit.
