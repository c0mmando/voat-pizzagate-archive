<p>The article is all about Madonna and a possible new lead named JEFFREY SACHS. Here are his credentials: </p>
<p>Dr. Jeffrey Sachs has been called &quot;probably the most important economist in the world,&quot; by the New York Times. Now head of Columbia University\'s Earth Institute, Sachs helped implement financial reforms in Bolivia and Eastern Europe before turning his focus to economic development in the poorest nations of Africa. </p>
<p>Oh, great! Does anyone think that Bolivia and Eastern Europe are in good shape financially? Why is it these fucking idiots go around screwing up country\'s economic systems only to do it more by being given carte blanche on the world? </p>
<p>So now it\'s Africa he taking aim at, and Malawi is on his radar. It\'s on Madonna\'s also and there was some problem with the funding for a new girl\'s school. Isn\'t that what Oprah did? Build an academy for girls that got those kids molested? Well, it seems that there was a problem with the funding, and the funding is tied to a Kabbalah Center. </p>
<p>You\'ll note that the two little girls in the first video are wearing t-shirts with a rose on it. The rose is HUGE in Kabbalah symbolism.  I picked a link at random: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.davidhalperin.net/kabbalah-the-zohar-and-the-rose-part-1/">https://www.davidhalperin.net/kabbalah-the-zohar-and-the-rose-part-1/</a></p>
<p>I guess the question is: WTF IS GOING ON? </p>
<p>Crazy adoptions, mysticism, missing funds, global economists, innocent kids being drawn into what? </p>
<p>And here we have alleged role-playing Nazi Sandra Bullock <a href="http://www.newser.com/off-the-grid/post/455/sandra-bullock-nazi-fetishist-babe-or-super-mom-you-decide.html">http://www.newser.com/off-the-grid/post/455/sandra-bullock-nazi-fetishist-babe-or-super-mom-you-decide.html</a> adopting a third child. Not much publicity for this. Hush hush because she\'s such a &quot;wonderful&quot; person! </p>

<p>Even WaPooh waded in how wonderful she was, and you know anything John Pedosta\'s associated with has to be championing kid\'s rights, right? </p>
<p>So there it is, but what’s the end game? I guess if we use what the Clintons did in Haiti as an example, we have a pretty good idea.</p>',

            You know the stories about young blood I assume Madonna's youngest were getting too old and she needed to find a new source .Charlize doesn't even appear to like children but she adopted two ,Sandra has her two . It seems like two is the number needed .  why do  Madonna's own kids refuse to be anywhere near her ? I think the evil bitch is using her adopted children to keep herself young [it's not working]

             You must have read my mind ... or I read yours .... or maybe we're just catching on to these lizards.

             I had the same thought after I posted. I was like, what if these adoptions were based on blood type and what if their kids were supplying transfusions so these a$$holes could stay youthful?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's too horrible to think about, but it's a small price to pay for having your own blood bank.

             Thanks. From what's said, the Google maps aren't accurate in Africa. Why? I don't know. But thanks for the info. I will keep this in mind and it's on my radar.

            Nice work! First, I wouldn't say "white people" tainting Africa, they are Jewish, Kabbalah to be exact. Almost anything nefarious is tied to this religion as we know, Kabbalah, Luciferians, Freemasons, Satanists, etc, it's what binds them (all races) all together. Ultimately, the NWO, Illuminati and Israel being the masterminds behind the scenes pulling the strings. I think with Africa it is the resources and they want to depopulate and control the people, as with what they want to do here with us, except over there they have money in natural resources, same with Syria. I've read that with Syria it is Israel that wants control of their land and resources. Remember in the 2000s when Madonna, Demi Moore, Britney Spears, etc all came out converting to Kabbalah wearing their red string bracelets and carrying the books in public. Demi Moore even talked about how bad the water was and how she has a filter for her shower water. Madonna is heavily into this shit she's so far gone I feel for her kids, all of them as they are likely being brought up in a Kabbalah lifestyle, backwards, what's good is bad, what's bad is good. Sandra Bullock, Americas sweetheart, barf, remember when she was with that loser Jesse James, well he was previously with a porn star and had a child with her, then turns around and won't let her see the little girl and Sandra played a big role in that. It was really sad as Janine had some drug issues got sober and Jesse and Sandra would never let her see the girl, even talked to magazines and the media about how awful Janine was, even though Jesse always had a heavy drug addiction and likely still does, but no one would listen to Janine because she was an ex porn star and Sandra was the doting step mother. These people are sick, twisted and royally fucked. Oprah, yeah with all her money she had financial problems with the girls school in Africa, riiiiiight. What's the real story? You can't get that famous with that much money and not be Illuminati indoctrinated. Oprah loved to keep the race issue alive on her shows and even audience members would call her out on it. So much for coming together, divide and conquer works best to control the population and dumb everyone down. In Haiti there was graffiti on the walls of the city in huge capital letters CLINTONS with a circle and line through it. The locals hated them. True story, this was in a post someone made while volunteering in Haiti after the earth quake. Makes you wonder. These charities, what's good is bad and what's bad is good...

             This is the stupid 35,000 look from me.  But this may be helpful to some trying to sort out a lot of this religious sect.  Pretty much every religion has has a corrupt "offshoot" which is part of the pedo cabal.  And these people all may think they are something "special".
            </p>
            <p>
             Islam, Catholicism, Judaism, Christianity - all have pedo sects.  Arab Muslims and the Afghans have been doing it so long, it is culturally embedded in some regions.  I've not heard much about this within Asian religions.  I think something went wrong in Western Europe a long, long time ago.

             This site seems to provide some linkage between Kabbalah and Gnosticism:
             <a href="http://www.newkabbalah.com/gnos.html">
              http://www.newkabbalah.com/gnos.html
             </a>
             .  The Gnostics then gave rise to the Freemasons, Illuminati, Mormons, and possibly the Knights Templar.  Traditional Judaism has little in common with Gnosticism, although I have read several articles that claimed Gnosticism was actually started by Jews.  That might explain the so called gospel of Judas which maintains that Judas did Jesus a favor through his betrayal.  The canonical gospels don't really discuss Judas' reasons, though money is mentioned.

            One of My first voat posts which was deleted was about Children, Inc which operates in Africa etc..based out of Virginia. I geuss the problem was I didn't keep the magazine to take finer photos of the ad. It waz just an ad for childrens inc, in  the nat geo magazine which i waz pointing out all the hidden (not so hidden) messages within. The imagery is obvious. But anyone could order the national  geographic from 2002 to find it, if they doubted me. I would if I had extra cash. . Im still looking for one to pop up randomly. But I kinda felt like I have a good enough example right here and the fact it was pulled is Bullshit. That's just me. But im just not a bulshitter. I can't make up the sick shit. 
Ok the ad is about a little 4 or 5 year girl called little buchi, within her dress on her torso lower right and left sides are the words which read PALACE HOTEL twice, and within her dress on her neck upper right,  is A MANS FACE WITH SURGICAL MASK AND DEVIL HORNS . On her neck on the upper left is the word SOLD there is "art" within little Buchi's Dress on her left shoulder, a scene that informs the eye about a brutal birth, horror scene, on her belly in the lower center reads the word SUGAR. On her upper right shoulder an "artistic" scene with gentlemen? Legs spread, teeth gnashing? This is NOT A PLAID DRESS. 
Little Buchi WTF?

            This  article doesn't  appear to  have  anything to  do  with  Pizzagate  directly,  and the  article  on Bullock was pretty  much yellow  journalism without  any significance  and  not particularly convincing-yes  Madonna  is a Jewish slime  icon that  needs  to be thrown  in  the  trash like a  nasty booger on your  little  pinky  but that  is  hardly  news

             What? International adoptions by stars have been part of Pizzagate since the beginning.Is this another attempt to get this post buried?

             And who the hell are you to say what's yellow journalism? Her ex-husband made the allegations, oh, but he's lying and she's telling the truth based on what?

              NO-adoptions  by  stars in  and  of  itself is not related to Pizzagate, the story  on  Bullock  is  tabloid, much  to  do about  nothing, Maddona is a nast Jewish mouthpiece, despicable  yes  but this article is pretty useless

                You  don't  have  to  argue,  just  post some real evidence-VOAT has  always  had stringent policies on  EVIDENCE    though the discipline  has  been lost in  the  last  6  months  from what I  have seen

            Also one of the most exploited with slave labor and human trafficking.  What better country to keep the poor extremely poor, steal natural resources and abuse the population than one that has no means (cell phones, internet) to cry out for help and tell the world about what's happening to them.

             It's true. It seems meddling has kept the country in poverty and given those resources to external interests. Think what would happen if Africans actually had rights to the gold/diamonds in their own country?

            <p>
             And you're leaving out pharmaceutical interests. They test all sorts of drugs on the population. The ebola testing came under fire for the torture they produced. But bringing these kids into the home ... I shudder what I think of what goes on.

              I wasn't leaving out Pharm...last sentence about testing drugs is direct link to Pharm. Aids supposedly "started" in Africa. Also, there's more people than Pharm directly that make money off of diseases and drugs...
