            Brian Peck has been convicted of abusing a Nickelodean child actor and he is still working there.  There are presently more allegations involving Nickelodean.  They are at present calling the actor John Doe to protect him.  Dan Schneider says he is having sleep overs at his house just like Michael Jackson.  Hollywood has a perverted sense of what decency is.  Harvey Weinstein is known as God by actors and the Moguls. Wohl says you can keep up with it all on Offended America.com There will be a tape released on Thursday.  This guy sounds on the level.....Jacob Wohl.  Upvoat  Thanks for Posting This

             Lipstick Alley has multiple threads on pedos. Google the name and start reading. Lots of info came up on Brian Peck and Nickelodean.

             The Black Child has done a lot of exposes on what really goes on in the music and entertainment industries. Just did a shocking (to me at least) story on a new Disney music video meant for children. Also did a vid on why Harvey W is now being exposed (ripping off a well-liked industry charity.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't agree with everything The Black Child says and advocates but the host is spot on in a whole lot of areas.

              Thanks will check them out.  I am still find some things shocking too, even after reading what I do.  My big dream is to see the House of Disney fall.  Can't wait.  Club 33 needs to be exposed as well.

               While primarily a Black Women's Site for the educated,  LSA is adamantly against any form of pedo behavior, rape, extreme sexual harassment on the job, anything that makes the young, poor, powerless feel that more vulnerable. You might even want to start a thread asking for anonymous experiences. Bet you'll get a lifetime of answers to read.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the most bizarre stories I ever read about pedos was in LSA. Heard variations on The Black Child, personal interviews with multiple talented Black artists and musicians willing to expose the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               A single mother was upset upon finding her super talented, beautiful young daughter who truly loved acting on a TV series was getting sexually harassed by ugly pedos. She insisted on having a talk at the studio with the show's producers. After she sat down a being "shape-shifted" in front of her. She ran out the door, grabbed her child, and quickly left Hollywood forever.
              </p>
              <p>
               Daughter relaying the story on LSA said she never, ever got any more details about what happened from her Mother. I could never figure out if special lighting tricks were used to create a bizarre image, which would frighten a religious woman, or what actually happened. As I said other similar stories of encountering a "shape-shifting" type being/demon were relayed by others seeking a music career at the time of the signing of the official contract. Those stories are online on YouTube where the realities of working in the music industry are revealed. Same for kids as it is for adults.
              </p>
              <p>
               You also might want to go to GodLikeProductions and read "Star Child's" account of Jessica Simpson's Reality TV show taping. "Star Child" believed to be the adult son of a old-time famous actor relays his horrible childhood of being forced to participate in swinging with other little children and famous politicians, as well as all of his father's business contacts. "Star Child" says this is the norm for children of the famous in Hollywood.

                This is what we have been finding about some stars, that they have sold off their children and it does not get any sadder than that.  The person a child trusts the most selling them to be used by others is thoroughly disgusting.  I cannot even imagine the pain that can manifest and it can last a lifetime if they never get deep psychiatric help.  So sad.

                You know, we have not really dug really deep down when it comes to Disney but I remember a digging into Club 33 and there were names on the list of the board and other bits that pointed to reasons to suspect and also I know that Walt Disney was a member of Bohemian Gardens and I believe that was established months ago on here.  There is always someone popping up with remarks about how there are parties after hours and how people are disgusted with him after hearing about his past. It may just be time to dig down further.
