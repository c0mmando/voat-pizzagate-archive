            erm.. he is using language that is used by me directly.. i used to work making software for banks and worked hard to expose the frauds and same issues he is exposing. somehow he is identifying the 'ank' part of 'bank' as being significant and also using my own name as the name for his currency - the 'ura'.

(URA is short for hours and labor its the currency of the new bank as explained in the interviews with Bernard)

             <p>
              greetings. i have been working to expose this topic for years, but due to me not have such a 'high flying criminal past' - i don't really get the same attention as he has ;)
             </p>
             <p>
              i worked for over 2 years making software for a company that made trading software for international banks - not consciously connected to ronald bernard, though possibly the software was used by some people he worked with. that is not really my point here.
             </p>
             <p>
              a large part of my work has been analysing and decoding the covert and overt use of language on our planet within the corrupt systems to identify evidence and connections that can be used to expose the criminality and dysfunctions, plus to evolve our own mind patterns to create new balance. several times i have found others using my ideas and never mentioning where they got them from. part of why i have not yet shared my work is that there are risks involved and it seems to me that one of the people who had 'borrowed' some of my ideas has already been murdered - not by me obviously, but apparently his sharing of ideas was a bit too close to the 'bone' for 'someone' out there. i was surprised to see ronald's website cryptically highlight the 'ank' part of 'bank' since outside of my own writing, i have never seen anyone else do that. yes, the connection is to the 'egyptian' 'ankh'. obviously, he knows something about the patterns i am highlighting too. when i saw his currency was 'ura' i was triggered into annoyance - since it would not be the first time that someone has basically lifted part of my work - however, in this case, it would be much more than that in that my work would have been lifted from my PC - without consent - which is a concern i have since it is so easy for 'those with the power' to do so. anyway, i don't know if the connections to my work are anything more than synchronicity, but it annoyed me for a moment. i am not saying he copied me - i am just saying i feel there is a connection occurring that i would like to understand. it would certainly be unfortunate if my remodel for earth's systems were appropriated by the illuminati characters and then reinserted into the world in their own model - under the guise of it coming from a 'reformed character' from their own group. it certainly would not be the first time such a thing has occurred. i suggest to take great care here.
             </p>
             <p>
              when i referred to ura being my name, i mean that literally 'ura' is my first name.

               If you are afraid of releasing your research why do you want to mention the research here?  this place is a HOTSPOT...,  your first name is quiet uncommon.

               Makes me curious, can you give a link or some extra information(about the ankh/patterns), why you think the Ankh is highlighted? if you don't want to share, can you tell if you think its a positive or negative reference?

               About him using URA, He says the word comes from Hours (Uren) and Labour (Arbeid in dutch), i can understand its very strange/coincidentally to see your name popping up here especial in combination with the related things you working on.

               The Bank software he is using now is mentioned in this video

               About Bernard's initiative/interview:
Why no official reply about the success of the video interview, 
Why in the other older lecture video's he seems a lot less emotional touched, telling/mentioning his story ?
               <br/>
               Why a new currency? 
Why a (new) bank?
Why not mentioning Pizzagate in the video, but only in the title?
               <br/>
               Why is there 0 information about his financial background.
              </p>
              <p>
               The people need a reply from him regarding the big success of the video...
And for the benefit of there new bank initiative ... he should make a official reply to the video...

                i am not afraid, so much as just intend to prevent exploitation and distortion of what i am doing. i never mention more than 0.5% of what i am doing. i am fine with that low amount.
               </p>
               <p>
                regarding the ankh - to me it is clear that he is attempting to use the term 'ank' in a 'positive' way to infer life force being present within his version of a bank - as opposed to the death force that is operating the current paradigm. at least, that is what i think he would say if questioned. however, my interpretation of the actual word 'bank' itself is that it's entire composition (regardless of etymological dictionary definitions) is intended to empower it's users already by including the word 'ank' within it and so to act as a channel / magnet for life force energy - for the benefit of the 'bank' controllers.  in other words, i see the embedding of the 'ank' within 'bank' as a form of NLP / mind control / magic - that is very old.
               </p>
               <p>
                thanks for the vimeo link, but i don't speak dutch presently - so i don't know what he described there.
               </p>
               <p>
                i agree with some of your questions about him and i will also add:
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  if he is admitting major criminality - why is no-one pressuring for him to be interrogated and the criminals brought to justice, instead of just supporting his own idea for defining the future of all commerce on earth!? "hi, i used to be a major criminal defrauding entire nations and being involved with genocidal agendas. but its all ok now, here's my plan for your future".. really?
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  why would he be tortured when he intended to leave 'the network' (when it is usually understood that no-one leaves and the alternative is death). why was he not just killed? obviously the torture did nothing.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  what evidence exists that he is not just another chancer who read the common 'conspiracy theories' online and put together an equation in which he would be able to exploit many people? he already admitted to massively exploited many people.
                 </p>
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                i could go on, but these are a key entry point towards clarity.

              In order to remote view, you need a lot of DMT.

              Most people have calcified their pineal glands through fluoridation.
             </p>
             <p>
              The children tagged with CARIS JAMES are part of a congenital anomaly register, they specifically show waardenburg syndrome (feel free to debate this point)
             </p>
             <p>
              Aldous Huxley shows some traits of the syndrome, his PAX6 transcriptor had a congenital mutation resulting in his eye problems. These mutations can also indicate higher intelligences, due to the differences in pineal gland secretions.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason they are picking these children, is they will make useful assassins/espionage/black assassin. Also the increased intelligence helps the mind compartmentalise far more easily because of the more complex neural maps.
             </p>
             <p>
              missense mutations in the most ancient residue PAX6 paired domain underlie a spectrum of human congenital eye malformations.
PAX6 is responsible for Savantism and the down sloping eyes of autism.

                OP means natural DMT, produced by the pineal gland. Hence the explanation that many people have calcified pineal glands due to the fluoridation of water.

                 I know, that's why I specified ingesting additional DMT is not a prerequisite, but thanks. Remote viewing is possible with regular fluoride ingestion, but yeah seems there's reason to believe that fluoride calcifies the pineal glad, thus supposedly weakening the 3rd eye's capabilities, such as remote viewing and lucid dreaming. I do believe there are many more factors involved, though

            ~100 upvotes on a post doesn't mean everyone on Voat knows who he is.  Not by a longshot.  This is new and you would be doing everyone a favor if you explain who he is at the top of your post.
