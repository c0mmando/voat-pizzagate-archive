            These are basically random thoughts -
           </p>
           <p>
            Of the 12,000 plus subscribers on this subverse, isn't there anyone with insider knowledge/evidence that could penetrate the web of deception in are of the areas that are complicit in pedo, trafficking, etc?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where are the hackivists? Couldn't there be evidence at NCMEC, etc?  Project Veritas, or someone needs to be in the system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are we relying 100% on the weiner laptop or other discovery in the Clinton Foundation investigation? Do we even know for sure there is an investigation into the foundation ongoing with FBI.  I know the Oversight Committee is still on it

            but can they bring criminal charges?
           </p>
           <p>
            I go back and read the years and years of committees on trafficking, yet the problem only gets worse. Seems obvious it's not a problem that they want to stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can show people long lists of professional, prominent people who have been convicted of cp and you have to know that is just the small portion that has been caught...and yet, they will not wake up and get mad.  Wikileaks can put out documents that show corruption and collusion and people do not read.  Makes me want to scream when I hear someone say "What's wikileaks?" Everyone has gotten so immune to corruption in the government that it is just expected and accepted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have to go to work now.. frustrated, but wanting to remain hopeful.   Sick of the people seeking the spotlight or wanting credit for being the first to report.  Produce some actual results and I'll praise you all day.

            Nobody does any research anymore! Its all complete riducoulousness lately. Seaman, Milo, Worldcorp ( what a joke)Alex Jones, magicians, Ashton Kutcher, random pizza shops, music lyrics. Did all the great detectives give up on here. What about the Hawaii connection, the Elpida home, Frank Guistra, Haiti and many more. I feel like this site has unfortunately hit a brick wall. Sad face.

            Yes, everything you said, but I think tech is finally at a point that could enable what they had in mind, ww3, depopulation, open slavery. There are more rebellious minds out in the world than they realize though

            I read about Fiona Barnett in another thread and started to watch her videos.
Found this very interesting
            <a href="https://youtu.be/1Q3yH9EIPfs?t=8m20s">
             https://youtu.be/1Q3yH9EIPfs?t=8m20s
            </a>
            Basically she explains that the pedophilia is cover, a red herring, for the really bad stuff, i.e. the satanic rituals.
For me this really struck a chord with what Alex Jones has been saying about "probably innocent" Comet Ping Pong. "Innocent" meaning, yeah, they're raping kids, but the REALLY bad shit is elsewhere, and CPP is just a cover to protect those places.
           </p>
           <p>
            God that's a horrible thought: the pedophilia isn't even the worst shit they're involved in.
Day of the rope when?

            I'm confused -- is this the place to leave a comment about the idea of the open thread, or is it the open thread itself?
           </p>
           <p>
            So here goes -- an idea about how to convince people who resist the idea that pedophilia is rampant among the power elite. Simply talk about the transgender movement. As recently as a decade ago, how many of us gave much thought to the existence of transgender people? Now it's a phenomenon that receives national attention. So too the idea of rampant pedophilia and its nature to manifest among individuals with extremely strong power drives shall become better known. It's a form of sex related to the kind of bottomless greed and massive cruelty that can only occur among political and economic rulers, part and parcel of the absolute corruption attributed to absolute power.  Some (many?) of those with the singleminded ruthlessness needed to reach the top must have willingly killed tenderness in themselves; only the frisson of ultimate transgression is left -- they hold common mating to be the inferior class's default, junkfood sex. The sexual liberation movement of the 60s has flushed out and fed all sorts of previously secret and even unheard-of sexual variations: elite pedophilia is another. This is not to 'normalize' what is and must remain a crime. But once you've accepted a previously unthinkable Caitlin Jenner, you need to recognize a seemingly unthinkable John Podesta as well.

            I think satanic stuff like trafficking is ramping up so fast lately because the old bastards like rockafeller, soros, some rothschilds, and kissinger are getting so old they want to see their plans come true before they die

            This is great. Sometimes, there may not be sufficient information about a strong hunch someone has, and therefore cannot submit the info. However, if that person can submit on this thread, other people will see it, and later if more info surfaces about the topic, it will be on more people's radar.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll use the thread for this purpose right now and repost a comment I made regarding the recent mansion fire in McLean, VA. The submission on which I commented was made by Seth_Rich 2 days ago. User "DarkMath" responded to my comment and pointed out a possible organ trafficking angle to my comment and mentioned George Webb. User "dmthirdeye" pointed out the Masonic number "33" in my comment.

            Hello, long time lurker here and finally registered. This may or may not be something indirectly related, so I thought I'd share. I have my suspicions about it, which I'll share. Maybe some can find out more info.
           </p>
           <p>
            Triple homicide in the McLean Fairfax VA area. 1339 Windy Hill Rd. Apparently Shirley Zhou and her son her shot by the husband and father, Hong Chen. Shirley owned and operated (personally performed) permanent makeup procedures on customers' faces, like permanent makeup eyebrows. They are like "tattoos."
           </p>
           <p>
            My suspicions: -very wealthy neighborhood near politicians
           </p>
           <p>
            -permanent makeup clinic- covert uses, changing identity, etc. Hillary's double?
           </p>
           <p>
            -cannot find anything about Chen, other than previous places of residence, mainly around the DC area
           </p>
           <p>
            -Shirley Zhou was from China and frequently traveled there to learn more about makeup procedures, trafficking connection?
           </p>
           <p>
            -News reports conflicted with each other early on, and especially as time went on. -Neighbors said that they didn't know the family that lived there/ They were well liked in the neighborhood -A family friend called police after seeing a body through the window/ The daughter found the bodies -The couple reportedly has a daughter who is away at college/ The daughter found the bodies
           </p>
           <p>
            -Police were and still are, according to the news reports I've seen and read and based on my intuition, not telling the whole story. They conducted a massive investigation with K-9s sniffing the woods, evidence teams at the scene, etc, and said that more details other than the revealed, "There was trauma to the bodies," would wait until family was notified. But later, reports say that the daughter found the bodies.
           </p>
           <p>
            -The usual store bought boquet of flowers that appears at so many possible false flag shootings started appearing while reporters were on scene, but apparently these folks were not known.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Apparently, this lady was an expert in the makeup art. People would travel from all over the country for her services. People on the makeup clinic's Facebook page stated how they had sacrificed time off, money, and travel to let her do the procedures.
           </p>
           <p>
            -I think it smells fishy, but could be nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            In light of this fire, I thought I'd post this.

            Major shilling op going on to cause division and infighting in the investigation. David Seaman and Alex Jones are example targets, I've also seen George Webb in the crosshairs. Think for yourself, remain focused on the goal of exposing and taking down child rapists.

             I'm gonna go over a few things with everyone, sorry if it seems like I'm hijacking, but you brought it up.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're dealing with a demoralizing campaign. I've outlined the process in another post, so I'm going to post it again:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              When we want to stamp out dissent, we follow a similar pattern:
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                Dismiss
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Discredit
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Deny/Distract
               </p>
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              First, we dismiss them. Remember all those times we heard, "oh, it's just some bullshit consipracy." Well, firstly, that lead us in to stage two. Anyway, the point of this step is to try and reduce the noise about it. A few years ago, no one gave a shit about 4chan, or the few more radical subreddits, and other similar sanctuaries for free speech. I'm sure you can come up with more examples.
             </p>

              Next, we use character attacks on the loudest or the most likely to cause a commotion in order to discredit them and make them seem like they're full of shit. We saw this happen with Fox news, info wars, etc.

              Finally, we use a plethora of methods to deny access to given information. This can be done in a multitude of ways, the easiest, yet messiest method I'm sure you're all familiar with is the popular "oops they killed themselves." A few more things we can do are limit the flow of information, ie. infiltrating IC and disrupting actual data transfer in the way of networking holds and the like. This would also be the ideal time to utilize distractions such as a dam breaking or the Kremlin being implicated in just about everything (which utilizes basic ass emotional appeals).

             I can give you guys a few things to go off of as a starting point in preparing yourselves for shills:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">
              reductio ad absurdum
             </a>
             ,
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences">
              argumentum ad consequentiam
             </a>
             (mentioned above), and
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_repugnance">
              wisdom of repugnance
             </a>
             . This is a primer for the types of emotional persuasion they're likely to use.

             is a list of logical fallacies. From this group, we should pay attention to the use of ad hominem, straw men, gentic fallacies, slippery slopes, texas sharpshooters, and loaded questions especially.

             Their objective? Quite the audience, for the show must go on.

             Yea too much personal attacks at characteristic not even related to pedoring researching.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              e.g "I don't tolerate journalist getting money by reporting pizzagate" "I dont like this fatfak because he doesn't even report pizzagate, so he is definitely shill." etc....
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             And this progresses into this sort of submission.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              "Don't attack alex. I love him. He reported area51 project, this might be related to Bush pedogate in XXXX"
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             And community's focus is blurred, it distracts us from the most powerful info about JP, JA, Obama, Hillary, pizza which derives from wikileaks, and voat eventually turns into an ordinary "conspiracy theory" community.
