<p>He spoke about this in his inaugural address:
&quot; I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in &quot;</p>
<p>In practice, a 1991 article stated only 11% of it\'s budget went to grants, the rest went to &quot;promotions, consultants, salaries, travel and conferences,&quot;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_points_of_light">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_points_of_light</a></p>
<p>Doris Tate was named as one of the &quot;thousand points of light&quot;. She was the mother of Sharon Tate, who was killed by the Manson Family. Sharon Tate was married to convicted pedophile Roman Polanski. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Tate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Tate</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Tate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Tate</a>.</p>
<p>Jerry Sandusky’s “The Second Mile Foundation”  was recognized as one of President Bush’s top “1000 Points of Light.”  Jerry Sandusky, received a 30 to 60 prison term after being found guilty on 45 counts of the sexual exploitation of minors. <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/01/26/the-suiciding-of-pedophile-investigators/">http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2013/01/26/the-suiciding-of-pedophile-investigators/</a> .Ray Gricar went missing after investigating the case.

<p>Bill Gates has also said, &quot;he’d like to see a birth registration system, and because it’s a new technology, “we should let 1,000 new ideas blossom.” <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/bill-gates-mobile-health-technology-will-save-lives-help-overpopulation/">http://www.zdnet.com/article/bill-gates-mobile-health-technology-will-save-lives-help-overpopulation/</a></p>
<p>Finally as mere speculation, could James be a point of light? James Alefantis\' picture is on this site: <a href="http://cargocollective.com/">http://cargocollective.com/</a>  <a href="http://payload152.cargocollective.com/1/7/231631/5347019/James%20Alefantis_final_905.jpg">http://payload152.cargocollective.com/1/7/231631/5347019/James%20Alefantis_final_905.jpg</a>
&quot;Cargo is a personal publishing platform aimed at creating accessible tools and a networked context to enhance the exposure of talented individuals on the Internet.&quot;  How is JA a talented individual or a inspiration to others?

<p>What type of light are we talking about anyway? Are we talking about lucifer\'s light? According to the KJV-based Strong\'s Concordance means &quot;shining one, light-bearer&quot;...  &quot;bringer of dawn&quot;, for the morning star. Is this the light they are referring to?

            I have been studying their patterns. And I am no expert at all. They gaslight, they discredit by bringing up money. They limit the argument to one thing, and then debunk. That's why they tried to limit it to pizza shops. They roll out their own "experts" to make it look like the problem is being handled. If the public relations campaign does not effectively silence the masses then the witnesses get assasinated. Evidence is destroyed and false flags are used. I think we are in the this stage right now. I think this is going viral exponentially, they are getting desperate. Just my opinion sorrry for the rant.

            Maybe through young children's plasma and pineal glands. When you have all the money in the world and live like a king you want to enjoy it longer.  The fountain of youth is the next thing you buy.

            It's amazing how once you wake up, there is no going back. At first I was physically and spiritually sick, now it's like we are torch bearers for the rest of humanity and more and more people will be made aware of the truth. It takes courage and a good heart to face this, so many people would rather bury their heads in the sand.

             I wish I could upvoat more than 1 excellent point- it all ties back to- Sacrifice /  MK Ultra and the sick experiments they are committing on human lives- When are people going to get outraged at the facts that the government has down played the MK Ultra torment committed- when Bill Clinton "apologized" to the public- everyone was busy watching the OJ trial glued to that BOX- now that was MK ULTRA at it's finest there-  WAKE UP PEOPLE!

            Believe it or not, but these monsters actually believe in occult numerology and its powers. And David Icke's birthday happens to be on 29 of April - which is the Beltane ritual. No1 day for the Satanists apart from Halloween. That is why they fear taking out Icke - for the fear of unleashing powers that might harm their cause. This is the only explanation.

            We are creating our nightmares by running in fear from these realities, NO longer! ...humanity is waking up from the spell and a large part of our reality is a nightmare. People are bringing attention to it now and then it can be healed as more gather the strength to see it for what it truly is. I completely feel you on your words here. Thanks for sharing.

            It was some type of honoring in Obamas or something, i will try to dig it up, and post it here. I just remember Bush calling Obama a shaft or point of light, and he mentioned it several times throughout his speech.

            Fabulous work and connecting dots here, thank you. I remembered reading Bush's speech about the thousand points of light and wondering how strange. He even said Obama was a point or shaft of light in another place where they both met for some type of ceremony.

            Comment by Ben
Comment: I think it would also be worth mentioning that George H.W. Bush's reference to the "thousand points of light" probably was an allusion to this castle and ceremonies therein. Thanks for bringing this subject "to light". Hopefully this topic can be expanded on in the future....

            Neil Young's "Keep on Rockin' in the Free World"
           </p>
           <p>
            The lyrics criticize the George H. W. Bush administration,[5] then in its first month, and the social problems of contemporary American life, while directly referencing Bush's famous "thousand points of light" remark from his 1989 inaugural address and his 1988 presidential campaign promise for America to become a "kinder, gentler nation."

            The hard drive of the county issued laptop that Ray Gricer had is missing...  Or, maybe it is the laptop that is missing...  Either way, he seems to have known too much about the Illuminati and the Luciferians...

             Two boys were hiding in a closet when HW came into the room with a young (12 yo?) black boy.  The kid gave him a blowjob.   One of the 2 boys told this story to Nick Bryant (I believe) and he put it in "The Franklin Scandal".

              There was a mob-owned motor hotel in Houston called the Carrousel that had a lot of government clientele, despite its easy access to prostitutes. One of the owners, a John Coil, told Houston gay activist Ray Hill that HW used to come around with a Hispanic boy (Hill emphasised "boy.")

              I am a card carrying conspiracy theorist. I believe a lot of them. The last one I discovered was a hoax was Sandy Hook.

             <p>
              However I've researched the moon landings and I'm not convinced they were faked. I found an explanation for every argument the hoax people are making. For some reason the one that made the hoax seem plausible was the identical background in some of the pictures. The mountains were so far away that doesn't mean anything:

                Math and Physics are encoded into the Universe. They can't be hacked.
               </p>
               <p>
                The real question regarding our world is whether the Cosmological Constant(CC) means we're living a simulation or not. The CC is the reason Einstein said he couldn't be an Atheist.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's also the reason Werner Heisenberg famously said “The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”
               </p>
               <p>
                The CC is too precise to be believed. I would kind of be like looking up at the stars and seeing ordered rows of lights. If you saw that you'd be very suspicious. It's an imprecise analogy but it sort of fits. Instead of ordered rows of stars the CC is the exact amount of background radiation required to get our universe to neither implode in on itself or blow itself to smithereens. Imagine a ruler stretching from one end of the universe to the other. The CC would be one location on that ruler. If it were to move 1 cm right the universe would blow itself apart. 1 cm left and the universe would have collapsed in on itself. It's such precision it boggles the mind.

                 So much of nature miraculously rests on these precisions. The exact conditions of our planet to sustain life. The body's homeostasis at the very specific 98.6 degrees. The insanely ridiculously perfect female reproductive system. The unfathomable microcosm and macroscosm in any direction we look. Crazy !

                 You lost me. I just assumed you've looked into it since you said it was disinfo. I'm thinking that since the earth is rotating we could simply hover over it w/ a helicopter and watch it spin, since it's supposed to be spinning at the speed of sound. Or does gravity capture the helicopter and spin it around with the earth's rotation, turning it upside down? Do airplanes adjust for the curve as they fly, nosing down constantly? Edit: Earth spins at speed of sound, not light, sorry.

                   No. Does the helicopter spin with the earth or not? Watch a few Eric Dubay videos, DM, you're no dummy, and it's time for you to move on to the biggest hoax/conspiracy of the last 500 years. Suspend disbelief, and give it a shot, since you accepted Sandy Hook.

                      I only made it to 2:16. Besides that gem above the maker of this video is using a Logical Fallacy called "Begging the Question". For example the video will quote a scientists saying "What is everything made of. Woops. There's about 95% of stuff we don't know.". Another one said "Physics isn't making a lot of sense these days.".
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In the case of the first it's talking about "DarkMatter" which is close to my heart because that's one reason I chose DarkMath. Most of the Universe is made up of DarkMatter and no one has ever seen it. If you think about that for a while it will fuck with your mind. That's what that "95% of stuff we don't know" was about.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Back to "Begging the Question", the video places "Flat Earth Theory" after each clip of some real physicist talking about something real. That's to put it in the viewers mind that whatever is next must be real too. It's a very common logical fallacy. I'd say "Begging the Question" and "The Straw Man" are the MSM's favorite weapons in their daily battle against the Truth.

                       If dark matter "which no one has ever seen" is really close to your heart (and I can understand that), then you will def have some trouble with this. Not researching the topic further due to "logical fallacies" that you see in a promo piece sounds in and of itself like a fallacy. Watch some Eric Dubay stuff. And check your pride at the door! No offense DM.

                            You've got it exactly backwards. The water would only fly off if the Earth STOPPED rotating. And technically it wouldn't "fly off" it would just keep moving around the Earth and flood all the continents ending all life as we know it which I'm seriously starting to wonder if God might have that in mind given human stupidity knows no bounds.

                             Gotta run, will talk later. Speaking of God, this is what the whole flat earth truth is all about. The spinning ball earth came courtesy of the pseudo-scientists that gave us evolution.

                             Actually no, you yourself have it backwards. Logically, the water would indeed be flung off. What you are saying is that it is the earth spinning that keeps the oceans stuck to the earth, but that's "gravity" doing that is it not?

                              I didn't realize educational standards in Holland were so poor. I guess that's what Socialism does. It erodes the foundation of any institutions it comes in contact with. Fascinating.

                               Borderline ad hominem, but I'm not offended. Flat earth is a world-wide phenomenon, and it's not going away. Talk later.
