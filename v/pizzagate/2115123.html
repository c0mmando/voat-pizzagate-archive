Salt Lake City — (KUTV) Jerome Elam is an author, lecturer, and human trafficking survivor. When he was 5-years-old Elam\'s stepfather started molesting him. Before long his stepfather started using him for child pornography and then introduced him to his pedophile ring.
&quot;The first time I was trafficked as a child, I was handcuffed to a truck stop bathroom for six hours, raped and sodomized and abused,&quot; said Elam.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Elam\'s story is not new. This is a crime that happens in America every day.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans are truly some of the biggest perpetrators and provide most of the demand for child sex trafficking that\'s going around,&quot; said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes</p>
<p>He says the average age of a trafficked child is between 10 and 12-years-old. It\'s a crime that steals the innocence of children, leaving a shell behind, if not killing them.
&quot;Only perhaps about 10 percent of those who are stuck in the life of being trafficked will ever get out alive,&quot; said Reyes.</p>

               DID can be helped by therapy.  Some patients even experience full re-integration.  Not all abuse victims have DID.  Most Don't.  Most abuse survivors ARE NOT incapacitated messes.  Many you would never have a clue what they've been through.
