            Burke killed her he was jealous all the parental attention Jon Benet got he was also angry she got a better Christmas gift than he got. He flipped out when she ate some of his pineapple as a midnight snack he definitely hit her with the flashlight then took her in the basement and poked her with his train track those two red marks were from the train track model train set not a tazer then he strangled her with the paintbrush and hid her body. The 911 operator heard Patsy yelling at Burke asking him What did you do!?!? it's obvious he killed her then his parents covered it up for fear of losing Burke too. Patsy is dead but John should be prosecuted for helping to cover it up he dicated the ransom note and Patsy wrote it. Case Closed. There was never any intruder and the evidence proves it. CBS did a great two-night documentary and they concluded and proved Burke did it. He got a lawyer and he's suing CBS for $100 Million and I hope it goes to a jury so they can rule against Burke. He's Guilty.

            I remain confused about JBR because as much as I want to believe it was a evil pedos, that CBS documentary made a compelling case for the jealous brother. Its hard to know what to think anymore.

            2930: CAN MCCONNELL SHOW TRUMP SERCO’S 8(A) DEMON TRACKS ON JONBENÉT’S FAKE NEWS BRIDGE?
           </h1>
           <p>
            United States Marine Field McConnell 
Plum City Online – (AbelDanger.net)
March 19, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Abel Danger (AD) has explained how AD’s Global Operations Director Field McConnell can show President Trump how Serco tracked 8(a) company pedophiles with Demon face-recognition software and injected fake news of the JonBenét Ramsey murder using a bogus ransom note on the federal bridge*.
           </p>
           <p>
            *The Federal Bridge Certification Authority – A communication network allegedly set up by Serco to synchronize fake-news injects with sabotage, murder, assassination and propaganda missions sponsored by a deep-state community of Senior Executive Service bureaucrats and US/UK pedophile newsgroups.
           </p>
           <p>
            McConnell claims that Serco and his sister Kristine Marcy – ICE Foundation director and Con Air founder – began using the DoJ Joint Automated Booking System, built by Nortel Networks, in 1996 to place pedophiles and 8(a) company agents and mentors at Demon crimes scenes and publish fake news of murder for hire on the federal bridge.
           </p>
           <p>
            McConnell claims that Serco and Marcy staged the JonBenét murder in December 1996 to extort control over selected users of the federal bridge including John Ramsey’s Access Graphics, Lockheed Martin director Lynne Cheney and their networks of 8(a) Small Business Technology Companies (‘S.B.T.C’).
           </p>
           <p>
            AD claims that Serco – preferred C4I supplier to Boeing – used Demon software and a BBC/ICE archive of child pornography assembled by Jimmy Savile (d. 2011) to blackmail Boeing and Lockheed directors into moving Boeing’s HQ to Chicago and mentoring 8(a) attacks over the federal bridge on 9/11.
           </p>
           <p>
            AD claims that Serco provided the UK Cabinet Office with deep state training for 9/11 when BBC pedophile elites allegedly injected fake news into media plays while 8(a) company actors, experienced journalists and television crews produced the “first live broadcast mass snuff film in human history.”
           </p>
           <p>
            AD claims that Serco and Marcy agents organized the late Clement Freud and Tony and John Podesta into a pedophile news group on the federal bridge and tracked their virtual identities with Demon face recognition software through the crime scenes associated with the abduction of Madeleine McCann on 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Field McConnell is asking for a meeting with President Trump to explain how, with a 14-word amendment (see below) to the U.S. criminal code, he can stop McConnell’s sister Marcy’s and Serco’s alleged use of face-recognition software on interstate commerce facilities including the federal bridge to extort fake news injects from suspects’ – not exclusively pedophiles’ – and conceal murder for hire..
           </p>
           <p>
            “18 U.S. Code § 1958 Use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire where “Whoever travels … with intent that a murder be committed [or news or evidence of such a murder be concealed, withheld, destroyed or faked] … and if death results, shall be punished by death or life imprisonment, or shall be fined not more than $250,000, or both.”

In Re: 26,000 page confession by serial killer and child rapist / JonBenet Ramsey
September 22, 2016
Special Agent Kimberly Milka
Denver FBI
Special Agent Milka,
Attached you will find a copy of a book entitled ‘Two Is Too Young To Die.’ It is located online at the following online address pastebin.com/Z6UkJkR4 I was directed to the link today by somebody I don’t know that visits by online publications.
The book/confession is authored by a serial killer claiming to have murdered JonBenet Ramsey and other children. The 26,000 word book is so completely disturbing and sexually graphic regarding the author’s confessions of violence and rape of little children it shocks the conscience beyond my ability to convey horror.
I am stating for the record in this Report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the author of this abomination could never be protected or immune from state and/or federal prosecution under the National Security Act of 1947. Nothing contained in this satanic composition and confession regarding the rape and murder of little children falls under National Security.
I will be providing a copy of this through the United States Postal Service to U.S. presidential candidate Donald J. Trump for review by his tentative Justice Department.
My heart and soul are searing with anger; and this I will tell you; the Lord God of Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham will not let this stand; that I will tell you.
Respectfully submitted, 
Timothy Charles Holmseth

            Our country’s Luciferian shadow government will not prosecute such matters.
Therefore, the confession, which was published on Barnes and Noble for a period of time, will be submitted by Timothy Charles Holmseth to U.S. presidential candidate Donald J. Trump for review by his tentative Justice Department.
Write Into Action is reluctantly publishing a few segments from ‘Two Is Too Young To Die’ for purposes of exposing the truth.

            I have spent over a thousand hours researching JonBenet. There are some very misleading statements in this article. For example:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Innuendo of sexual abuse began to circulate, though no evidence was ever found to prove these allegations."
           </p>
           <p>
            Untrue by definition because JonBenet's medical records have
            <em>
             never been released
            </em>
            . Investigators have had no access at all to them. Even though at the autopsy the coroner observed evidence of external sexual trauma, the subject and content of her
            <em>
             frequent
            </em>
            visits to the doctor remain a mystery.
           </p>
           <p>
            My own (quite well informed) opinion: it was impossible for any intruder to enter the house through the basement window. There is considerable evidence that it was her brother Burke that knocked her unconscious with a flashlight to the back of the head and either he or Patsy strangled her afterwards.
           </p>
           <p>
            The JonBenet case has nothing to do with Pizzagate. Don't waste your time.

            </p>
            <p>
             A mother murdered her daughter? That makes absolutely no sense at all and reminds me of the disinfo put out regarding the Madeleine McCann case.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know who killed JonBenet but there sure seems like an awful lot of disinfo getting put out surrounding it. The most egregious is John Mark Karr's story. Karr was unquestionably part of some sort of Finders ring in Thailand procuring children to grease the gears of Brownstone Operations, of that there is no question. His "admission" very conveniently brought him back to the U.S. at a time when Thai authorities were more than willing to go digging.
            </p>
            <p>
             Therefor by deduction we can easily say there's most definitely pedophilia involved in the JonBenet case. John Mark Karr did that himself. And "my own (quite well informed) opinion" after reading up on the sordid shit for the past 6 months leads me to believe the pedophilia we see was part of a larger Brownstone Operation.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that my friend means you're either full of shit or a useful idiot. Sorry, I don't make the rules.

              Interesting! Sorry to sound like an simpleton, but to me, John Mark Karr just LOOKED like a pedophile. It always felt like he had struck some kind of deal with Colorado/Thai authorities: "let us sully your name in association with the Jon Benet Ramsey case to throw people off, and we won't prosecute you for touching up little Thai boys/girls..." kind of scenario.

                This is fascinating. I found John Mark Karr so creepy and who the hell shows up randomly to declare themselves a wanted pedo in one of the highest profiled murder mysteries in US history, unless otherwise provoked/threatened/forced/used as patsy.

                Do you think Jon Ramsey encouraged/financed the CBS special to throw faux-blame AT Burke and AWAY FROM the REAL guilty freaks...???

              The two cases have nothing to do with each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's take a look at your logic for a second: John Mark Karr claims to have killed JonBenet. He did this ten years after the fact. The problem is that he was lying: he claimed to have drugged her when she had no drugs in her system and his DNA didn't match the DNA found in her underwear.
             </p>
             <p>
              So he had
              <em>
               nothing whatever
              </em>
              to do with the case at all. Nada. He wasn't even charged. That means that any facts about him - who he is and what he was doing - have no bearing at all on the JonBenet case. This is just basic logic man.

               So yes, John Mark Karr had absolutely nothing to do with the JonBenet murder. But TPTB running these Brownstone Operations had to get him out of Thailand and fast before he spilled the beans. And there's your evidence he's related to JonBenet. Yes he could have just been really cunning and smart but it's way too cunning and smart if you know what I mean. John Mark Karr is a pedophile coward. He doesn't have a cunning bone in his pathetic body. They couldn't kill him because he was in a Thai jail so they had to do the next best thing.

                 JMK was "sipping champagne" on a "FIRST CLASS" flight back to the US? You're kidding. Where? Links!

                 This is getting more twisted with each year that goes by. I sort of always dismissed JMK as a creepy pedo mentally ill attention seeker, but now looking like something more sinister went on. This really needs a separate thread.

                 Have you seen George Webb's videos at all? Watch those, he explains what a Brownstone Operation is. Black budgets are padded with drugs, organs and children. It's total fucking insanity. They used to just make money dealing drugs. Then some psychopathic genius figured in for a penny in for a pound and the rest is history.
