<h2 id="md-weve-never-quite-known-whether-child-molesters-should-be-treated-as-sick-people-or-punished-as-criminals">We’ve never quite known whether child molesters should be treated as sick people or punished as criminals</h2>
<p>On Sunday, HBO premieres Leaving Neverland, the new documentary that tells the stories of two men who say they were repeatedly sexually abused by Michael Jackson while they were children. The new reckoning raises the persistently tricky question: Should pedophilia be treated as a sickness or punished as a crime? After Jackson was charged with several counts of child molestation, Dahlia Lithwick looked into the research to try to answer the question. Initially published in January 2004, the original, still enlightening, is reprinted below.</p>
<p>Again, and for all the wrong reasons, we can’t take our eyes off Michael Jackson. Whether or not the allegations are substantiated, the question is in the air: Is pedophilia a disease to be treated, or a crime to be punished? Are people who seduce minors sick or evil? Our current legal and medical systems blur both views. We call for the most draconian punishments (life imprisonment, castration, permanent exile) precisely because we view these acts as morally heinous, yet also driven by uncontrollable biological urges. </p>
<hr />
<p>If sex with children is truly the product of freely made moral choices, then we should deal with it through the criminal justice system. But if it is a genetically over-determined impulse, an uncontrollable urge nestled in our DNA, then punishing pedophiles must be morally wrong. As science—and culture—increasingly medicalizes bad behavior, finding a neurological component to everything from alcoholism to youth violence, we run the parallel risks of either absolving everyone for everything, or punishing “criminals” who are no guiltier than cancer patients.</p>
<p>What science has revealed about the moral/medical roots of pedophiles is, of course, ambiguous. What is clear is that the binary choice laid out above is an oversimplification. The medical community, which started to view pedophilia as a disease rather than a crime in the 19th century, has amassed evidence that at least some violent and antisocial behaviors have genetic links and signposts. But researchers have been unable to isolate a biological cause for pedophilia, or even to agree on a personality profile. Not to mention the terrific confusion within the medical community in defining what this “disease” really involves. Until a few years ago, for example, the DSM-IV—the Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—defined pedophilia as a disease only if the sufferer’s “fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.” In other words, a non-impaired, remorseless pedophile was apparently perfectly healthy.</p>
<p>Advocates of the “disease” school say pedophilia is often the product of uncontrollable impulses that seem to respond to treatment (including castration, both surgical and chemical) particularly in conjunction with monitoring and behavioral therapy. This raises at least a possibility not associated with car thieves and insider traders: That small tweaks to one’s brain chemistry may neutralize the impulse to commit more crimes. And if that is the case, they contend, shouldn’t we be treating rather than punishing? Can we really call ourselves a just society if we are jailing folks for their neurochemical profile? In a thoughtful essay in Reason, Thomas Szasz urges that pedophilia is ultimately still a moral failure regardless of its biological roots: “Bibliophilia means the excessive love of books. It does not mean stealing books from libraries. Pedophilia means the excessive (sexual) love of children. It does not mean having sex with them.” The crime, he argues, is not the psychological impulse, but the willingness to give in to it. But this conclusion assumes an answer that science is still uncertain about: whether for some pedophiles, the impulse to molest has become a pathology. If that is the case, pedophiles can’t have the criminal intent necessary to want to commit a crime, and that <em>mens rea</em> is the cornerstone of our criminal law...</p>

            I think pedophilia is a growing problem due to pornography addiction progression in addicts. I must confess I am an example of this. If I didn't confess it I would continue to feel like I'm lying to everyone or hiding something. And ever since starting researching Pizzagate, pedophilia became more tempting and alluring despite or maybe because of how it disturbed me. The reason is that I had not confronted pedophilia before in my life, so I was not aware to be dedicated against it yet. Then, when faced with it, and all while in a porn addiction that my therapist described as one of his most severe cases to date (and I am very young), I made some severe mistakes. I think most pedophiles can change and work to protect children instead of giving in to their lusts, if they ask God for help and struggle to dedicate themselves to a new Ideal. I struggle with pedophilic thoughts sometimes but I fully acknowledge it is evil and I have evidence that God actually planned for everything that's happened to me so I could make the informed choices I've made, and to adopt the philosophies I have that place children in their rightful place of innocence and virtue

             It definitely seems like the whole world -- entertainment, fashion, technology, education, political and civil rights movements -- has been set up to corrupt and weaken people and encourage them to indulge their lusts. Keep up the good fight, AS. :-)

            rape is a crime of control.  the rapist needs to take back his control  he feels he lost from women.  He can't rape her if she isn't upset/fighting/screaming etc.
if she acts like she wants  it, he cant perform.
rape against a child is the same thing only one step further.  The rapist cant relate to an adult.
           </p>
           <p>
            people don't grow up wanting to rape.

            A serial killer has an illness too. A mental illness as well. That is also a crime. It's not as complicated as you think.

            Maybe it is neither? A friend's brother was in prison for pedophilia ..he worked to pay for therapy in prison so that he would never hurt another child. If western government really wanted to stop the crimes, looks like they would have free therapy for those who wanted it.

             That's very admirable of your friend's brother, and a good argument for stronger penalties. Was his therapy successful?

            Is torture, deceit, lies, and permanent psychological and many times physical damage of victims treated as an illness? Sometimes it is but most of the time, it is evil. Is war an illness? I don't think so, a war waged to destroy evil is not an illness.

            It's deviation just like homosexualism because it cannot lead to procreation so it's deviation from biological point of view, it's also immoral because it hurts children. The thing is - people often can chose what they want to be, we have free will - anyone who say that we don't - lies to himself. Often it's harder to chose what we want to do because there are cases of hard childhood or history of homosexual contacts or being raped in young age, but it's probably possible to overcome it.

             People like you disgust me. It’s because of your types that pizzagate lacks credibility in the public’s eye. You moron, uneducated baboon. So hard to red pill people as long there are scum like you.
