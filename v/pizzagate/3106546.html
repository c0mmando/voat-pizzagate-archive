<p><strong>So that is the CDAN blind, as least as best as I can explain it</strong>. As I’m sure folks realize, there is no way you can confirm or deny something like a <a href="https://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/07/blind-items-revealed-40.html">CDAN post</a> other than trying to find corroborating information elsewhere. But as I’m sure many folks here might know, the most definitive evidence I could find, outside the CDAN blind, that Monica Petersen actually was in Haiti investigating some kind of human trafficking, is a Jan. 2016 Facebook post shared by Bella Robinson, who is a Rhode Island-area sex worker and sex worker rights advocate, and was a confirmed friend of Monica Petersen, according to the same Washington article by WaPO reporter Glenn Kessler. </p>
<p>In the January 4th, 2016 post shared by Bella Robinson on Facebook, Bella claims to be sharing a report from Monica Petersen, who supposedly was in Haiti at the time. The 2016 WaPo article, does in fact confirm that Monica did visit Haiti “… a number of times.” <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193">(You can see multiple postings of Bella’s Jan. 2016 Facebook post embedded on this other Voat thread about the Petersen investigation)</a>.  According to Bella’s post, Monica reported that she was actively investigating the Clinton’s ongoing deep ties to corruption in Haiti, in particular the Clinton’s family’s shady links to the Morne Bossa mine in the north of Haiti. The Morne Bossa mine is located right next to the Clinton Foundation-sponsored Caracol Industrial Complex (i.e textile sweatshop), near Cap Hatien in Northern Haiti. Again, according to Bella’s post on Facebook, Monica claimed in her “travel update”-type report:</p>
<p>“..the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. <strong>I can’t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton’s Caraol [sic] Complex.</strong> And mining has always been historically linked to trafficking, slavery, and labor exploitation.” </p>
<p>This Facebook post was clearly only shared by Bella to her own little group of friends back in January 2016, well before Monica’s death and before all this became news. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/?utm_term=.86ab79b19f3b">Dec. 2016 Washington Post article</a> about Monica’s death, written by WaPo reporter Glenn Kessler, Bella Robinson is interviewed. The entire focus of Kessler’s article, from start to finish, is a debunking job against the supposed “conspiracy theories” about Monica’s death. In the WaPo article, Bella denies that Monica’s trip to Haiti had anything at all to do with investigating human trafficking. However, in the very same article, Kessler claims that Bella herself was the one who started the supposed Monica Petersen “conspiracy theories.” According to Kessler’s WaPo article:</p>
<p>“An acquaintance named Bella Robinson, a sex worker and activist in Rhode Island, in January had posted a blog post that Petersen had shared on Facebook that had been critical of the Clinton Foundation’s work in Haiti. Shortly after Petersen’s death, the blog post appeared in a Reddit discussion thread. This then resulted in a flurry of “news stories” falsely claiming that Petersen had written the blog post and was killed for investigating the Clintons.” </p>
<p>The <a href="https://imgur.com/TmiB2gU">blog post</a> linked to from the WaPo article, containing Bella’s posts about Petersen, is in fact a random imgur image hosting website with screenshots of posts from Bella, Monica Petersen, the Human Trafficking Center, and the “Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking.” The imgur site linked to from the WaPo article, does in fact contain one of Bella’s posts quoting Monica Petersen’s investigation into the Clintons in Haiti. <strong>However, the imgur site linked to by the WaPo article, does not contain the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193">specific Facebook post</a> from Jan. 2016 by Bella Robinson, in which Monica Petersen specifically alleges that there is human trafficking happening at the Clinton-sponsored Caracol sweatshop in Haiti</strong>. So how can Kessler dismiss the whole thing as “false reporting” about Monica and Bella’s posts, when he himself is not being truthful about what Bella actually said about Monica’s reporting from Haiti?? </p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, I honestly think we catch Kessler in a straight-up lie in his WaPo article about Monica’s death</strong>. In the article, Kessler cites an Alex Jone’s Youtube video, and cites the Alex Jones video as claiming that Monica’s life “was cut short” specifically because of her investigation into the Clinton’s Caracol sweatshop and its connections to human trafficking. <strong>Kessler himself specifically says that Alex Jones’s claim about Petersen investigating the Caracol sweatshop is “false.” Again, how can Kessler claim this is false, when he never once addresses Bella Robinson’s actual <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193">Jan. 2016 Facebook post</a>, where she herself posts Monica’s claim that Caracol is a site for human trafficking</strong>??  
</p>
<p>In the article, Kessler never asks the critical question of whether there is any substantial evidence that Monica was investigating anything related to human trafficking at the time of her death in Haiti in 2016. <strong>I wonder if this is because if he did ask that question, he would have to address the existence of Bella’s post about Monica, the Caracol Complex, and alleged trafficking occurring there</strong>? In my opinion at least, I think Kessler seems to be trying to be pull a misdirection-type trick, by dismissing the Caracol-related allegations because “crazy old Alex Jones” is talking about it on Youtube. (I’m personally inclined to think Jones could be functioning as some kind of disinfo agent himself, but I definitely don’t want to go down that insane rabbit hole here lol).</p>

            Did you know that Loretta Fuddy--the Hawaii state health director who verified the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate and was reported to be the only casualty of a plane crash two and a half years later--was the chairperson of Subud USA from 2006 to 2008?

             , a biography of the mother of US President Obama, Ann Dunham Sutoro, contains several references to Subud. As is generally known, Obama lived with his mother in Jakarta for some years.

             Arianne (no second name) wrote to me to say, “Talked to Irin Poellot who is reading the book about Obama's mother and has already run into several literal mentions of Subud!!! I remember the late [Subud member] Mansur Madeiros mentioning he knew her in Indonesia and he is mentioned in the book! I can't help wondering if we will get inquiries about Subud since it is mentioned often in a book which probably will be widely read. It also is a delicious fact that
             <strong>
              our Subud sister, Ms Fuddy, just was appointed to her post in the Health Dept in Hawaii in time to be involved in the documentation of fact that Obama was born there

             Dear Brothers and Sisters,

             Our dear sister,
             <strong>
              Deliana Loretta Fuddy
             </strong>
             , died yesterday in a plane crash one half mile off the coast of Molokai, Hawaii. The plane was en route to Honolulu. Many of us knew Deliana as
             <strong>
              the Chairperson of Subud USA from 2006 to 2008
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             A small plane carrying nine people (a pilot and eight passengers) had engine failure and crashed into the water. Deliana, who was
             <strong>
              director of the state Department of Health since January, 2011
             </strong>
             , was killed. The other eight survived.
