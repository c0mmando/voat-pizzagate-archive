            DC is also separate from Virginia, they're separate jurisdictions. DC police have already denied FOIA, and then been found to have lied on investigation status, so may not be the best sources.

            Hi. I've mentioned that there are a few community advocates that have been very active for years, trying to get politicians and authorities to investigate the extensive number of cold cases, mia and deaths in DC, all ages, infant and up, many black victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a couple of blogs up by advocates, that also list cases in full as the Dc cop website has a lot listed, but not close to how many. Dc cop website, interestingly has a transvestite section of murdered ones. I could see trans, entering comet club world, but then trying to leave as all drunk or drugs or dosed, when it turns pedo and not their thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            A older, wise black man has been a long community advocate about these cold crimes, and a few media clips. I bet he knows a lot if stuff, including foia. 
Family and patents are in the loop with those elder guy as cold cases not getting Attn they deserve. So, not all families of victims would not want to talk, but wish for more help.

            I have a feeling that the playground is where they allow the already captive children to get outside for a bit and still be watched closely. Don't want them getting a Vitamin D deficiency, you know? This may also be where customers can check out what product they like without parents and other people getting suspicious. I can imagine that a real playground would get confusing for their customers as to which children are the products and which are not, and the potential for the kids to try to make friends with others on the playground and say something that might raise a red flag would be high.

             Good point, and by the accounts of the apparently "freedom of move" inside Comet from kids who seem to life there it seems possible. Also because of the multiple safeties higher-up that if someone will escape he/she will brought back or silenced.

             Some 2 weeks ago i came across a other playground manufacturer during a small off-track investigation.
             <a href="https://jongerenopgezondgewicht.nl/partners/bedrijfspartners/2">
              This
             </a>
             is a Dutch goverment (kids)program and the business partners combined made it interesting to investigate more. Did not find anything yet but also did not yet spend a lot of time in it.
            </p>

             Planting it here can never hurt.

              Kompan
             </a>
             was something i wanted to check-out immediately after learning meaning "Pan" And some of the other companies (Walt Disney, Unilever) are already linked to pedophilia. The slogan from Albert Heijn has been for years "we keep a eye on the little ones" (rough translated)

              Thanks for your comment, and the additional info! Agreed that the slave kids wouldn't be the wiser as to what life is truly like for kids who have real families, which makes it easier for them to be "free range". Wasn't there a comment in Alefantis' Twitter or Instagram account referencing 'free range' children, or something like that? I may be remembering wrong, so don't put too much weight into this. I've read so much that it's starting to melt together.

             Possibly, but the playground is surrounded on all sides and therefore is far too public.  If they really wanted to give them fresh air and sunshine, some woods would be better than a very public playground.

              True. I thought the playground was fairly secluded myself as it's not really in a neighborhood or park setting, but I haven't spent much time in bog cities such as DC, so your assessment of "very public" is probably correct.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit to add: I meant big cities, but my typo actually makes sense, so I'm leaving it the way it is. ;)

            Really interesting video. But if anyone is calling the parents, they will have big problems. Parents will tell to the police that someone asked them questions, police will investigate and come to visit you. And if the guys in the police who are working with children abductors are giving your number, well, say bye bye.

             I would imagine the parents would be desperate for any help to find and get their child back, and I doubt any parent would object if you explained first that you are searching for a connection between that area and their child.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a delicate area which is why I said "to politely contact the parents to find this information (without being a nuisance of course)."

              I am not saying that the parents would be mad. I am saying this is dangerous. At least, don't call with your real phone. Too curious people die here.
