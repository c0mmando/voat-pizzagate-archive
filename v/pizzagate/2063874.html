            Wow, great post.  Interesting as hell.  Upvoat.  As for the logo, yeah.  At first glance it reminded me of an angry cat face.  Then I saw the butterfly.  And then I saw the two, ahem, ladies.  I've noticed from the start that frigging lawyers seem to be deeply enmeshed in all this.  In this one post you've tied in some key people with the power to okay substantial roles in all this.  Holy shit.  Great job, great leads.

            Gosh I hope people open this up and look into it and start spreading this news.  This woman is highly suspicious and she is either just taking this job on for the money or she has other nefarious reasons.  There is plenty here to look into.

            Well the Board of Directors include these people   David Geffen Steven Spielberg Quincy Jones and formerly Karl Malden and Lew Wasserman.  A list of might fine people.  Ahem.  Yes the first three have all been talked about on here but Malden and Wasserman I have not heard.  This Playhouse being associated with Geffen says a mouthful.
