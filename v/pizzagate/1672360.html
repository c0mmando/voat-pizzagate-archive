However, after the initial excitement, because I have to admit, I was completely convinced that I had found the final piece of evidence needed to prove that John Podesta was indeed the man in the controversial and very disturbing child abuse video discussed on Voat, I have come to the sad realisation that I might have fallen into a trap. I left a comment to try and set the record straight, but I\'m afraid it was overlooked and definitely did not reach as many voaters as I thought it would. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THAT I MAY HAVE FALLEN INTO A TRAP AND I WANT TO APOLIGIZE TO EVERYBODY FOR HURRYING AND THINKING THAT THIS MAN iS INDEED, WITHOUT A DOUBT, SAYING: &quot;I\'M JOHN PODESTA...SING&quot;. IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE, SO PLEASE FORGIVE MY ERROR IN JUDGEMENT</strong>.</p>
<p>I\'M NOT SAYING THAT THE CHILD IS FAKING, OR THAT THE ABUSE ISN\'T GOING ON, BECAUSE IT IS. IT\'S VERY REAL. BUT THE ABUSER STILL MIGHT NOT BE JOHN PODESTA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will explain everything so you can then, verify for yourselves and maybe come to the same conclusion as I did, which is that this man might NOT have identified himself as John Podesta at all. </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/plan9">@plan9</a> who wrote this and made me take another look.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The song he\'s singing is from a kids show called &quot;Caillou&quot; in case that helps anybody <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDlfiDj0FicYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDlfiDj0FicYouTube</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you listen closely to the child abuse video, the man can clearly be heard saying &quot;<strong>Growing up is not so tough...</strong>&quot; which are evidently the verses of the &quot;Caillou&quot; theme song that can be found at 0:29 of the YT video. Now, here is where it gets tricky. The following lyrics don\'t match the syllables uttered by the abuser, as you\'ve all heard, which initially pretty much sounded like a confession to me &quot;<em>I\'m John Pode (sta)... Sing!</em>&quot; But something told me to go check the rest of the lyrics and that\'s when I found <strong>this</strong> verse at 0:10 : &quot;<strong>I\'m just a kid who\'s four...</strong>&quot; and when I compared it to the abuser\'s words, they MATCHED! The man utters this verse, <strong>but he cuts it off short</strong> and says &quot;Sing!&quot; </p>
<p>There is a strong possibility that the man is mixing up or repeating the verses. He sounds like a sadistic, ERRATIC, disturbed individual who\'s getting off on frightening the child who\'s at his complete mercy. The fact that the words he first says <strong>100% match</strong> the &quot;<em>Caillou</em>&quot; song\'s lyrics is a very strong indicator that the rest of what he says, is <em>also possibly</em> related to the song, as in its other verses. </p>
<p>The <strong>power of suggestion</strong> is very effective and in this case, <strong>it had completely influenced my perception</strong>. </p>
<p>Thanks again to <a href="https://voat.co/user/plan9">@plan9</a> for this tip. And I\'m really, very sorry for having UNWILLINGLY made a small mess here today. I wouldn\'t want to be the reason for any unnecessary harm or false accusations. There is still a possibility that the man actually said &quot;I\'m John Pode (sta), but with this new lead, it makes it much much less convincing. Please, keep an open mind and keep up the good work. If there is evidence to prove that Podesta is a sadistic pedophile, I\'m not sure at all this is it. Let\'s continue to investigate, but we must not let our emotions get the best of us. </p>
<p>Peace to all.</p>',

            While many people defend their mistakes to the end, or pretend they didn't make them at all, you owned up. We all make mistakes, it's part of the learning process, the more mistakes you make, the smarter you are. Thanks for being a good influence. There's nothing wrong with making mistakes.

            You've seen the voice/nose comparisons?  It is a pity no-one has been able to source the time and location  of the filming.  If the authorities won't investigate - and do it properly this time - they will reap the whirlwind.

            John Podesta BUSTED!  Caught spewing endless lies about #pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            He says our news is "underground."  I heard "like a seed - and this one's ready to germinate.

           <p>
            We need a scalp to send a signal that no-one is safe.  JP's would do just fine - even if he is not the "father" in Fatherhood.

            Well, thanks to both you and your wife for this :) This hint you pinpointed to us actually turned out to be in JP's favour, so nothing to worry about, hehe. On a more serious note, I can definitely understand your wariness and your wish to remain anonymous, so thanks for your courage.

            YingYangMom, it is unclear whether you are familiar with this video:
            <a href="http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/giuseppe.webm">
             http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/giuseppe.webm
            </a>
            This is the video with the word Skippy, said by someone other than the victim, and almost certainly not the perpetrator. It is very easy to miss. I listened to the audio perhaps 30 times in a few sessions before locking onto the word. However, once you tune into it, it's unmistakable, with an upward inflection on the second syllable. Headphones are essential. Word starts about 1/3 of the way through the video. My conjecture is that it is spoken by a third party witnessing the attack and is thus attempting to get the perpetrator to exercise restraint. The hyperlink that opens here seems to have no audio, but the video at WC has audio.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the Worldcorp angle a red herring? Perhaps, but it remains impossible to dismiss out of hand three torture videos where two sound very much like JP, one of which has the victim screaming John two or more times, and the third where someone says Skippy (JP's nickname and alter ego.) For the sake of thoroughness, WC's videos have to remain of interest. To help me understand the dynamics of this particular conversation, kindly let me know if you were aware of this Guiseppe video and that it contained the word Skippy, and whether my comments are of any benefit.

             There is a strong possibility that the man is mixing up or repeating the verses.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Right after he says SING!   The next verse he says
           </p>
           <p>
            Each day I grow some more
I nananana something more
           </p>
           <p>
            It's clear to me that he is simply dropping some of the lyrics that he doesn't remember.  He also absolutely sings "Caillou" just like in the theme song. Other parts of the song you can make out are 
"I'm finding my way"  and from "Growing up..." until the end of the song, he pretty much stays with the lyrics
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, in the clip you can also clearly hear the man say
           </p>
           <p>
            "point it at yourself, point it at yourself"  at the end.      This lends weight to the idea of the kid being in a shower....perhaps with cold water from the shower end.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also sounds like there is another child there singing.  At one point the man addresses this child in a more cheerful voice.  To me it sounds like he says "Tracy sing."
           </p>
           <p>
            To hear the clip clearly, I downloaded the mp4 from worldcorpo, opened the file in Sound Forge.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Applied a Noise Gate filter, to filter out sounds that were below -7.5 decibels from peak
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Applied an EQ filter to boost EQ from 100 kHz to 700 kHz and lowered all the other frequencies to boost the man's voice
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Slowed the audio by half.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            If anyone wants to go crazy with this, the new generation of audio tools, shows not just a waveform but the full "spectrum" of frequencies.

            I agree with you fully.  Well said.

            Listen to the words to the actual song (which I believe was playing in the room) and also to the other lines sung by Mr. X (who may or may not be Podesta) and it is easy to believe he's starting to sing "I'm just a kid who's 4" again, and simply drops into mumbling when he forgets the words.

            This kind of investigation will include good and bad leads, and true and false hunches/impressions.  All of those things come with the territory and should not cause great upset when they are encountered.

            Thanks for posting this. I felt from the start those videos were some kind of planted distraction, they were too disturbing and arrived too out of nowhere; "too bad to be true" if you know what I mean. It takes a lot to put together a mea culpa like this and set the record straight for others!

            Well it did and thank you so much for it. Sometimes we point something out not knowing the effect it will have, but it turns out that it's that little detail that made all the difference in the end. Kudos for sharing that awesome catch with us :)

             I don't think it's fair to accuse the Mod, because literally minutes after I find out about the Caillou video and doubts start to sink in, I PM the Mod who right away agrees to unsticky as "New Evidence" and sticky it as "Potential Lead" which didn't last that long if you ask me. Well that is until I submitted this Post and explained everything in details. The old post was then flaired as "Debunked". In any case, we all make mistakes and I'm glad it's all settled now :)

               I would have objected to the 'debunked' sticky if only the title of my post wasn't so close to a JP confession. It could possibly be him (I still think it is because of the voice and background music noise and lights and the accent and voice in general) but the clip doesn't contain a confession and it just stinks. I want this torture to stop so bad.

            I know it's speculated the videos are taken at cpp (or possibly a shower), is this based on the light patterns or has anyone else heard the bass in the background of the first video?

            I will say that for me, the alleged 'self-identification' had no bearing on my (and many others) certainty that it is Podesta... I knew from the voice matches previously. I also have other sources that are not pertinent to a fact based investigation as many would see it. I'll just say this - it's been recently factually confirmed that the CIA has long believed in and studied ESP/clairvoyance etc. I have sources of certainty, not sources that work well in a court of law... The man is John Podesta... Worldcorpo is FBI... and I will not stop stating these as fact.

            Either way, there is a child being tormented, and there is still the possibility that it is Podesta. If not, worldcopr is still in need of investigation. Either way, there seems to be obvious crime going on here.

             I never personally heard "I am John Podesta", but I think the sharing of this video has alerted unaware people to what goes on in these sick circles; people are outraged, so that is a positive thing in a sense.  Normal people despise child abusers.  And let's face it, if the person in this video is not John Podesta, it is hardly defamtion of a good man.

            That is why when I analyzed it I stuck to the "Father's" voice. Whatever words he is saying is not the important evidence. 
The important point is that it sounds just like Mr. Podesta's voice -

             Yes, exactly that. Somebody (who I don't know) is going to end up with the proverbial egg on the face. Maybe a mod, maybe me. But I'll accept it if it's me that does.

            I would assert to any critical of our movement, though, that such mistakes are a function of having a corrupted State police/justice system by which it is left to the Citizenry to take action (without access to professional training, standards and investigative powers / resources) to ensure public safety

            The whole WorldCorp thing is a waste of time, to the point that I pretty much downvote any thread about WorldCorp content at this point.  If law enforcement makes a break in the case of WorldCorp, I'll read that.  Otherwise, you are grasping at straws, smoke and mirrors, and half revealed half truths and total manipulation.  Worse, it subjects ANY listener or viewer to its mind melting disgust.  There is plenty to work with and analyze in investigating pizzagate that is real world and can lead to solid outcomes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Leave the WorldCorp psy-op, LARP or MK-Ultra programming where it belongs, alone in hell.

             I have to disagree with you on this one. WorldCorp absolutely needs to be exposed and investigated, because they're posting videos of a child being abused and tortured. I came here to help save some kids, not to give up on them because it doesn't concern or incriminate John Podesta or James Alefantis. This is heart-wrenching and it also needs to be stopped.

             I used noise-reduction, slowed it down and played it over and over. It never once sounded like "podesta", more like he starts the second line the same way as the first and trails off because the boy isn't singing along. So:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "It's just a kid who's four, each day I grow some more. I'm just... Dada-SING!"
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Yes, he sings "IT's" in the beginning. The actual song is also playing in the background. The actual song says "I'm just a kid..."
            </p>
            <p>
             He does the same thing later when he can't remember the lyrics "I'm... dadada something more..."

              I agree with
              <em>
               everything
              </em>
              you've said except for the part where you say that he says: "
              <strong>
               It's
              </strong>
              just a kid... " because, when the man starts to sing at 0:55 of the clip, I can clearly hear him say "...
              <strong>
               Am
              </strong>
              just a kid who's four... ". I mean, there's a big difference between the sound
              <em>
               I'm
              </em>
              and the sound
              <em>
               It's
              </em>
              and I can't make the
              <em>
               It's
              </em>
              sound at all. But at this point, it's not very relevant, is it?

             I personally could never make out the word 'Skippy'. And i still can't tell if the child says 'John' or 'Dad'. The tone of the child is so high and screechy (because of the pain), that it can almost be any one-syllable word, really. But that's just my perception though.

               I can't convince anyone that I'm not a shill if they really want to perceive me that way. You can always look through my profile and history if you like, but Yin Yang is a symbol of Balance, Harmony, Centralisation of Energies, et al. I've never heard of it being compared to 69 before. Well, I could imagine perverts thinking like that, maybe yes, but this is so far from reality, it's a little funny to me.
