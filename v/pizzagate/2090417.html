<hr />
<p>Austyn Crites name comes up a few times in Wikileaks but only as a purchaser and subscriber of specific books, however…these aren’t the Podesta Emails. These are the Global Intelligence Files.</p>
<p>The emails show Stratfor’s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>
<hr />
<p>A quick Twitter search showed a reporter from the BBC had spoken to Crites. James Cook posted the following Tweet:

<p>In the link below, Crites can be seen with an electrician in Google Street View. Behind them is a painting of Pee Wee, which reads “child care” on an extension of the house with boarded up doors and windows.  If this place is still operational, would you drop your child off here? </p>

            Not trying to dampen anything, but do you have dates when this place opened?  Only it looks like it has just been acquired and they are gutting the place and getting rid of all the stuff.  It still has a Papa Smurf picture behind them, looks like they are just starting the renovation to turn it into Pee Wee Playhouse.  This google shot is taken in 2013 maybe a newer google shot would show what it looks like now?  I am sure this cannot be in operation at the time this pic is taken?  Would be interesting if anyone lives near enough to let us know what it looks like now? Opinion? @ birthdaysuit11
