</p>
<p>*Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>We wanted to make you aware regarding an incident that occurred recently in the neighborhood near Rt. 7 and Fairfax County Parkway.  There was a report of some suspicious activity regarding a Cooper Middle school 7th grader walking home from her bus stop.  A black SUV followed her home.  The driver was described as an older Caucasian woman with black curly hair. </p>
<p>A woman she did not know said to her, “Your mom asked me to bring you home.”  When the girl said that she would rather walk, the woman said, “It’s very important.”  The girl kept walking and the SUV drove away.</p>
<p>The School Resource Office (SRO) at Cooper has been monitoring the situation along with the Fairfax County Police.   If you see something, please contact the Fairfax County Police at (703) 691-2131.  We encourage all families to take precautions and to review with their children what they should do in case they are approached by a stranger.*</p>',
