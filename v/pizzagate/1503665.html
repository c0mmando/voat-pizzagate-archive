   A friend disclosed that she was a member of the "Children of God" cult, linked to CIA. She was to record everything she did daily and report. I think cults are being used as fronts for child abuse.

            For those interested in the Hollywood link to this cult, River &amp; Joaquin Phoenix and Rose McGowan spent parts of their childhoods in the Children of God.

            Alefantis' art gallery is owned by the Visionaries, they have museums all over the states and they perform pseudo-shamanic rituals that are really suspect. I really think they're the one's behind everything.

            Sorry if the title is a bit confusing. Basically my friend disclosed that she had been a member of this cult. Because of widespread publicity about their child abuse, the cult ended involvement with the practice in the 80's. She herself was not sexually abused, but she was made to write down everything she did every single day, and report it to the church.
           </p>
           <p>
            She said her older sister was definitely sexually abused. Her sister has had psychotic episodes in past years and is generally unstable. She is now married to a member of the CIA and has a child. Apparently she doesn't like to speak about her experiences, and is now estranged from my friend for over a year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically this sect believes that sex is God's gift to humanity, and as such they should share it with all members of the "family," which includes children. The grand-daughter of David Berg, the leader of the cult, was repeatedly raped by him and other members of the cult. Ricky Rodriguez, who was supposedly like an adopted son to Berg, killed a family member before killing himself, after claiming he had been raped by his mother and Berg.
