             I'm sure they both needed each other to present as a Christian team doing good for children and LEO,promoting "traditional" values. As a single male, he probably wouldn't have gone far at penetrating schools. As a single female, she probably wouldn't have gone far with LEO and the military. As a widow, she can still push that charitable Operation Safety 91 and count on the sympathy angle.

             But they did give a negative review, in house which has only come up now that the grand jury subpoenaed the diocese. Nothing was proven because the victims stayed mute till past the statute of limitations (usually the case with child abuse perpetrated by figures of authority). The perpetrators/priests/bishops count on this to keep their activities protected. Hopefully, grand juries will apply enough publicity to have laws changed to benefit the victims and not the perpetrators. Me too outrage isn't just for Hollywood actors.

            He really loved trains, his wife said.  NO.  He loved having children riding those trains.  Since there were accusations of abuse before the Church absolved him of his duties, then he would be more than happy to drive a Loaded Disney Train filled with Children.  This is so obvious.  If people really think that these priests that are absolved by the church and do a life time of penance are not continuing their abuse of Our Children, well then you  are asleep.
