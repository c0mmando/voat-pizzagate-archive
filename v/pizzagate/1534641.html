<p>And another pizza illuminati.  Message in comments reads, &quot;Hey can I message you? I\'ve got a couple of questions I hope you can answer&quot;</p>
<p>This isn\'t as incriminating as some of the other stuff coming out now, but it does make me think this is an insidious, endemic problem. I don\'t think my acquaintance is involved in this stuff, because to be fair a lot of these things look really cool (and she is loves cats). But some of these comments are disturbing given what I now have been exposed to researching these symbols. I am particularly disturbed by the Jesus bedsheets and the &quot;food of the gods&quot; taglines.  I don\'t think ALL of these things I\'ve linked above are related, but I\'m sure you\'ll find more than a few of them suspect.</p>
<p>What do do with this information? I don\'t know. That\'s why I\'m posting it here. Maybe you can look up the creators of the suspect items. Maybe they were on sale because nobody wants to be associated with this anymore or they want to flood the market with symbolism to more effectively hide wolves among sheep. But I couldn\'t help but notice, haven\'t seen anything on it posted here.  Gather info.  Check the comments on more obvious items.</p>',

            That being said their are also shithead kids that see us doing our thing and think it's funny to poke at us.  And, then you have the attempts at making this stuff normalized.  Either way, not good really.

            The rageon symbol also has a lightning bolt which is an occult symbol for Satan. Of course being a lightning bolt it's easily denied that they know that.

            Edit: Also the name of the pizza illuminati guy is epicbreadcrumbs which is a hint. I found that these people leave a trail of hints across multiple website to make orders of either children or where to get them. I've followed some bread crumbs but since I don't know all their tactics I usually hit a wall.

              I'd like to but it's not much proof other than looking at what these illuminati freaks post all over their instagrams and knowing how these people operate with clues that lead other places. I find a website that I've been studying but I definitely need more analytical minds to check out. It's linked to someone who I'm convinced trafficks kids to an island like that Rachel handler girl that was with Bill Clinton.

             Good to know. I also found a pizza lightning bolt shirt on there somewhere. Will look again when free.
