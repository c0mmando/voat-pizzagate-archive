<p>I have decided to make this post outlining how mainstream media have taken up the mantle of normalising paedophilia; it\'s not just social justice/Cultural Marxist outlets like The Huffington Post or Salon which are promoting child rape, but rather the New York Times:</p>

<p>(in the interests of full disclosure regarding the preceding article, The Grauniad is a vitriolically misandrist outlet and I have no doubt that if it had been a male teacher who had committed statutory rape against a female student, they\'d be calling for the harshest penalty which the law could afford.  I don\'t know if defending paedophilia along gender lines makes them better or worse!)</p>

<p>(there was a 4th Grauniad article I saw asking if Jimmy Savile really did anything wrong in raping/sexually assaulting scores of children, as some studies suggest that raping a child might actually be beneficial for them, but I can\'t find it now)</p>
<p>and major social media platforms such as Twitter, which protects child pornography accounts and suspends those exposing them:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/reallygraceful/status/805834976772182018?lang=en">https://twitter.com/reallygraceful/status/805834976772182018?lang=en</a></p>
<p>as well as Facebook with its recent poll asking users if they wouldn\'t mind if the platform allowed adults to request nudes from children:</p>

<p>It seems to me that the same playbook used in the normalisation of homosexuality is being employed in the normalisation of paedophilia. They appear to have moved past the 1st stage, what I like to call \'sympathy for the devil\' (feel sorry for the poor child rapists who can\'t help what they are and lament how they\'re stigmatised and ostracised by our backwards, intolerant society) and moved on to stage 2, classifying paedophilia as a normal, natural, healthy sexual orientation. Indeed, the nonsense PC Newspeak terms are all ready to go, e.g. \'paedosexual\', \'inter-generational love\' and \'minor attracted person/MAP\'. I recall opining in a conversation with my brother back in 2015 (I\'ve been trying to redpill family &amp; friends about this filth since then) that I envisioned a second front being opened up in this battle focusing on children and that it would be framed as a children\'s rights issue and sure enough, we recently had an Australian &quot;sexuality expert&quot; asserting that parents should seek the consent of their babies before changing their nappies and should strive to create what she called a &quot;culture of consent&quot;.</p>

<p>We\'ve also had the push to recognise a child\'s &quot;right&quot; to change gender. If children can consent to these things, what else can they consent to?</p>',

            Not only is a concerted attempt being made to normalize pedophilia, an attempt is being made to normalize the viewing of child pornography, as not even being part of pedophilia. That is to say, they are trying to make it so that someone who watches CP is not even considered a pedophile.

             I recall that the former leader of the British Labour Party, Harriet Harman, whilst working for the National Council for Civil Liberties (today known simply as Liberty) in the 1970s lobbied Parliament on behalf of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) to decriminalise child pornography unless it could be proven that the child(ren) in the images had been harmed.  She, along with former NCCL/Labour Party colleague Patricia Hewitt also lobbied Parliament on behalf of PIE to have the age of consent lowered to 10 years old and to decriminalise incest.  I have amended the original post as I discovered yet another Guardian article defending Harman's reprehensible actions, saying that she has nothing to apologise for.

              I've heard a bit about PIE. There was an article from the Telegraph I failed to find which described how the British police were recommending the decriminalization of viewing CP, as so many people were doing it that it was no longer practical to arrest and prosecute all of them. Our society is in a dreadful state.

            This is the shit they don’t think about. “Hi, I’m Chris Hansen.”, the other guy,” ok. I’m the guy you just set up. I’m also the guy who just pulled a 9mm and put it in your mouth. I’m going to jail, so I might as well be famous.” They, the jewish media, who have such a big hardon for ratings, don’t give to fucks about him. Shit, they want someone to kill him on live TV. Why? Ratings. They’ll sell more adverts. They are sick fucking things (I can’t call them humans because they aren’t.) They are jews who hate Americans. They are vile.

            Great post, thank you. This is the reality we are facing and we need to stay firm in advocating AGAINST pedosadism. Look at
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2018/06/01/hes-pro-incest-pedophilia-and-rape-hes-also-running-for-congress-from-his-parents-house/">
             Nathan Larson
            </a>
            , the Virginia accountant running for congress, who is pro pedophilia, incest and marital rape... what is being conveyed here when someone like this is trying to get into a position of power publically. Pedosadist normalization is evident every time a criminal child rapist and exploiter in power get basically months in jail and even time served/house arrest, and then continue to work in gov. through private contracting. What about those who sell a plant that get decades behind bars. We need to be very vocal and mobilize aginst this agenda of normalization, because if we consent to it, we will be defeated by evil and our children will be in even more danger... and it will be LEGAL!

            The symptom of the debt currency system ..is that all desires can be commoditified..
..and profited from...
..if people dont want to see children being commodified and end the pedoempire...one has to cut the fuel that feeds the debt system...
...it takes a leap of faith and understanding of the merchant system to realise that we and our labour credits are legally the sureties if this debt system..ie foundation 
..
If we as sureties reduce debt at the US treasury ...we exercuse surety rights over tye US ..and ccan directlt control affairs...
..this would be the decleration of peace on our part ...
Till then we lend our energies to the war side of the game 
At the present moment we delegate our title to the representatives of tye war game ..we then lend it petrol ie via our lending to the banking system of the war game ...we lend our labour credits to increase debt ...the war game runs on our consent to lend to the war game...
Hence the symptoms we see...the use of children as commodities is an inevitable consequence ...it is hidden because the majority of us would see it and begin to ask questions...we have had our wyes wide shut

            The right to "choose" gender is  pedo grooming children starting in kindergarten. The sexual connotation is obvious.  And if no one  can say what gender they "choose" to be, who can tell them when or with whom to or what age they engage in sexual behavior?  All Satanism is introduced by degree, just like Freemasonry.  In this case it is starting when children are totally incapable of even understanding the decisions.  The mantra of the pedophiles is, "8 is too late."  By that they mean too late to inflict lifelong irreparable damage on children.  They know exactly what they are doing.  Sadly, parents do not know, or just don't care.

            Honestly it wouldn't be that hard to normalize it.  What I would do is start off by saying to parents that times have changed for our children and show a chart or two that show the incidence of inappropriate sexual contact with minors is on the rise over time.  This single line on a chart would include all forms of molestation, rape and even consensual sex between teenagers under the age of consent.  I'd say that it used to be that a person had to have major contact with the child in a private setting such as a relative being a baby sitter but these days there's more incidents happening in parks, outside shops, at the local beach or pool and even teachers are increasingly being caught engaging in sexual activity with their students.  As such we need to teach the children from a young age at least the basics of what inappropriate touching is so they can report molestation, know that rape isn't them performing an act of love or pleasure, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now with everyone thinking of the children and not wanting to seem racist by suggesting it's typically muzzies having sexual emergencies what I'd do is introduce basic classes in kindergarten to make sure the kids know the difference between a good touch and bad touch while explaining that it feels good for adults but is inappropriate for children.  At that point curiosity will take over which will lead to them playing with themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            A year or two later their education would include animal reproduction where they learn that a penis goes in a vagina and that in nature only some animals show consent.  I'd explain how birds sing and dance, how some creatures like fish build elaborate displays to attract a mate, some fight for control of a group of females, etc. and say humans are animals to and detail how a baby is made.  I would make them take a test on this which they would have to pass to pass that grade or be forced to repeat that year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the fucked part.  Once they pass that grade, say year 1, a now 6-7 year old child would know what consent is and what the consequences are with passing that grade as proof enough so all that needs to be argued then is that children deserve the same rights and freedoms as adults starting with something real basic like the right to work a job like delivering the local paper, earning a wage while working at their family business, etc.  Once children get recognized as having the same rights and responsibilities like taxation on their income as the rest of us you can move it up to lowering the voting age and their sexuality beginning with transgender drugs and outright sex change surgery.  Once you take away the parents right to object and promise children autonomy over their lives by being able to vote against their parents all it'll take is a test case with someone point at their loli's passing grade and them on the stand saying they knew exactly what they were doing, already had sexual contact with other people and consented with the older person as well and all of a sudden the age of consent for an individual will be lowered to that passing grade.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short if you love your children and they propose any kind of sexual awareness in their primary school remove them immediately.

             There was a Scifi movie about kids rising up and taking control of the government. Voting age was lowered to 12. I wish I remembered the name of it. At the end, all old people (over age 30) were sent to extermination camps.
