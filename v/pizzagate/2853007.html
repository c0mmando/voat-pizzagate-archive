<p>JRR Tolkien\'s Son Part of UK Inquiry Into Catholic Church Mishandling Child Sex Abuse Allegations</p>
<p>The top Roman Catholic archbishop in the U.K. is set to face pressing questions over the way the church has handled child sex abuse allegations, including over the clergy son of JRR Tolkien.</p>
<p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, is set to be questioned this week by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, The Telegraph reported.</p>
<p>The investigation will look into how major British institutions tackled sex abuse claims, with the Catholic Church attracting major controversy for relocating abusing priests in dioceses around the world.</p>
<p>Nichols\' former Archdiocese of Birmingham is set to be examined, including how it handled allegations of abuse against Father John Tolkien, the son of famous author JRR Tolkien, who wrote The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit fantasy novels.</p>
<p>Senior church officials are being blamed for allowing Fr. Tolkien, who died in 2003, to continue working as a priest despite an alleged victim coming forward against him years earlier.</p>
<p>The man, Christopher Carrie, accused the priest of sexually abusing him twice in November 1956, when he was 11-years-old.</p>
<p>As BBC News reported back in 2003, the Archdiocese of Birmingham awarded Carrie £15,000, or nearly $20,000 USD, in an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Fr. Tolkien had denied the allegations, and a police investigation launched against him in 2001 was discontinued, as the Crown Prosecution Service found him to be too ill to be charged. The priest died two years later at the age of 85.</p>
<p>Carrie, a father of two, said at the time that the church needs to answer for protecting Fr Tolkein.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Father John Tolkien is now dead, and cannot harm any more children, that does not exempt the church from responsibility or liability.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied that the settlement is substantial enough to recompense me for some of the wrongs committed,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>&quot;More importantly, I hope the coverage given to the case may encourage other victims of sexual abuse to come forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Carrie further revealed that church officials had promised him in 1993 that Fr. Tolkien was set to shortly retire as a priest, but he continued actively officiating in church services at least until the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>The scandals rocking the Catholic Church have been felt worldwide, including in the U.S. A Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed in August how 301 priests abused over 1,000 children over the past several decades, with church hierarchy shielding the perpetrators.</p>
<p>&quot;Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing. They hid it all,&quot; said at a press conference Attorney General Josh Shapiro.</p>
<p>Pope Francis has scheduled a major four-day conference on the clerical sexual abuse crisis with his top bishops in Rome for February 2018. The meeting, believed to be the first of its kind, comes following the pontiff\'s condemnation of the clergy who have been committing abuse, and vow that the Catholic Church will do better.</p>

            Cdl. Nichols seems to be in Lockstep with his pope about hell.

            After Pope Francis was cited by an Italian journalist as saying that Hell doesn’t exist, Cardinal Vincent Nichols of Westminster in the U.K. took to the BBC to say that what Francis may have had in mind is the imagery of Hell as a place of endless fire and torment, which, the cardinal insisted, “has never been part of Catholic teaching.”
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not how I remember it after 12 years of Catholic Schooling and going to mass every morning for 8 years.  I had a fear of going to hell.  All of us did.  Shame on him.

              J. R. R. Tolkien was not only the author of the best-selling novel ever written, but a fierce Catholic. Nearly 55 years ago in a letter penned to his son, Tolkien offered a prophetic message on having unwavering Faith despite grave scandal in the clergy.

            Anybody think Tolkien Mythology might have been a proto-MK-Ultra style normalizing of close relationships between unrelated young and old?

             Secret Masonic history of the races told in metaphor. Elves go to "New World" while the evil Sauron/Moloch/Baal/Manyfacedgod cult takes over Europe/Middle Earth. They use Orcs/black people as pawns to invade Middle Earth. So, it has been posited, anyway.

..tolkein admitted tue stories were based on historical fact ..
The hobbits could be a metapjor for the goyim.or sheep...or literally children
..Harry potter is very likely an allegoru of the educarion and programming of deep.state agents in UK grammer and public schools...

               Yes, often it is, but the son was educated in Oxford instituations where pedophilia is rampant, and also might have been abused by a priest. We don't know, so I'd be careful to throw Tolkien Sr. under the bus.

                   Soumds like a story a bunch of power hungry group would sell to the goyim...to avoid them looking to control power..
..tolkein admitted tue stories were based on historical fact ..
The hobbits could be a metapjor for the goyim.or sheep...or literally children
..Harry potter is very likely an allegoru of the educarion and programming of deep.state agents in UK grammer and public schools...
Grammer comes.from the word magic schools
Uk public schools are known to encourage pedophilia..
I have a family friends son in a famous london school...who know who the pedo teachers r ...scary environment ...
A lot of the public officers in foreign office ...and othrr important public offices are picked up from these public schools..
..
The teaching is poor to say the least ..is a waste of a parents money..all it does is set up a network to be used later..
A harry potter club..of a brainwashed group of know it alls..
I never see these folks in top science and engineering universities..wouldnt last a week..
..but u find them in droves in oxford and cambrige ..littluns of the deep state

                   I know I say stupid things but here's what I really mean. We should assume his son is innocent until proven guilty. And we should assume he is innocent since no evidence against it has ever been provided. He's the one who helped convert C.S. Lewis from atheism to Christianity, let us not forget. He was a devout Christian himself. There is a left-leaning man named Michael Drought who studied Tolkien immensely, reviewed thousands upon thousands of his personal writings and letters. If he was a pedophile surely it would be indicated in his writings. Listen to the "Of Sorcerers and Men" lecture by Michael Drought for a better understanding of who Tolkien was and why he did what he did.

                    Thanks for clarifying. I agree about presumed innocence, but as a
                    <em>
                     legal
                    </em>
                    concept only.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Btw: presume is used when you suppose based on
                    <strong>
                     probability
                    </strong>
                    (it requires some evidence) while assume is used when you suppose without any evidence
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm not presuming or assuming guilt either, I'm
                    <em>
                     just asking
                    </em>
                    the question.

                   <p>
                    I definitely will listen to the lecture, thanks for the reccomendation

                     Ah I see. I stand behind innocent until proven guilty as a philosophical concept perhaps, though I'll probably have to give it more thought now. I never really considered the issue in depth before. Anyway, the lectures go into great detail, mostly about Tolkien's works of fiction but also his life and some of his motivations for his writings.

             I was never into Tolkien but knew some in the past that were.  From the sound of your description of keeping Children from again, I  think that sounds like every pedo's dream.  Sounds kind of like being on magic mushrooms too.

              This is laughable to the point of utter dismissal. That's nothing like Tolkien's works, if you haven't read them, don't criticize them. You're making it sound like Lewis Carroll or something. I've read both and they're nothing alike.

                What you said was reminiscent of Carroll and that's why I brought it up. That's what it came across as, to me. That's why I said it was "laughable," not that anyone should be laughing at it but just that it is absurd to jump prematurely to conclusions. I guess I got too angry since Tolkien's works have inspired me in the pro-Christian direction more than any other work I've ever read, and I've read all the products of his fantasy writings. There is no way a pedophile could produce what he produced, I don't think anyone with evil intentions could produce such a Godly work. It's comparable to C.S. Lewis' works in many ways, though arguably better.

                   It has been my experience, in my short time on this planet, that the real heroes were everyday common people. Most of them are dead, sadly. They are my rock.

                 That's why I said that it was either family or maybe in school, a teacher, or priest.  An authority figure.  It should always be left open at the beginning.  This needs  further research. Into his and his son's background.

                  Go to "Of Sorcerers and Men" by Michael Drought for a good start into Tolkien and his motivations. It's a great source  since Michael Drought has read the Lord of the Rings 47 times and studied most of Tolkien's personal writings (which are innumerable)

                I didn't mean it like that. It really is laughable, I was being serious. It was an asinine and careless comment of baseless accusation, literally baseless. They haven't even read any of his works.

            The TL;DR is that they settled with the victim mentioned in the OP since they were afraid a further investigation could reveal that there had been other accusations as well.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Richard Scorer, of Slater and Gordon, representing alleged victims of Tolkien, told the hearing:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “It wasn’t settled because Archbishop Nichols wanted to ‘do the right thing’ by a victim of abuse.
             </strong>
             If you study the file, we suggest it is very plain that Mr Carrie’s claim, and those of other victims of John Tolkien, were settled for one reason and one reason alone – because
             <strong>
              in the absence of a settlement, the archdiocese would have been obliged to disclose that they had received a complaint, or possibly complaints in the plural, of sexual indecency by Father Tolkien in 1968.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              When more of Tolkien’s alleged victims contacted the church with civil claims in the early 2000s, after charges against him were dropped owing to ill health
             </strong>
             , Nichols, then the archbishop of Birmingham, told a lawyer acting on behalf of the diocese that he would “prefer not to disclose” the earlier complaint.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The inquiry heard that at least four other people made abuse allegations against Tolkien. It is understood that several civil claims over abuse committed by Tolkien have been settled by the church.
             </strong>

             As usual more sexual abuse of Our Children swept into the dust bin.  They think it will never be found, or at least are hoping.  No longer.  We are exposing their cover ups, unfortunately some of these vile  perpetrators have met their death.  Is that the only way we can hope for safety of Our Children?  Is that the only way that Victims can be assured that they will no longer brutally rape more Children again?  May the High Level Clergy rot in hell.  YES francis there is a hell and it's waiting for you. Hopefully sooner than later.

                   A few movies on that. In Broad Daylight, the movie, is pretty close to the history of the matter. Just watched on youtube for free. That makes me think it is going to be banned there soon for some reason. Certainly banned in the UK and Ireland.

               Not into her or her music, but not a bit surprised.  So sad to have another person in the limelight getting this sick stuff out there.  Really don't we have enough of this yet?  Yuck.

                I guess I was surprised to see her do it. I think she has a beautiful voice, but I'm not a huge fan of her style. She just didn't seem like the type to push it. Now she needs to stop being the diva she thinks she is and go gender neutral. Can you imagine that?

                 Now I am wondering about her son.  Did she have him naturally?  Or is she another one of those that needed a beard?  Never enough money.  Now they are pushing her to do this garbage.  She possibly has to do it in order to get more jobs.  She is beyond loaded.  Sick.

                   Holy Cow.  I had forgotten how many times she claimed to try.  I always think that whatever they tells us about their families always has some lies in it.  That's horrid about her Mother having so many Children.  I don't like abortion, but that's not right either.  Man.

                    She puts it all out there in this video. Pushing gender neutral identity, and how the world owns your children.A baby even has a tee on that says New Order.

                       You are right.  This says it all.  I think this was a hint.  A mason.  Freemason?  Many masons were.

                       The direct paternal ancestor of Celine Dion, Jean, was named « Guyon ». He was a mason who spent his career in Mortagne (Perche, Orne, France) up to 1634, year of his departure to "La Nouvelle-France" in Canada.

                        What a coincidence we were discussing Madonna and Jolie too. Sometimes life is stranger than fiction. Strange how so many of these people connect. I'm starting to believe in this blue blood/royal blood scenario. Esp knowing most of our presidents have been Masons. I read Trump wasn't a Mason, but Hillary and him are connected distantly in their family tree.

                         I don't know if their being connected means anything or not, but many people are connected to people they would never believe.  Who knows.  I have heard people say on here that he is a Mason, but again who knows. I have looked and found nothing as of yet.

                          Thanks. I didn't see that about him being a Mason. I did see the politician Gingrich say he wasn't. If Trump and Hillary are from a distant family tree,that would mean they would both be from a similar blood line. That's where I was going with that.

                           The bloodline thing in itself is scary.  Wow.  Although people can veer by marrying others.  But once in this cabal bloodline system, Idk, would be hard to get out.  Family cult thing and all that.

                      I would say she is controlled.. They don't get to the height she is without being their puppet. Terrible to think about how much control they are seeking. I hope I'll never see their New Order.

                       Wonder where her son came from.  Possibly stolen like Jolie and Madonna did.  They don't have any morals.  The fact that they are with the NWO, that's why they take other people's Children.  They think they can take anything that belongs to us.  That garbage all started with Hillary.  It takes a village.  And she did.

                        Just look at her clothing line for babies. Who would dress their baby this way? They almost all look like a Halloween costume.

                        I feel sick looking at this. Most are black and white. Skulls and single eye clothing. Illuminati confirmed.

                            I did see that she first met her husband when she was 12, and he was 38. They married when she was 20. He was her husband/manager.
Also, look at the various meanings of the word Nunu that is part of the name of her clothing line.One of the definitions is a word for penis or sex organ of both sexes. But also can mean a term of endearment.

                             Wow.  I had forgotten they met so early.  Manager and a 12 yr. Old?  What could be fishy about that?  Hmm.  Like Macron and his wife meeting early but parents made them wait til he was 18.  At least those parents had a brain.  But still, Wow.  I have a feeling nunu is probably sexually related.  Why not.

                        I wonder if there are pics of Celine pregnant. I'll have to look sometime. I wonder too if the child is really her biological child or adopted. 
  I remember when Hillary said that. I bet they have been pushing it long before she made that statement though. What's funny about Madonna and Jolie is how they don't really want the fathers to have much to do with their children's life from what I have seen.

                         Maybe because the men are not "in charge" so to speak of the nonsense with their new found feminism.  It was odd that Brad took off I believe he did not like what she was doing with the children.  Possibly they are not his anyway.  It's all so screwed up.  Just think of the wildest scenarios and that's probably the right answer.  I saw on TV where Oprah interviewed Michelle O about her new book.  She talked about her family's fertility problems I heard.  Trying to fan the flames.

                          I would say that is a big part of it. Brad really got the bad end of the stick with her saying he was abusive to the kids. There was that about Rocco (Madonna and Guy Richie's son) wanting to live with his dad because of Madonna's treatment and lack of attention to him. No wonder so many celeb kids get so screwed up. I saw that about Michelle's book. Have we ever seen a pic of her pregnant? I don't know if that's true about the kids, but it makes you go hmm.

                           I don't believe or disbelieve what is said about Malia and Sasha but I will say it is possible.  There are many that have faked their pregnancies as well.  I am sure she touched on that to kill all the rumors about the girls.  Their lives are controlled and they seem like robots, follow the instructions.

            [Biography]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien_family#John_Francis_Reuel_Tolkien) of Father John Tolkien:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             John Francis Reuel Tolkien (1917–2003) was the eldest son of J. R. R. Tolkien. He was born in Cheltenham on 16 November 1917. He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford and The Oratory School in Caversham, Berkshire where in his final year he decided to become a priest.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the advice of the Archbishop he decided to go to college to study English and joined Exeter College, Oxford from where he received his B.A. degree in 1939. In November 1939, he went to the English College, Rome to train as a priest
            </p>
            <p>
             Due to the outbreak of World War II, the college was moved to Stonyhurst in Lancashire where John trained as a priest during the war. He was ordained as a priest at St John and Augustine Church in North Oxford.
            </p>
            <p>
             His first position was as a curate from 1946 to 1950 at the St Mary and St Benedict Church in Coventry where he taught weekly classes to 60 children and organized the building of church schools. From 1950 to 1957, he was a curate at the English Martyrs Church in Sparkhill, Birmingham.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thereafter he moved to North Staffordshire, where he was the chaplain of University College of North Staffordshire, now Keele University
             <strong>
              and at two grammar schools
             </strong>
             ,
             <strong>
              St Joseph's College, Trent Vale and St Dominic’s High School, Hartshill.
             </strong>
             He was parish priest at Knutton Roman Catholic Church from 1957 to 1966.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1966, he became the parish priest at Our Lady of the Angels and St Peter in Chains Church, Stoke-on-Trent. He held the position until 1987 and there oversaw the building of a new school. He was chairman of governors at Bishop Bright School, chaplain to the North Staffordshire Catholic Teachers Association and area chaplain to the Young Christian Students.
            </p>
            <p>
             He moved back to Oxford in 1987, settling in Eynsham where he was the parish priest at St. Peter's Catholic Church till his retirement in 1994. Father Tolkien also served in parishes in Oxford, Birmingham, and Warwickshire.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1987, he and his sister Priscilla began identifying the large collection of family photographs. In 1992, they released a book titled The Tolkien Family Album containing photographs and memories of the Tolkien family and giving an account of their father's life to celebrate the centenary birth anniversary of J. R. R. Tolkien
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            He was moved around quite a lot. Were his superiors aware of his pedophile activities and crimes, even in his early years?
           </p>
           <p>
            (Rhetorical question probably.)
           </p>
           <p>
            He had more victims, the Church settled with a couple of them.

             I think we are going to find out that anyone who has gotten traction with ideas that challenge the power of the globalist Cabal is going to have been targeted for corruption and/or reputational destruction. We know it happened to Assange. It's constantly claimed here by those who want to silence PG research. I expect to see much, much more of it, especially since the press is part of the Cabal.

              JRR Tolkien's Catholic background:
             </p>
             <p>
              His mother converted to Catholicism after her husband died. JRR was raised Catholic and "Mabel had named Father Morgan as her sons' guardian before she died. He encouraged the boys' educations, using his family money to help them and opening his library to them." So, JRR Tolkien ended up being raised by a Catholic priest. Read the details:

              And it's his son, not him himself. JRR Tolkien himself was not that kind of person, at least from what I can tell from his writings, which I have read extensively. They are the most beautiful and noble writings I have ever encountered and no pedophile could have produced them, no guilty conscious can produce 60+ years of continuous works like that. He can tell us himself in the afterlife.

                More beautiful than the Bible in my opinion. Although I've not read the Bible all the way through. The Bible is more important obviously, it's been around longer and testifies of Jesus Christ. But it was not written by Jesus Christ, it was written by men. Men write according to their skill. It is possible that a pedophile could have great skill in writing, I'm sure many do. But the spirit and the type of things Tolkien chose to write about, are very unlikely for someone who's preoccupied with abusing children. Anyway, there has never been any evidence than Tolkien abused children. We don't even know if his son did or if it's a false accusation. Presume innocence until proven guilty.

               I think we are going to find out that anyone who has gotten traction with ideas that challenge the power of the globalist Cabal is going to have been targeted for corruption and/or reputational destruction. We know it happened to Assange. It's constantly claimed here by those who want to silence PG research. I expect to see much, much more of it, especially since the press is part of the Cabal.

               Several generations of people have been inspired by the works of Tolkein Sr., which are quite powerfully anti-globalist and also a warning against the corruption of the powerful. It doesn't surprise me at all that this is being reported. It wouldn't surprise me if his son was targeted for corruption as described by

                He is also accused as being an occultist and the symbolism is in his work. Tolkien is my favorite author, but nothing is off the table. Raised by Catholic priest and part of secret society of scholarly men who wanted to create a modern mythology. He said he thought Norse religion was more impressive the Christian faith, or at least some messages were more impressive. The 9, the all seeing eye, Suaron imitating but not being able to create. It is worthy of discussion.

                I still don't understand. Why shouldn't it be reported? Do you want to make an exemption for children of celebs?
