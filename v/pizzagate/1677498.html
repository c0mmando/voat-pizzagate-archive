              I hear you and you are right.  Gonna have to avoid the comment section on both of these people (seaman and the lift the veil dude, as it is confusing me and causing me to make comments I probably should keep to myself.

              <p>
               you sir, are a rare breed. theres not too many people who can reflect on themselves and their own shortcomings so quickly and candidly
              </p>
              <p>
               we are all likely to do what psychologists call "projection", where we see our own flaws in other people, but can't see that exact same flaw in ourselves. knowing that we are all likely to engage in projection, its a wise habit that whenever we find ourselves in a situation where we want to criticize someone, to ask ourselves if we are guilty ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               as for OP, I'm not sure who is in the video, but he seems legit at first impression.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've been following David Seaman ever since pizza gate, and at first David seemed legit, but the more i watched him the more sketchy he became.
              </p>
              <p>
               in particular, he spends way too much time pitching gold and goldmoney
              </p>
              <p>
               don't get me wrong, i actually agree that gold and silver are real money, and that everything else is credit. i believe that people should endeavor to acquire and posses real, physical gold and silver.
              </p>
              <p>
               however, i don't actually spend very much time talking about gold, silver, and credit, because i figure if people truly want to know about money, they will find a way to learn and do not need to be told or lead by me or David Seaman.
              </p>
              <p>
               as for GoldMoney, i kinda-sorta like the concept, except for everything about it:
              </p>
              <p>
               1) you either have possession of physical gold, or you do not. a note that says you can claim an ounce of gold is only good until the day they decide not to honor it. same goes with this scheme
              </p>
              <p>
               2) im not sure what the fee is to take possession of your physical gold, but anything above 0 is usury as far as I'm concerned. this is the modern day equivalent of money-changers who Jesus drove from the temple.
              </p>
              <p>
               3) if George Soros is involved, be very wary. George destroys currencies and countries to make BIG profits.
              </p>
              <p>
               So what else has David Seaman done?
              </p>
              <p>
               David changed his twitter avatar to a Star of David, presumably signaling his allegiance to Israel, Zionism, and or Judaism. as far as i know, David Seaman has not talked much about Jeffrey Epstein, Lolita Express, Rape Island, and how the Mossad/CIA use brownstone ops to compromise and control politicians and others
              </p>
              <p>
               David makes long-winded, shaggy-dog stories that don't reveal anything that isn't already known. he singles out an individual here and there, while avoiding the BIG issues like CPS, NCMEC, Save The Children, Haiti, Silsby, AmberAlerts, AlertSense, DynCorp, etc
              </p>
              <p>
               when all is said and done, it seems that David Seaman was trying to get out ahead of pizza gate and steer it into the ground
              </p>
              <p>
               i also think that the whole "Hillarys Health" thing was an elaborate hoax that David Seaman helped perpetuate.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hillarys Health was a big distraction from all the other issues that should have been talked about during the presidential election.
              </p>
              <p>
               there was the supposed image of Hillary Clinton's brain showing major irregularities, but that image was later found to have been originally hosted on an epilepsy blog. i know the image was a fake, because i compared it to the original pixel by pixel.
              </p>
              <p>
               the supposed health care provider who "leaked" this medical info had also released other supposed info about Hillary's Health, but since the brain image is a known fake, its safe to assume the other info is fake as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               So during the election, we get distracted by Hillarys Health for a while, and then the supposed leaks are shown to be fakes at the last minute, so therefore Hillary critics look like fools, and Hillary gets to skate to election day by not having to face tough election year questions and issues.
              </p>
              <p>
               it was a perfect play.
              </p>
              <p>
               then Hillarys Health segued into PizzaGate, and David Seaman was out in front from the get-go, leading people in the wrong directions.
              </p>
              <p>
               i think David Seaman deleted all his social media accounts because he knew he was screwed, the game was up. i don't know if he has the stomach to really look any deeper.

                Seeing as though you went to great lengths to write that, I will to respond to my original comment about the lift the veil dude being a complete dolt and the comment I am making now pertains to only me, but you can include yourself and the lift the veil dude if you want.
               </p>
               <p>
                When I point a finger at someone, there are three pointing back at me.  There is always someone else to blame other than myself.   I don't know about any of these people's truths, only my own.
               </p>
               <p>
                The bashing of another only serves to make the ego feel a little better and the better feeling doesn't last long, until I have to do it again and again and again, until there is nothing but a whole lifetime of judging another.
               </p>
               <p>
                Having said all this and from what I've learned through pizzagate, I'm gonna have to bash clinton, podesta, soros, alefantis, the pope and the rest of the depraved satanic vultures who are doing what they are doing.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is no excuse for these low lifes and they should not get away with what they are doing.  I can only trust that what goes around comes around and their inexcusable deeds will bring much turmoil and suffering to them.

            It isnt surprising. I have been saying this for a while now. He repeated research by others and then asked for money and shilled products.

            He was the face for a while but it was continual shilling of products that gave him away to me. Also he is Zionist who supports Isreal.

            I'm just a dude from the internet who has been digging into pizzagate since it was still a DNC/MSM collusion investigation (oh how it snowballed...) but my opinion is that David Seaman got really fucking lucky.  And honestly, we did a little bit to.  He was trying to fleece us for cash and just ran with something he thought was controversial and would eventually blow over.  I doubt he had any idea with would balloon into an exposé on how the Deep State controls politicians and funds its black ops.  We kind of needed someone who had the shamelessness to self promote, kept pushing his HuffPo "experience" and w/e and enough people bought that to get them looking harder.  He has given us a lot of exposure, some good some bad, but he has kept up the act throughout the whole thing.  Being the "face" (i use that term extraordinarily loosely) of pizzagate, it made it look like we never lost steam.  Sometimes, persistence is more important than anything else.  With pizzagate coming to fruition (i wholly believe in Trump now), i feel he has been OUR useful idiot.  I feel bad for anyone that gave him money, but he is what he is.
