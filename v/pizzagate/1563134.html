             How have I not? The link was titled "threats from Alefantis?" Stop deleting my posts seriously. You keep doing this. I've been a member on Voat longer than you have even if you are a moderator.

              That is not a satisfactory summary of a 19-minute video. Threats to whom? Based on what? Under what circumstances? With what consequences? The video is there to back your claims, not to be your main means of delivering them.

                 Hey question. How tiring does it get moderating through all the posts on here? How often do you get to come up for air? I know since Pizzagate broke the night before the election I've been investigating it and I have to take breaks from time to time. It all becomes to much. I also have been showing a lawyer friend all of this stuff. He's said many times that there is enough circumstantial evidence here to start a massive investigation by the authorities as well as a trial. He concedes that the child references alone on Alefantis' instagram account are borderline if not illegal. He explained it like this. You can be arrested for insinuating a riot with a crowd of people. Say you're a famous rock band and you tell the crowd to start rioting and they listen to you. He's been apart of cases where people have promoted something illegal online but weren't actually involved, yet because they were the promoters they were charged. It's all mind boggling that people are getting away with this.

                  It is tiring. The majority of the posts on here need to be deleted, then there's the rest that we still need to vet anyway, and then there are the people who are pissed because we removed their submissions. Sometimes we're attacked, either verbally or in organized downvote attacks, both consume time and energy we should be spending with moderation. Luckily the team is growing, and we get to do shifts and take time off, but we're still a smallish team, the old mods are inactive, and the flow of new submissions is continuous.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But it's getting better. Thanks to continuously enforcing the rules, submissions are becoming better in quality, and trolls are getting exhausted and discouraged.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If this was any other investigation, our current pile of circumstantial evidence would be more than enough to start a formal process. But since this is what it is, it'll take an extremely strong pile of evidence and a critical mass to get there. That is the sole purpose of this sub, and it's worth keeping quality to a certain standard for that.

                   Yeah, I agree. Thanks for replying. What do you make of James' Alefantis telling the guy he threatened to leave his VOAT account open. He want's to use him as a shill? Also, I've been heavily looking into the fact he kept saying "that's your culture bro." I just think it's something to look at. I've come to a pretty solid conclusion that Alefantis has adopted his culture of what he does as normalcy.
This isn't going away and Alefantis' bad move of calling that guy out and threatening him shows that he's desperate. I think of it as the movie "The Dark Knight." Batman is starting to hurt their wallets so things are starting to get ugly. "In their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't' fully understand." Not saying their turning to anyone, just saying they're getting desperate, or at least he is. Anyways, hang in there.

                     Excellent information. You know I'll tell you something. My whole life I was raised to find the truth and origin behind anything. Philosophical, religious, tradition. Anything that I found that was based on a lie, or had some hidden meaning or gross occult ties, I never touched it. The fact that all this pizzagate stuff is coming out now and all these symbols are showing up as having an origin. This doesn't surprise me. Even the cross itself has a phalanx symbol origin and the truth is that Jesus was actually hung on a torture stake or pole. There is another Greek word, xyʹlon, that Bible writers used to describe the instrument of Jesus’ execution. A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek New Testament defines xyʹlon as “a piece of timber, a wooden stake.” It goes on to say that like staurosʹ, xyʹlon “was simply an upright pale or stake to which the Romans nailed those who were thus said to be crucified.” Even in Rome, the original sculptures of Jesus' death were of him hanging on a pole, not a cross. The cross was introduced by Constantine. For example, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and depictions of their gods and goddesses often show a cross in the shape of a T with a circle at the top. It is called the ansate, or handle-shaped, cross and is thought to be a symbol of life. In time, this form of the cross was adopted and used extensively by the Coptic Church and others. The sun-god worshipper, Constantine in 312 C.E., while on one of his military campaigns, he had a vision of a cross superimposed on the sun along with the motto in Latin “in hoc vince” (by this conquer). Some time later, a “Christian” sign was emblazoned on the standards, shields, and armor of his army. (Pictured at left.) Constantine purportedly converted to Christianity, though he was not baptized until 25 years later on his deathbed. His motive was questioned by some. “He acted rather as if he were converting Christianity into what he thought most likely to be accepted by his subjects as a catholic [universal] religion, than as if he had been converted to the teachings of Jesus the Nazarene,” says the book The Non-Christian Cross.

                    <p>
                     I studied all religious symbols and found they all are connected to the occult, and in fact the bible tells you in Exodus 20:4,5 to leave idols and symbols out of any kind of true Christianity. Wouldn't it make sense then that the Vatican would be involved in all of this since they are promoters of the cross and have been caught red handed many times in child abuse scandals?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I say all of that to say, a lot of what people were raised in is actually false Christianity. Yet, once they become initiated with all the hidden truths, it's not hard for anyone to recognize all the lies, all the hidden symbols and what they mean. It's why Catholicism takes out the name of God, to keep people in the dark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Having said all that, I recognize True Christianity from False quite easily now and it's not hard to know what you're being lied to about. And James Alefantis and everyone his "Culture" are lying. They use these symbols in plain site because none of us knew at the time they meant anything.

                     <li>
                      (first and foremost) they are mentioning Molech (Moloch) in the Podesta e-mails and Alefantis has a napkin code image with Molech Maschine reference which links them all to the same false god.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      John Podesta shares a picture of himself with the number 14 and the Phi fish on his hands. (Satanic Occult reference. No one would know that unless you are initiated.)
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      The artwork they are all obsessed with is a smoking gun and borderline illegal if not illegal.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      (And this is very recent) James Alefantis says "he doesn't like kids." Bold faced lie. If he didn't, why does he have a "child friendly" pizzeria where he's held child sleepovers and children posted all over his instagram. This to me shows he's getting desperate and he may be saying he doesn't like kids the same way a normal person does.

            I am sorry I did not mean guilty of a crime.  I mean deserving to be investigated because of certain evidence.  When we see pictures of their instagram that we have seen, then we are of course suspicious and that is why we have been looking for information.  When Crocker hangs with those people he opens himself up to suspicion.  Not saying he is guilty.
He is probably just hanging on because of JA's popularity.

            Yeah, I don't know why he had 3 hrs. up there.  Maybe it was posted 3 hrs. ago?  I'm not on facebook.  Whether he is guilty or not of being involved, I think both he and JA are pretty cocky and deserve all the bad gossip they get.  JA more so because he is very much involved.  Chris because he hangs with people that walk on the wild side.  When you run with them you have to take the dirt that goes along with it.

             you're assuming that they know they are "walking on the wild side."  As of right now, there's a lot of evidence to assume JA is CIA, and has been conducting brownstone operations.  The CIA use anyone and everyone, that can be of use for them.... Even if they can ony  help them in a small way... They're still helping them.

             An entity with this magnitude of financial, and political backing, doesn't deal with limited budget or limited resources. They do what they want, when they want, regardless of how badly they want it.

            JA is a small time little cog  in this big pedo ring that likes to shoot his mouth off.  He is dangerous to the elites.  Believe me he will not be around for long if he does not learn to shut his mouth.  After what he has allegedly done to children, there are many that will not care what happens to him.

            I agree. Not only that, this is what concerns me. This is regarding Pegasus KILLROOM. James Alefantis mentions Plumbing. Of all the construction work why would he mention plumbing. It's being accused of being a KILLROOM and he mentions plumbing. It just seems odd to me.

            This stuff is unbelievable. I can't believe Alefantis is going as far as he is by openly threatening someone and putting it in writing no less.
