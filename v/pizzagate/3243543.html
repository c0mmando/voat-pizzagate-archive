Little is known about the family and its charitable organisation, Morningside Foundation, and the lively and candid Chan intentionally kept as much as he could to himself about it in an interview last week in between the announcements of the two donations.

             The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, known to many simply as Sheppard Pratt, is a psychiatric hospital located in Towson, a northern suburb of Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1853, it is one of the oldest private psychiatric hospitals in the nation. Its original buildings, designed by architect Calvert Vaux, and its Gothic gatehouse, built in 1860 to a design by Thomas and James Dixon, were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971 .
            </p>
            <p>
             The future of the Asylum was greatly enhanced five years later when in 1896, the estate of Baltimore merchant, businessman, banker, steamship line owner and philanthropist, Enoch Pratt, (1808-1896) bequeathed a substantial amount of his remaining fortune, approx. $2 million, (after founding, constructing and endowing the city's public circulating library system, the first in the country, with the Enoch Pratt Free Library on West Mulberry Street near Cathedral Street in 1882-1886) to complete the construction and expand the asylum as originally planned decades before with the stipulation that the name be changed to "The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital".

              That facility has over 200 researchers in it and has a clinic and psychiatric hospital for children associated with it. Nominally it is a University Research center devoted to the study of childhood mental illness. However, the clients come for minor problems like learning disabilities, and attention deficit and leave as multiples without their parents knowing. The clinic only takes “high functioning” children -- not schizophrenics, or cerebral palsy kids. Unsurprisingly, the Rockefellers, and the Carnegies are major funders of it.

              Alice Louise Florence Fitzgerald (March 13, 1875 — November 10, 1962) was an American nurse who served in Europe during and after World War I. She earned a Florence Nightingale Medal from the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1927, for her achievements...
             </p>
             <p>
              During World War I, she was named the first "Edith Clavell Memorial nurse" from Massachusetts, funded to work with the British Queen Alexandra Imperial Military Nursing Service at Boulogne and Méaulte from 1916 to 1917, and then with the American Red Cross.
             </p>
             <p>
              She founded the International School for Public Health Nurses.[2] [10] For her efforts, Fitzgerald was awarded medals and honors by Great Britain (Royal Red Cross second class),[11] France (Medaille d'honneur and other decorations), Italy, Poland, Serbia, Hungary, and Russia...
             </p>
             <p>
              She worked in Asia in the 1920s, advising the Governor General of the Philippines on public health nursing, and founding a nursing program at Baguio.  (See: Stephanie S. Bator, "

             </p>
             <p>
              Back in the United States, she was director of nurses at Polyclinic Hospital in New York (from 1930 to 1936), and a housemother at Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in the 1940s

             According to investigators, "Silvio is among the 10 most prestigious satanists in the world," once featured in a History Channel documentary. On his website, Silvio claims to have been honored by the United Nations (information the police haven't been able to confirm), and his Youtube channel features several videos promoting black magic to achieve success in life.
