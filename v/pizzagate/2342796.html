            You have to wonder why Leah et al. feel the need to
            <strong>
             defend in advance
            </strong>
            what they think is going to come out about Haggis.
           </p>
           <p>
            What did Haggis reveal to the church during his E-meter sessions?  Something worse than rape of an adult?
           </p>
           <p>
            I applaud Leah's work on exposing the church, but unless she's a mind reader she can't really know the truth of Haggis' personal life.  She should be careful about aligning with him in the face of rape claims against him.  Yes, it might be a Scientology smear campaign, but it also might not be.

             Exactly. It's fair to assume that the Church knows what Haggis did. But they may also know WHO he did it FOR. And that moving target is way more dangerous and valuable as an ally. So the Church partners with the Cabal to protect assets and sacrifices the underling, Haggis. Leah is gonna get caught the crossfires.

             This is war. This is what happens. An enemy of my enemy is my friend, and a friend of my cause in an ally until he's not.

            Operators in a cult are often brownstoned as a control. It is unlikely that someone would try to expose the crimes if they are being blackmailed. So, logic dictates that Paul Haggis is not guilty of the accusations against him, and he is being targeted because he was trying to expose something. Either that, or he is a brain damaged victim of the cult, firing short circuit signals like Corey Feldman.

             That is what I was leaning towards as well. Interestingly enough, Haggis even pushes the Feldman narrative:
            </p>
            <p>
             On pedophilia and sexual abuse in Hollywood:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Most of this behaviour has been aimed at women, but
              <strong>
               I am sure that former child stars such as Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, who have both made allegations in the past that no one took seriously, are worth considering
              </strong>
              , too.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             See what he does there? "I am sure" (taking the stance of an expert) that "allegations in the past" (not facts, and not current) which "no one took seriously" (ergo, if you're some one than you too wouldn't take them seriously) are worth considering too...
            </p>

             Totally agree.  The pedos have--as a group, not just Scientology---been trending away from mocking/ignoring/larping because it hasn't worked....
The next step-- and they are trending towards--- throwing a bunch of their own baseless charges into the air.  Creates confusion; even a disproven charge helps to discredit legitimate charges made against others....so they can start to answer legit accusations as "just a witch-hunt".

             They already started here with the "Trump is a Globalist secret swamp-dweller" routine we get every few days.

              I have a feeling Franco is using the very same tactic. Not speaking to the actual allegations, and encouraging others to come forward, acting as if he wants people to accuse him. This will likely bring out a ton of false positives -- provable larps with illegitimate charges -- which he will then use to dismiss and discredit the rest as "bandwagon" bashing...
             </p>
             <p>
              It's PR 101. And they got it down...
