<p>This is part of the Pizzagate/Pedogate/pedowood issue.... Parents who think is okay to sell their own children for sex, whether it be for $100 like the news article above, or for &quot;use&quot; in a film as many child stars have stated.</p>
<p>Articles like this make it very clear, child trafficking is occurring in every city, and every economic class. </p>
<p>This woman tried to sell her child, her daughter, a mere 8 years old, for sex, for a bargain price of $100. One hundred dollars for permission to rape her child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(Kelly) ... stated that she wanted to bring him a child, who she stated was 8 years old, for sexual intercourse in exchange for money,” specifically $100, the complaint said.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article later goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A police investigator’s report returned June 7 described two videos found on Kelly’s phone. Both videos showed Kelly engaging in sex acts with her 8-year-old daughter, the complaint said.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poor child, not only had to endure strange, perverse, disgusting men raping her innocent body. She was trained and assaulted by her own mother!</p>',

            <p>
             you need to review our submission rules in the sidebar (view desktop site if on mobile). This is not pizzagate related under Rule 1; we deal in child sexual abuse by the global elite or their minions only. Also, you have multiple rule-breaking posts, which we issue bans for. I am going to remove this directly, since editing it is pointless. Please desist from posting until you have edited your existing threads to comply with the rules.

            you did not show how this case is related to the 'elite.'  normally this would receive a 24-grace period flair, but since you still have
