<h3>Incidents include a girl being given one dollar before being raped by an aid worker.</h3>
<p>Young boys and girls already revealed a decade ago that they were being abused and their families told how they were powerless to act, the International Development Committee heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Corinna Csaky set out evidence from an investigation she carried out in 2008 into the abuse of children by humanitarian staff and peacekeepers.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The testimonies were part of a report, <em>No One To Turn To</em>, by Ms Csaky for <em>Save the Children</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Csaky said an advance copy was sent to the CEO of Oxfam and all major international (non-governmental organisations) NGOs, in 2008, two years before the earthquake abuse.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it is now claimed authorities did not do enough to act after 23 organisations were implicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the report it was claimed the majority of abuse allegations were made against troops associated with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) \'particularly in Haiti and Côte d\'Ivoire\'.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 14-year-old boy in Cote D\'Ivoire quoted in the report said workers at a peacekeeping camp would sometimes ask for girls his age.</p>
<p><em>Many girls were gang-raped:</em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'Often it will be between eight and 10 men who will share two or three girls. They also use their mobile phones to film the girls.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Children and parents said they were unable to report the abuse. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'The people who are raping us and the people in the office are the same people,\' according to a young girl in Haiti.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>Allegations of attacks by charity sector employees have been exposed since a scandal involving Oxfam in Haiti emerged.</strong></p>
<p>The charity\'s staff were deployed to the nation in 2010 after a devastating earthquake with as many as 53 aftershocks rocked the Caribbean country.</p>
<p>In the wake of the disaster aid workers stayed in villas as they helped piece the nation back together. But years later it emerged many had used prostitutes during their work there.</p>
<p>There were accusations many girls were underage - although the charity insists this was never proven.</p>
<p>Penny Lawrence, resigned as Deputy Chief Executive of the charity saying she took \'full responsibility\' for the behaviour of staff in Chad and Haiti \'that we failed to adequately act upon\'.</p>
<p>Since then, some 1,100 complaints over safeguarding in aid agencies have been made, according to the Charity Commission. </p>
<p>They included a young boy in Haiti who said a homeless girl was taken to a man who worked for an aid organisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'He gave her one American dollar and the little girl was happy to see the money,\' the boy said.</p>
<p>\'It was two in the morning. The man took her and raped her. In the morning the little girl could not walk.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>A father in Cote d\'Ivoire said: \'They don\'t even hide what they are doing.\'</strong></p>
