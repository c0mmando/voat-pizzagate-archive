<p>Paul Francis Gadd (*1944), known by the stage name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Glitter">Gary Glitter</a>, is an English former glam rock singer who achieved popular success in the 1970s and 80s. He was known for his extreme glam image of glitter suits, make-up and platform boots, and his energetic live performances. </p>
<p>He sold over 20 million records, spent 168 weeks on the UK Singles Chart and had 21 hit singles placing him in the Top 100 UK most successful chart acts. </p>
<p>From 1997, he returned to public notice for committing sex offences, being imprisoned for downloading child pornography in 1999, and child sexual abuse and attempted rape in 2006 and 2015.</p>
<p><strong>He was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one count of having sex with a girl under the age of 13 following investigations by Operation Yewtree.</strong></p>
<p>*<em>He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2015, but is thought to be due for release in three and a half years, the <em>Sun</em> reported.</em> </p>

            "well behaved" ?
Society put them there because of their actions. 
I don't give a fuck about how many times they say thank you and please in prison. 
Give them all the chair. Fire up old sparky....that chair should be running 24/7

            Holy fuck, ive said it before and I will say it again, prison is like an entertainment centre, you get to play ping pong ball, hang out at the gym, If I was to go to a gym being a law-abiding citizen[ for what it is worth which is sh*t] I would have to PAY for membership. You can even study for a PHD in prison, save up your pocket money and have a wad when you come out of prison, and get prison aftercare. WTF??? They get everything handed to them on a plate for FREE. Crime DOES PAY.

             You are a blithering idiot. They are talking about a special prison for sex offenders where they get this treatment, not a regular prison. In most prisons, you are treated harshly, can be shanked or murdered by the guard's and raped. Then, they do psyops where pieces of shit like you complain that prisons are to easy and the state should be harsher. Keep your boot licking mouth shut.

              Prisons are too soft , if you think Prison is ''harsh'' in the UK, you are as soft as shit. Stop talking nonsense you fool. If prisons keep them fed, watered, and entertained, there is a problem, a huge problem it means that crime pays, crime should never pay.Why are you defending this, want to try a real prison where it is literally run and legitimised by rapist and paedophile prisoners who would make your softie arse a sock for good measure try Guatemala or mexico or Iraq. You silly pansy. I hope they make a sock of you one day!
