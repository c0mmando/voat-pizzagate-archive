            Alex Jones = straw man.
I rarely listen to him. I do my own digging and also get my news from other researchers. When I have on occasion watched a clip of Jones on You Tube, it was always news I already knew. He has a definite and consistent bias. He quickly backed down from supporting pizzagate. Years ago the respected Patriot Truth teller William Cooper exposed Alex Jones. Many have always been skeptical of him. I was suspicious of his early entry into using "fancy" graphics and trying to look like a funky Network News show. Who was funding him? He is a horrible interviewer and always talks over his guests. His job is to become the "face" of alternative media....AND AN UGLY ONE. Classic discredit tactic.

             Bill Cooper was shot trying to defend himself from local police who knew he was crippled at his remote home. Alex Jones, still alive despite many public exposures, was, and still is being exposed.

            I want to do a post on Jones.  I don't follow him.  I don't follow any YT idols.  Everyone here that reads my comments should know that by now.  I don't follow anyone.  I discovered an article and I want to post it.  It will show a new tactic they are using and I think it is nasty.  It is using Children.  The deaths of Children.  If you ad it on to here it will get entwined in the q discussions.  I don't want to get into that.  Hope you don't mind my posting off your standing up for Jones.  I won't get into that.  Mine will only be on the right or wrong of what they are doing.

            i suspect, without studying it too much, that jones is being shut down to test the waters or set a precedent (biggest name in the [controlled, limited hangout] 'truther' movement) for censorship of real truth tellers on the internet.  but that's just my suspicion.  but yes in my mind, jones is definitely clearly controlled and misdirects his followers as to real power players

            Bullshit. Alex Jones has gone on the record saying pizzagate is a conspiracy theory and disingenuously labelling it as Hillary Clinton running a human trafficking ring out of a DC pizza psrlour. Pizzagate is a global conspiracy and Hillary Clinton's involvemet was just a fraction - albeit substantial.

            Maybe, or maybe this is a stratfor (cutout) guy being censored by a bunch of tech companies that got their start through In-Q-Tel (also a cutout). So, kinda like the gov is censoring itself.

             Looking at this comment again, I think protecting AJ's speech is important. Even if stratfor shill, their censorship is our censorship, don't let them sell this restriction based on soley based on their shitty usage of the right.

            Bill Hicks, sorry, "Alex Jones" is controlled opposition.  He hasn't exposed the truth of pizzagate, and he's no friend of ours.  Pizzagate is real, and he is a fake.

            Well what have we learned from history? Most of the popular figures who get publicity get it through stunts put on as part of top secret projects. Everyone from MLK, to Ghandi, The Beatles, Mother Teresa, and famous feminists get there through their involvement with the CIA. Alex Jones is so obviously a part of all that, the stunts are put there to make us look ridiculous when we tell the truth. Oh, here's a story about spirit cooking, but wait, Pizzagate is fake news, but we have all the inside information to everything, we're going to report on it here, unless it's Pizzagate, in which case, we still say that's fake, but oh, let's have everyone on the Pizzagate message boards fall at our feet... give me a break.

            Only 9 comments and I see the name calling begins.

            This Alex 'thing' is pivotal and those who are struggling to see that the attack on Alex will usher in rampant and tyrannical censorship need to box their way out of their bias bubble and zoom to 40,000 feet.

            Big Tech is breaking people and businesses because THEY CAN!
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever/whoever gets labeled by Big Tech as offensive, incitefull, or hateful becomes a target to destroy. 
Free speech and the liberty to live your life in peace and prosperity be DAM-D. They don't care.
           </p>
           <p>
            By excluding dissenting voices from media platforms and shutting down their pay portals, this is going to hurt more than just an Alex Jones. This is tearing apart businesses that have employees who have families. Most will never have the resources to fight back. Alex Jones is one of the ones most likely able to put up a legal fight and secure a solid push back on this shredding of our constitutional rights and freedoms.
           </p>
           <p>
            If folks are too embarrassed, or too shy, or too biased, or too close minded to speak up for this attack on free speech, then doing nothing will ensure that the word pizzagate and other similar things will be memory holed out of existence. No one will speak of it because their right to do so will be gone. They will be punished for even thinking about talking about it.

            Alex has been openly calling out the scum for many years, i honestly think he is legit. Everyone on the info wars team seem like good smart people who i would enjoy hanging out with. Bring back Jakari Jackson and Lee Ann Mcadoo!  Pizzagate is the big enchilada, its when the 'fake news' phenomena started.

             <p>
              Well, I've said this a half dozen times but I guess I'll say it again to someone new.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imagine you are the Cabal the rules the world. The people need to be controlled, so give them Fox News and CNN. 85% of people are content to pick a side and feel self righteous about the choice and mock the ignorance of the other side.
             </p>
             <p>
              But 15% of people don't buy it. They need to be controlled too, so what do you do?
             </p>
             <p>
              You give them the truth. Well, you give them a portion of the truth. And you deliver to them via a big personality who uses these partial truths to lead you to false conclusions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Enter Alex Jones.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you really think he'd have been allowed to get as big as he has if he wasn't controlled? If he was the real thing, he'd have been quietly removed long before he was a household name. He'd either have had a heart attack or they would have found child pornography on his computer.
             </p>
             <p>
              So what is Alex Jones job? It's twofold. First, HE does the investigation and reports HIS conclusions.  Secondly, he adopts a personality just crazy enough to immediately discredit himself to the 85%, but not so bad that the 15% become skeptical.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's an example. Do you remember the "It's Okay to be White" campaign? Little harmless flyers were posted everywhere with that benign statement. The Left freaked the fuck out about it. Do you remember?  And what did Alex Jones do?  He pounced on it immediately and started merchandising shit that said, "It's Okay to be White, It's Okay to be Black, It's Okay to be Brown; it's GREAT to bring human."
             </p>
             <p>
              So what did he accomplish by doing this?  Easy. He took something that was meant to raise awareness to the global anti-white pogrom and he reframed it to make it appear that all races are equal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or how about the way he freaks out about "Radical Islamic Terrorists"? Be honest with yourself. Do you really think Arabs would be any less savage and stupid if you somehow erased Islam from their minds? No. Their religion is shit tier but their incompatibility with Western nations is much deeper than that. It's racial.
             </p>
             <p>
              But Jones is a Civic Nationalist. And he convinces others to become Civic Nationalists as well. Civic Nationalism is right wing virtue signaling designed to get you to cheerfully embrace the white genocide happening worldwide.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please. Think critically. You're following a conman.

Going by your theory then that must mean that no one is too powerful that they can't be controlled, including Donald Trump. Are you then also saying that Donald Trump is controlled opposition as well? If the globalists are as powerful as people claim then what's stopping them from pulling a JFK on the Don? Obviously they haven't done so because they have an agenda.

               I don't really want to type out a huge response so all I can say is I think Alex Jones is a smart guy who is helping the masses to wake up and start doing their own research. People will learn more if they research on their own and do their own work vs just being told stuff. They have not killed him because they think he makes truthers look crazy and people don't take him seriously. Over the years he has clearly stated how Europeans and Americans are being replace with 3rd world sub humans because they are easier to control. If you listen to him frequently he often talks openly about the anti-white agenda. You make a good argument but you have not convinced me man, sorry. Alex Jones is still OK in my book.

            Rather than blindly backing a guy who looks by all measure to be a Limited Hangout artist, how about a more realistic examination of Alex Jones?
           </p>
           <p>
            Understanding Jones' history and tactics, examining his funding apparatus and digging deeper into his background ( which is murky, at best ) are all avenues of potential inquiry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Qanon's major point is DO NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW ANYONE, but do your own examinations and critical thinking.

             Are you a Trump supporter? If so, don't you know Alex Jones has done more to help Trump than the message board poster, Q? Lots of reasons not to agree with Alex Jones, but the facts are facts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alex Jones was one of, if not the biggest cheerleaders for Trump. If it wasn't for Alex Jones, their may have not been a Trump presidency. Q is just coming along for the ride that Alex Jones, Trump, and many others, worked so hard for. Trump supporters that are attacking Alex Jones, are attacking the single biggest, or one of the single biggest factors in getting Trump elected. Its mind boggling.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump was on the Alex Jones Show. Its highly likely that Alex Jones and Trump are working together more so than Q and Trump. History proves that Trump and Alex Jones have worked together to get him elected.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q is building a cult. "WWG1WGA, WWG1WGA, WWG1WGA ,WWG1WGA". I see it everywhere. Then the really emotionally attached Q believers that stop following or listening to a person because they don't believe in Q. If you don't agree with Q, "you are disinfo agent!" They're putting themselves in an echo chamber. This is cult like behavior and dangerous. And its dividing Trump base. Was that the plan all along?
            </p>
            <p>
             Q believers claim Q doesn't ask for money so he's legit. When that couldn't be further from the truth. Q is taking up your time and attention and time is more valuable than money. Its easy to make more money, but you'll never get back the time invested into Q.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't need Q to tell me not to blindly follow anyone. That sounds like gaslighting. Think logically, sounds like more gaslighting from Q. I wouldn't doubt Q could be an insider and even possibly close to Trump. But that does not mean he is on Trumps side.
            </p>
            <p>
             My biggest issue with Q followers is that many of them are dividing Trumps base. People that support Trump should come together and support Trump. Trump is the main guy. Who cares about Q? He's not Trump and he didn't help get him elected. So to me, he's irrelevant.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not an Alex Jones shill, I'm a shill for the facts. And the fact remains, Alex Jones has done more to get Trump elected than Q. So, for that reason, I'd side with Alex Jones over Q. Since I'm not emotionally attached to Alex Jones, Q, or any narrative, I'm perfectly okay with being wrong. Because I research facts. And I don't have an overly huge ego that prevents me from admitting when I'm not correct about something.
            </p>
            <p>
             People need to be careful about being too emotionally attached to a narrative or a person. And the overly ego thing too. It clouds judgement. Stick to facts. Like Trump being on Alex Jones Show. And Alex Jones being one of the biggest influences in getting Trump elected. Those are facts. Any real Trump supporter will want to unite with other Trump supporters, not divide them.

              I have and still do follow Alex Jones, for over 15 years.  I'm not dismissing his impact, but I'm also not going off the reservation on the First Amendment narrative being pushed right now.

              He is absolutely a Limited Hangout.  I believe 100% that he is Bill Hicks, also.

               lol srsly? I dont think its possible to find someone as humorless as Alex Jones
              </p>
              <p>
               although, the Deep State coulda tortured Hicks with acid down his throat or some shit to alter his voice &amp; forever knock the humour outta him
              </p>
              <p>
               but just the way AJ thinks. Its not mercurial or cerebral enough to be Hicks. There's no artisrty with language in AJ - thats something so indelible you could never strip that away from the soul that inhabited Bill Hicks body

              I'm not sure why you're getting so many downvoats. The truth, even if people here don't like it, is that AJ has a HUGE audience! His rabid support of Trump undoubtedly immensely helped Trump win the election. That doesn't mean there aren't a lot of legitimate concerns with AJ, or that we should not be suspicious of him. It just means his reach is wide and he did cheerlead trump!

              One more thing. If qanon is an insider and trump is connected. Do you really think trump would turn on alex jones like that? Alex has been 99% loyal to trump minus that one segment where he started crying over the Syrian bombing. That is completely against the type of person trump is. He's not going to throw someone who went 100% all in for him during the election over a stupid 10 minute video where alex looked like he was on drugs!

              Couldn't have said it better myself. Alex jones redpilled me and once my eyes were open I moved on to different content producers and subjects. I'll be forever grateful to him. He back peddled on pizzagate, specifically comet ping pong being involved in child sex crimes, because he was being threatened by the George Soros legal cabal. Infowars employs 100+ people. You can't go around claiming someone is trafficking children through a creepy pizza shop with no concrete evidence! People have no empathy for how serious of a threat that is to his entire operation. He's not a single person with a YouTube account! He's built the largest alt media company and with that comes a plethora of additional pressures and legal ramifications that these qanon loving, EVERYBODY IS A ZIONIST SHILL losers do not understand.

            Seemed far too coincidental that Alex Jones lost his expansive platform (across the various social media sites) after having Isaac Kappy on who outed Hollywood pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much as I think Alex can be a muppet, he has indeed been red-pilling people for years.  As Q said (whether you believe them or not), sometimes a little disinfo has to go in to help spread the truth.  I mean I don't entirely agree with that..... but given the world we live in, people are more likely to digest hard truths like pedogate if it comes amidst other topics.

             I follow Q based on some of prayingmedics videos. I'm not fully convinced Q is on Trumps side. But I do agree, that disinformation is necessary. One big reason is to confuse the enemy. People get emotional when they are being "lied" to, but they don't understand that disinfo is necessary. We're in a serious battle / war on many levels.
