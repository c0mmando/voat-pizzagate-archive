<p>&quot;Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City — and making wisecracks about his just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl.</p>
<p>“I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an ‘offender,’ ” the financier told The Post yesterday.</p>
<p>“It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel,” said Epstein.</p>
<p>Epstein’s flippant reasoning aside, a New York judge ruled at a hearing last month that the moneyman is the most dangerous kind of sex offender: a Level 3.</p>
<p>That means, according to the state, Epstein is at “high risk” to repeat his offense and poses “a threat to public safety.”</p>
<p>But Epstein doesn’t seem bothered by the designation.</p>
<p>“The crime that was supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York,” he said.</p>
<p>Epstein recently returned to his $50 million East 71st Street mansion and celebrated his release from a Florida jail with his close pal, Britain’s Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>
<p>In court papers, the victim was identified as a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>At one point, Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of statutory rape, according to investigators. Court documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to $1,000 for sexual massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan.</p>
<p>He also molested girls he had brought in from South America and Europe and once was given three 12-year-old girls from France as a “birthday gift,” the documents alleged.</p>
<p>Epstein struck a secret nonprosecution deal with the feds. The government agreed to drop its probe of various sex-crime allegations if Epstein copped to prostitution felonies in Florida state court.</p>
<p>But in New York’s sex-offender database, Epstein doesn’t come up in a ZIP code search. He shows up only via the “name search” option, and no New York address is listed.</p>
<p>That’s because Epstein’s Upper East Side home is considered “temporary.” By state law, he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database, and Epstein listed his Florida home.</p>
<p>PageSix</p>
<p>&quot;Jeffrey Epstein’s East Side mansion houses Russian playmates&quot;</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein is not letting his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a teenager interfere with his lifestyle.</p>
<p>But instead of having his assistants troll local high schools, the billionaire money manager — and registered sex offender — is importing his playmates from Russia, my source says.</p>
<p>A recent visitor tells me Epstein has a house full of young beauties at his East 71st Street mansion. “Half of them are from the former Soviet Union and the other half are a mix of Americans and Europeans,” said my source.</p>
<p>Although all the women appeared to be at least 17, the age of consent in New York state, they were all several decades younger than 63-year-old Epstein, the visitor said.</p>
<p>Epstein apparently has contacts in Moscow who provide matchmaking services for both his “orgy island” in the Caribbean (which he jokingly dubbed Little St. Jeff’s) and his Manhattan townhouse.</p>
<p>“When the Russian girls arrive in the city, they already have Jeffrey’s phone number,” said my source.</p>
<p>One procurer, Peter Listerman, claims in TV interviews that he introduced many oligarchs and A-listers to Russian models, and says: “I’m not a pimp, just [a] matchmaker.”</p>
<p>Listerman, or a dead ringer in an Astrakhan fur hat, was photographed entering Epstein’s mansion in January.</p>
<p>Epstein had no comment.</p>
<p>The mansion is called the Herbert N. Straus Mansion.</p>
<p>Google images has alot of pictures of it.</p>

            WOW!  Listman looks like God's Gift to Women, right?  Ugh-Ly.  Another Narcissist.  His friend Jeffrey is a Narcissistic piece of garbage.  A B-day gift of 3 12 yr old French Girls.  If you add all their ages together they are still to young for him.  He doesn't share sex I am sure.  He takes it.

            Unfortunately it is now owned by Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile and trafficker in white slavery!

            Then you've got The Breakers - the family summer ultra-mansion for the Vanderbilt family. Of which Anderson Cooper is a descendant. One of the guards informed me that these family members STILL vacation here to this day, on the completely blocked-off 3rd floor. Apparently, there is a neighborhood across the street that allows them to travel underneath the mansion and take an elevator up to the 3rd floor:

            I can't remember my login and as a "new" member I can't start a new thread but can someone please look at this info and post or dig on it?  It relates to pizzagate because it is confirmed cases of sexual abuse of kids that was covered up by a mega church in the DC area.  I will post several links below to start your research but there is TONS of info online about the church, the abuse scandal, the pastor(s) involved, the resulting convictions.  In short, CJ Mahaney started Sovereign Grace Ministries (under a different name at the time) and than planted several churches around the U.S. some of the largest being in the DC/Maryland area.  Apparently back in the 1990s there was a pedophile network operating in some of his churches (civil lawsuit
            <a href="http://thewartburgwatch.com/tww2/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130514115743611.pdf">

            </a>
            lays out the details). I believe the angle that should be investigated in part is WHY the church has never been more thoroughly investigated in spite of multiple claims of abuse, why so many pastors within the church covered up abuse, hid it, helped the perps and discouraged victims from sharing, and especially what potential political connections CJ Mahaney and other prominent pastors involved may have had.  The Catholic church is well known for the sex abuse but the evangelical church scandals are just beginning to come to light.  I think a mega church in DC with a history of abuse and cover ups is a good place to start!  (Once again, please note, the "churches" I speak of in this post relates to Evangelical churches. NOT Catholic churches or scandals.  I believe evangelical churches have just as much if not more corruption, abuse and scandals that have yet to be fully discovered.)

            Also relevant because in the recent Larry Nasser trial, Racheal Denhollander was one of those who publicly spoke out about the abuse she suffered from him.  She had also grown up in a Sovereign Grace church and spoke out about their own sex abuse scandal.

            This civil suit ended up being dismissed on a Technicality-statute of limitations. Its 46 pages long but details the extent of abuse and cover up by pastors at SGM. SGM now uses the case dismissal as "proof" that they were falsely accused.  The details are very horrible and the document hard to read.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe we will find political connections between CJ Mahaney and someone more powerful especially given the location of several of his largest churches in the DC area.  There was a pedophile ring operating within his church and Mahaney claims to have no knowledge of it.  Someone please do more digging on this.  I believe it deserves its own thread if someone could start one.  I have added several more links at the end of this post that are relevant to the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to this church I know of several other mega churches that I believe are operating pedophile rings or allowing pedophiles to access children under the guise of "ministry". Because I have no direct proof I won't post the names because I don't want to be accused of defamation.  I have heard stories tho of a private school (run by a church) principal taking pictures of children on his cell phones, separating a 6 year old girl from her mother and threatening her that she had to come to school that day so her mom could work (child terrified and screaming-was resistant to going to the school-he was alone in a room with her) and other questionable behavior.  Incidentally the man is the son in law of one of the pastors.  A theme I see in churches with abuse issues is relations, pastors and leadership are all related.  This incident was brought to a senior pastor's attention who did nothing about it.
            <br/>
            Another DC area church and my personal experience, a sunday school teacher (nasty old man) who talked to us about sex and later it came out that he sexually abused kids within the church.  Church leadership did nothing when parents complained about his inappropriate conversations with kids.  After years of nightmares about that building and a "secret room" that I was always looking for, I returned to the church and actually found the secret room I'd had nightmares about for the past two decades!  Whether he abused kids in that room, whether I was ever personally abused by him, I don't remember.  But point is, another case of church leadership burying allegations of sexual misconduct.
