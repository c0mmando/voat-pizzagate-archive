<p>Take Spin ping pong. There have been threads on Spin before but the connections branch out in more ways then at first observed. The owner of Spin is Franck Raharinosy. Franck Raharinosy was known to be dating Barbara Bush Jr, daughter to George Bush JR, the Bush family being the occult pushing CIA\'s number one family.   <a href="http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/barbara-pierce-bush-new-boyfriend-dating-report-71306">Title Here</a> Yeah, Ping Pong just had to have a Bush family connection didn\'t it? </p>
<p>Francik Rahrinosy in an article claimed he spena a  last minute Christmas visit  with friend Pushpa Basnet, foudner of Early Childhood Development Center, at her center with her and the children. <a href="http://www.ninunina.com/blog/2017/1/11/franck-raharinosy">Title Here</a></p>
<p>CNN, the CIA\'s top propaganda network,  seemed to be very impressed with Pushpa Basnet and her work with the children as they gave her the 2012 and 2016 Hero award.  Susan Sanrandon, the Ping Pong Queen, presented Basnet with the award in 2012. Each of the Top 10 CNN Heroes received $50,000 in recognition of their work, and Basnet’s nonprofit, the Early Childhood Development Center, has been awarded an additional $250,000 grant to continue the work.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpa_Basnet">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Early Childhood Development Center not at all surprisingly has this symbol <a href="http://ecdcnepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Butterfly-Books-wide-2B-1.jpg">Title Here</a> They just can\'t get enough of the Monarch butterfly. </p>
<p>Getting Back to Susan Sarandon, it is known by most in here that she owns several Ping Pong joints. That just can\'t get enough of ping pong. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/09/susan-sarandon-ping-pong">Title Here</a> Note the predictable picture of Susan with a ping pong racket covering one eye, leaving only one visible. Corny.</p>
<p>Susan Sarandon of course was on the board to the Hele Haiti Foundation. Of course she was. And of course this is their symbol. <a href="http://zorzap.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/haiti.jpg">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Sarandon is also a supporter of SOS childrens Villages. Remeber Laura Silsby and the 33 cough, yes 33 children? Well there is a happy ending. After they were freed from Silsby, it was Sarandons SOS childrens Village that took good care of the children from that point forward. No, really. <a href="https://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/news/sos-takes-care-of-children-victims-of-trafficking">Title Here</a></p>
<p>In case you are curious about SOS Childrens Villages, here is ther logo and webpage. <a href="https://www.sosvillagesenfantsbenin.org/Our-Activities.aspx">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Not surprisngly, Wyclef Jean and his SOS Childresn Villages were investigated for fraud in a criminal probe as he couldn\'t explain where the money went. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/wyclef-jean-faces-criminal-probe-over-haiti-charity-8209814.html#">Title Here</a></p>
<p>And wouldn\'t you know it, Wyclef John also was involved with Yele Haiti of Surandon and CNN fame. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/01/13/yele.wyclef.haiti.relief/index.html">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Yele Haiti Foundation also had generous support from, your going to be surprised, Angelina Jolie, Tyra Banks of Eye of Horus island fame, Super spook baby Matt Damon, and Wyclef Jean among many other well known names. <a href="https://www.looktothestars.org/charity/yele-haiti-foundation">Title Here</a></p>
<p>If you want to go down the rabbit hole, a seemingly unrelated article appeared in Variety titled :L.A. Sheriff’s Department Apologizes to Wyclef Jean for Detainment Over Mistaken Identity) The Sherrif said it was all a misunderstanding, and the aritcle even has the offical departments statement, complete with the infamous LA sheriff badge. <a href="http://variety.com/2017/music/news/wyclef-jean-detained-la-sheriff-apologizes-mistaken-identity-1202013415/">Title Here</a></p>

            It's always the same ones over and over on the Boards or Sponsors.  Elton John, Bill Clinton Bono Paul McCarney and Look!  It's Ellen!  Dancing Ellen.  Dancing because of all the money pouring in.  I can't ever watch her lousy show.  She fills her studio I don't know how.  People don't realizing she is padding her wealth with the money of selling poor little children.  Her and Portia make me sick.

            A report in yesterday's New York Times alleged that much of the money was spent on administration, public relations and consultants, or was funnelled to outside businesses owned by friends and relations of Jean. In one mysterious transaction, detailed in Yele's tax returns, the singer's brother-in-law was given $600,000 for helping with the "rebuilding of Haiti".  Bill and Hillary have been rebuilding Haiti for years now.  When will it end?  When will someone actually do something to help the poor people of Haiti?

            "But I am not an orphan" told an eight year old girl.  How Heartbreaking.  The Haiti Habit.  They all have it.  They can't help it.  The trafficking of children pays big.  It's an evil web they are caught in once they get the feel of all that cash pouring in.  The lifestyle, the continued adoration by the media. For that they are in the business of selling children.  It's really quite disgusting.

            , thanks for all these interesting interconnections. The one thing you forgot to source, though, was the very last paragraph that makes this Pizzagate related:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There is a great deal more including some of the organizations being accused of fraud, and one being accused of stealing children
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Can you please provide a link for the child-stealing accusation? I will gladly remove the flair when you do. Thanks.

            This post must have the Pedo Protector is Censorship mode.
Excellent references and attention to detail of a citizen investigation done right. Yet the Moderator(s) must censorship this at all cost, even if it becomes obvious that pedo protection is more important than children or even human dignity.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only qualification to be a mode is to fuck children over under the tactic of Big Bloated Government rules, regulations and contempt for open dialogue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please remove the 24 hour flair on the 23 hour old post Archiving this post is the same as removing an investigative tool.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again pedophiles require all the protection Moderators can give for only 30 pieces of silver and a child or two for sexual and organ harvesting.

            I always think of that weird movie "pretty baby" in which Susan Sarandon played a prostitute in a brothel and then auctioned off her 12 yr old daughter as a virgin to the highest man bidder. Seems to promote child porn. back then some photographer took naked pics of Brooke Shields too.

                that what was happened was horrid but wishing the same crime upon an innocent child is not the way.  I tried to help you and so did some others but this is not winning you favors.  You are now harassing someone that had nothing to do with what happened to your child.  Believe me we have just as much sorrow for your child as all the others.  But this will not get us in your corner when you make threats against a member's child.  That is not what we are about here.  Now please calm down and put up a decent and coherent post.  You know I can't honor this.  I am on your side, but this is unacceptable.  I sincerely think you owe

                  He did not start out this way, I think he/she is highly agitated and a feeling everyone is against him because of not understanding the policies or how to post.  We don't know what the experiences where regarding the child.  Possibly a lot of ignored requests for help regarding LE there never has been a detailed story about it.  Frustration can lead to many things that we otherwise would never do.  Might feel backed into a corner.  Right now I am hope he sees that paring down his posts and simplifying them and just telling his story from the heart is the best way.  We are all here to help, but threats are not how we roll.  It's also not a good way to get people on your side.

                   No. It’s easy to look him up. He’s given his youtube and gab. This guy has a history and is psychotic. There’s things about him all over the Internet. He’s harassed me now for weeks. He pings me constantly. He calls anyone that is a pizzagate mod a pedophile. I’ve tried talking calmly. It doesn’t work. He calls me names, is friends with Donkey, pings donkey and others and encourages them to harass me too. He lies all the time. Now he says he would pay to have my son raped? He’s lost ALL SYMPATHY FROM ME.

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/DeathToMasonsASAP">
             @DeathToMasonsASAP
            </a>
            , most of your post is well sourced; I would like to ask you to please add the following, however:
           </p>
           <p>
            1)
            <em>
             Spin ping pong:
            </em>
            Please add one or two sentences what it is, you might also want to link to their website (possibly as an archive).
           </p>
           <p>
            2) As

            </a>
            has pointed out, the 'Hearts of Gold Hospice' link isn't working.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) 'There is a great deal more including some of the organizations being accused of fraud, and one being accused of stealing children.' Please list these organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you.

             Everybody in here knows what Spin Ping Pong is. Those that haven't heard of it know that you play ping pong at ping pong places, even though the elite seem to be the only ones who play ping pong.

              Yep. But you mention only one specifically in your text that was accused of fraud. Which where the other ones?
