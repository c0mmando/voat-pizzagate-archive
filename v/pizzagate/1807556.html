<h1>Claims related to pizzagate</h1>
<ul>
<li>sexual exploitation in bars ... is well known</li>
<li>cases of personal sexual servitude where gang members hold someone basically in captivity in their house for purposes of their own sexual pleasure</li>
<li>7,572 trafficking cases were reported to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, a rise of 24 percent on 2015, according to Polaris, with at least 5,550 cases related to sex trafficking</li>
<li>The most common form of trafficking was sexual exploitation taking place in hotel rooms and private parties described in the report as escort services.</li>
<li>U.S.-born adults and <strong>children are most likely to be victims of sexual exploitation</strong> and be forced into door-to-door sales</li>
<li><strong>Children</strong> who have run away from home, those <strong>who have been sexually abused</strong>, and those <strong>in the care of social services or foster parents</strong>, are most vulnerable.</li>
<li>all too often it was assumed that trafficking happens elsewhere and doesn\'t involve U.S.-born citizens</li>
</ul>
<h2>My conclusion</h2>
<p>The pizzagate related claims in this article can be used as a reliable source, and the article as a whole delivers indicators of sex trafficking of underaged U.S. citizens <strong>supporting pizzagaters demand for full investigation</strong>. The size of the problem, counting that only one National Hotline received an average of 15 calls a day on 2016 related to sex trafficking victims, further supports the urgency of the matter.</p>
<p>Additionally, the spread of the article delivers an indicator that MSM might be hiding the problem in purpose, reducing the public awareness. In an earlier study I\'ve read it was suggested than less than 10% of the victims report their case, suggesting that there is a remarkable amount of cases of child sex trafficking DAILY in the U.S. This should, by no doubt, be considered as serious enough to both be reported by the MSM and to be investigated fast. The low level of investigations supports pizzagaters claim that the problem might be wiped under the carpet also by the political elite and high profile persons in the law enforcement.</p>
