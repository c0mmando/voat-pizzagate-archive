Jamaica Informant Organ Harvesting Witness &amp; Warning<br />

<p>How does this relate to Pizzagate? </p>
<p>George Webb has made a series of videos over 109 days:
Here\'s # 108 from yesterday -  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqcLQNpdM30">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqcLQNpdM30</a> - </p>
<p>&quot;Day 108 - DynCorp Harvest, Killing Is Great Business, Part 1&quot;</p>
<p>describing the details around the large operations which consist of a criminal gang liaison with top government officials and administrators.
Webb describes the &quot;Rat Lines&quot; wherein the organs and living humans are brought to market for their body parts. </p>
<p>The witness in Jamaica, who is a Medic, backs up Webb. He says that it is not an &quot;inside job&quot; though some Jamaicans may be working for the operation. He says the money and the organs are from richer countries where people can afford to pay high prices for organs. He says that his people are being used because they are thought of as &quot;3rd World&quot; and that the murders are claimed to be a result of rape. </p>
<p>He realization came when the bodies of woman he found had their pants on , but their heads cut off. 
He reasoned that if it was really rape they would not be mutilated and , obviously, would show signs of sexual assault. 
What rapist puts the pants back on the victim after a rape/ murder?</p>
<p>Webb has been saying that he uses Haiti as an example but that the same operation goes on in other countries with the same M.O. &quot;Modus Operandi &quot; used over and over. </p>
<p>Webb connects these large Industrial scale businesses of mining human organs to the Clinton Foundation and various revolving - door [with government offices] Corporations. </p>
<p>There is suspicion that the Pizza joints, such as the one with all the creepy art that Obama and Clinton used for fund raising events, were connected with this very same business.</p>',

            All these postings about how he is a medical doctor or a medic are utterly bogus. It's amazing what credibility a white t-shirt and a stethoscope around your neck will give you.

            Except, which 'horrible crimes'? The recent wave of beheadings in Jamaica?

            The cosmetic plastic surgery business most certainly is, mostly anti-aging rejuvenation of looks.   image-Google on  before-and-afters of facelifts.   It's what pays the rent for those docs.

            Younger clients tend to things like nose-job or chin-augmentation.

            People much older and in worse shape than HRC have been kept tick'ing by routine things. In fact, I don't remember seeing any allegations that her maladies were extra-ordinary. The claim was that she was HIDING them. No doubt that she was.

            Didn't hear about 6 new hearts for Rockefeller. I will grant you the benefit of the doubt that it's true.   Money can buy you a place at the head of the line at a hospital  in a place like Karachi or Jo'burg.

            What if the pedophiles knew about the organ harvesting, made a deal...let us fuck the kids before you harvest them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedos find kids, fuck them, hand them over to harvesters or harvesters find them, let pedos fuck them, then harvest them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Win/win for pedos bc kids will be dead so can't talk plus they get their gratification
           </p>
           <p>
            Win/win for harvesters bc they have the pedos bring them more kids to harvest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe money is exchanged too. Seriously, other than  money/power/fear/participation how the hell are these pedos able to get away with it. Like Hollywood pedos that a multitude of colleagues know is a pedophile but say nothing. Either they're paid off, get opportunities (star of movie, etc) are scared bc their life was threatened, or they participate in pedophilia too. Is there something besides power/money/fear/participation ? Well I guess there's the people that know and just don't give a shit.

            I think organ trafficking is the main motivator behind #pizzagate. It is well hidden below the whole Pedo shit. Some wealthy people are able to get spare parts to prolong their lives, and noone will go to the police if one of their underaged sex slaves goes missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the war Serbia vs. Albaninan-Terrorists in Kosovo the Albanians had a organ harvesting factory, called the yellow house, in Albania close to the border to Kosovo. Even Carla Del-Ponte who was very politically motivated to rewrite history in favour of the MSM narrative wanted to look into this.

            4 beheadings in 5 days has Jamaica on edge, therefore this video has gone viral and people are buying the organ trafficking explanation. However AFAIK organ donors are not routinely beheaded, eh? See the other thread for details (it sucks having two threads).

             Doesn't look viral to me. 
Yes, as I wrote , they take them live, so they will be fresh for the transplant. 
Maybe someone ordered a head [or a few heads]. 
There could be many reasons for a rash of beheadings,  but that does not interfere with the organ harvesting angle?

              Went viral = please refer to the comment I made here enumerating the posts of this video on YouTube 5 times today, and related videos 3 times yesterday and today. This video just showed up and Jamaicans are really pushing it. Don't you think the same video posted 5x in a day is viral? I have no statistics on Facebook shares.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why? I uncovered that the whole impetus behind this is that there has been a rash of beheadings lately. Beheading as in head detached, not head missing! (So your theory of 'maybe someone ordered a few heads' does not work, okay?) Understandably people are upset and wondering what the heck is going on, looking for an explanation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some guy sitting in his car with a stethoscope made your OP video saying this is all about organ harvesting. He talked about organ snatching being a thing, named prices, but made no specific claims that organs were missing, okay? The main case he presents is based on a picture someone sent him. As I said above he says the chest was bloody but he specifically says he doesn't know if it was cut.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whatever. I don't see any evidence there is organ harvesting going on with these recent beheadings. It's just some guy with a stethoscope's theory that scared people have latched onto.

                 Right, I didn't want to make it easy for anyone that might want to hurt him and might not easily find his FB..It's not that easy to understand some of his pronunciation.  some crimes are crimes of opportunity and if it's too much work to get his ID, they won't bother?

             I wish I could edit the heading. I mis - spelled "trafficking".. The report was made today. That's what I was told.. But I could be wrong. Another reason to edit the heading if I am. Sorry if that was unclear.

            I made some skeptical comments over there, I'm not going to cut &amp; paste. I will address that you talk about him finding dead women with pants on and head cut off and I think he's talking about seeing a picture someone sent him of a single dead girl, with neck cut. He says the chest was bloody but he couldn't see if it was cut.

             I will listen again. I believe he is a Medic. Maybe he had suspicions for a while and then something clicked when he realized the rape victims still had their pants on. I think it's happening more than once. I know he's in Jamaica . I don't want to get into the details of why or how I know that.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can try to relay more questions to him. It seems he's quite upset. And I know, when I am upset I am not always as clear as I could be. When he said "those abroad" he wasn't referring to himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did hear he was called "doctor" - And he does know there are Jamaicans involved in the scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought the timing of it was interesting.
            </p>

             The fact there was a group arrested and only one killed ties in with the info George Webb gave to the extent Webb said the victims were taken live, as hostages, and then transported. The purpose of this is that they are taken to a holding area near to a hospital, kept alive so that their DNA and blood type could be tested for compatibility with the recipeint, and then they are killed as needed - so their bodies would be fresh. The heart is only viable for one hour - so Webb contended. And from what I recall of the info from Webb, the heart is the most valuable.

             I do know they thieve for other organs.

             I recall Webb explaining that they transport them out of the country, to be closer to where they will be used.

             I will listen to Webb again to double check.
