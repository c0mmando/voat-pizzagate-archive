            If you take the Franklin scandal as an example, the only big newspaper's owner was directly involved, and used the paper to cover up, and slander the victims or anyone investigating. The chief of police was raping children. He was protected and very good friends with the top FBI lad there at the time. Larry King who ran the credit union utilised church pedophiles to procure children from 'boys town' a kind of care/schooling facility. He also used his victims to recruit more victims. There was also a large network of doctors, teachers, lawyers and especially CPS and foster/adoptive parents who were involved. It was massive, and it seemed as tho ANYONE could have been involved. They seemed to have intentionally situated pedo's in anyt role where they might come in useful. Its impossible to know, any estimate could be lowballing it massively.

            Interesting question. I do not believe these should be called rings. That implies a finite isolated number. I think this is a network.
           </p>
           <p>
            In general various networks intertwine. The ritual abuse network, the child abuse network, the child trafficking network, the "legitimate" child network ie state fostering, adoption etc, satanist network eg Aquino, Luciferian illuminati 13 family bloodline network, political networks, country networks, the mob network, narcotics /drug smuggling networks, mind control networks, medical /big pharma networks, corporate networks, sex slave networks, human trafficking networks, hollywood networks, music industry neworks, tv /media networks, entertainment - Disneyland, military networks, Nato / Gladio networks, secret society networks, security networks, police networks, psychopath networks, banking networks. Everything is connected and intertwined.
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence of survivors books eg Brice Taylor and Cathy Obrien, implicates many US Presidents in mind control sex slaves - most except Carter from Kennedy , especially Bush senior with children. Also Bob Hope, mafia, Kissinger, Cheney etc. Evidence from Australia, Fiona Barnett implicates 3 Prime Ministers and of course many lesser figures, and authorities. UK survivors implicate about 30 people as child abusers out of approx 1200 in the House of Lords and Commons,  at any one time in recent history from say 1970s. This includes at least one Prime Minister, 2 Home Secretaries. In Belgium a huge scandal largely unearthed and covered up but to the highest levels of power. This I believe to be true for most western countries to a greater of lesser extent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Child abusers /pedophiles /paedophiles are in key positions I believe in many countries - Key positions are such as (for UK) judges, Crown Prosecution Service, Coroners, Crown Lieutenants,  HM Courts and Tribunal Service, Privy Council, National Politicians, Civil Service, local politicians, Police, Doctors, Lawyers, Dentists, Social Workers to name some.
           </p>
           <p>
            Child abuse is useful for the "elite" as it is a fantastic blackmail tool, so for instance politicians in high office get where  they are BECAUSE they are child abusers.  It is also useful as a means to cause dissociation for trauma based mind control. It is also useful for causing fear an esential component of the way these people rule.  Child abusers often abuse 300 plus victims, thus causing ever greater chaos and expansion down the generations. btw multi generation child abuse is meant to exhibit a genetic component adding to the chaos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Presidents and Prime ministers are just puppets of the people really in power. Of course the people are expendable. The elite bloodline families are have been and are carrying out their plan of new world order out of chaos. Child abuse is a tool to enable that. As the "elite" are psychopaths, due to their bloodline and upbringing, as they mete out the abuse to  their own children,  then there are quite enough psychopaths to easily dominate the positions of power throughout society. We do not believe they can be so "evil" but it is really a matter of being amoral and lacking compassion. It is exceedingly hard to understand for the rest of us. We tend not to due to cognitive dissonance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyhow to get back to the question, how long is this piece of string-  as far as we can see. We just need to convince most of the rest of the population of the truth. How many children involved?  probably about 1 in 6 of the population if not more.
           </p>
           <p>
            But do not get depressed, things have come a tremendous way in the UK since news of serial child abuser Savile was unmasked after his death. Many many more adults have come forward detailing their childhood abuse. More of the population are believing it happens. You have to go through barriers of truth - that it is happening on a huge scale, that is happens even to babies, that it is so violent, that some is associated with vile ritual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            All we can do is try and make a difference, one by one we can by all joining up. Many spiders when they unite can tie down a lion Ethiopean proverb. Now lets expose them and make life better for our children.

            I believe that US government "mind control" research started in the spirit of an arms race.
            <br/>
            Some context:  Schoolgirls were captured then raped and indoctrinated.  Cultures have known and practiced this type of indoctrination for centuries.  It's how to create a person that is willing to participate in a suicide bombing.  Note that the little girls that escaped were not celebrated, they were feared and shunned.  And with good reason.

            MKULTRA, ARTICHOKE, NAOMI projects maybe were working on getting the same effect in a sterile lab environment but eventually resorted to the already proven method which involves the sexual abuse of children.  It's all so crazy but it's hard to find an idea that can explain why the US and other governments have developed a pedo tolerant attitude.

            Regarding gaining entry - the masonic or scientology model is a good one - hierarchical, where each level up represents a deeper and deeper dive into the org.  At level 1 its just networking and meeting interesting people and some membership dues.  At level 2, you dues go up and you meet some more influential people.  By level 3, maybe you'll be asked to do something in exchange for a favour - say, swing a contract or muddy someone's name.  Now they have something on you, just a minor thing, but you're starting to get bound to them now.  As the levels go up, more knowledge is received, more favours are given and more "commitment" is required in return, dirtier deeds or engaging in strange acts which will act to keep you loyal.  By the time these people are deep in and sacrificing etc, they essentially ARE the establishment, they have huge power and they have committed huge sins and they know of the sins of others - as a result, each member has a very strong reason to stay loyal and protect the secrets of the others.  It is a mexican standoff at the top, an atomic bond.

            It seems to be far more expansive than my mind can fathom without feeling physically ill.

           <p>
            I mean every time there is an actual bust that is actually reported in a nation's news network, hundreds to thousands of images/videos are found. That adds up to several thousands of children over the years, at a minimum, since that is just what we see confirmed in international news reporting.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a lot involved there, a lot of people. Abducting victims, hiding the victims while they are imprisoned, making the CP materials, transporting victims, disposing of victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then only one to a few people actually get prosecuted, even when hundreds of other leads are discovered, which means tons of people in law enforcement / government complicit in not pursuing or even covering up, on top of all the people involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or like Project Flicker, where thousands were caught purchasing CP, hundreds of them in government, and then only a handful were prosecuted. What the hell? And that was in 2006, so only a decade ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            And like look at this one:

             We discover in 1986 that Michel Felu used the offices of his employer, Joseph Verbeeck, Director of UNICEF Belgium to realize erotic and pornographic photographs of children. The more "soft" of these photos have been published in L'Espoir , the police are required to make excavations at Philippe Carpentier and other members of CRIES. She "discovers that the CRIES hides an international network of pedophiles that affects at least 18 countries". More than 4000 photos and tapes are seized, involving a hundred children. The images are taken and tours not only in the premises of UNICEF, but also in private apartments in Antwerp or Brussels where parents prostituted their children, and around the world. The lists of members of the CRIES are seized, and searches are carried out, especially in Belgium, the French police being uncooperative. Although all members of the CRIES have not participated in the exchanges and purchases of pictures and movies of child pornography , Philippe Carpentier and Michel Felu were sentenced in 1988 to ten years in prison for organizing the network

              Well they're not hiding it very well, are they? I mean here we all are, looking at this stuff for ourselves and drawing logical conclusions. And the information is being rapidly spread all over the internet, especially taking off since the Podesta email leaks. It doesn't really seem to be a matter of them hiding it so much as the general public having cognitive dissonance issues and not wanting to acknowledge it.

              I mean most here should be familiar with the video footage of Joe Biden inappropriately touching children and making them uncomfortable.

              Did any of the news media crew go, "Hey stop touching that little girl's chest? She is pulling away from you and doesn't like it, plus it's inappropriate." (10:05 in the video) NOPE.
