<p>Russian adoptions have been in the U.S. headlines for the last few days because of the sensational news of the meeting in Trump Tower last summer between Donald Trump, Jr., and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who claimed to be lobbying influential Americans for the restart of Russian adoptions in the U.S.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Yakovlev_Law"> which were banned in 2012 by Putin</a> in what many observers believed was retaliation for the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p>I haven\'t seen the alleged <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/396416-state-department-emails-hacking/">hacked State Dept. emails</a> on pastebin yet, but one of the pedes over at The_Donald just posted a screenshot of one of the leaked emails, dated June 6, 2016, entitled &quot;veselnitskaya house&quot; which purports to contain a picture house of the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, sent by William Browder to House of Representatives staffer (Committee on Foreign Affairs) Kyle Parker, who forwarded it to General Robert Otto. The Reddit users in the comments agree that it has ominous undertones and seems to suggest her house is being monitored or set up. This was sent 3 days before her meeting with Donald Trump, Jr.</p>

<p>Of course, it is well known that Natalia V was allegedly in the United States last year working to overturn the Russian adoption ban and even started a foundation to that end, called the<a href="http://archive.is/EhQK2"> HUMAN RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOUNDATION </a>. </p>
<p>What is fascinating is that Kyle Parker\'s Linked In page (which I am unable to archive) states that Kyle Parker worked extensively on passing the Magnitsky Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Public Law 112-208, Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, proposed and led multi-year campaign culminating in passage of precedent-setting legislation advancing trade and human rights, passed House 365-43, Senate 92-4; negotiated terms of law with White House, State, Treasury, Justice, and congressional leaders; formed and guided coalitions, developed public outreach plan, and ran media blitz resulting in thousands of articles </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other accomplishments: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>●	Conceptualized and executed 26 congressional hearings covering Russia, Moldova, and Turkey, exploring diverse themes from Internet freedom to corporate raiding, torture, national minorities, and bilateral cooperation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And most germane to the present discussion, Kyle Parker lists these accomplishments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>●	Launched advocacy drives freeing American citizen languishing in foreign jail, raising global awareness of Interpol abuse, promoting religious property restitution, and <strong>safeguarding intercountry adoptions</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also </p>
<blockquote>
<p>●	Devised strategy securing U.S. foreign terrorist designation for Russia’s most-wanted terrorist three years before he gained international infamy by threatening the 2014 Winter Olympics</p>
<p>●	Monitored national elections for OSCE in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Moldova</p>
