<p>Crudely commenting on this trend Southpark devoted a 2 minute and 13 second segment to Catholic Parishioners heckling a Priest during a Sunday service with jokes about the sexual abuse of young boys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A Boy and a Priest” centered around the friendship between Butters and Father Maxi, the local South Park priest who is being ridiculed by the townspeople over the Catholic Church’s history of sex abuse. Father Maxi’s relationship with Butters does his reputation no favors and prompts the Denver Archdiocese to send a cleanup crew of ordained church officials to South Park in order to remove any traces of child molestation.</p>

<p>In response, the Catholic League—a religious advocacy group—has released a baffling statement about the episode, calling the South Park creators &quot;cowards.&quot; As a statement from the organization\'s president Bill Donohue reads:</p>
<p>The October 3rd episode of “South Park,” titled “A Boy and a Priest,” portrayed molesting priests as pedophiles. This is factually inaccurate: almost all the molesters—8 in 10—have been homosexuals. Therefore, the cartoon-victim characters should have been depicted as adolescents, not kids. In Hollywood, the creators of “South Park,” Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are seen as courageous. They are really cowards. It takes courage to tell the truth.</p>
<p>So what does the community think? Is this speaking truth to power? Or is it a large media empire normalizing abuse?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Comedy Central is an American pay television channel owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks </p>
<p>Nickelodeon is also owned by Viacom. Dan Schneider, an alleged sexual abuser, was employed by Nickelodeon for decades. Thus I look at Southpark with suspicion</p>',

            Trey and Matt are the good guys, they are comedians and this is how comedians expose this stuff. Spreading information isn't always about "normalizing" something. To anyone who is a true fan of the show, it's obvious where their allegiances lie. South Park has always been about exposing that the emperor has no clothes on and the reason why they have been on for so long is that they are very sly in how they do it. Honestly, I thank God that there are guys out there still able to do what they do.

              There are like three entire episodes devoted to calling out the Vatican and Catholic priests on molesting children

              In the South Park video games you even fight Catholic priests who tried to molest and rape you!

             If it's even tongue and cheek, it's wrong.  Since they are owned by the same co. that owns Nick well I have to be suspicious.  Sometimes their shows seem to allow us to view it one way or the other, which I find suspicious.  Neither here nor there only confuses the message.

               Yeah,  I never really watched them until we started posting here, and I too thought they were informing us, and maybe sometimes that's what they wanted us to think, but I started thinking that maybe they were thumbing up their noses at us.  You know, like na na na na na.  In other words, this is what we are doing still.  All the hoopla over Nick and they are still at it.  Buggers.

             I really really hope so.
            </p>
            <p>
             The question is how much do Matt and Trey know? And who are they protecting w/in the Hollywood Pedo industry?
            </p>
            <p>
             I once interviewed a Hollywood Limo Driver who picked up Matt &amp; Trey after a visit to South America
            </p>
            <p>
             They had just returned from Cuba and explained  many Hollywood Peeps visit Cuba (this was when travel to Cuba was illegal).
            </p>
            <p>
             They explained it's easy to drive or fly into Mexico then fly to Cuba without getting your passport stamped. Seemed a bit shady. He also explained that many Hollywood guys go to Cuba and Mexico for child prostitution availability.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.s. I hate to use the term child prostitute as these kids aren't in this industry voluntarily, but it's the easiest way to communicate the concept

              Getting into Cuba was really shady and as you say illegal AND there was a woman that was caught.  From Canada to Cuba and she got fined $12K!!!  Not worth it.  If I remember correctly she forgot and left a baseball cap on her head.  Now I believe that you still have to have proof of some kind that you are in the art field.  Correct me if I am wrong.  But that's just up their alley, easily verified for them and they have a pass to little Cuban Boys.  They always seem to set things up just right.

            The Catholic League makes a good point. Calling this pedophilia confuses the issue, this should be addressed as typical homosexual behavior. It is typical homosexual behavior to abuse postpubescent teens. Getting this fact out to the public at large would definitely help people understand the nature of the problem. The problem is that "celibate" homosexuals are allowed to serve in the church. Also the boy scouts, and as high school teachers. Homosexuals should be kept away from teenage boys and children.

             It is not typical homosexual behavior. Many more heterosexuals prefer girls . "Homosexuals should be kept away from teenage boys and children." How about the heterosexual pedophiles? Or maybe not be allowed to even have children. My father was a pedophile.

              Wow.  I didn't know about your father.  I am sorry and hope you were not abused.  You make a very good point and explain it simply.  It sounds to me as though they are trying to blur the lines on pedophilia.  We can't let them.

               Thank you. I was abused starting in infancy.My father's good friend was Joe Ryan, who started the parapsychology dept. at Duke University.Had long suspected he was CIA..as Duke is implicated in MKUltra. My son told me he was CIA right before he was killed by a drunk driver last Sept.My dad and Joe were such good friends they each knew when the other was going to call them.Dad's  family were German...one of my ancestors helped to start the KKK and founded the Dallas Daily News.
