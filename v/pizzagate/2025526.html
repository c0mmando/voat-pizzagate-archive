<p>Oren Richard Knez III, 19, of the 1300 block of Parker Place, was arrested July 20 after police executed a search warrant of his house, Deputy Chief Nick Olsen said.

            : I'm confused about why it's a problem NCMEC tipped off local authorities? I have grave concerns about NCMEC -- especially their lack of oversight -- but aren't they supposed to be a national clearinghouse that local agencies report busts and tips to and send videos and photos of kids to so that networks across state and national borders can be unraveled and kids rescued? Isn't his their mandate?

             I agree with you in that it is confusing.

             Yes, they are, and THAT is the problem.  According to their website:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Thirty-two years ago, police could enter information about stolen cars, stolen guns, even stolen horses into the FBI's crime database – but not stolen children. Several tragic cases began to awaken the nation to the problem that there was no coordinated national system for addressing missing children cases.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So, you have to ask yourself?  If the authorities can run a national database for stolen cars, guns, and HORSES, why can't they do one for kids?  Why is a PRIVATE company allowed to do something illegal....... have access to child porn?   Even worse, have access to child porn with absolutely no oversight and no transparency?  Who are their donors?
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't have any idea who they are working for?  They 'help' bust a lone pedophile, but yet, as Trump just spoke of yesterday, human trafficking is worse than it has probably ever been in history.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who  are NCMEC and what are they really doing?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is just an example of the whole problem with them.

            1800THELOST tried to investigate me for exposing pedophiles when I was running victimsofgaybullying.com in it's wordpress.com aka accelerate.lgbt/about days - i found a referral tag from their offline CMS system in my wodpress control panel. All i did is put pictures of gay dads child rape victims on the page being used as a poster boy for gay pride and that's about it. They try and take the FBI's tip-offs and send it to the bin. Great work! 
Gay child sex victims being used as poster boys for their rapists by the greatest gay marriage activist in Singapore. If you expose this the faggots will report you for exposing their pedophilia normalization and using child rape victim's photos as poster boys for gay pride and just linking to a video about this will get you sued.
put "abcplugspedos" into www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au to see what I mean.

            (compare the description / comments of the video with the caselaw to see what's going on - conclusion gay judged ruled children must enjoy anal sex - because linking to Robert Oscar Lopez a gay family child rape victim's blog post "same sex marriage is child abuse" is hate gay judge confirmed hate speech. In other words child rape victims can't be haters of their child rape, they need to be one with their rapist and boylover or they are deemed outcasts and haters by society and are ordered to pay amends and give money to boylover.org OTO member

            If you link to this video on your blog AND NOTHING ELSE - the newspapers will report you as a gay basher after you were found guilty of hating gay dads baby rape.

             This has actually happened multiple times in court and in the media in Australia
            </strong>
            . The same court also ruled it's a crime to expose Obama's connections to pedophiles who disappear their child rape victims to get off charges:

You'll also get the internal name of their CMS website they use to enter data on incoming tip-offs. Could be useful for those who want to gain access to such a system.

             OK but you can't have me on without exposing pedophilia normalization of the gay elite and Australian gay judges saying it is hate speech to speak proven facts about Obama's connections to Pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             To love gay rights is to love pedophilia, that's the argument I'll be making with conclusive proof. For god sake the founder of the US gay rights movement American children are forced to study with Californian Bill SB 48 is Harry Hay who has his own NAMBLA fan page and worse.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1863343">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1863343
             </a>
             If the founder of gay rights in America is a Nambla meeting goer on camera, nambla shirt wearer on Camera, Nambla meeting toast maker on Camera, how can you separate gay rights from pedophilia. Put simply you can't.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Obama says on Camera I am friends with Terry Bean gay child rapist, it is a crime of an Australian citizen to point that out because you can't speak the truth when it comes to gays and pedophilia. In my dad's case the gay judge Truth isn't relevant to the defense of insulting the elite gays, it's weather they are offended or triggered. If gays dont' want their leadership exposed raping kids, then you must now accept and tolerate their leadership raping kids. That's what the buzzword tolerance actually means. All the proof to what I just said is here in only 2 paragraphs - rubbing it in. When a demographic that are 30-40 times more likely to rape kids are given first pick of the litter by gay foster carer agencies like lwb.org.au already a large number of children have been raped. But it's PC rape because it's hate speech to expose what's going on or the medical studies that prove that from the US library of Congress / US CDC etc.

             A link to a short summary of my dad being found guilty of hating state media praise gay dads doing federal government facilitated human trafficking of babies for sex. You could also have my dad on if Tom Cahill isn't on with us because those too are at odds (for just reason). Here is his interview about being being sued (now found guilty) of the crime of not published loving gay marriages activist Russian infant anal rape and being a fellow boylover.org member like the gay judge. I still talk to my dad because he gives good intel, like Garry Burns wrote a letter saying he knows the judge is gay is what I found out yesterday.

             Just so you have the heads up, Jews and Homosexuals will be vilified for the sake of fighting paedophilia normalization. We need to put the rights of the child above the PC crowd. That's what I'll be doing.

I have been exceptionally busy today, but am now in a position to respond to your emails.


1) I can offer you a show at 9AM U.S. Eastern time, in a couple of weeks or so.  I take it the subject matter would be satanic child abuse. I haven't heard from Tom, so I am unsure if he wants to join us on the show or not.


2) I will need your Skype ID, please send a contact request to

3) Whilst I appreciate satanic child abuse is an emotive subject, I have two rules for my show, no profanity, and no threats against individuals or racial groups.


If all the above is okay with you, and you can clarify the situation regarding Tom, I look forward to offering you a date in the next few days.


Best Wishes,

               well i had alarm bells going off with these pricks 1800THELOST aka NCMEC they way they behaved with me just for putting up a the same photo of a gay dads child rape victim ( well a link to it anyway) hosted by the most famous gay marriage activist in Singapore "Alex Au" who was just prosecuted by the Singapore Government here:

               I guess you are a bad person if you expose gay rights activists using child rape victims uncensored photo as a poster boy for the child rapist's cause. Just google Mark Newton and Peter Truong and see what comes up. The ABC is trying to take down the Australian taxpayer documentary on it everywhere off youtube now with copyright claims because in the documentary "the boy with the henna tattoo" they say published gay rights activists raping babies has nothing to do with the gay marriage debate - at the every end of this video
