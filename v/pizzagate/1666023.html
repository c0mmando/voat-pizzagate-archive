<p>Cases with truly horrifying chats have been lumped in with chats that show no evidence of any sexual intent, the nationwide network\'s enormous online audience never knowing the difference.</p>
<p>Critics say the group doesn\'t understand the law, and may be motivated less by a pursuit of justice than a pursuit of fame and social media reach, which can lead to money.

<p>More at article about how it goes wrong so please take a look.  Hard to tell if this is justifiable concern or pushback against activists, but the dangers of mob justice can be real, and can interfere with police investigations.  But if the police are doing NOTHING, then this is what inevitably happens.   Discuss.</p>
<p>Also  W5\'s Creep Out will be broadcast Sat., Feb., 18 at 7 p.m. local time, if you are in Canada might be worth a look.</p>',
