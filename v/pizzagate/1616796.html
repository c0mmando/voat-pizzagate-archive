            The Netherlands was probably the first country to use traditions of pedophilia as blackmail operations against power players. Its early acceptance of homosexuality must have played a role here, since exposure of it hasn't carried the scandal it did and often still does in many countries, since at least WWII.

            Also, the Netherlands is indeed a nexus of elites (former world center of financial power, invaded the UK just before its meteoric rise, earliest Western settlers in the US), so the tradition of pedophilia runs strong there. Ex-SS-er Prince Bernhard, founder of Bilderberg, was a scoundrel, a pervert and a fraud - and EVERYBODY knew. Even his wife the queen.

            Laurentein's Brinkhorst sister-in-law Mabel Wisse Smith is a Tavistock/CIA agent who infiltrated the highest echelons of Dutch Mafia before traveling to Bosnia to work for Soros, ending up back home marrying the current King's brother - who became comatose after a bizarre skiing accident and has been euthanized last year.

            The Dutch judiciary and DoJ have been infiltrated by pedos long ago. Many instances of high level judges and DAs involved in child porn and worse. Myriad Dutroux connections. Also, the general secretary of the Justice Department for more than a decade was a known pedophile and (highly) suspected child molester.

            The Netherlands is, again, a nexus of this and many other deep rooted evils in the Western world. And its fake royal family - it was the first Republic of name in the Western world and the US Declaration of Independence can be traced almost literally to the Dutch text two centuries before) - has been at the apex of it all.

            If it weren't for the staggering works of art and genius there, it's probably better off nuked.

             Being Dutch, I have to shamefully admit that you are probably right. Not about the nuking though. Please consider how the average Dutch civilian literally has no f
             <em>
              cking clue that this is going on in his own country, and that Prince Bernhard is one of the sleaziest pieces of sh
             </em>
             t ever to crawl out of the sewer. For example, the case you mention about the high-ranking official at the DoJ (his name is Joris Demmink), is completely unknown to Dutch Joe Average. If you talk to people about this, they look at you as if you're insane. They simply cannot comprehend such gross injustice is allowed to continue in our over-regulated and over-legislated little country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the Dutch Royal family is still held in high regard, despite the many many scandals they are involved in. This has a lot to with they way they managed to "frame" themselves after WW2. Especially Prince Bernhard managed to sell himself as a great hero of the Dutch resistance, when in fact he acted as a spy on behalf of the Germans, betrayed the battle at Arnhem (you know, the one in 'A Bridge Too Far'), and it has been rumored for decades that there exists a letter he wrote to Hitler, offering him to arrange a full merger of the Netherlands with Germany, provided he would be allowed to act as governor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even though the Dutch are mostly unaware of any of this,
             <em>
              should
             </em>
             this story break, and
             <em>
              should
             </em>
             it turn out how the Dutch elite has set this up, and how they are still playing a major role in all of this, I can assure you there will be hell to pay for those involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thing is, the average Dutchman doesn't like pretentiousness, and doesn't like the idea of "an elite", of a group of people pretending to be "elevated" over all else. The average Dutchie considers himself a decent, upstanding, God-fearing citizen, and we only tolerate "the elite" as long as they show themselves to be like us: modest, law-abiding, frugal and socially concerned taxpayers. History has proven that should this trust be violated, the anarchistic side of the Dutch will rise up and burn, without any consideration for status or privilege, anything that offends them.
            </p>
            <p>
             So hold back on the nukes for now; blow this case wide open, and leave it to the Dutch to organize some ruthless precision cleansing.
