<p>SUMMARY: <em>So this post by <a href="https://voat.co/user/tyfdt">@tyfdt</a>   kicked off the latest round of Epstein and US Virgin Islands scrutiny</em> : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2562859">Pedo Island Pics dropping on 8 chan</a> </p>
<p><em>Seems that after that earthquake Jeff is up to a spot of reconstruction on his island Little St. James as the pictures in the 8chan link show.  An article about construction on his other island Grand St James island highlights how busy Jeff is at the moment. I\'m sure he\'s tickled pink by his Little and Big acquisitions. But I digress..</em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, changes are afoot with that intriguing Virgin Islands pizza yacht business <strong><a href="https://www.pizza-pi.com/">Pizza Pi</a></strong> which was discussed at length here about a year ago.  Looking at the owners of that business takes us back to Wall Street and George Soros..</em></p>

<p><strong>Owners: Alexander Sasha Bouis and Tara Bouis (nee Chaille)</strong></p>
<p>Some information on their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Captain Sasha &quot;The Brain&quot; graduated from MIT, worked on Wall Street</strong> &amp; threw it all away to become a sailboat captain.  One of his most charming traits is sounding like he knows what he\'s talking about, then backing it up with something half-baked and totally impressive.  His most recent bluff-and-make-it work was the design and layout of every system on board Pi.</p>
<p><strong>Chef Tara &quot;The Brawn&quot; was a special education teacher in Indiana</strong>, paid for culinary training in cases of Guinness, moved to the islands to be a scuba instructor &amp; is now an award-winning yacht chef.  She\'s an expert at biting off more than she can chew.  Designing the layout of the entire boat, and then building it herself took it to a new level.  She also looks good handling a range of power tools in a bikini.  </p>

<p>Well, if we look at <a href="http://archive.is/Td9mh">Sasha Bouis\' CV</a> we might see why- he\'s worked for <strong>Standard &amp; Poor\'s Financial Services</strong> LLC, graduated from MIT and still seems to be employed by <strong>George Soros</strong> at the Soros Foundation as an \'IT Guru\': </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and Donald Trump used to privately dine with Epstein at his NY apartment. Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon <strong>Leon Black [Apollo Global]</strong>, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level investment manager.   </p>

<p>Then I found this video about Pizza Pi:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8-A791hWz64">PIZZA PI — The best pizza of the caribbean — Sailing Uma</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>So that\'s a doorway to what I wonder?  <strong>Googling Uma\'s Angels led me to this odd instagram account</strong> which also has images of Trump <a href="https://www.instagram.com/umasangels/">https://www.instagram.com/umasangels/</a></p>
<p>Buzzfeed even wrote about it: <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/someone-appears-to-have-stolen-this-womans-photos-and-is-usi?utm_term=.pfzm4kxNq#.ok0P9A1Bo">Someone Appears To Have Stolen This Woman\'s Photos And Is Using Them To Troll People</a></p>
<p>Uma Kompton has a Youtube channel with a bunch of weird videos like this one: <a href="https://youtu.be/ATumvsKHCaQ">https://youtu.be/ATumvsKHCaQ</a></p>

            2003 Vanity Fair Article on Jeffrey Epstein - extreme foreshadowing
           </a>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Oh, and Donald Trump used to privately dine with Epstein at his NY apartment. Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon
            <strong>
             Leon Black [Apollo Global]
            </strong>
            , former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level investment manager.

            Wow "Billionaire Jeffery Epstein, who owns nearby Little St. James, reportedly purchased the larger island earlier this year." from the 'construction...' link, The Source, St. Thomas. November 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently Grand St. James belongs to a Dane, Christian Kjaer, or at least did back in 2015:
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's strange this linked site hasn't been updated since early 2016. It would be even stranger if Epstein has owned the bigger island for years, open knowledge locally, but that hasn't been discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I posted the above link here a 'dog year' ago, that Kjaer owns it,and no one commented otherwise.

            Here's another funny Trump connection:
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein's former friend and business partner, Steven Hoffenberg, got sent to federal prison in 1993 for 18 years in a Ponzi scheme that bilked investors out of 460 million dollars.He has paid back only 200 million but in 2016 he was on the news announcing a pro Trump PAC of $50 million. In 2014 he was based out of Shanghai, doing the same business (debt collection) and offering to school "outside" businessman in the respectful Chinese way of doing business. He got married in 2014 and posed in front of the Trump Towers.

            Here's another funny Trump connection:
           </p>
           <p>
            According to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by VANITY FAIR, Epstein may have good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze his assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward: Hoffenberg does only 10 years, not 20, pays back 60 million, not 450 million AND in 2016 is saying he's going to put together a PAC supporting Trump to the tune of 50 million dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2014 he's based out of Shanghai, in the same kind of business that got him in trouble in the US: debt collection.
I guess China appreciates Hoffenberg's business model.
           </p>
           <p>
            "12) Towers Investors China offers sales consulting to executives from outside of mainland China with the very deep rooted respect mandated understanding and full-time, non-stop training in how one must behave in business in mainland China. MULTI-NATIONAL EXECUTIVES MUST BE TRAINED BY TOWERS INVESTORS CHINA TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT MAINLAND CHINA."

               I don't give a shit if you disagree with someone,  when you demonize &amp; assert ALL women are weak or ALL brown people are villians, i want to smack you upside your head .Should all white males be judged by Joe Whiteboy Bidens actions  ?
The problem is that a book, the Talmud, teaches its ok 1.to be racist 2.homicidal. &amp; 3.rape children,  the solution would be to target that fact, the Bible has some really questionable things in it too,  guessing but the Koran probably needs a looking at also.We get that your sexist and racist , you spew it ad nauseum &amp; it gets really old.
You never answered a question from a year or so ago, do you belong to a racist org. or are you independent ?

                if the stats say that 90% of white women who get impregnated by black men are abandoned, is it racist to oppose your daughter dating a black man? I sincerely hope it happens to yours, as some people only learn the hard way.

                   Another reason they claim to be BOTH a religion and a race is because when , someone like me disdains Judaism (because of the racist/homicidal/pedophiliac Jewish text The Talmud), Im called a racist, which im not. It's trickery at its best , Semite is not defined as Jew yet anti Semite means anti Jew ?

                   So you agree with Jews, your a Soros Antifa shill who can't think for himself, Hitler borrowed money from Zionist bankers and murdered 94 million non Jews or Goyim, if you look closely you'll find that the 6 gorillian poor jews he supposedly killed actually were relocated to Palestine. You live in a fallacy &amp; need to start thinking for yourself,  Christianity is not a race , neither is Islam or Buddhism so Judaism canbot be a race either, its how they fool themselves  into thinking they are an elevated "race" &amp; others are not.
What racist org. do you belong to ? You do know the KKK was started by a Zionist, right ?

                    Wow, really dumb fucking woman.  There are religions that are universalist and those that aren't.  LMAO how is that difficult to understand? YOU CAN IMMIGRATE TO ISRAEL WITH JEWISH BLOOD NOT JEWISH FAITH.

                   <p>
                    Still proving my point, women will want to further redefine the guilty class of Jews because they cannot accept collective punishment and nothing will ever happen.

                     So you believe Judaism is BOTH a religion AND a race, how interesting. Why don't you get a fucking clue , thats like saying all white people are Christians , there are Israeli's (a "race") &amp; those who PRACTICE the RELIGION of JUDAISM,  a "Jew" is someone who practices said religion.
You've been fooled by their propoganda troll &amp;  still haven't answered ,  WHAT hate group do you belong to , or do you have no pride in it ?

                      oh my god, the MAJORITY of Christians are NON-WHITE today.  because its a UNIVERSAL religion unlike Judaism which doesn't proselytize.  stop pretending you care which quality unites this group: YOU ARE AGAINST GROUP PUINISHMENT therefore no action can be taken against this vast Jewish network.

                    Another reason they claim to be BOTH a religion and a race is because when , someone like me disdains Judaism (because of the racist/homicidal/pedophiliac Jewish text The Talmud), Im called a racist, which im not. It's trickery at its best , Semite is not defined as Jew yet anti Semite means anti Jew ?

             I remember Schlong/Donkey.  The reason I ask a question is actually a writer's trick/hook which helps people to engage or interact with a post.  Psychology.  It's a reason I don't draw conclusions on posts.  If you do that it stops many people from thinking through facts for themselves.  There.. now one of my secrets is out.

              THE REAL PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
"In this lively debut work of history, Edward Kritzler tells the tale of an unlikely group of swashbuckling Jews who ransacked the high seas in the aftermath of the Spanish Inquisition. At the end of the fifteenth century, many Jews had to flee Spain and Portugal. The most adventurous among them took to the seas as freewheeling outlaws. In ships bearing names such as the Prophet Samuel, Queen Esther, and Shield of Abraham, they attacked and plundered the Spanish fleet while forming alliances with other European powers to ensure the safety of Jews living in hiding. Filled with high-sea adventures–including encounters with Captain Morgan and other legendary pirates–Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean reveals a hidden chapter in Jewish history as well as the cruelty, terror, and greed that flourished during the Age of Discovery."
I have this. Lots of info. This is the history that is left out of the text books.

               Port Royal, (described as a wicked place by all), was the main pirate town, before it slid into the sea in an earthquake. People of the times said that god had stricken them from the face of the Earth.The most expensive part of Naples, Florida is named after it. The Jewfish was named so because they were trading the fish possibly, while others maintain that it was the size of the fish in comparison to the wealth of the jews.
