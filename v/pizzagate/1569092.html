              your source is also in french which I don't speak.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               PARIS Bruno Mouron and Pascal Rostain, former photographers of the magazine Paris-Match, make the event today in Paris, with the exhibition Trash, visible until 3 June at the European House of Photography. The program: photos of the ... dustbins of the stars! The two Frenchmen began by taking an interest in the detritus of their famous compatriots (Brigitte Bardot, Bernard Tapie, Yannick Noah, Gérard Depardieu) before heading to Hollywood.
              </p>
              <p>
               The idea of ​​making these particular clichés was born at the end of the 80s, "after reading an article in the World evoking the experience of a professor of sociology," says Bruno Mouron. To study the consumer society, this teacher had his students collect contents of garbage. Mouron and Rostain decided to do the same with the stars. "They are real portraits," says Mouron. "The best portrait I ever made of Jack Nicholson is his trash."
              </p>
              <p>
               These photographs were widely published in the international press of the 90s and are now under glass at the Maison de la photographie in Paris. The two companions avoid exposing any object related to what is medical and sexual. "The principle was not to denounce".
              </p>
              <p>
               And we learn some good about the people. But certain accepted ideas are also verified. For example, Jack Nicholson adores champagne: his trash is full of bottles of bottles, while Madonna, as a great sportsman she is, drinks water, mainly from brands Evian and Volvic. More interesting ... In the trash of Tom Cruise, the two photographers fell on a typewritten list, more than one hundred articles, which the actor absolutely claims in his box when he is on the move. This goes from the milk bottle of such a brand to the very accurate pair of socks.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2004, the two paparazzi fell on a receipt showing that Charlize Theron, the Oscar-winning heroine of Monster, had spent less than $ 3,450 on his last trip to Gucci. John Travolta, in the same year, taking advantage of his star status, had brought a pizza ... from Chicago by the Fed Ex courier service to Los Angeles! When one loves, one does not count! In Mel Gibson's garbage bin, at the end of '90, there were a lot of children's toys and quoted queries.
              </p>
              <p>
               Today, both photographers have expanded their research. If they are still interested in people (they were looking for Polnareff's detritus in Limoges), they have been investigating strangers for two years, with the intention of studying the garbage 42 countries. They have not finished talking about them ...
              </p>

             <p>
              I'm not saying it's not interesting. especially the part of that article right after where you left off they say there are childrens toys in the garbage bin. Which seems completely unrelated and odd to include at that part if it isn't talking about pedophilia. But you didn't include those parts. That combined with huge leaps in logic caused me to delete your post. I'm not sure if you worded poorly due to english not being your primary language as well. If you need help with wording to repost please let me know.
