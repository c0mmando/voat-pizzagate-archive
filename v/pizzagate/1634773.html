Human leather is produced from skin sourced from normal everyday people.  These people have bequeathed their skin to us prior to their death.  There are a few areas of the body, (back and abdomen) that have uninterrupted skin coverage, and are therefore the best for processing into human leather.

<p>Then whilst searching online, for an interview I had read months ago, with a LA based Middle Eastern origin designer who used human skin in his collection (unfortunately I couldn’t find the interview again) I came across an article about Oprah endorsing SkinMedica TNS Recovery Complex which allegedly contains fibroblasts sourced from human foreskins.  SkinMedica say they grew fibroblasts from only one foreskin.  So, I looked for the SkinMedica product INCI (ingredient listing) I could find their eye product INCI and sure enough 2nd ingredient is Human Fibroblast Conditioned Medium.

            CANNIBALISM PRACTICES BY THE ELITES:
Did anyone catch from the interview with the Hamstead children. About the satanic cult given meat to local MC DONALDS!!
Is it that hard to believe that the restaurants connected to this are serving human meat? Can we investigate this?
- If this satanic creeps use children for abuse and rituals, what more don´t we know?

            They staged a major "women's march" on DC to try to brand Trump as a woman-hater, they're funding violent demonstrations in Berkeley and NYU. They are sending out celebrities to suggest Trump be impeached, removed in a military coup, or assassinated. They're not settling down after an election. They're attacking Trump as though the campaign was still ongoing. They're resisting Trump's nominees beyond what's normal. The media has created "fake news" to try to brand Pizzagate revelations as fake. They're sending in a guy to shoot up Comet Pizza to try to blame Pizzagate investigators as unhinged, and then having him "realize" that nothing was going on there and it was all just "fake news." They're having media coverage of Pizzagate that omits the relevant key facts and makes up new fanciful facts no Pizzagaters are alleging. They're getting Twitter, Reddit, and other sites to block and ban Pizzagate conversations. They're making fools of themselves blaming Trump's win on Russian interference and warning that maybe Putin planted child porn on some of their computers. They seem to me to be to freaking out.

            Stem cell skincare products are big business today. Any link to Denis Solvay, owner of the Belgium Mother of Darkness castle where the worlds Illuminati go for the sickest of sick and vile satanic rituals and child hunting parties? Rumoured to kill one child every day under the million stars altar shit in the backyard. Solvay is a pharmaceutical giant. Just SICK.

            Are you really thinking this through?  blocking a twitter account can hardly be classed as "panic".  The Democrates "filibuster" didn't even last the full alloted time.  More of a weak display than anything related to painc.

            My 95 year old grandmother is a skin graft/ foreskin recipient. She had a wound that would not heal, as well as poor circulation.  I always assumed it healed due to the stem cells that newborn babies have.

            is that what the "RED SHOES" are all about with the Soros pictures ?
Not sure where I saw them ?
One with his son and some girl? 
One with Soros and a bunch of guys all wearing the red shoes ?
all sporting a sinister smile

             In so glad u brought this up I meant to reference it in the text.   I did wonder if the red shoes could be human skin with a dye to disguise them.

              Human skin that is removed by a cadaver is said to take on the color of smoked salmon.  I'm just throwing this out there, but that certainly is a reddish color.  I haven't seen the red shoe pictures though to say if they looked dyed though.

            So I have watched HOURS of footage from the interviews of the children (they each had 3 sets of interviews). And then I watched the "interview" with that sick fuck Ricky Dearman, who, by the way, is the world's WORST actor (it's a fucking joke that he refers to himself as an actor) and I would bet my fucking LIFE on the fact that the kids' allegations were based on truth, and Ricky is a sick fucking piece of shit ritualistic child abuser and child trafficker. I don't have time to find references right now, but some google searching will turn up his involvement with some weird ass cult from Korea (if I'm remembering that correctly), and also with an organization called "Luv4Haiti" or something like that. Put the pieces together and it will all make sense. Alisa and Gabriel's mom and stepdad are no saints - I believe they are quite brainwashed in some sort of vegan cult thing - however, I do NOT believe they are involved in sexual abuse or child trafficking, and I do NOT think the allegations were total fabrications.

             Now it’s very easy to source plastic surgery leftovers (i.e. under eye bags, face lifts etc.) which would contain fibroblasts, so not sure what special benefits would be in foreskin fibroblasts over facial fibroblasts.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In most parts of the United States, circumcision is the complete norm at hospitals for newborns, so it might have been easier to obtain foreskins rather than plastic surgery leftovers.

             Hitler's eugenics is based on Margaret Sanger's teachings. After the Nazi defeat eugenics bacame a dirty word and the globalists changed it to Planned Parenthood. It never stopped, just like MK Ultra, or Joseph Mengele's horror experiments (Film Human Centepede is said to be based on one of his later experiments when he escapes to Argentina). They are all thiving underground. Podesta and Alifantis got way too careless and now they are in a panic mode with Jeff Sessions sworn in. Still, I believe they will stage a false flag as a distruction. They know that public will not stomach what is about to come out.

             I believe you're right, it never left. They went underground with it until a new generation Came along forgot the first hand horrors and had time for the indoctrination programs in school to kick in. I actually was taught in school that communism is a wonderful thing, but that people corrupted it!

              The concepts of communism are a wonderful thing but human nature is completely contrary to it. We aren't ants or bees and never will be. This is basically what communism is - hive mentality. Therefore, communism will never work for us. Our nature is to grab for power because the more powerful you are the more likely you are to survive. This is why capitalism works so well for humans. But in a communist society, when that power grab happens people die. Usually it happens on a small scale at first but becomes necessarily larger and larger in scale when more and more people rise against. Ultimately, human nature makes communism evil.  Human nature makes individualism and individual rights successful.
             </p>
             <p>
              tl:dr :  Communism is only wonderful if you are an ant or a bee.
