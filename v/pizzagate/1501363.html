            The sad and simple truth is that most of the people in this world are FUCKING DUMB. Like, insanely, uneducated, other-worldly, wretched, low IQ, inbred DUMB FUCKS. I cannot say it enough. To be honest, if I was part of the world's elite, I'd want a major population cull too. Ignorance may be bliss, but some people are so fucking stupid that it it amazes me they can get out of bed in the morning and function. Im not talking about folks that are not open minded enough to acknowledge phenomena such as Pizzagate or a point of view not gleaned from MSM. Im literally talking fucking STUPID; a waste of oxygen, time, resources, energy and money. And don't fucking lie. The majority of you completely agree with me.

             Not in all society in the world are same-same as the USA slave/penal colony, one simply travels until one finds a safe spot, the world is a big place there are many cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not every place is like the USA addicted to Kardashian TV, and fast food poisoning, lots of good places have no cops, where infant toddlers crawl with no threat of molestation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Problem here is the USA model, a failed penal colony from 1600's to civil war, fields slaves to factory slaves to desk slaves, now with automation (AI) most humans are un-needed in the colony's ( Say USA), again PPL 80% of USA population to be culled by 2025, bail early or die, its your fate.

            Our Galactic friends won't be letting that happen, the dark were only allowed to do as they have done for a certain amount of time and that time is pretty much at an end, as the divine plan has said so. Everything only seems in utter chaos atm because it is the years of negativity reaching boiling point and making itself be seen to all, only to clear that and start with the New. It will all be over in the next few months and we will be able to live a peaceful life as intended by divine plan. Our Galactic friends will make themselves seen also within the coming months. Anything promoting the destruction of the planet is just the Cabals last ditch effort in keeping us in fear but it can't and won't last. People need not be afraid, as everything that is going on all has its purpose to clear and make way for the New Earth, we need not fear anymore, we are past that point, 2017 will be the greatest time that Planet Earth has ever witnessed. Keep your heads high and know that joy and peace is just around the corner.

             I have known quite a few elite 'billionaires familys' in my day, a recurring theme is they plan, out 10 generations to make sure their great-great-grand-children don't have to starve or fail.
            </p>
            <p>
             The poor live day 2 day, hour 2 hour
            </p>
            <p>
             The elite worry about losing their power &amp; wealth100 years from now, or ten generations from now.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             This is the difference between elite and poor
            </p>
            <p>
             Once you understand this mindset, then perhaps you will see how they see.

             I think that all men/women should be free, so long as they don't harm others.

             Fact is 99% of humanity 'struggle their entire' lives and never have time to look around, hell Emerson and Thoreau wrote about this 100+ years ago.

             "Good" relative BULLSHIT I have  many good dogs, but I also know that under any condition a dog can go into "FEAR MODE" and bite, then good dog becomes bad dog, and must die. IMHO talking about "GOOD PEOPLE" don't mean shit, your just talking about somebody who ain't been busted or caught. All humans are potential bombs.

             The core of PIZZAGATE is accounting for the 8 million missing children. This IS BAD to have 8 million missing children, and nobody seems to care, ahhh ignorance you say, good-people just don't know thanks to the MSM.
            </p>
            <p>
             People make a choice whether to be IGNORANT &amp; HAPPY, and Knowledgeable and Un-Happy, those of us study our entire lives know all too well that our friends and relatives consider us weird or strange, just like the MARK of cain&amp;abel.
            </p>
            <p>
             "GOOD PEOPLE" are 'good sheep', or 'good dogs', but the kennel master knows all too well that 'good' could go 'bad' in an instant.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I think we come together on pizzagate to resolve this issue of 8 million missing children, its certainly a BIG ENOUGH problem to flush the toilet on world GOV, but then again, PEDO is a problem as old as humanity, most cultures fucked children that couldn't get pregnant.
            </p>

             Look at donald trump he ASS-FUCKED little girls for years looking for whore to feed his casinos, he didn't want to damage the goods vaginally as people pay big money for intact HYMEN,
            </p>
            <p>
             TRUMP is 100% mafia, look how PPL defend him here, and then talk about "GOOD", they will not even look at Trump's history just apply negative voats to make it go away.

             There are no good people, everyone has the potential to be a monster.

             Society created religion to solve this problem where the sheep could believe in GOD and follow the good book ( yet note the entire bible is about rape, torture, and mutilation )

             We all want change, but is like the "Batman Movie", "I told you I would take you places, ... I never said they were good places"

             GOOD? for whom?
            </p>
            <p>
             IMHO largely pizzagate was created to selectively take out opposition to the TRUMP MAFIA, so they could have a free rein in redesigning the USA,
            </p>
            <p>
             Note this is what they did in NYC, GIULIANI took out the Italian mafia, and now NYC is 100% Talmud mafia, TRUMP intends to do that for all of the USA and maybe the world

               Not every place is like the USA addicted to Kardashian TV, and fast food poisoning, lots of good places have no cops, where infant toddlers crawl with no threat of molestation.

               Problem here is the USA model, a failed penal colony from 1600's to civil war, fields slaves to factory slaves to desk slaves, now with automation (AI) most humans are un-needed in the colony's ( Say USA), again PPL 80% of USA population to be culled by 2025, bail early or die, its your fate.
