Saying how the Masons either take one shoe off (willingness to participate) or both shoe\'s off (fully comitted) to whatever it is their doing surely this all ties in??</p>
<p>Like this photo from the Wesminster &quot;attack&quot;  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mskFl">http://imgur.com/a/mskFl</a>
First of all, 
                #1 They are missing one shoe
                #2  Whats going on with the cop holding the machine gun and his right foot? Why is his leg 10in shorther than the other?
                #3   Does it look like there\'s cropping at the bottom of the guys back pack who\'s attending the &quot;victim&quot;?
                       Recrangle like cut out near the &quot;cops&quot; foot?
                #4   WTF is the guy in the glasses doing? If the area is locked down then why is he just standing there,
                        looking like he shouldn\'t  be there? And is his jacket almost blending with the road?
                #5    The person that\'s an apparent &quot;victim&quot; is missing ONE shoe 
                #6   This picture shows a red paramedics bag where the first shows a green one? <a href="http://imgur.com/a/b8KD2">http://imgur.com/a/b8KD2</a></p>
<p>And finally here\'s some more pictures from the same incident with people missing shoes-</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/HZiOT">http://imgur.com/a/HZiOT</a> One shoe
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/H77JO">http://imgur.com/a/H77JO</a> No shoes lol
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/qjMAF">http://imgur.com/a/qjMAF</a> One or two shoes off</p>
<p>Also i\'ve tied to g@@gle the name of the taxi in the first pic, either Len\'s, Leni\'s or Lenis and haven\'t had any luck so if anyone can find that company please comment, thanks!</p>

            That is an ad on the side of the taxi - not the taxi firm.

            Could be KEK trying to send a message [that it is a staged event with models] but so could the shoes  [that it was a staged event by masons].  Depends on whether you subscribe to "the Universe" - or whatever - communicating by meaningful coincidence - Were the Romans and the augurs right to inspect chicken innards? - and was it for the right reasons?
           </p>
           <p>
            In  the red bag shot you can see a [probably the]  "leni's" taxi approaching - so that will give you say 10-20 seconds between shots.  Maybe try and contact the photographer and ask to see his whole series - he is either an independent witness or a plant.  It could be there are two bags there, one red, one green but one in each pic is obscured by a person.
           </p>

            I've been exposed to the idea of false flags enough to suspect that things are not always as they seem.

            Red shoes on men is certainly odd, but shoes being knocked off victims of high-impact bodily injuries is not unusual at all.
