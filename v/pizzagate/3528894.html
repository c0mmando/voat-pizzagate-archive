<p>the Democratic party, is involved in a tryst by one of their leaders. He’s living 2 lives; by day a ‘Congressman’ and a ‘family man’ and by night, drug induced party time in West Hollywood. Officially, Schiff is under investigation, see the summary from truepundit.com:</p>
<p>Adam Schiff is now the target of a federal investigation focused on his  trips to Ed Buck’s ‘drug house,’ Buck is a high-profile, millionaire Democratic  who has contributed  large amounts of cash to Democrats including Schiff, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, etc. Larry Nichols is the DC insider and operator. Bill Clinton described Nichols as a dangerous man. Clinton would know because Nichols spearheaded many of Clinton’s political black-bag Ops. </p>
<p>…...…..federal agents have traced Congressman Schiff at Buck’s drug mansion over a dozen times . And now they want to know what Schiff was doing there. “(AG William) Barr is looking into why Adam Schiff was at Buck’s place 16 times,. “The reason Barr is obligated to look , is because  if he saw any illegal activity, he is obligated by law to report it. “And if he didn’t report it, then he is guilty of a crime.” Two men previously died at Buck’s mansion from drug overdoses. Finally, Buck was charged in Sept. with running a drug house and doping up victims and then allegedly acting out his  sexual fantasies on the incapacitated victims.  Jeffery Dahmner. Buck targeted homeless men.</p>
<p>This is about human trafficking, and who knows what else. All we know is what evidence the police found and reported. </p>
<p>It’s clear why Schiff is leading the Impeachment coup publicly, because the Democrat strategy has been the old “Accuse your opponent of what you are guilty of, and the public will be confused” – We want to reference another 2 sites of interest – Rense.com   and InfoWars.com now operating banned. video (Alex Jones has matured a lot in the last 2 years!) See a photograph as example:</p>
<p>…... if they all knew he was a pedo psycho, why did Democrats continue to take Bucks money? they were close friends. And why does one make friends with Person A instead of Person B? The answer would be common grounds. Bingo!  He has donated “nearly $30k to Democratic candidates like H.Clinton, T. Lieu, P.Aguilar, A. Schiff, and Raja Krishnamoorthi as well as the Getting Things Done PAC.</p>
<p>In civil lawsuits, Buck has been named as a human trafficker, rapist, and performing strange and nearly ‘ritualistic’ acts on homeless men  . Does this sound familiar? Spirit cooking anyone?  this is what the police concluded: </p>
<p>An influential gay Democratic donor who has been linked to multiple overdose-related deaths of vulnerable black gay men in his  home was arrested after yet another man overdosed in his home . The LA County DA Office said Ed Buck, was charged with felony counts of battery causing serious injury, administering meth, and maintaining a drug house after he allegedly injected a man with meth. Schiff is a puppet and like all puppets he has a weak spot. How Pedostein’s blackmail worked was obvious, as is the gay drug den.</p>
<p>Schiff has his own Ukraine military contract that he’s been working on for awhile now.  According to Fox News:</p>
<p>House Intelligence Com Chairman A. Schiff,  is facing questions about his own connection to a Soviet-born businessman who has raised money for his campaign and whose company has received lucrative defense contracts from Ukraine’s government. </p>
<p>when the Maidan Revolution erupted in Ukraine, he went back to Ukraine and started cultivating ties with the defense industry there. At that point, as is obvious from the document announcing the 2013 fundraiser, Pasternak was already giving aid and comfort to Adam Schiff.,. </p>
<p>Now there’s Ed Buck, reportedly a pervert with a “thing” for getting young black male prostitutes high through date-rape drugs and involuntary meth injections, with a second dead body turning up in one of his apartments yesterday. The first death a year and a half ago resulted in the cops letting it be called an “accidental” overdose, as gay and lesbian activists argued something worse seemed to be happening. There certainly were cries that Buck was let off easy because of his $53,000 in political donations to Democrats…. Since Schiff is so loud about wanting to “Get Trump,” maybe it’s time for him to start answering some questions about this most important of his campaign donors and why he has allowed himself to go into political debt to such a person.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve examined the facts, let’s take a look at one last anomaly and chatter on the dark web. A helicopter crashed with owners of the Standard Hotel where apparently tons of bad things happened, so the witnesses were killed ‘in an accident’ (these guys know you have to make it look like an accident!) </p>
<p>Schiffs district and dark web says the Standard hotels owners were on the copter. Dark web said the helicopter people had dirt on schiff in secret meetings in the hotel. -Qanon</p>
<p>Here are a list of references to the strange things that go on in the standard hotel, including a stint by none other than Harvey Weinstein THIS LINK HAS MANY REFERENCES AND IS A GOOD RESOURCE .</p>
<p>But we are not the first to out Schiff as a Pedo-dupe. Jerome Corsi did it first:</p>
<p>Adam Schiff may be being blackmailed over alleged involvement in pedophilia. Corsi has recently dedicated himself full-time to covering the postings of an anonymous 8Chan forum . Corsi alleged that Schiff had ties to three people who died in a recent helicopter crash, all of whom were “associated with the Standard Hotel, a trendy, gay-friendly hotel located in Schiff’s district in West Hollywood, California.” Offering absolutely no evidence to substantiate anything he said, Corsi reported that “a pedophilia ring” was being run out of this hotel and now “you’ve got Schiff being involved, perhaps, with blackmail, there is possibly pedophilia.</p>
<p>So we know that the deep-state is tied to the Occult. If Schiff does have something dirty to hide or a secret predilection of Chocolate, this would be a legitimate reason to use him . He’s likely being blackmailed which explains his irrational behavior. Probably he’s been tasked to ‘get it done, Impeach him – whatever the cost’ or we’re going to let loose all the facts of your dirty secrets. Thank you Nancy.</p>
<p>There is no question that Schiff is Deep-State Owned.</p>

            My opinion, based on observation: Something’s very wrong with Schiff and I notice it every time I see him in media. Schiff is robotic in his demeanor, and always appears to be talking to someone offstage, not connecting with listeners at all. His weird, almost constant wide-eyed, expression looks past his public audience into the distance. He seems terrified. This has been even more pronounced during the impeachment hearings. He looks and sounds like he’s programmed to repeat certain points in dozens of different ways. As if he’s been programmed. I don’t doubt he’s a Deep-State puppet who has a
            <strong>
             LOT
            </strong>
            to hide.

            People rightly focus on the two murders but for me it just makes me wonder how many men he drugged and raped that simply fled and never spoke out about what happened to them. Did any of them go to the police only to be told no investigation would take place?

             Over the years, how many men and boys died of torture and drug overdoses and were never discovered, perhaps never missed either, as he was dealing with desperate street people?

             Persons like Buck do not come to their strange perversions in their 60s. More likely their 20s or 30s. There already is the blind gossip item that hints at 2 more Buck related deaths in Charlotte in 2 separate hotels around 2012.

            I don't doubt that Barr would like to find dirt on Schiff, but the True Pundit isn't a reliable source, unfortunately.

            In a way it's funny - all the pedos and pedo enablers in both parties trying to smear each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that Schiff just (rightly) called out Jim Jordan for knowing about the sexual abuse at OSU, and keeping his mouth shut.
           </p>
           <p>
            The articles should have mentioned Schiff's involvement with Mark Epstein's Humpty Dumpty Institute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, one of Schiff's buddies, former NBC medical correspondent Hensel, was just arrested for sexting a nine-year-old girl.

            Just a few days ago there was an "insider" on 4chan who claimed Adam Schiff was being investigated for his antics with Ed Buck.

           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I recall a photograph of Adam Schiff in overalls, with Jussie Smollet when Smollet was a very young child.

             Wait, I don't think thats Jussie Smollet. I only have the photo of Schiff with the little black(Haitian?) boy on his knee/crouching down. But from what I remember I dont think the other photo was Jussie. I would've definitely saved that.

             I put a link over on pizzagatewhatever that claims it happened at the Chateau Marmont, not the Standard Hotel, and the witness murdered later in France was Anthony Bourdain. Also the "handler" might have been Ed Buck. Same MO. Don't know if the tale is legit.

            Ed Buck was more than just a Democratic donor himself. He was a bundler, a high-up functionary in political parties, who put together donations from other sources. He was a Hillary elector to the Electoral College.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also this from CDAN:
           </p>
           <p>
            "SATURDAY, JANUARY 12, 2019 Blind Item #4 This serial killer, because lets face it, that is what he is now despite always being referred to as a campaign donor should be asked about the two deaths about six or seven years ago in Charlotte under the same circumstances. The only difference was they occurred a few days apart and in hotel rooms. POSTED BY ENT LAWYER AT 8:45 AM"
           </p>
           <p>
            From the CDAN comments; "OH FFS! The 2012 Democratic National Convention was held in Charlotte from Sept. 4-6. There's the starting point."
