            Or maybe she was just a kid who was kind of ignored by a famous parent and did the whole "well, negative attention is still attention" thing.............though I wouldn't be surprised if she had been abused by some sick movie mogul that stopped by the house

            I'm very surpirsed you didn't include this video of her talking about nipple torture (twisted around three times) and satanic initiation -
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi43MZ-DPH4">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi43MZ-DPH4
            </a>
            This video surfaced just when she separated from Pitt.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wondered if her weird decision to remove her breasts BEFORE she got cancer in them had something to do with them being permanently wounded by this initiation torture, and that she could carry drugs on her person when she went visiting officials in other countries.  She was saying she was going to London to work in the UN or something right before pizzagate broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is more likely Voight was initiated and abused into the system- his Midnight Cowboy breakout movie was about innocence lost, gay hustling and was shocking in its day.

             Has anyone even seen any evidence that she actually had her breasts removed. Thousands of women who went through this procedure proudly showed of their scars on fb and the like but did the one who did it first do it? And didn't Jon Voight release a video about the dangers of soros during the election.

            Good info, but you can't just say that Voight is a very likely spirit cooker.. just because he's successful. If we start saying that it kind of undermines what we are doing, looking for facts.

            Jolie is definitely worth a look though..
