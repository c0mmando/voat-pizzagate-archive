            Prosecutor tried a case on her being a head of a child trafficking ring. Vote was 2-1 for not guilty, quoting the judge who opposed:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “The witness, Gloria Patricia Aldana, never even mentioned the three cases (for which Bailey was charged) in her testimony,” the judge said. “And the Public Ministry didn’t even question her about these.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So, additional to a ring, this is also indirectly related to pizzagate for including possible corruption in the judicial front. Good find, but might end up being a dead end regarding investigations.

            It looks like she really was innocent and maybe someone in government tried to railroad her for less than honorable reasons. If I had to guess I'd say this maybe was like Haiti when even the State Department emails themselves said people need to be on the lookout for pedophiles going there to adopt children. Now we know they didn't want anyone giving child trafficking a bad name.

            It's just like bombing brown people, we don't like anyone cutting in on our action.

             They outlawed foreign adoption in Guatemala in 2007 and she was trafficking kids out of there for profit until 2013 so I don't know that she was so innocent. They get 40,000 for each kid and trafficked thousands of them. I'm pretty sure there were politicians involved which we'll never be able to uncover now.
            </p>
            <p>
             The story helps explain why adoption agencies are closing across the US. Guatemala was number two adoption origin and they outlawed it. Russia outlawed it and that was where they were getting their white babies.

              I don't know either but just look at Laura Silsby and the missionaries that went with her. Who knows what Laura's guilty or innocent of but it looks like maybe she was enticed with money. She had a failing business and was in debt. Maybe she sort of lied to herself. I think the real guilty party is somewhere else and she was left holding the bag. That's kind of how these things work at that level. People are set up all the time. Desperate people take desperate measures.
             </p>
             <p>
              So in Bailey's case maybe she was found innocent because people found out she was the Fall

            Harvard seems to be in full shark jumping mode lately. Harvard-educated intellectual says it would lead to child abuse to not tolerate child abuse by foster families.  Meanwhile, Epstein's buddy Dershowitz is the public face of the law school. Congressional scholar and choom gang member Bathhouse Barry got his law degree there. Barry's sponsor and 9/11 money man Dopey Alwaleed has his own divinity center at the divinity school. Even Anthony Weiner knew that was a bad idea and wrote a letter to Larry Summers.  People pay $60k per year for this?  John Harvard must be spinning in his grave.

            This PRI and al Jazeera were the only ones reporting about this story. They were buying kids and women were having kids just so they could make a few dollars and these people could sell them to Americans. Check out the Harvard quote on the bottom of this next link.
