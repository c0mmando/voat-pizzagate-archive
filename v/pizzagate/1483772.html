<p>&quot;Why don\'t yuoi&quot;?</p>
<p>Yes, I do think it is necessary and absolutely required to form a third party that does not rely on sitting around and waiting and hoping for the best.
Do I have the skill, tools? No, I\'m not tech savvy in the least. I do what I can, which is recruit people who do have the tools and power to take the next step.
If you support this initiative, and have ideas to execute it better, I think you should take responsibility to do so, for example if you think this is not the right place to look for this, tell me where is better, to help me set up this faction. </p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>looking for people who can do some real things to work together anonymously to gather incriminating evidence, digitally or physically, and become a faction that pressures the government to turn itself in and tell what they know. Use the tools they have and organize a strategic party that can really do something diplomatic, instead of sitting and waiting on empty promises and a cover up. They will not surrender and neither should we. We have information, and we need to plan to do something with it. I just know there are people on here who can do something.</p>

             I think the idea is clear by now. It's a front for a global elite pedophile market, which, the closer you look, connects to other rings and different illegal practices. The idea was that we needed to look there in order to do something about it. We have seen it now. Now it's time for action. The problem is not within the current prime suspects. They can be the key to disclosure if they are interrogated unrelentingly. It is important a dedicated faction is organized to get to the bottom of this. It is a very old problem that keeps being renewed. The people behind it are in totalitarian control and do so by remaining covert. They people who are now caught are to be disbanded and punished legally because they fucked up. The organization does not cease their practice because members quit.

            There isn't really much to disagree on. I suppose Pizzagate originates from 4chan, which is relatively underground.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your hanging on to the practice of reporting facts, half facts, and theories, and discussing these, is outdated. PIzzagate is viral now. Time for action: let me reinstate that, it is almost too late for action, and it bothers me things haven't been done earlier. I feel betrayed when in the past there was a trend of protests and resistance, starting around Occupy, which is when Anonymous was viral. The lasted all the way up to the ISIS attacks, which is when ''they" also did what was right. Where are they now? Where are all the activists? What is hours, days weeks of research good for, when in the end months go by without change?

             What are the specific actions that need taking and things that need doing? Maybe if we can come up with a list of actions, people will be able to see which ones they can do and put themselves forward for, and then a more cohesive group could come together out of the people working on each of those things?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone in theory could list 'jobs/actions' and then they can be crossed off once someone has completed it and confirmed/proved it's been done. Could even gamify it to get more people to 'sign up' for tasks.

              You understand the message. There is so much information, it is not easy for one person to conceive a well thought out single plan. It's overwhelming.
             </p>
             <p>
              It might be a very good idea to get a thread going. Might take off better. That would, hopefully result in a list.
             </p>
             <p>
              My first idea is, for Washington citizens or those willing to travel and stay there, to survey the Comet Ping Pong. Like really camp out in a van with a team who take turns taking watch, and record their things. A blinded van of course so that it can't be seen people are inside. This same mission requires additional agents, one to drive the "empty" van, someone that can be stationed on another position to get vision on the back, and someone who is mobile to follow suspects. That last person, depending on the resources, has the preferred ability to call for back up if necessary. Non violence does the trick. Ears and eyes, and documentation. Then, leaks of hard evidence if they can't be used in anonymous blackmail to collect intel to be scrutinized. The leaks will have to happen eventually anyway, plus they have to hold some empirical credence to the public as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police is obligated to respond to evidence, so they have to be considered at first to report the crimes as well. If they fail to comply, consider them corrupt and fall back on the power of your faction. That way the world realizes there is nothing to fear if you're not passive, and everything to fear if you're in on the scandal.

            Great to know there are activists.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'm concerned about is where pizzagate comes from: From a place on the internet that is considered relatively 'underground'.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's been pretty long since then. What worries me is that  the first thing I discovered is there is no organizatoin, what seems like. Open discussion is not effective if nothing comes from it. The problems require a reposnse. Awarenes is great, but doesn't do that  much. Don't overestimate all the talk on here or the memes anywhere. This is not about reaction from lying media. Getting emotional about these distraction on the side means you loose.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will continue to gather the people and urge to do what I think is necessary - not for the benefit of anyone but the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't live knowing what I know without fighting for the innocent who can't fight.
           </p>
           <p>
            What worries me is that there is no initiative what so ever to pressure the government and the authorities, and the people and places implicated, to comply and align in an effort to battle the system of abuse. When this comes from a place of the internet and there is no collective of anons yet who do something similar to what Anonymous has been capable of doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to form a faction that achieves something effective.

            How about a petition to Loretta Lynch to prosecute Clinton for her careless handling of classified information by keeping an unsecured server in her basement. This would expose the fake Russia hacking story and end the push to flip EC votes.

               I am as savvy as you are, with the same quality of having excellent ideas to set and achieve some very noble goals. As you do what you can, you are an ally. As you do what it takes, you are a hero. If you do more than that, you are a fool, yet risks must be taken.

            I'd recommend targeting the Roman Catholic Church. As well as the recent coprophilia thing from the Pope there's the problem with the story about the events on the road to Damascus. The three accounts of the events (Acts 9, 22, 26) are not consistent about who heard what, and what Paul's instructions were. What this means is that Paul contradicted himself about his appointment as an apostle. Also the Christian account on the crucifixion is inconsistent with the prophetic references to the event etc. Saturnalia is also relevant to the Christian celebration of the holiday season.
