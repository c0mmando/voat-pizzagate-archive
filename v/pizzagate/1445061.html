            This is the only photo on the tumblr page that was curious...taken at the white house. The rest of the art on the page is just bad graphic art. There were three photos/art things with pizza but nothing that stood out. She has a crush on Jackie Chan, writes terrible animae fan fiction, and is very angry when tweens steal her artwork. She is a herpatologist of some sort...lizards, turtles, snakes...
