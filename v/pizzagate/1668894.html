            The point you make about the emails. I thought about that. I don't imagine he's stupid. In fact, I'd say he's pretty damn intelligent. TBH, I also have wondered if maybe he did it on purpose, or maybe didn't focus on discretion for a reason.

            I think it's telling when he talks about Comeys decision right before election to reopen the investigation. Podesta says two expiation... 1) Forces within the FBI wanted HRC to lose or 2) a cya organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah so what logical explanation would make it so the FBI wanted her to lose?!? Pedogate, corruption, both?

            He's def in heavy damage control and fighting for his life. That little worm; the most suspecious thing you can do in this order is:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Delete your social media
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Lock a previously unlocked account
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Keep account status the same, but go underground.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reckon he's guilty of the last and it's not just because he was the chairman of a losing POTUS campaign. Him and his cronies are cooked and they totally know it.

            The Podesta Group is hired by goverments to spin terrible PR into beautiful rainbows. They go into Sudan and Thailand, knowing the horrors that go on there, and lie about it to the rest of the world. These guys are sheisters to to the highest degree. He thinks he can spin the campaign disaster in the same way, and now even pizzagate! His interview was all PR, spinning history into a different and false light. There's a reason he is doing these interviews. It's not to set records straight, it's to craft and repeat lies until they're believed.

             People have written books about what a monster Hillary really is, the authors being former Secret Service. She is forceful but she is a screw up. She screwed up healthcare for 2 decades after her arrogant effort of 1000 pages worth of crap legislation. She abused Bill when he was the President and was known for her violent temper. She can hold three different opposing positions at the same time. She has accomplished nothing but destruction and mayhem. She overwhelmed Obama and destroyed Libya. She really cannot do things well, but her ambitions are sky high.
            </p>
            <p>
             She really does embody everything that a tyrant and a monster are. I believe she even thought of herself as a female Mao Zedong. She had posters that resembled every other known tyrant that has existed. She wanted to fight and win WWIII and was setting it up to do just that.

             OK. So, Hillary had set it up big time to ensure she got nominated. She set up the DNC, got the contributors to donate to the states so that she could siphon off the money to her own campaign. Then we see talk in the emails about creating Pied Pipers that will collect interest in the election and then would drop out and shift that interest to her. Bernie may have been a pied piper, made a deal, etc etc. Bernie was small potatoes, so they let him run under the Democrat ticket, with the general idea that he would eventually drop out. Things went crazy and Bernie began to win.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hillary (known for her temper when out of reach of the camera) may have begun to rant and rave. Someone did something wrong. Podesta was her campaign manager so he may have taken the brunt of it. So, he gets careless with his emails. He deletes any Russia emails (being a paid lobbyist for them he surely would have some) and tells Russia to hack him. Hiding and controlling scandal is one thing -- creating a global empire through WWIII is another. Who knows what kind of thing he might have found out about the ambitions of Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anthony Weiner may have taken the brunt, as well. Huma and Hillary were inseparable, and there was no real marriage. Who knows if it wasn't even an arranged marriage to give Huma respectability before Hillary became President. Don't you think it is just a bit stupid to send pictures of yourself to young girls? It isn't the same as actually having sex like Bill Clinton did with Monica Lewinsky, but it would be scandalous.
            </p>
            <p>
             What if the people around her know the truth --- that she is flipping frikking insane and has no moral backbone whatsoever. So, the only way to expose such a thing is to do it vicariously. After all, there may still be people around those parts that actually love our country more than they love Hillary and Billy Boy Clinton.

            No, they think they are 'made' and untouchable, they get cocky, and they fuck up.  Weiner was probably entrapped, IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            The story about the 15 year old girl being obsessed with Weiner doesn't pass my smell test.  Weiner kept his 'life insurance' folder for... Well, life insurance.

             I seriously dont think the illuminati understood what it would lead to when they made the decision to give internet to the average joe, and they have no clear way to shove that genie back in the bottle. We may well be looking at the demise of the illuminati in our time. Pizzagate is the #Gboot (great battle of our time)

            And Podesta knew HRCs trustworthiness rating was very low in 2015 and 2016. That is from the emails.   So he knew quite some time ago she was not the right stuff, didn't have the magic politicians need.  Maybe he thought they could fix the election.  A lot of strangeness.  Interesting post.  We need to be able to think out of the box, always.
