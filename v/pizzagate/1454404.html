           <p>
            As a matter of Soul Safety, I submit the following reminder:
           </p>
           <p>
            This discourse and inquiry is not about sex, sexual freedom, sexual expression, beauty, art or anything of the sort.
           </p>
           <p>
            This discourse is about theft.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is about rape, exploitation, slavery, extortion, perhaps torture, murder, trafficking, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not about whether or not someone young can be beautiful and attractive.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is about NOT allowing other people to STEAL essence, love, light, innocence, youth from the child or anyone for that matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is about soul violence, malignant narcissism and entitlement beyond reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            NO ONE has the right to STEAL someone elses' sexuality.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there is sex to occur, it is to occur *not&amp; with deception, manipulation, drugs, alcohol or force, but a free act and deed of mutual surrender between two informed, willing and capable parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't let scintillating, sexy, seductive images of any sort seduce you or short-circuit your Soul.
Don't go down the delusional rabbit-hole of thinking, "Maybe these people have it right."
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not confuse possible titillation or arousal with an automatic presumption of goodness.
           </p>
           <p>
            The music video's and all the imagery are there to tantalize and seduce. It's all part of the facade and the sales pitch. Becoming desensitized to all of this, shunts one's ability to see it for what it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            THEY ARE SADISTICALLY RAPING BABIES. 
DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THAT!
           </p>
           <p>
            This ain't SEX. It is wickedness, trying to become exalted to goodness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the REALITY of porn, the same as the FANTASY or porn?
Is the REALITY of DRUGS, the same as the FANTASY of drugs?
Is the TRUE REALITY of PROSTITUTION, the same as the FANTASY of PROSTITUTION?
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't let them dress this sickness up with catchy codewords.
Oh how cute...Pizza....Awee Chicken. Pasta, Panda Bears, Red Shows, Checkered patters.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY DO THEY USE THIS LANGUAGE??? To DEPERSONALIZE the victims!
           </p>
           <p>
            If a baby or child girl is merely a pizza or "money under a sheet", then what's to stop ANYONE from thinking they can have it?  DO NOT FALL FOR THE LINGO AS YOU LEARN IT!
           </p>
           <p>
            These sicko's got lost between fantasy and reality and by not experiencing, guilt, remorse, empathy or shame, have descended into a form of wickedness that we must prevent from spreading.
           </p>
           <p>
            This PEDO-culture is an STD all it's own. It's a MIND, BODY AND SPIRITUAL disease.
This is NOT about finding children beautiful and attractive. Normal people can see beauty in children and in nature, and in many other places.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             There is no shortage of beauty. There is no need for the World to rape it's innocents.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            One CAN see beauty in what is beautiful, but one does not ever have to turn such perception to ugliness.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people involved in these crimes are deranged, psychotic, violent, manipulative, sadistic creeps. 
They are not "free".  They are not "evolved". They are not "special". They are not "enlightened".  They are deprived, deranged and devoid of true love.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are enslaved by endless cognitive and soul distortions and have in their distortions grew drunk on evil. This is a sick, hypnotic addiction. They are truly "possessed" by their desires and tak delight in their evil-doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not fall for the seduction in the alleged "modeling" photos., sexy stuff or language. When focusing on sexy things, languages, images, insinuations, it is possible for one to feel simulated. Indeed some of the not CP images I have seen on many of the linked sites are beautiful.
           </p>
           <p>
            But THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beauty existed BEFORE these demons chose to STEAL IT. Beauty will also exist when these psycho's are stopped. The World loses NOTHING by stopping these predators and protecting our beloved children.
           </p>
           <p>
            If getting titillated, do not let any unexpected stimulation confuse you or deceive you. Sex and concepts of sex and beauty are arousing -- but that is NOT what this is all about.
           </p>
           <p>
            What this is about is sick, intelligently and purposefully illegal activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're not talking about stealing cars here., this is stealing the literal soul of a person, fracturing their consciousness, breaking apart their psyche, so they can be used like an inanimate object, used up and tossed away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their intent is to rob, deform and destroy the light in these beautiful children.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing more precious that one could steal but the essential spirit and beauty of a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            WE MUST PROTECT AND DEFEND THAT AT ALL COSTS.
           </p>
           <p>
            DO NOT GET SUCKED IN BY ANY VENEER OF SEXINESS.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            This is NOT fantasy, but a perverse, dark and sick reality. Don't be fooled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many FANTASIES looks attractive depending on the angle.
Do not be confused by confused feelings.

           <p>
            Reality is that between
            <em>
             consenting
            </em>
            emotionally and physically aware partners, sex is powerful and beautiful and a gift from God.
           </p>
           <p>
            But we cannot let people "steal" to feed their own sick fantasies from unconsenting or manipulated others!
           </p>
           <p>
            FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

            Do NOT get confused along the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            NOT ABOUT SEX, BEAUTY, AROUSAL OR DESIRE.
IT"S ABOUT INSANE ABUSE AND SOUL MURDER OF INNOCENT, PARTIES.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please stay vigilant. Stay strong and remain clear.

We are fighting against truly epic evil.

             Well.... The really sad part, the Vast Majority of people out there in sexual relationships are in them with liars, young men with false intents, young women with false intents, treating each other like glorified sex-toys....
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sorry, if you lie to someone about your intents, knowing it will increase your chances of getting laid, that's very similar to rape when you KNOW the person wouldn't sleep with you if it was just to put another notch or experience on your belt. It's like
            </p>
            <p>
             "No I agreed to get into a relationship with the person I thought you were, not the slimy snake I woke up one day to find you are."
            </p>
            <p>
             That sort of crap ruined me years ago, and it sucks because most people male and female are like that. That's why you've got young women out there with 2-3 children and no active father... And should they ever come into a decent man, that decent man has to pay for the sins of real scum-bags.
            </p>
            <p>
             But thanks for mentioning that, it's a real rapist mentality to do someone like that at the very least, and our society doesn't much teach how that kind of behavior is potentially extremely detrimental.
            </p>
            <p>
             Getting into the "fantasies" though.......... People have all kinds of insane fantasies about everything, especially young people, that's why they make such easy victims. Oh and the benefits of Cannabis, that some people call a "drug", the real true to life benefits that can be attained for your health are no fantasy, though much like anything enjoyable can be a abused, and yes people with their heads in the clouds often have too many fantasies about it, or while high or buzzed on it.

The more we are exposed to a thing the less shocking it is, even something as horrible as CP.  OP is very right, what if this takes 5-10 years to reach critical mass?  That's a long time to be down that rabbit hole.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time humanity's disbelief in this type of horror is what has caused it to flourish IMO. Stay sane out there.
