            I agree, EataDick. I really believe this investigation can be carried out without linking to anything pervy or lurking around any barfy websites. It's not helping. I think if a mountain of connections continue to be made, the puzzle will come together. I think it's been well established, at least among the red-pilled, that there is a very real network of abuse, do we really need to see it? We just need to give evidence pointing out the players. Not to mention, as you said, that it will just discredit you. 
This whole thing has already fucking ruined porn for me... and I only liked porn between consenting adults that know and like what they're doing. Now it all reminds me of a corrupt den of sadness and trafficking.

             EDIT:  But I see what you're saying, it can just be thrown out of left field... always see what a link address is before clicking. Good advice.
