            Looks like it may actually be made up. not really sure. I heard the report but never looked it up on Wikileaks. I can't find it on Wikileaks, only references to it

            Cathy O'Brien is not a liar - watch the documentary on YouTube. She shows proof in her crotch. They mutilated her genitals to carve a demon face into her clitoris and labia with a series of exacto knives and cut her vaginal muscle so it prolapsed and protrudes. The account of Hillary Clinton raping her makes sense. She described how Hillary forced her to give oral on her after a long day outside in the hot sun without a shower with pantyhose on. John Podesta said in some email on wikileaks that Clinton smells like urine and cabbage and farts. Those two coincidences reinforce Cathy's story.

            Years ago, maybe 25, my aunt was asked to pick Dick Cheney up at Bradley Airport. he was more of an unknown then, and coming to Ct for some function. She said he was completely rude to her during the ride . After I read Cathy O'Brien's book I always wondered, did he think my aunt was an mkultra  at his service….

            Wasnt expecting to watch another mans bulge tonight. Thats enough internet for one night...
           </p>
           <p>
            But to be honest, i always though of Cathy O'briens story sort of crazy. I know about MKULTRA etc, but its always something to hear them talk about their experiences versus reading about them, and even if you believe that there might be some sort of pedophilia in the goverment, the stuff that O'brien said about having her genitalia mutilated etc is just too sick. Nowadays I'm really thinking that her story is true, no matter how sick.

            I don't believe her story about Reagan. Don't have a problem believing it about Bush Sr. or Hillary. Note Bush's patting of Teri Hatcher's butt  10 years ago
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the young woman who has been living with them for 8 years seems to be mind controlled by Cathy and Mark. Her sisters on the other hand are very believable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I read other people who have claimed that Mark threatened them. Mark will only appear on shows where he can control the questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            They do not talk about Cathy's daughter, who was in custody of the state of Tennessee, when she was younger. Wonder where she is now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not dismissing the whole idea of children being controlled by the CIA, but I think they wouldn't be alive to tell their story. So I have my doubts

             The problem with Reagan is that he was in presidency during the  Franklin Scandal era and said nothing to expose the pedophiles.
I'm not saying he's guilty of anything, but it  doesn't help me believe in him as a trustworthy truth-teller.   .

              I liked Reagan, but the man was allegedly sexing up Elizabeth Taylor when she was 15. Remember, he comes from Hollywood, which has had a long history of pedophilia.

             Men always see this statement as a compliment, but O'Brien wasn't saying it as a compliment, just a fact. There can be such a thing as a penis that is too large for a woman... The reason a woman would mention his large penis in this context is that an unusually large penis has the potential to inflict pain or be very uncomfortable in certain situations. Especially perhaps for a young woman like O'Brien's daughter. Or during anal rape, an unusually large penis could cause considerable tearing and damage.
