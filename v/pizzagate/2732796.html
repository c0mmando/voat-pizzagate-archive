<p>&quot;The Venture Bros\' writers took a character who was a violent pedophile and managed to make him likable. That\'s a hell of an impressive feat.﻿&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sgt. Hatred so damn sick! lol His feet fetish!﻿&quot;</p>

            I liked Brak, Sealab 2021, Aqua Teen Hunger Force (EARLY years), back in the day. ALL quite well written. Sunday night bedtime ritual. These days, I only like Rick and Morty, but they haven't had any new shows in QUITE a while.

            The rest is adolescent garbage. Seth Green is such a dork.

             Yeah, I have a soft spot for all those shows too... but, Ricky and Morty, they're no bueno. Check out their Bushworld Adventures episode... there is some serious fugged shit in there. There's a whole scene where Morty's penis gets bitten by a snake and Rick encourages him to pull it out, so he can suck the venom... yeah, seriously... lost pretty much all my respect for that show.

            Sounds about right, I've been decoding this crap on my twitter for a while. compare the blue skinned gold jawed/eyed symbolism of They Live to Avatar for some mind blows of pro/anti cult - basically it's been a propaganda war with both sides for a long time now.  - Their side joking about how they own everything and our side going HEY LOOK AT THESE SICK PEOPLE! - and meanwhile us populace generally just sleeps.  Welp, no more!

            I don't know how any of these morons watching this crap find a joke in any of it.  None of this is funny.  SNL is no longer funny it is sick humor and people laugh.  This country has changed their perspective on what is funny and isn't.  All of this stuff makes me sick just reading about it.  Watching it?  I can't even imagine it.  Child Grooming Material and they think it is funny.  We are in big trouble.

             Ikr.... have people completely gone off the moral map of decency now?!? I remember years ago when our oldest was a toddler (he's 18 now) how we began noticing how we couldn't let him be privy to much of what was on mainstream television. The crap that's out there now is sick, evil, depraved, vile &amp; perverse. I cannot comprehend that as "entertainment". 😔

              It's not fit for adults as even.  It is contributing to the depravity of our society.  I can't even stomach what's on tv, that 's why we don't have cable anymore.  No Netflix either.  For someone that grew up on Red Skelton, and Laurel and Hardy type comedy well, today's comedy and shows disgust me.  People might think that is old fashioned, but good writing that makes people laugh and is not filthy dirty is a talent.  The sad thing is most and all of the entertainers are caught up in the Pedowood World.  Gone are the days of good clean fun by perverts. Now we just have new perverts.

               Their plan is to deprave and debauch our kids. Once you've been traumatised in childhood, you often grow up to traumatise the next generation.  That's what they want.  Our children are being groomed by the media and technology. They are surrounded by porn and violence at an early age. That can't help but change their growing brains.

                it scares me to death.  I do know some families that do not allow their children to see such things but many will be allowed.  They will be desensitized and not have any feelings for their fellow man, when they are harmed or need help.  The world is spinning way too fast.

                 The world is getting worse. I feel for parents trying to raise children in these times. But I also feel hope. I have had many close to me die, so reading about near death experiences gives me great comfort. I came across
                 <a href="https://www.nderf.org/Experiences/1yazmine_s_nde.html">
                  this

                 one. It was interesting what she saw on the other side:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Scenes from the world's future I saw how the world of people wanted to wake up, yet there were some in high places who all they could do to stop it.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Sounds like the evil that we are dealing with.
                </p>
                <p>
                 She talks about the 'rainbow' body and there are many references to rainbows. She even references 'spiral'.   It made me wonder whether these occultists, on their trips to their evil dimensions during their ceremonies, see these things and then use them as symbols to communicate to other satanists.  Yazmine was not a satanist; she just happened to have an NDE when she lost her baby when she was five months pregnant.

                  What a beautiful story.  This gives me much hope for I have wondered so many times how and what it will feel like.   I had an experience and sign from someone after they died and it was a powerful message that they answered me on their birthday.  So I wondered yes, is there an afterlife.  Now I know that my thoughts and prayers have been answered.  With all that has happened with the Church lately, it has only strengthened my faith.  Thank you so much for this.  I will read this over and over again.  I will treasure it.

                   Yes, I believe that they (your departed loved ones) can hear your thoughts. When you pray, I believe the saints and archangels hear you.  I've had some strange things happen to me that indicated that my prayers are heard (if not always answered, lol).

                    I have read that prayer is more powerful when said in a group.  Why I don't know.  I think it is powerful no matter when or who is saying it.  My situation was right after a funeral and then she left a message on her birthday.  This was my mother in law.  We were very close. The message on the day of the funeral was extremely bazaar since I prayed to her inside the Chapel and asked her to send me a message if she heard my special prayer. She did.  If ever I doubted any of this before, that made me a true believer.
