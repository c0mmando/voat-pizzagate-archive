<h3>Malcolm Turnbull said Adelaide archbishop Philip Wilson, the most senior Catholic cleric ever convicted of the crime, should not be allowed to remain in post while appealing his conviction.</h3>
<h3>Wilson was convicted in May of failing to report to police the repeated abuse of two altar boys by a paedophile priest in Sydney during the 1970s.</h3>
<h1></h1>
<p>&quot;He should have resigned and the time has come for the pope to sack him,&quot; Mr Turnbull told reporters. </p>
<p>&quot;There are many leaders that have called on him to resign, it\'s clear that he should resign and I think the time has come now for the ultimate authority in the church to take action and sack him,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>Wilson has said he would only offer his resignation to Pope Francis if his appeal fails in the New South Wales state District Court. </p>
<p>&quot;I am conscious of calls for me to resign and have taken them very seriously,&quot; Wilson said in a statement this month. </p>
<p>&quot;However, at this time, I am entitled to exercise my legal rights and to follow the due process of law. Since that process is not yet complete, I do not intend to resign at this time,&quot; he added.</p>
