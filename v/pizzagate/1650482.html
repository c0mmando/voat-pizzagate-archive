            There are so many variables I don't know where to begin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Depends on the age of the child, situation they were in, if parents can be loacated, if they were adopted or kidnapped.
           </p>
           <p>
            First thing that should happen is a full medical screen screen. Next, interview with a mental health professional like myself with police either watching through glass or perhaps in the room if the child is comfortable though they mayor know the person is a police officer. They would be interviewed about their prior life to get info on how they wound up in the at situation. Good chance they have blocked out their prior lives or were too young to remember it. These kids will be staying with in a hospital for observation of injuries or at a foster home appointed by the state to deal with horrific situations. When I see some of these kids. Usually older couples with grown children who have tons of experience with abused kids. Some may even become so attached to the MH case worker or social worker that they will refuse to be left with anyone else and the social worker/MH worker will take them for the time being. That is frowned against but sometimes an abused kid bonds to the first person who meets their needs and does not hurt them. I had this happen a couple times.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will then get a lawyer appointed who sees to it that their rights are being given to them and advocates for them for social services and the like. Will find placement in foster homes or with their families and follow the cases closely. These foster families are long term placements who have only one or two kids at a time and are the same older couples or single women as I stated above. I forgot to add, most of the ones I know who take in kids who have horrific abuse histories are retired social workers or are retired from MH careers or medical careers. People with a lifetime of professional experience with kids and are some of the most wonderful people I have ever met. If parents can be found, the police and social services will investigate them unless it is a clear case of kidnapping with evidence proving that is the case. Like if someone snatched a kid at the market or while they walked to school.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have only dealt with small children for the most part. The trend I have seen tend to be runaway who met a guy online type deals. The young kids do well over all. Far better than the teens though I suspect the teens had problems which lead to them making poor choices online and come from homes they want out of.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the young kids I have helped are either in foster care already or were in homes being investigated for abuse. I cannot recall one where the child was adopted and then abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            What needs to happen is a public awareness campaign on child abuse. It isn't just physical or mental abuse, it is depriving children of daily healthy meals and the basic love and safety a child needs to feel. Taking things away as punishment or not meeting their needs on a basic level. I don't think people realize that being a shot parent is abuse even if they are not hurting the child physically. A kid crying when they fall and get hurt who hears "suck it up" or "your a baby for crying" learns parents cannot be trusted for comfort so when the neighbor or who ever touched them wrongly, they won't tell Mom And dad because they don't associate them with comfort and trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for the rant. Had a shit day at work. I will make a better post or edit when I am feeling less rage.

            Most mid size to large communities have a variety of community based or non profit programs who help victims of crime, domestic violence or sexual violence. Most victims of sex trafficking can receive help and services from such programs. Most people just aren't aware of all that is available in their communities. The easiest thing any citizen can do is educate themselves on available community resources. A good place to start is your local homeless shelter or social services office (welfare department, WIC office or CPS even). Call and ask them if they have a resource guide or know where you can get one. States are starting to maintain databases of community services and programs that can be found online. Familiarize yourself about what's out there and try to spread the word however you can. Most people don't access services because they just don't know the services are there.

            Probably the first thing is to make sure they know it's not their fault. Typically abusers blame the victims and they are likely carrying it around with them. That and maybe create a pizzagate support network maybe run by survivors for survivors &amp; have chapters in every affected city?

              They probably already have created a support network which we can direct survivors to as they are freed.

            These are two great ideas, but we will have to severely vet the people involved.  There are so many very professional pedos that are good at what they do, worm their way into these kinds of programs.  Serious stuff to think about.

            I just watched a youtube inteview with a lady from Houston that locates children that CPS loses. as well as helps families who have been victimized by CPS. She said older children feel like they owe their abusers or they have stockholm syndrome. Many are so damaged they will go on to abuse other children, many will suffer from multiple personality disorder etc. we are talking about thousands of damaged children and future damaged adults. this is a bad situation and there will need to be serious consideration of what to do... there will be people not caught who will prey on them and I think as a society we need to have an honest discussion about what happens next.
