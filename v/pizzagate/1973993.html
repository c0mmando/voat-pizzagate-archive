OSTERMAN, BAR OWNER DOUG NICHOLSON, BAR OWNER JOEY LEGATH AND A NUMBER OF RACINE 
ALDERMEN INCLUDING ALDERMAN GREG HELDING, ALDERMAN JAMES KAPLAN AND OTHERS.</p>

<p><a href="http://issuu.com/communicatornews/docs/amended_complaint_2/0">http://issuu.com/communicatornews/docs/amended_complaint_2/0</a></p>
<p>As a result of Dickert’s and his cohorts’ numerous acts of soliciting and receiving bribes, extorting, threatening or 
incentivizing alderpersons to comply with his and the Financiers’ desires regarding liquor licenses, extorting business people for additional money, wire fraud to conceal the nature and existence of these payments, Dickert gained control of the government of Racine and used that 
control against certain individuals and businesses in Racine.</p>
<p>Monte Osterman on behalf  of Dickert, approached Caleb Robinson—who was attempting to sell hot 
dogs on and around Monument Square and was facing resistance—to “shake him down.”  Dickert would have benefited from 
the receipt of 
this elicit money and Osterman would have also benefited by receipt of money or preferential treatment from Dickert. Shortly after this visit, Mr. 
Robinson was granted approval to sell hot dogs from his mobile cart in front of city owned property.
Monte Osterman acted on behalf of Dickert when, he approached Business Owner, Caleb Robinson and others to
 demand that they pay money to Dickert, which would be delivered to him by Osterman, in exchange for Dickert
 undertaking official acts that
 directly affected their prospective business ventures. 
 Also at the direction of Dickert, 
Monte Osterman threatened those individuals who declined to pay bribe monies to Dickert.  Specifically, Osterman
 warned that Dickert would take official action against Business Owner, Caleb Robinson or any other individual who refused 
to pay him 
money “under the table,” and that the 
official action would negatively affect their business interests.</p>
<p>Monte Osterman’s actions evidence his agreement to participate in the scheme perpetrated by Dickert and the Financiers 
to control the city of Racine’s government and the commercial and personal benefits attendant to such control. Monte
 Osterman benefitted from his participation in that he was able to use Dickert’s control over the Racine city government to his advantage. Specifically
, Dickert allowed Osterman to position himself as the go-to granite company for construction projects in Racine. 
 Osterman threatened those developers who refused to give him business by reminding them of his close relationship with
, and influence
 over, Dickert.  
Monte Osterman, at the direction of Dickert, demanded Business Owner provide him cash for Dickert or Business
 Owner’s plan to develop a gas station on the west side of downtown Racine would not win the necessary approval
 from the Mayor and city
 departments.  As part of his effort to extort money from Business Owner and to demonstrate the control Dickert held 
over the alderman and common council, Osterman called an alderman who had been creating problems for Business.
Dickert would have benefited from the receipt of this elicit money and 
Osterman would have also benefited by receipt of money or preferential 
treatment from Dickert. When Business Owner refused to become Dickert and Osterman’s personal ATM machine, his planned development on the west side of downtown Racine was terminated.</p>
<p>Dickert accepted the bribe monies paid by the Financiers and, in exchange, ran the city of Racine’s government in
 a corrupt fashion which deprived Racine,etc etc</p>
<p>In particular, Dickert had Jerger report the bribes as campaign contributions in Dickert’s 2009 and 2011 campaign
 finance reports.  Further, Dickert and Jerger would attribute the bogus 
contributions to people other than the Financiers and for amounts different than the Financiers had provided to
 Dickert. To ensure there was no disruption to the scheme, Dickert threatened to remove 
any alderman from the Licensing Committee, or any other influential position they held, if they failed to “play ball.”  Dickert further threatened to support candidates to run against these aldermen in the next election cycle. </p>
<p>relates to pizzagate as our friend Wisconsin is corrupt -------------Look at who made illegal campaign contributions to the
 corrupt mayor in his elections - it is a list of the most prominent business leaders in the area. The mayor committed perjury
 multiple times in his depositions, and his best friend plead the 5th to over 100 questions regarding the illegal campaign 
contributions and racketeering schemes they were involved with.

             I don't know why you're suddenly responding to this a month later.  Anyway, I have been following your work since you began posting, and you are now providing some links to legitimate news or other impartial information sources in order to back up your assertions of fact, which is great.
            </p>
            <p>
             I suspected a hoax a month ago because, as I said then, the website you linked to, Racine Community Media, did not seem like a legitimate news source.  It asserted facts without providing links to actual news reports or other impartial information sources for documentation.

             This is not a hoax. This is very real. The newspaper in Racine was directly involved in the racketeering, collusion, conspiracy and other crimes involved. Some of the major networks in the community involved in criminal corruption are Rotary, Lodges, Freemasons, RAMAC, Leadership Racine, Racine Community Foundation, Johnson Foundation, Racine Interfaith Coalition, and many others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is directly linked with Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Committee of 300, Council of 13, and other global societies and groups. Racine is also a hub for the mafia (Dominicans, Sicilians, Franciscans, Mexican, Dixie, etc.), and represents the path to one world religion through corrupt partnerships with Jesuit / Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Scientology, OTO, LDS, LC, Kabbalah, and other faiths.
            </p>
            <p>
             RICO investigations linked to Johnsons and to Clinton Foundation among many more were obstructed at local, state and federal levels with Loretta Lynch personally involved. Racine is the "Root" to the real agenda of Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast built through Sustainability and enforced by AI and Community Policing. Racine is the model for these programs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The corrupt criminal mayor who recently resigned following a string of others involved was rewarded with an appointment to privately control the Great Lakes - one of the largest fresh water sources in the world. There is much more to the recent Foxconn and Amazon deals in the Racine area.

              YES.  The Foxconn and Amazon deals I believe are going to microchip employees, among other things, at least that is my thought.  Correct me if I am wrong.  I also believe this is why Bezos is buying Whole Foods, many thousands of employees to be micro chipped as well.

               You are not wrong Carmencita, and it goes beyond microchipping and the Mark of the Beast. It is about control over every aspect of life including food, water, healthcare, education, religion, communication, and much more. It also is tied to prison labor, education reform, and the pipeline of slavery from Cradle to Grave.

             Carmencita, don't get too excited just yet.  The poster is only providing part of the story, which is old.  The RICO part of the case was dropped in 2015:
             <a href="https://youtu.be/NUSBTVovKrQ?t=6002">
              https://youtu.be/NUSBTVovKrQ?t=6002
             </a>
             Calls into question all of the breathless and voluminous Racine posts made today as probably providing an incomplete picture.  I certainly don't doubt that Racine is corrupt to the bone, as most governmental organizations seem to be, but the posters do themselves no favors in presenting distorted information on a research site.

              The RICO civil case was settled under fraud, threat, extortion, embezzlement, racketeering, intimidation, and collusion between law firms in order to prevent it from going to trial. They never intended on it making to depositions. The mayor and others committed perjury and committed other crimes in the process of the civil case, and also revealed a lot of the racketeering and conspiracy in discovery. The parties involved are asking for full federal criminal investigations into the corruption and the collusion involved in the case. They were assured that the FBI would prosecute the case until it became known who was involved in the illegal campaign contributions and who they were connected to. It was shut down by the FBI and by Loretta Lynch personally at the DOJ who was in direct communication with one of the attorneys.

               Factfinder2 is absolutely wrong. Racine is a hub for extreme criminal corruption tied to the world's most powerful players.
              </p>
              <p>
               The chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons (Racine, WI). Look at the Zika virus test for one example.
              </p>
              <p>
               Carmencita and others - you should know by now how serious this is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Racine is the "Root" to the entire system of Global Criminal Corruption. Do you want to be Enslaved or Saved?

                I agree it is very serious and do not doubt what you have been posting about Racine.  What I was saying was that the article was confusing me, and unless you noted the date, it seemed that it was happening now.  I am not saying it did not happen, and since it did happen before, it can be achieved again.  Yes, of course, I also believe that papers would not publish the article, having been taken over.  We experience this with many other pieces of news that people question because the MSM has been bought.

              Not surprised one bit.  They keep their "friends" close.  They are probably all Brownstoned and well payed.  They certainly are copying the mob tactics of no pay no play.  This goes on in Mexico.  Wake up people, what you thought was going on in other countries has been going on here too, Big Time.
