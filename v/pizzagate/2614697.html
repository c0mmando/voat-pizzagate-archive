            65,000 kinda sounds close to 64,000 dollars worth of hotdogs from the WikiLeaks. Maybe the dollar amount referred to how many hotdogs, ie kids.

             I thought they might be related too. However, the infamous "hot dog friday" was in 2009 and the children crossing the border was in 2014. They might still be related but the connection isn't 100% in my mind.

            yer i put this up a couple of days ago. TheLastRefuge has blown my mind a few times, he's a real class twitter analyst

            thats the kicker, though, isnt it: with no war in Cntrl /South America to trigger it, Obama with under 10 000 unaccompanied minors in 2012 BUDJETS for 65 000 two years later
           </p>
