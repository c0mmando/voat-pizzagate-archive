            Didn't this guy run over a kid before all of this? Maybe he's getting a lighter sentence to push this stupid narrative. This whole story is ridiculous. At the very least, this man is deranged, and by no means represents peaceful internet theorists who are probably too high/sleepy/antisocial to ever hurt anyone.

            Lucky he didn't "storm" the place with his car and hit someone.  Since he is a repeat drunk driver, I suspected he could of served even more time for reckless driving after hitting a teenager in October 2016. But I suspected wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            North Carolina doesn't give long jail sentences for repeated drunk driving or even vehicular manslaughter.  In the 2010 case of one man who killed 37 year old mother of two Kristie Lee while driving drunk: "A court found Hermelindo Castro guilty in her death and sentenced him to the maximum penalty under the law – 3 ½ years in prison. Lee's family members say that sentence is too short.

           </p>
           <p>
            One would think that with his repeated drunk driving record Edgar Maddison Welch should have already been in jail for hitting a pedestrian hardly 2 months prior to terrorizing JA's computer, but he wasn't.   Maybe JA can take comfort that Welch isn't out on the street driving for the next few years, it just might save someone's life.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Edgar Maddison Welch struck a teenager with his car, sending him to the hospital by helicopter, in October 2016, according to a report by WBTV.
            </p>
            <p>
             The incident happened about 7:30 p.m. in Salisbury, North Carolina, the news station reports. Kenyatta Belton, 13, suffered head, torso and leg injuries after he was truck by Welch’s Buick LeSabre.
            </p>
            <p>
             Witnesses told the news station that the victim was walking with several other friends when he was struck by the car.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “We was walking down the road, just a normal walk, and this one car had the full road,” Belton’s friend, Sean Lankford, told the news station. “We was pretty much on the white line and he wiped out one of my friends and he had the whole road to turn into even the whole other lane, even in the same lane he could have avoided him.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Welch was not charged at the scene. Police told WBTV he was driving about 45 miles per hour, which is the speed limit on the road.
According to a police report obtained by Slate, the investigation into the incident is ongoing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Welch has a criminal record, including a conviction for driving under the influence in 2013, which led to a sentence of 60 days in jail, according to court records. He was previously convicted in 2007 of driving after consuming alcohol while under 21.

            Kenyatta Belton was lucky not to have been killed given Welch's history.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Welch also has a history of erratic behavior and a lengthy rap sheet. The Charlotte Observer reported that Welch’s arrest record in North Carolina dates back to 2007 and includes a number of drug and alcohol offenses. These include charges of:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              possession of up to half an ounce of marijuana,
             </li>
             <li>
              possession of controlled substances
             </li>
             <li>
              driving while intoxicated
             </li>
             <li>
              driving with an open container of alcohol.

            Regarding the Kristie Lee case...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kristie Lee's death Wayne County Superior Court Judge Arnold Jones shares their frustration and has taken a rare stand for a judge by speaking out against what he believes are inadequate sentencing guidelines for felony death by vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>
             In cases like Lee’s, victims' families often want to blame the judge for what they see as a light sentence that doesn't fit the seriousness of the crime. However, North Carolina judges are bound by strict, structured sentencing guidelines, leaving them with few options.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               “I just don't believe it's that much different than taking a loaded gun and going into a place of business and firing,” said Kimberly Smith, Lee’s sister.

“I am hopeful that those who provoke fear, traffic in lies and perpetuate conspiracy will awake to the tangible harms that result from their actions,” he said in court. “I am hopeful that one day reason will prevail before a shot rings out again in a place of warmth and love and communal gathering.”

            Alefantis - it's no secret you are into the religion of raping and killing little children.. Especially after this. We know you and your pro-pedo downvote trolls are here. It's no secret both the Spirit Cooking and now your bumsex boyfriends links to the occult are well documented

             I didn't mean to come on here and be, "That girl," but the article is only a month old.
            </p>
            <p>
             Granted this whole False Flag event mentioned in the article did take place nearly a year ago by now (I think?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Regardless, I had a good laugh from the top comment. I don't think there's anything wrong with posting this article. It gives all of us a chance to recap some past events, discuss it, reinforce the information, and ensure all of us remain on the same page throughout our research. (:

             You know anyone can edit IMDB right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Welch has some IMDB credits, but his one ON CAMERA listing on IMDB is literally marked as "uncredited."  This means his name does not actually appear in the credits of the movie.  So he most likely was an extra.   I'm sure some extras can act and I'm sure that some folks who don't appear on on IMDB at all can act, but it's a pretty long stretch to say this guy ever worked as an actor.  I think his last job was at a supermarket.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have an IMDB credit from a summer job back in college.   I mostly carried stuff around, but my IMDB page has an impressive looking title for me.
