<p>&quot;The Official Art Gallery of Satan No Friday the 13th would be complete without a visit to the Official Art Gallery of Satan! The gallery in question is Vector Gallery located in New York and is run by visual artist and electronic musician JJ Brine. Some have compared it to Andy Warhol’s Factory, while local residents are somewhat unhappier with the occult theme and proud images of Satanism and Charles Manson. It may appear to some to be purely an art stunt, created to attract attention to the artists but, the fact that they hold religious ceremonies at the gallery indicates they are slightly more serious about their satanic images and lifestyle. As with all things satanic, one has to decide if the imagery is for real or being used purely for artistic purposes, at the end of the day it is down to you, the viewer, to interpret these symbols and meanings as you wish. Vector Gallery were behind the Usher’s Unusual Charger article!&quot;

<p>&quot;Secretary Clinton shares my belief that America must remain the world\'s indispensable leader,&quot; Scowcroft said. &quot;She understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States, more secure and prosperous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stefano Stefanini was permanent representative of Italy at NATO and diplomatic adviser to former Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. He is currently a senior adviser to the Podesta Group and non-resident senior fellow of the Brent Scowcroft Center for International Security at the Atlantic Council, Washington.&quot; JJ BRINE\'S connection to Scowcroft group :</p>
<p>&quot; Mr. Friel, 31 years old, didn’t always run in these circles. About a decade ago, he worked for former national-security adviser Brent Scowcroft—“probably not the target audience for my work,” Mr. Friel said—at the American-Turkish Council. A letter of recommendation Mr. Scowcroft wrote for him in 2007 said the “substantive speeches” Mr. Friel helped write “required no substantial editing.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Scowcroft confirmed he signed the letter. A spokeswoman for the American-Turkish Council said Mr. Friel interned there.&quot; <a href="http://www.juliasinelnikova.com/pressdocs/WSJ_Vector_May_2015_oracle_photo_feature.pdf">http://www.juliasinelnikova.com/pressdocs/WSJ_Vector_May_2015_oracle_photo_feature.pdf</a></p>

            IT'S OUR LITTLE SECRET
            <em>

Selling all our memories
            </em>

To a certain kind of conspiracy 
We have big properties on many lands ******
We travel with a marching band 
And we play the people on the streets 
With our nimble hands"

            Isn't it amazing how lazy we are when it comes to processing new information. People are waiting for some kind of #ILLUMINATICONFIRMED referendum from the blogs, maybe a buzzfeed quiz. Better yet some remote academian with a reputable twitter following who treats every subject like a bygone conclusion, driving the point home with  #justice #contempt #wtf But NO really. The funny thing about knowledge is that it comes with actually KNOWING something. Maybe this case is a bit more nuanced than anti-SJW SJW millennium wikipedia analysts can deliver in a 36 hour googling spree.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also noteworthy to mention that JJ Brine has been on TMZ like six times. Not only for the Bynes-Brine BFF shockathons but also for holding a RETRIAL OF CHARLES FREAKING MANSON featuring the killer's son and for a Miami art installation where USHER CHARGED HIS MOBILE PHONE INSIDE OF A WOMAN'S VAGINA.

            THIS IS THE AREA OF WHERE IT LEADS TO THE PEDO-FILE CONNECTION ; SO SAYS THE NYPD &gt;&gt; "Maury Terry’s book, The Ultimate Evil, investigating the Process Church’s relationship to organized crime, and specifically to the Son of Sam and Charles Manson murders. Having come out in the late 1980’s, Terry’s book has since become a classic for independent researchers, true-crime enthusiasts, and “conspiracy theorists,” and has received an equal amount of hatred in the media for those who claim it is indeed “conspiracy theory,” “Satanic Panic,” and/or “religious bigotry” against the Process Church. The reader should and can decide for themselves, by viewing the research novel "

            This guy seems to be in some kind of higher position in the "process church" I believe the cult has since altered it's name into a splinter group of Scientology called "compulsions analysis". But it's obvious he has some affiliation due to the symbol that is constantly brandished all over his media.

             "—from human and drug trafficking, prostitution, hit-men for hire, and even kidnapping for human sacrifice. Rothstein claims that the epicenter of this dark-occultist crime syndication is a group called The Process Church of the Final Judgement."
            </p>
            <p>
             " Former NYPD detective Jim Rothstein has as well come out on record in recent years, discussing his career investigating Human Trafficking for the department in the ‘70’s and ‘80’s, which led him directly to the center of a branch of organized crime that can be considered nothing less than “occult/cult organized crime.”

             "ormer NYPD officer Michael Codella. Having already published a memoir of his career in New York, entitled, Alphaville: 1988, Crime, Punishment, and the Battle for New York City’s Lower East Side, Codella officially came on record to discuss a brief period during his time as an NYPD supervisor, when the infamous Son of Sam murders were unofficially re-opened for investigation by the department in the early 1990’s."

            <p>
             " many interesting details discussed in this interview, Codella tells that his informant was a prominent member of the Rat Pack biker-gang, which ran a business providing black-market security to anyone who had the money, and this biker-security force was often rented by cult-members to maintain a perimeter outside of houses where satanic rituals, often sacrifices and orgies, would take place. The cult considered at hand was the infamous Process Church of the Final Judgement. After a withstanding business arrangement between the “Church” and the Rat Pack, the informant and other bikers were reported to have initiated themselves into the Process Church, where they enjoyed the long list of any and all illicit black market activities, including pedophilia, and even kidnapping for specific purposes of ritual sacrifice."

              Son of Sam special was just on network TV last week!! 
Berkowitz interviewed in prison. he told them over and over it was a satanic involvement, and it was pretty clear he was meeting with a group with others involved. he uses the word cult as well as i recall.... he will not say anything further when asked if other people were involved. the stupid journalist acts like this is a trick or some game. Berkowitz is calm and clear, he discusses his childhood and parents as loving and normal, and clearly states he got involved with satanism and that 'demons' were involved as well. good and evil seem to be the only game he is playing....
i for sure believe he was in an occult group that encouraged the murders!!

            JJ Brine's connection to Haitian Voodoo 
JJ Brine: “I have been to Haiti a couple of times. I was going to see Max Beauvoir a friend of mine who died recently who was the supreme chief of Haitian Voodoo.”

            &amp; the expected voodoo connection to the Clintons:
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 1975 Bill and Hillary Clinton honeymooned on Haiti, meeting Beauvoir and attending a ceremony. “After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man,” Bill Clinton recalled."

            A Mod is saying i augmented JJBrine's web page: ??
           </p>
           <p>
            HOW?
           </p>
           <p>
            another bizarre turn of events: If i type a  "RANDON SEARCH TITLE" in to a search engine, How can that CHANGE what is found on a Webpage? &gt;&gt;Example&gt;&gt; 
explain how typing JJ Brine Voat/ Pizzagate into a search engine is going to CHANGE the search box on HIS webpage?????? Are you saying google is changing that for him???? Because i didn't change anything to that search box, i found it on the web, the web!! EXPLAIN THAT!
I was asked to remove that link for this post, this post was deleted by MODS 2 TIMES already, citing rule #3 and this link:
            <a href="https://jjbrine.wordpress.com/?s=brine+voat%2Fpizzagate">
             https://jjbrine.wordpress.com/?s=brine+voat%2Fpizzagate
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I found it ALREADY on the net,doing a search.  You can put anything into the search box, but is didn't. i found it THAT way.
Mods sayin' i augmented that link,how??
My mistake not have taken a screen shot off the web, didn't know i was going into a battle with MODS, i thought WE were battling PEDOS?!?!

             Ok, yes you too!! right ,in plain sight! It's like mini-me Aquino! His life is like tentacle porn - going in many directions,hence it's been a challenge to pick which side to cover. Ok he's in DC now, there's gotta be ties to Pedo-ring scum there. I said he worked for Scowcroft,and the American- Turkish Council too. IF you go down that rabbit hole you find a Sybil Edmond FBI coverup spy story of the ATC having foreign turkish spies on US soil.The Kicker in all of this the trail leads back to

             "certain Turkish diplomats, were indeed under FBI investigation.  And all this put together means that people like Dennis Hastert probably were- and perhaps still are- on the payroll of Turkish ‘deep state’ interests." &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

             the next question is : Was the ATC ,with DENNIS HASTERT  at the helm, sex trafficking kids in a joint State Dept Op? How does this relate to JJ Brine? Swordfish69 said something about art Galleries, music scene,,JJBrine is a link to all of this  CORBETT INTERVIEW :

              Excellent!!! Yes, i had seen the connection to the turkish council as well on wikipedia and was floored!  i wish i had more time to investigate!
             </p>
             <p>
              this guy looks like every douche, would be artist that can't make art, i ever met... 
BUT he worked for scowcroft!?? HUGE flag there, most of these type people never even finished college, or have a BA perhaps.... not government types if you know what i mean. 
He looks insane in every single photo. 
the baby one though...... who would let that guy hold their baby like that!!!??? sick

            : Is this just a post about Clintonites? Or is there some connection to child abuse/trafficking? If so, it appears to be buried. Please edit your post to feature it prominently so we can leave this up.

             Ok, i copy that. Not a post about clinonites. The Sex Stains played at the SAME art exhibition place in NYC that JJ Brine had his art show at. Past that, it will take much longer to dig out more info. I got some leads,maybe in hast i throw this post up, incomplete, but it contains links and info ,i haven't seen other places.
Do what you want, hours putting this together is on the chopping block again?
