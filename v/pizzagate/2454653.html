            ASK ANYONE when they first heard about Katy Perry and most would agree it was when she released her huge 2008 hit I Kissed A Girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            For years, people have speculated who the song, which alludes to Perry kissing a girl and liking it, was about.
           </p>
           <p>
            The singer has previously said everything from Scarlett Johansson to Angelina Jolie’s lips inspired the catchy tune but now Miley Cyrus is claiming the song was written about her.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an interview with WKTU radio station, the Malibu singer claims Perry’s colossal hit was written about a kiss the two shared almost 10 years ago, when Cyrus was 15.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miley Cyrus kisses Katy Perry on stage in February, 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the hosts asked Cyrus if any of her friends had congratulated her on the success of her new song Malibu, the singer brought up Perry.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Katy Perry and I have been friends for a long time. We were actually just realising that next year we’ve been friends for 10 years. I think she’s my friend who I’ve known the longest which is really, really cool,” she told the station.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cyrus and Perry have been friends for over 10 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Cause when she came out with I Kissed A Girl I was doing the Hannah Montana movie and I heard her on the radio and they said ‘Who’d you write that about?’ and she said me. And I was on a four-wheeler at the time and I heard it and I started screaming and freaking out and then she asked me to go to the MTV VMAs with her,” she told the radio station.
           </p>
           <p>
            “And she took me but my mum didn’t want me to go by myself, stranger danger, so my mum went with me in the limo with Katy Perry. And my mum didn’t really get the joke. She just thought it was cool that I got to go with Katy Perry, so yeah that’s how we met,” she added.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a 2009 interview with Q Magazine, Perry told the publication the lyrics were inspired by her friendship with a girl as a teenager.
“I did kiss her. I was totally obsessed with her. She was beautiful — porcelain skin, perfect lips,” she said.

            I think her fiance Chris Hemsworth is onto it. He's encouraged her to move to Byron Bay. And a few months ago she made a statement saying she never really wrote any of her music.
"I don't know, I didn't write the song, so I have no idea," she said of the tune, which was written by a songwriting team of Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly and Jessica Cornish. "Honestly, I picked that song because I needed something to go with my clothing line. I didn't write it and … I didn't expect it to be popular, originally. It was just something that I wanted to do, and I needed some songs and it turned out for the best."
           </p>
           <p>
            Although she said "Party in the U.S.A." is "not even my style of music," she is thankful for its success.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I'm really blessed for it to have done as well as it has. Totally blessed," she said. "God has definitely put me in an amazing position with amazing people."

            Cyrus knows and understands she is going to get criticism from those that are mature enough to see her tricks but her team of PR and lawyers will keep us at bay until the conditioning is broadcast. See, we forget. We already endured our conditioning and most of us have no idea the modes of control it debilitates us with. THIS conditioning isn't meant to set in for quite some time, yes, it has it's immediate effects and we could analyze those all day, yet the latent conditioning that is being put into young people now isn't meant to fully effect them until it becomes part of their other selves and begins effecting their adult lives, as our conditioning is now.

              Try to look for examples in your own life. I know, in my own life, I feel as though hours and hours of sitting in front of the TV version of "The Hulk" and emulating his behavior - "You don't want to see me when I get mad" influenced me to some degree. There are modes you may not even recognize, say, sentimentality perhaps, how "Happy Days" and "Little House On The Prairie" might make you yearn for those "better days" and instill in you a feeling of foreboding, change, and loneliness.
             </p>
             <p>
              The two most overused EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS they use to RAPE you are VENGEANCE AND SENTIMENTALITY. If you look at recurring themes in movies and entertainment you will see an overabundance of these themes which shows us WHAT TRAITS THEY WANT TO BE AT THE FOREFONT OF THE HUMAN ID...NOONE gets away with being bad and always gets their just desserts, and, as I said above, they like to touch one "the good old days' to make you believe things were better in the past, which they were and they weren't considering the same old playbook has been played on us as humans for centuries.

              You might have become aware but to believe you have 'broken' the conditioning is like an alcoholic saying he can contain his illness.

               Just like an alcoholic you first have to admit your illness. I realize I have been brainwashed, so step 1 completed.  Now I need to deal with my illness, just as an alcoholic would. Working on that. As you state " but to believe you have 'broken' the conditioning is like an alcoholic saying he can contain his illness" is a negative view. Many do deal with their illness. Yes, they know they are an alcoholic, but have learned how to deal with it. I'm learning to deal with the brainwashing, lol.

            Oh My God.  Watch the whole thing.  at 1M  she cuts her toes off with a big Butcher Knife and Pink Bubble Gum Blood pours out.  Teddy Bears and floating boddies in the pool that at one point look like dead bodies.  Shades of Poltergeist with Heather O'Rourke.  The hot dogs on the floor,  and then the Black Guy on the floor sticks one in his mouth.  NO MILEY it's not your mouth and you can sing what you want to.  They are scripting every word.  Every Word.
