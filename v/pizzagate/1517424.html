<p>I looked into this, and found one thread about him here on Voat:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1433773">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1433773</a></p>
<p>His name is Ed Opperman; he runs a private investigation agency in Colorado; he has a paralegal degree, and worked with law firms / retired NYPD officers at one point. Seems pretty legit, and everyone was pretty excited, especially after he released this show:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouA1NFhjwaU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouA1NFhjwaU</a></p>
<p>He commented that, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>if 5% of the folks that listened to my pizzagate show and are all so outraged about it, just bought a 3 month subscription to The Opperman Report I could put together a team of investigators and PR to blow that thing wide open. Not even 5% maybe 1%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyways, I\'m not vouching for him, not telling you to give him money. I\'m just curious: what happened? He seems to have fallen off the map, and everyone stopped talking about him for some reason.</p>',

            Ed is a good man, and hosts a great show.  I heard him mention that, and I would be curious to see him on the case.  In fact, the Opperman Report is recommended listening-- scratch that-- the Opperman Report is REqUIRED listening for all pizzagate researchers.
            <br/>
            I became aware of Ed Opperman &amp; the Opperman Report just this November 2016 while searching itunes podcasts for "pizzagate".  I suggest you review selections from his 2016 podcasts as I did this December, and you will be better eqipped to reapproach these investigations.
            <br/>
            As you will see, Ed was essentially on this case before it broke.  His 2016 shows are basically a literature review for pizzagate investigators.
