<p>Accusations of pedophilia seem to follow the globalists and elitist politicians wherever they go. This does not surprise me. They often exhibit characteristics of narcissism and psychopathy, but their ideology of moral relativity is what would lead to such horrible crimes.</p>
<p>Evil often stems from people who are empty. When one abandons conscience, one also in many respects abandons empathy and love.  Without these elements of our psyche there is no happiness. Without them, there is nothing left but desire and gluttony.</p>
<p>Narcissists in particular are prone to use other people as forms of entertainment and fulfillment without concern for their humanity.  They can be vicious in nature, and when taken to the level of psychopathy, they are prone to target and abuse the most helpless of victims in order to generate a feeling of personal power.</p>

              Why would anyone down-voat this most excellent article? Written by a patriot and intellectual leader of the USA Militia/Patriot Networks.
             </p>
             <p>
              IMHO Voat is not what it appears, they're not investigating, Millenial-Falcon aka king-kong his job isn't investigation his job is normalization of the content, and feed the NYT narrative. What Brandon Smith does here is lay out the entire pizzagate case like a lawyer.
             </p>
             <p>
              I ask again, why are the MOD's running a down-voat brigade to destroy the truth?

            The media did try to attack Trump about being on Epstein plane, but it is also verified he did not engage in any ill acts. The media can not pursue this because if they do, they will open a can of worms they don't want to that will come back on all of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can say is support Trump, he is the only one on the good side of all this in his position.

            "Recognize and take solace that though we live in dark times, and evil men roam free, we are also here. We are the proper response to evil, and we have been placed here at this time for a reason. Call it fate, call it destiny, call it coincidence, call it god, call it whatever you want, but the answer to evil is us." -My favorite part! Very interesting read, thanks.
