<p>We should undertake a psychological campaign of demoralization/repetetive-negative-entrainment against them. Every time you see an obvious shill comment, reply along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time you post one of these comments you are protecting people who torture, rape, and murder children. </p>

<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a person who gets paid to protect child rapists.</p>

<p>Every time you see someone you love, you will think to yourself &quot;I get paid to protect child rapists&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>etc., in your own phrasing, with your own twist, or exactly the same, doesn\'t really matter. Even if there are four replies like that already on the comment, make another one. If there\'s one thing we\'ve all learned from experience with shills, it\'s that they do check their inbox, diligently. The idea is to repetitively confront them with what they\'re doing over and over and over again and build a negative psychological response into their psyche. <strong>Never engage with the content of their post in any way</strong>. If they reply to you, no matter what they say, just write another one of those messages telling them very directly what they\'re doing.</p>
<p>The messages shouldn\'t be angry either. For two reasons, firstly, shills are trolls, secondly, (I\'m not no god damn psychologist but bear with me) anger makes the message less effective at working it\'s way into the shill\'s psyche. When some angry person yells at you &quot;fuck you, you\'re a fucking retarded asshole&quot; that\'s just an angry person being angry and you can more or less laugh it off. Anger prompts an immediate denial/defense/dismissal response. When large number of people are repeating to you in clear, direct, unemotional language, that you are an accomplice to child torture, rape, and murder, presenting you with nonthreatening, straightforward sentences that just happen to be designed to build habits into your cognition (e.g. the third example), the knee-jerk anger defense reflex isn\'t triggered and the ideas are processed more deeply.</p>
<p>At some point the shill will either quit out of inability to deal with the cognitive dissonance, or, by some unlikely miracle, actually grow a conscience and realize what they\'re doing. It\'s my guess that the majority of shills are bad people but they\'re not psychopathic, mass murderer, pedophiles, they just have weak morals and want the pay, or they\'ve bought some kind of political brainwashing. Some of them can be broken with repetition. If you just write a few of these replies and keep them in text somewhere, you can just paste them whenever you see a shill. Originality is not necessary. Only truth and repetition.</p>',
