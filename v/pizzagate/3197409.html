<p>&quot;A SEX fiend who speaks English and wears a surgical mask is understood to be the kidnapper Portuguese police now fear may have snatched Madeleine McCann.</p>
<p>In one attack he broke into a British family\'s home and loomed over a seven-year-old girl who woke up and asked &quot;Is that you Daddy?&quot; and he replied &quot;Yes&quot; in a foreign accent.

<p>The seven-year-old girl from the UK woke to find the pervert laying next to her in bed wearing a medical mask.</p>
<p>Detectives have discovered a creep carried out nearly 30 attacks within a 40-mile radius of the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where Maddie vanished from 12 years ago today.</p>
<p>He crept into Algarve properties rented by families and many victims were British.</p>
<p>And a judicial source is reported to have confirmed the unnamed man was definitely in Portugal at the time the three-year-old suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>And the insider also alleged he was KNOWN to local cops and had previously been investigated on suspicion of involvement in paedophile cases.</p>
<p>A chilling reconstruction features in the final episode of Netflix\'s recently released eight-part documentary The Disappearance Of Madeleine McCann.</p>
<p>Portuguese cops are believed to be working on a tip off from Scotland Yard about an alleged foreign paedophile.</p>
<p>Maddie’s parents Kate and Gerry are kept updated of any significant new development in the Met Police investigation, aided by their foreign counterparts.</p>
<p>But their spokesperson Clarence Mitchell declined to discuss the latest claim, saying: “We will not be commenting whatsoever on operational details in either Britain or Portugal.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not in a position to talk about it.”

<p>A friend of the McCann’s added: “It is just odd that news of this possible new lead has come out of the anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance and we’re wondering if it could have been made up.&quot;</p>
<p>Investigators Anthony Summers and his wife Robbyn Swan, who penned a book about the case and narrated the Netflix doc, said the masked intruder was one of at least 12 suspects police are probing.</p>
<p>Anthony said: &quot;From what the little girls told their parents afterwards, the man had come into the room wearing a sort of medical mask. He had a funny smell.\'\'</p>
<p>Robyn said the holiday company that operated the Ocean Club resort where the McCanns were staying had refused to comment on whether or not they knew of these sexual assaults.</p>
<p>She said the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had declined to comment on why British holidaymakers had not been warned.</p>
<p>Of the Maddie case she told the documentary: &quot;Would they have left their children alone had they known there was a sexual predator about?&quot;</p>
<p>Maddie\'s parents Kate and Gerry have already slammed the new Netflix documentary saying it “won’t help” the search for their daughter.
\'KNOWN TO COPS\'</p>
<p>The family also believe the controversial new film could “fuel conspiracy theorists”, their spokesman said earlier.
A Met Police spokesperson said: &quot;We have no response to this – we will not be giving a running commentary of an ongoing investigation.”</p>
<p>The new suspect\'s nationality was not revealed in today\'s reports.</p>
<p>Respected news website Expresso claimed: “The PJ (Policia Judiciaria) is following a tip received from Scotland Yard and sent recently to Portugal relating to the Madeleine McCann case, Expresso has learned from a judicial source.</p>
<p>“According to the source, it relates to a complaint made about a foreigner who was in Portugal in May 2007, when the English girl disappeared from a tourist complex in Praia da Luz.</p>
<p>“The suspect is no stranger to Portuguese police. At the time the PJ investigated him on suspicion of being involved in cases of paedophilia but in light of the information coming from London, the investigators are looking into this case in more detail.&quot;</p>
<p>The source told the website: “This is a line of investigation that is still open. Like others.”

<p>The PJ are already said to have spoken to witnesses who could help in connection with the new lead.</p>
<p>Asked this morning to comment on the latest reports in Portugal, including the Correio story about Portuguese police having a &quot;new suspect&quot; and &quot;new lead,&quot; Portugal\'s Attorney General\'s office repeated an answer it gave last month to a question about whether Scotland Yard had formally requested more help via rogatory letters.
A spokesman said: “Regarding these facts, as is public knowledge, an inquiry in the Portimao section of the Faro DIAP Public Prosecutors Office is ongoing. It is under investigation.”</p>
<p>The news coincides with the 12th anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance as the youngster\'s parents vowed to carry on looking for their daughter &quot;for as long as it takes&quot;.</p>
<p>Parents Kate and Gerry McCann said on their Official Find Maddie Campaign website: &quot;It\'s that time of year again.
KATE AND GERRY\'S PAIN</p>
<p>&quot;As much as we\'d like to fast forward the first couple of weeks of May, there\'s no getting around it.</p>
<p>&quot;The months and years roll by too quickly; Madeleine will be sixteen this month. It’s impossible to put into words just how that makes us feel.</p>
<p>&quot;There is comfort and reassurance though in knowing that the investigation continues and many people around the world remain vigilant.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you to everyone who continues to support us and for your ongoing hope and belief.&quot;</p>
<p>Three-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished during a family holiday in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May 2007.</p>
<p>She had been left sleeping alone with her younger twin siblings while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas restaurant with pals at the seaside complex.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was revealed Scotland Yard has asked for more funding as it continues to follow up leads in the disappearance.</p>
<p>British police launched their own investigation, Operation Grange, in 2013 after a Portuguese inquiry failed to make progress.</p>
<p>Force bosses have been applying for funding from the Home Office every six months to continue the inquiry, which has cost about £11.75 million.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Kate joined friends and well wishers to remember her daughter on the painful 12th anniversary of her disappearance.</p>
<p>Last November, a further £150,000 was granted  and Maddie\'s parents told of their delight at being given fresh hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Relevance: The disappearance of Madeline McCann is where a lot of Pizzagate originates.</p>',

            There must be someone out there with a heart that saw Podestas there and can anonymously talk about it. I know it’s dangerous territory but apart from the blatant photo fits there’s not much. We need some witness statements. someone must’ve seen these scumbags!

            As an Englishman who has followed this case since it first occurred. There's a huge disinformation push on social media. Please read the Gaspar statement to Lincs Police found here.

             Shit, that's a lot of new info to parse.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Uri Geller, linked to Mossad, is related to Clement Freud, who befriended the McCanns in Portugal."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             That's weird - second time today I heard a reference to him. I can't remember where I heard his name today, but I think it was listening to XM radio on Ozzy's Boneyard LOL.  Some old rocker droning on about something.
            </p>
            <p>
             His name came up as being Mossad years and years ago.  Maybe it's time to look into Uri the Spoon Bender?
            </p>

              Watching now. LOL. Uri seems to be front and center of everything. “Spoon bender” suuuure. Is that now euphemism for “Mossad Spy” ? Doesn’t he also live in Hampstead, near Tavistock? So weird, these connections. One day I hope to visit this Hampstead place but I’m scared I’ll vibrate into hell from all the hinkyness :(

              <p>
               In March 2008, intelligence received by the UK Police suggested there was an organised child abduction ring from Belgium which had Madeleine stolen to order.
              </p>
              <p>
               In Belgium there have been over 100 witness reports linked to Madeleine through a hotline for missing children.
              </p>
              <p>
               A child therapist said she was "100 per cent sure" she saw Madeleine at a restaurant in the Belgian town of Tongeren, on July 28 2007.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Metropolitan Police intelligence unit, in an e-mail, stated:'Intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken.
              </p>
              <p>
               'Somebody connected to this group saw Madeleine and took a photograph of her. The purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and Madeleine was taken.'
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              This is so sad. The only thing that gives me hope, is that she could still be alive.

              Never ending lunacy. So, were Ger n Kate SPIES? I’m on board with that theory. Clement pals took her then called his son (Matthew Freud) who sent his no 1 guy Clarence Mitchell straight over to navigate the fallout. The incestuousness!

             Oh Jesus, that's not what I expected. To be honest, my gut's telling me that isn't her. Maddy's eyes look hazel, this poor model's look brown. It's too hard to tell from what facial structures to judge, since she's still young and I don't want to look at it any longer.

                 I agree - not the same girl.  Most of those photos also look like they are from the 1990s.

               I don't know of a way to flair a comment, MH. I looked at the images, and none of them is explicit enough to allow me to remove it as illegal speech under U.S. law, I don't think.

                Packages will provide some very powerful abilities to 'flair' comments (or even highlight keywords, if you remember that convo from a little while back) when they're implemented on the front end. However, users will need to subscribe themselves to a published package in order for them to see the effects.
