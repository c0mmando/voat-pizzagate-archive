            Wow King is still breathing the  same air as  other  peeps??? I can't  believe  it-what I also  cannot  understand  is  why someone  in  military  intelligence  hasn't  given  this monster some free lead

            Excellent post, even if some of it is a rehash. I have hunch that Aquino is a critical element in unraveling and exposing the true extent of MKULTRA. Through him, perhaps the whole cabal of ‘trainers’ and clients can be exposed... that’s my hunch.

            I had almost forgotten about King, but he is super important. How fortunate for Justice, that he is still findable.

            a 2013 post on their fb page states that they are live recording at Brookhouse International School (elementary school) in Nairobi, Kenya. Wonder if Larry King made the trip to entertain the kids like he did back in the Boys Town days?

            Lawrence E.King allegedly works at Food Lion supermarket, Leesburg, Va per my life. Same supermarket owned by a Belgian conglomerate Ahold Delhaize whose  international headquarters is in Zaandam, Netherlands.
They do a lot of home delivery with their Peapod service. On their board of directors sits a senior advisor from Blackstone Advisory Partners. Stephen A. Schwarzman, the Chairman, CEO, and Co-founder of Blackstone Group, is a Bush Pioneer (see Bush's Rangers) having raised at least $100,000 for Bush in the 2004 presidential election. [1]
Henry Kissinger’s good friend Lord Jacob Rothschild sat on Blackstone’s International Advisory Board
           </p>
           <p>
            Another job reference listed was BMW of Sterling,VA owned by Thomas A. Moorehead .the world’s first African American Rolls Royce car dealer.Owned his first dealership, selling Buicks in Omaha, Neb.While giving a tour of his office, Moorehead seems slightly embarrassed as he points to pictures of himself with presidents Obama and Clinton
           </p>
           <p>
            What are friends for if not to help out a guy in a pinch??? King has connections that have survived the Franklin Coverup.
What are other kind of politically connected employees does Food Lion and/or Thomas Moorehead employ?

             Warren Buffet is passed off as some kind of folksy hero -- the super rich guy who still drives a beat up car and lives in a small house.  Best case scenario is that he is simply a cash hoarder.  Worst case scenario is that he prefers to spend his money on "hobbies" that can't be discussed in public.

              yes indeedy we have been saying forever that this dude is Teflon Don. Nothing sticks and he seems to escape every scandal scottfree. Even notoriously private David Ge*fen has had the spotlight on him recently

              but you will never see anything about WB. As Carm and I have pointed out before, too many coincidences re Franklin for him not to be directly implicated.

               Oh, yes the Pedo B-day Party given for Ge$$en.  Amazing WB was not there. His being omitted makes it even more obvious.  Notice some of the biggest Pedos were not mentioned or invited.  SS  GL  and WB.  I just can't imagine he was not part of those trips to the WH parties with the Boy Scouts. He was from Omaha after all and has connections to L King through his wife.  And YES Please Journos Please make us a nice Warm Glass of Milk and a Heather O'Rourke article.  We need our sleep.

              and I have been saying this for months.  But just try and find anything about him.  Hmm.  Yeah, it's called Scrubbing the Past.  A couple of months ago I found something on Democratic Underground about how he saw him holding hands with Larry King (the black one) holding and they were getting married.  I have no proof that it happened.  And I was extremely shocked to read such a revelation, whether true or not.  I just posted the one about him living with some woman for years now, no marriage.  So a possible Beard?  Someone should do a Post on Warren Buffet.  Takers Anyone?

            #4 "One of King's earliest boosters was the wife of a man with an unrivaled reputation for shrewed investments - Warren Buffett.
           </p>
           <p>
            Larry King (not THAT one), the founder of Nebraska's notorious Franklin Credit Union. King was, in the mid-'80s, Nebraska's most prominent Black Republican. He sang the national anthem at the 1984 and 1988 Republican National Conventions, was a pal of George HW Bush (who was recognized at a number of King's "parties"), laundered Iran/Contra money, ran a pedophile ring which catered to elites (he flew young boys and girls all over the country, including many times to Washington), and subjected children to satanic ritual abuse. He's behind bars now, and recently lost a million dollar lawsuit by one of "his" boys for years of torture and exploitation.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Backing from Buffett's socialite wife, Susie, came early in the rise of Larry King. Susie Buffett was a volunteer at the credit union in the early days. According to the Lincoln Journal-Star of March 19, 1989, King 'liked to tell the story of a woman coming to the credit union to see him and being told to return at 7:00 the next morning because he was so busy. The woman was Susie Buffett, wife of billionaire Warren Buffett, and she did come back to offer her help at the credit union.' For years, it has been part of Larry King lore in Omaha, that the Buffett's hosted a tenth wedding anniversary party for him and Alice."
           </p>
           <p>
            Warren Buffett lives with a woman named Astrid Menks. The Wall Street Journal reported that he met her in 1977 when Susie brought her home from the nightclub where Menks was a waitress, called The French Cafe. The French Cafe, a number of King's "children" testified, was also the scene of a number of "parties" at which they were assaulted and raped by wealthy and prominent citizens of Omaha.

             On fire Carm. I don't know how LK hasn't been Arkancided at this point. Surely that's less expensive that 'protecting' him. Buff is 87. Is he collecting new hearts like Rockefeller?

             He married Menks after Susan died. Did Susan originally distance herself because she wanted to get away from whatever proclivities were going down in Omaha? Of course, this 'official' story is hogwash

              What a bunch of wack jobs.  They are not fooling me.  Those two women know what he is doing and he is not doing it with them.  Notice how his biographer has to chime in that he loves the ladies.  Again, not fooling me.  All the talk about how thrifty they are and Simple Folk, My Butt!  I bet they do a lot of secret stuff on they sly.  If not, they are a bunch of Crazy Bed Bugs.  Edit.  I bet those cokes he drinks are followed by some Dark Red Chasers (and I don't mean wine).

            How in the world can King be hired to do work with a "Christian" ministry choir?  I know Jesus said that you are supposed to forgive, but that forgiveness only comes after someone has actually confessed their sins and asked for forgiveness.  He has paid his debt to society for the embezzlement charges, but NOT for the rape and trafficking of children.  So, that "Christian" organization can't possibly be a true Christian organization.  Even God doesn't forgive unless you repent.  I don't think the rest of us should be expected to be more forgiving than God.

            And I don't care how great a singer he was.  Hitler was a pretty good painter, too, but I doubt that -- had he not committed suicide --- Hitler would have been able to make a case that he should be forgiven for his crimes and get to live out his life as a painter.

             We should be making a list for judgment day..
All organisations that employ these people and their employees , including government establishmnet ..should be. be given a notice to leave these organisations ..if no action is taken to ostracise these people...
The notice should be provided by registered post and recorded in an open source database..
I informed a police organisation who r allowing and thereby condoning smuggling , black money laundering from proceeds of criminal activity like drugs ..child prostitution ..kidnapping..etc
Literally out in the open..with the police statiin right next door ..within yards of this activity..i have informed them of the tax consultants who in colllusion with tax authorites aid in black money laundering.. .next i will give them one month to clean house
..A public notice in the gazette..is a followup for inaction..
Then it is a record for life..When judgement day comes the employees who stay on without taking action will have no excuse.

               True, but if the tide ever does turn, I think it would be good to have a master list of people who need to be removed from any and all connection to positions of power.  I hope one day we'll get enough of the public woken up to the reality of the psychopaths ruining this nation and when that happens, we are going to need to clean house.  I want to make sure that the worst of the worst are at the top of the list.

               I'm sure he does but just to cover all our bases we probably should have a "most wanted" list of sorts. It helps to identify the enemy to friendlies who may not have the skills, time or care to put the research in.
