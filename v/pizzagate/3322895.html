<p>We speak with Vicky Ward, an investigative journalist who profiled Jeffrey Epstein for Vanity Fair in 2003 in a piece headlined “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” <strong>The magazine’s editor at the time, Graydon Carter, cut out the testimonies of two young women Epstein allegedly molested who had spoken to Ward on the record.</strong> Ward later wrote about the incident for The Daily Beast in an article headlined “I Tried to Warn You About Sleazy Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.”</p>

<p>AMY GOODMAN: So, that is very significant, because you were pregnant at the time you were doing this piece.</p>
<p>VICKY WARD: Yes.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: Can you describe what happened to you when you wrote this piece? You spoke to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>VICKY WARD: Oh, multiple times, multiple times. He wheeled out, you know, all these important bankers and academics and financiers to talk to me. And <strong>he would call me all the time, but he would threaten me. He would talk, and then he would say, “You know, Vicky, if I don’t like this piece, you know, something is going to happen to your unborn children.”</strong> You know, and that way, he would sort of say it, you know, lightly, but I went to the magazine’s general counsel at the time.</p>

            I'm gonna take a break now. This stuff is just way too intense. I thought the man was a filthy pedophile, now I see, he's way worse. Just way worse and I didn't think that was possible. Hopefully he won't spend too much time in prison..... you know what I mean?

            This beast is such a vile piece of shit. Threatening unborn children how low do you have to go? He obviously LOVES publicity and having his name spread around it shows the untouchable power he thought he had by all his blackmail. In addition, he never made his money through Wall Street, he made it by stealing working peoples pensions, etc. Same with Peter Brant and both spent time in jail for a couple measly months.

            I read yesterday that Vanity Fair redacted her draft in order to protect Epstein, but this is worse than I had imagined.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a side note, the article she wrote mentions that Epstein managed the finances of the Queen (at least partly).

             You Are Guilty Until Proven Otherwise
“All things are subject to interpretation; whichever interpretation prevails at any given time is a function of power and not truth.” – Nietszche
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The common colloquialism “you are innocent until proven guilty” is patently false. We hear it growing up. We hear it in the movies and on TV. We are conditioned to believe it by the echo chamber of a hoodwinked society. We have convinced each other that we are innocent until proven guilty. But when it really comes down to it, in the thick of it, when you’re facing down the egotistical power trip of a police officer or a correctional officer in a county jail, you are, in their eyes, guilty until proven guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            The judge will talk a big game in court or in a trial, telling the jury that you are “innocent until proven guilty,” but subconsciously even the jury goes into the process thinking you are guilty until proven innocent through a strange kind of reverse psychology. The reality is that you are guilty until proven otherwise, unless you have money. If you have money, you can pay your way into innocence, or at least bail and the chance to work on your innocence. If you don’t have money, however, you are stuck in jail and treated like a criminal long before you are ever found guilty or not. It’s not pretty. The guards treat you like an animal and there is no recompense for your ill-treatment or time taken if you are found not guilty. And this happens every day to thousands of people in thousands of counties across the country. “Sick” does not even begin to describe it.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              You Do NOT Have the Right to a Speedy Trial
This is yet another common colloquialism that we are all culturally conditioned to believe in. The sad truth is that trials can take months and even years to develop. My trial took nearly three years to develop. An appeal trial typically takes two years and you are forced to remain behind bars during the duration of the appeal. This means if you have a two year sentence and you appeal it and win, you still have to serve that time and there is no compensation for lost time. It’s a common tragedy. A right to a speedy trial is supposed to be a constitutional right. This is yet another way that the so-called judicial system violates our right through naked tyranny disguised as justice.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The US is the Most Incarcerated Nation on the Planet
“Injustice everywhere is a threat to justice anywhere.” – Martin Luther King Jr.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Living in what is wildly considered the “land of the free” this one should come as a body blow to anybody who truly believes in freedom. The US prison population has grown by 500% over the last 30 years. So, the United States has less than 5% of the world’s population, yet it has almost 20% of the world’s total prison population. Even though crime is at a historic low.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is an unprecedented war on freedom, a clear sign that the tyranny of the state will use its monopoly on violence (militarized police) to stomp on the liberties of its citizens and keep them in check, all under the illusion of freedom, safety, and security. Law and order itself must not become entrenched lest we slip further into tyranny. There must be checks and balances. It begins by eradicating outdated, overreaching, violent, immoral, ad unjust laws. As Francis Bacon said, “Things alter for the worst, spontaneously, if they be not altered for the better designedly.”
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Civil Asset Forfeiture
“The state is nothing more nor less than a bandit gang writ large.” – Ludwig Von Mises
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            As if police brutality, extortion, and overreach of power weren’t enough, unscrupulous forfeiture laws that give them permission to seize, keep, or sell any property allegedly involved in a crime. The key word is “allegedly,” because most of the time property is taken without someone even being charged with a crime. That’s insane!
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally meant to be used on large-scale criminal organizations, it is now used almost entirely on individuals, ruining people’s lives over petty crimes. More and more police departments are using forfeiture to benefit their bottom lines. It’s less about fighting crime and more about profit. A blatant loop hole that the state takes advantage of at the expense of its people. HBO’s John Oliver did an excellent piece that gets right at the heart of this issue.
           </p>

             The Thin Blue Line is a Big Fat Problem
“There’s no weakness as great as false strength.” – Stefan Molyneux
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Most people falsely assume that it is the sworn duty of a police officer to protect and serve. But it is actually the exception, not the rule. A cop’s only duty is to enforce laws; most of which are outdated, immoral, violent, and unjust. A cop who protects and serves is doing so in a humane capacity and not because he/she is obligated to do so. They just happen to be acting humanely while wearing a badge.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reality is that power tends to corrupt. This applies especially to police. And especially-especially to militarized police who are trained to be oppressive, overreaching, violent extortionists enforcing a statist agenda. And especially times-three to cops who uphold the “Thin Blue Line” and do not hold other cops accountable. Without accountability power becomes absolute and corrupts absolutely.

             Was just watching a few videos on Fomenko and our “timeline” here on earth. They control everything, which I knew to a degree, but manufacturing  / deleting multi-hundred year periods of time is incredible. They legitimately want the world to be the exact opposite of natural and true. I don’t know what to do, everything is a lie.
