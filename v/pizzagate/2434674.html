            Myrtle Beach is a terrible place. There are evil cults, constant ritualistic events, wiccans, satanists, weird supernatural odd events.... spooky place. Most of my occult experiences happened there. There were satanists everywhere. There is intense polarized racism and a tradition of low education. As a tourist town in a rural community, it has a constant transient population of migrant workers, carnies, hippies, petty criminals and druggies. During the summer, it is one of the craziest places I have ever seen. There are so many stories to tell about this nutsoid place.

            <em>
             Former U.S. Education Secretary Dick Riley, a Greenville Democrat and former South Carolina governor, endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             “Hillary Clinton has spent a lifetime getting results for women, children and families,” he said. “She will spend every day as president working to help hard-working South Carolinians get ahead and stay ahead.”
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Meanwhile, former Gov. Jim Hodges, the last Democrat to occupy South Carolina’s governor’s mansion, is set to endorse Clinton on Wednesday, Clinton’s campaign said.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Hodges is to moderate an event with Hillary for American Campaign Chair John Podesta, a former senior adviser and chief of staff to President Barack Obama.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Riley, 82, served as governor from 1979-87 and worked as U.S. education secretary from 1993-2001.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             “Hillary is smart, grounded and focused on the issues that matter most to South Carolinians,” Riley said. “Back in the 1970s, she came to South Carolina to help children. As first lady of Arkansas, she and I worked together to reduce infant mortality rates in Southern states. She wants to get things done and will fight for the underdogs – that’s the way she's always been.”

This swiss-cheesy innuendo approach is very similar to the disinfo posts we regularly get in here to distract researchers and slide relevant content off the board.  Due to this, and the fact that you have not actually established a connection to the elite yet, I'm going to give this a 24 Hour Reprieve flair. Please edit to make the assertions of your post clear, as well as the sources that support them, and add evidence of some plausible connection to elite child abuse. Reply to this comment when you've done so to see if we can remove the flair.

             To clarify further, February 14th is a day of ritual in honor of Nimrod, which the Masons worship and makes the release date of the main perp of this thread significant. I hope people will actually read the thread I created and linked to. It involves a LEO who videotaped himself raping a child on Valentine's Day.

                All you really need to do is provide the links that prove the guy is in the military and that his dad is a defense contractor. You can paste the permalink to the comment where the evidence was posted in next to the text of the post that's relevant.

                  Unlikely. There is no way to search or sort by flair. It's already an extra workload on mods to come back and review flaired posts to see if they've been fixed. Having to scroll back days to do it would really suck. Our hope is that editing posts will become a regular crowdsourced activity that happens pretty fast, and that in the process, everyone's awareness of how to satisfy the submission requirements will increase and the overall number of problem posts will fall.

                   I don't mean the time frame. I mean have the editing feature, so the entire original thread can be viewed rather than just a few sentences at a time. It would be easier to cut and paste to arrange it in a kinder format if I could see everything.

                    You should be able to grab the lower right corner of the source window when you click "edit" and drag it to expand it as large as you want...at least if you're viewing on desktop. Mobile it's hit or miss...sometimes you can expand the edit window sometimes it just jukes around and gives you fits.

             Is it really doxing if a dangerous criminal with possible high level connections is out on bail? If you'd like to learn more about him, a great research tool is FamilyTreeNow dot com.

            No. Voat has a very, very liberal doxxing policy. Basically, as long as you are not trying to out a fellow voater, or sensitive personal information about anyone else like SSN, bank account numbers/passwords etc. you can share any typically publically available info here and it is not considered doxing. Addresses and telephone numbers and family tree info are not doxing (unless it's a Voat user).

            , can you add a paragraph to the beginning of your post with the info that has come in in Comments about how this might be relevant to Pizzagate (one guy is the son of a defense contractor). And, was this part of a CP/abuse RING they busted that might have higher connections?

              Voat takes people's right to privacy seriously, so if you delete a thread yourself, it will erase all the content in the post, but not the comments (which are other peoples' speech). Same if you delete a comment you have made. Voat despises mod censorship, so anything a mod deletes is not erased -- it remains viewable and linkable in Removed Submissions. So, if you have created a new post that contains a link to this post, DON'T delete yourself. Let mods remove it. The link will remain active and the text of the removed post will not be altered.

            I'd like to know the names of the other CHILD PREDATORS, HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, and the JOHNS. I'm also wondering the age of the prostitutes who were arrested under Operation Millstone.

              <p>
               This is his twitter, maybe someone on Twitter can look up his followers?

              I hope they haven't released him on bond. He has access to so many weapons and contacts, how could be not be a suicide risk, or be suicided?

               He was released on $12,500 bond according to the court search site.  All the bonds I've looked up for these arrests seem extremely low.

                You're amazing! Thanks for doing that, and I agree. To call them PREDATORS and letting them walk seems mighty suspicious. Maybe the cops are hoping they'll lead them to the other people they're looking for? $12,500 is very low according to a man who talks about working all the time on Twitter, and saying he misses his night shift. Hmm...

              Thanks for digging up that incredible info on his dad and verifying my theory that he was involved with the military. More military intelligence, just like we saw with one of the people Cruz, the Parkland shooter, was staying with as well as a neonatal intensive care nurse. Frightening...

            This is disgusting.  Why is he out?  Who signed off on that?  Someone is allowing this freak to get out of jail and he possibly will carry out what he did not finish.  Do they think he will just turn over a new leaf and mend his ways.  Oops I forgot, evidently someone thinks he is not guilty. Someone in the background is pulling the strings.

             I agree. This is exactly why I believe he has high level connections. At the very least, they should keep him in jail because he's a flight risk or might commit suicide. He's obviously not right in the head.

              Hopefully the tables will be turned and he will be sent back.  We had that happen the other day with that guy that had 300 charges of rape against him.  I am hoping that sheriff (if not involved) will pull out some tricks from his bag.

               I sure hope so! Especially since I just found out that the address he supposedly lives at is less than 2 miles from schools.

                The need to keep this guy under surveillance.  Do they even do that anymore?  Doesn't seem like it.  They have to actually catch him in the act, they can't entrap them.  Oops sorry your dead.

                 I'm sure they still do surveillance, and that they're on this guy like stink on shit. I'm wondering what's going on with the other traffickers they arrested. Are they out on bail, too?

            Remember that Myrtle Beach is a popular tourist area. If someone could do a search of missing kids in this area compared to surrounding area, that would be helpful.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the website I mentioned at the bottom of the thread, he had a PO Box in Myrtle Beach until July of 2017. He's moved around a lot. He's also lived in Colorado, North Carolina (he also had a PO Box here), and Virginia. There's no address listed for him before the age of 19 when he lived in Herndon, VA, which is only a 40 minute/24.2 mile drive to DC.

             Fascinating! Hard to tell right now if it's him or not, but thanks so much for posting that, and it most likely is. Excellent place to start for deeper digging into who he hangs with, and other places he's associated with.
