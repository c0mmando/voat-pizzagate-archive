<blockquote>
<p>(July 8, 2018)  In an emotional Facebook Live video....[late politician Awanui Black\'s widow] Anihera [Zhou Black] has claimed <strong>he and several other men sexually abused young girls and passed victims around \'like a box of beer.\'</strong></p>
<p>Weeping hysterically in the self-filmed video, she said on Saturday: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'I have an announcement to make on behalf of my kids and I and perhaps it will shock a lot of you and perhaps it will help some of you find some comfort... something that needs to be done.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She went on to explain how he would have affairs, orgies and abuse young girls with other paedophiles. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>\'He became a predator, a recruiter, a teacher, a pimp, a ringleader of one of the many child-adult sex rings here in his beloved Tauranga Moana and he took that s--- nationwide with all his contacts in every stream of life.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(July 10, 2018)  The widow who told the world her politician husband was a paedophile says he was involved in a ring of abusers which goes to &quot;the highest heights you can imagine&quot;.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview, Anihera Zhou Black told the Herald: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;This goes deep and wide, in terms of the paedophile ring, to the highest heights you can imagine. These people aren\'t just labourers and workers at fast food restaurants. These people are suits and people in power.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Awanui Black died aged 48 in 2016.</p>
<p>He was a regional councillor, Maori Party political aspirant, a commissioner at the Maori Language Commission, lecturer at Te Wananga o Raukawa and Treaty of Waitangi negotiator for Ngati Pukenga.</p>
<p>He was also a paedophile, according to Zhou Black\'s gut-wrenching Facebook Live broadcast yesterday.</p>
<p>Zhou Black, 49, with the support of sister Piiata Tiakitai-Turi, 50, said today her decision to denounce her former husband was intended to give strength to victims of abuse.</p>
<p>She told of her belief Black had used their marriage to mask his predatory sexual behaviour towards children and her growing horror as she realised he was not the man she had believed him to be.</p>
<p>The couple had met aged 15 and were in a relationship from 18. He went on to become a highly-regarded pillar of the Bay of Plenty community and someone with the mana required to stand on the national stage.</p>
<p>Her Facebook Live post - based on partial admissions from Black and disclosures from others - came after 26 years of silence.</p>
<p>And there were children, she said. The youngest victim to have emerged was someone who had said they were aged 8 when sexually abused by Awanui Black.</p>
<p>Anihera Zhou Black said in the time which followed [her final 2014 separation from her husband] there came disclosures, and events which occurred that answered questions in her mind from her years married to Awanui Black.</p>
<p><strong>It had led her to believe there was a &quot;ring&quot; of people who - with her former husband - had preyed on children.</strong></p>
<p>She said she would be speaking with police <strong>but believed an independent investigation could be necessary as one of those she believed was involved had been a police officer.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;We don\'t know where the cover up will begin. There are compromised police here in Tauranga that are part of that ring. I know of one.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She would also not name a number of suspected victims, again because it could jeopardise the police inquiry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It\'s an unknown figure, to be honest. I have knowledge of some but whoever else is out there, we\'ve just had so many people come through our lives.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A police spokesperson said they were aware of the video and would be seeking further information about the allegations.</p>
<p>In Tauranga, <strong>artist Graham Hoete, also known as Mr G, started painting over a mural he had made of Black.</strong></p>

            1) This has been going on for a long time.  I can't find the story on the internet, but in February 1963, QEII and Philip visited the Bay of Islands NZ with the royal yacht Britannia and stayed on private Roberton Island (now usually referred to by the Maori name).  Certainly a private location for whatever ... The same time period in which the young royal couple abducted children from the Indian school in BC, Canada.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Bay of Plenty has plenty of pedo history, as do the NZ gangs and police.  One woman I know was abducted, drugged, and gang raped age 15 by Hells Angels in Auckland circa 1980 - the police would not do anything.  The woman's mother had also been raped and impregnated at age 15 in 1955 in the Bay of Plenty by a NZ policeman.  Again, the authorities did nothing.  She gave birth to the baby who was adopted out.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) @ Carmencita: Jacinda is not a tranny, just stop that nonsense already!  (Michelle Obama - yes)  You can't hide that sort of thing in a country which socially is little more than a gossip filled small town.  But seriously, this has gotten out of hand. The world is full of unattractive women, but stop looking for trannies around every corner, it makes us look like idiots.  Jacinda is remarkable in another way though, she is extraordinarily stupid for a successful person.  IQ definitely below average.  Not a person one would expect to be successful in any fashion.  She can barely speak coherently.  I do not know her personally, but MK Ultra/Pedogate puppet is my hunch.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Former PM (((John Key))) - as creepy as John Podesta.  A pony tail puller in public, according to the NZ Herald, he would celebrate election nights with pizza (the baked flatbread, yeah right).  Daughter Stephanie trying to be the next Marina Abramović in London:

            why are AWS's posts hidden here. Does a post automatically get placed on a back.burner when a certain number of downvotes occur?  Such thay you have to press "show " to see the comment? When that happens, any replies also get buried.  AWS does take us to task and he proves right now and then. (credit should be given when its due) Besides,  a good rebuttal can get lost. Just wondering.....

             Yep - after four downvoats, the comment is hidden. The same happens, btw., when you block a user - you can see that they left a comment, but it is hidden.

              thanks, im rather tech-challenged and reliance on a cellphone doesnt help. I would urge folks not to down vote because of dislike for a person or that person's political leanings. You can always learn something from your adversaries and learn from.the rebuttal as well. In trial work, you are apt to become better at your job  by facing skilled  and experienced adversaries.

              : Yes, Voat collapses comments that have I think six downvotes. I'm not sure if upvoting helps keep a comment from being collapsed (i.e. if it's based on the difference between them).
             </p>
             <p>
              If you want your reply to not be collapsed as well, make it as a top level comment on the submission itself and ping the user whose comment you are replying to (also helps to quote what you are replying to -- always a good practice, but essential in a case where you are not directly replying).

               Yes, it helps. ;-) It's about the difference between up- and downvoats (from -4 comments get hidden).

            Holy shit, this is huge. I hope more comes out about this in the following days/weeks/months/years. This could be the pedogate whistleblow of the century.

            Also, I'm told by a friend who's read the files, that Black's pedophile ring connects dots in the Justin Davis files, if anyone wants to have a read of them:

            I think it would be a great idea to get someone with a "international connection" viewing perspective to go over them.

             I've looked into the Justin Davis info - not sure what to think about it, tbh. Somehow I think it's highly unlikely that someone has info that suddenly solves 'all' old murder cases.

            , could you edit your post to give some context about who the pedo in question is, how he rose to power, what power he actually has, who financed his campaign, etc.? I don't think most PG researchers are up on Kiwi politics.

             For sure.  I'll have to research it, I can start on that tonight.  Do you happen to know of any Voat/PG'ers familiar with New Zealand to ping for their insights/links to shed more light on Awanui Black?  For now, though, I did find a few things, but I want to spend time interpreting them before I put them in the body of the thread, so I'll just leave them here for now:

             I don't know what that means, perhaps Black ran in 2008 and 2011 locally, and also for Minister of Parliament for which he came in fifth of 17 people in 2011?:

              Oh!  There is a lot of people around the country (NZ) with histories of horrendous sexual abuse while in state care during the 60s-80s.  I believe Awanui Black is just one spoke of the rampant sexual abuse wheel.

              I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the man, the first I'd heard about him was when the news dropped this week.
             </p>
             <p>
              As to financing... it could be the Maori Party or even his own Iwi.
             </p>
             <p>
              It shows here:
              <a href="http://tauranga.kete.net.nz/tauranga_local_history/topics/show/2850-awanuiarangi-black-1968-2016">
               http://tauranga.kete.net.nz/tauranga_local_history/topics/show/2850-awanuiarangi-black-1968-2016
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              ...that he is "affiliated" with Ngāti Pūkenga, Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Ranginui, and Ngāti Raukawa ki Otaki.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ngāi Te Rangi, however, has put up a reward for people to come forward and report to authorities any knowledge they have of the alleged crimes and pedophile ring in the region.
             </p>
             <p>

               https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12087172
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              I've been trying to find out which Iwi he's linked to by birth, but no luck.  But perhaps  Ngāti Pūkenga, Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Ranginui, and Ngāti Raukawa ki Otaki are each linked to his family.  (Just to clarify, my family is linked to one Iwi, while my niece and nephew are linked to three because of our family and their father's family).
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll keep digging and see what I can find out.
             </p>

            As reported in multiple previous press releases, Harmon Wilfred, a CIA whistleblower in possession of testimony against Bill and Hillary Clinton that should have had significant influence on NZ foreign policy, has been living in New Zealand since 2001.  He has been stateless, without travel documents and unable to leave the country ever since his request for political asylum was rejected in 2006.

               ‘I believe Ani Black’: Sexual abuse and the silence that poisons communities

            <p>
             Sometimes it’s hard to communicate a direct truth in a direct way. We merely suggest or indicate or postulate because we want to be careful not to be the person who is responsible for the kōrero. To risk your own mana and the mana of your whānau and your community by speaking plainly and directly takes courage, mana and certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anihera Zhou Black directly and plainly outing her husband of 26 years, Tauranga Moana leader Awanui Black, as a paedophile, was a shattering experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             Time and again, we Māori men seem daunted by the horror before us and sit mute. We really do need to start talking to each other, to our wāhine and to our whānau. We need to show leadership in overcoming this scourge in our communities. We need to be brave enough to admit that Awanui’s strengths do not discount what has been said by his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our leaders and our men need to have the courage to say: I hear you. I am shocked, saddened, and horrified that this occurred. If you were a victim, you can come to us and you will be believed, we will help you find support and we will help you tell your story if that is what you want.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let’s break the silence and let victims know that we are with them. Let’s break the silence and have a hard and courageous conversation about sexual abuse in our communities. To paraphrase Ani, let’s break the silence with a cry or a scream; it is this silence that is a violence to our soul.

             I think some people might be hesitant to speak up since they fear that the Maori community might get discredited when one of their leaders turns out to be a perp. At least this has been my impression from cases in native communitites in the US and in Canada.

             Perhaps this should be a separate post  for botb pizzagate and pizzagate whatever in order to.make the news announcement.
            </p>
            <p>
             I listened to the press conference. I disagreed with the general conclusion that the news was a nothingburger. A witness who spoke by phone gave a very vague explanation of his alleged intelligence background (which i would expect) He gave an equally vague description  as to how he overheard two federal employees, not officials,  bragging how Seth Rich was hit, by them. (I would also expect such vagueness in order to protect his identity) However, he seemed sincere and many a murder crime has been solved by such a witness coming forward. Trouble is, there are no law enforcement authorities who are willing to follow up on such disclosures.
            </p>
            <p>
             The witness identifies one culprit as an ATF agent. The witness goes on to explain that there are dirty cops everywhere in local law enforcement which U. S.  prosecutor Rod Rosenstein did not hesitate to use.
             <br/>
             The whole thing starts to breakdown when assumptions are made that Seth Rich downloaded the DNC files to a thumbdrive and he had the thumbdrive in his possession.

You got chastised for sourcing.a fake news site and you didn't even try to defend yourself, I did it for  you. Are you still in highschool by the way?

                Sorry, I should have put a sarc, or something, on there. Very tired. I spend little time here because of outside influences. Explanation is, even Fake news should be archived because it is PG related.  Who puts it out, and who benefits, is just as relevant as the inquiry itself, and it is not just circumstantial if there is a money trail to follow. Never made it through HS.

            : to answer your Q as to what is drawing the Hillary and Obama to New Zealand. Perhaps an answer lies in the fact that New Zealand is one of the five countries who are part of a super intelligience   alliance which includes USA, Canada, England and Australia,  known as Five Eyes which is engaged in signal intelligence monitoring communications of each others citizens with no oversight or accountability.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall that the Clinton Foundation relied on the same private basement  server as Hillary. In turn, Obama was aware of this private server since he and Hillary communicated with one another using  phony  names as did others in the small circle of  government officials engaging in sub rosa activities on an international scale.
           </p>
           <p>
            Praying Medic believes that Qanon is bonafide and his decoding of Q's breadcrumbs suggest that Hillary  went there under a pretext of making speeches but in reality she was trying to determine what, if any,  of her communications have been captured by 5Eyes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama still has security clearance and may be helping her in a quest to discern what evidence is out there to implicate her and others. Q has stated on more than one occasion that these folks are stupid to believe that emails were forever destroyed when in fact they have been forever saved. Q has emphatically stated that "We have it all"
           </p>
           <p>
            I am gullible at times and could be very wrong about my asessment of Q.  The decoding by Praying Medic has me convinced and I urge you to listen to PM's  discussion of Q's  Proofs.

             You probably know how skeptical I, and others are of Q, or anyone at this particular juncture. My take is that they, or them, were actually going to blow up the Northern hemisphere and that is why the complete takeover of Australia was first-most on the list. Since there might be trouble on the former penal colony, they elected Tasmania and New Zealand as the escape pod Islands as can be proven by real estate prices and local resentment of the new, and rude, people transforming their piece of paradise into what they were supposedly trying to escape from. I have been watching that trend for a while now.

              I am gullible at times and could be very wrong about my asessment of Q. The decoding by Praying Medic has me convinced and I encourage you and others to listen to PM's discussion of Q's Proofs and make up your on mind.

             I agree with you, Pizzalawyer.

             I would add that any longtime PG follower who has not taken the time to seriously weigh the evidence about Q from non-shill sources like Praying Medic or Lisa Mei Crowley is letting themselves be swayed by those who would bury pizzagate.

              One of the Praying Medic guest interviews gave a nice shout out to voat/pizzagate, one of several occurances in my  recent meandering on the Internet. I wish I could recall which program for you.  By the way, Q has responded once or twice to PM  indicating he is viewing PM's content. Also, others decoding Q agree that PM's work is the best.  If you are time challenged, then limit your lurking to PM.

             Why would this be strange?  She just wrote a book in English. They speak English there.  American performers like Pink, Kendrick Lamar and Queens of the Stone Age are touring New Zealand this year.  It's not like going to Mars. She probably is a pretty popular figure there.  I just learned she is named after the most famous New Zealander, Edmund Hilary. They don't have problems with having a female leader.  New Zealand has a female Prime Minister currently, its third. The US and New Zealand got closer during her time as Secretary of State

              i just re-read your post and wanted point out that Sir Edmund Hilary did not come to the worlds attention until several.years after Hillary Clinton's birth.  That was a fabrication like her bombing experience in Bosnia.

                If I recall, HRC claimed on video she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary.  The problem is, SEH didn't scale Everest (or was it K2?), becoming widely known, until after HRC was spawned.

              I don't think I mentioned the royals. And there are and have been female leaders in Europe and South America so Hillary didn't need to go all.the way to NZ to find a comfort zone. Im aware that it.is an English speaking country (hence the alliance) since my son and his friends travel there for surfing and mountain climbing...it is a "get away from it all" destination.  And more recently some uber wealthy globe trotters are resettling  there  to avoid  political strife  and any interference with their wealth, somewhat akin to survivalists who are moving there as well. I would imagine small chance of terrorism or nuclear strikes,, I might move there myself.  Hillary has a globe trotter penchant having traveled more miles than any other Sec. of State as its a great way to avoid real work (never mistake motion for accomplishment).  But I'm sorry, it just doesn't seem in character and I may be a minority of one in that feeling.

              I thought it was common knowledge that the Clinton Foundation used the same server. Now Ill have to go back and find the reference.  Hillary is not off the radar screen of  many Republican Congressmen who believe she committed crimes and I hope and pray that some day she is arrested and charged. The passage of time didn't bode well for Weinstein and maybe she'll have to the "perp walk" too.

             I agree with you that they are really stupid to believe that their emails just evaporated into thin air.LOL. LOL. LOL.  Pretty dumb for a high official of the US.  Even I know that.  I had forgotten about the 5Eyes.  Thanks for the reminder.  I hope your assessment of PM and Q are correct.  Also pretty dumb on Barack's part fully knowing of the server, it's the don't worry about it now,, we'll fix it later plan.  Duh.

             There's long been talk here that the "elite" are buying up big in terms of land to build underground bunkers.  Wouldn't surprise me if they ended up getting asylum from our fucktard PM who worships the ground Hillary walks on.

               I found an old video of Jacinda Ardern when she was a teen.

               She looks like a tranny mainly because she is SO malnourished.

                She looked way better as a teen.  Normal and healthy.  She looks like a boneyard.  Yes sick and malnourished now.
Oh LOL I had to laugh at your description of Hillary.  She looked horrible.  Absolutely HORRID.

                Instead, Ms Ardern was making meatballs for 150 homeless people and joining them for lunch.   B.S.  She was intercepted and now she has sold out.

               you are right that Clinton looks bad. She has abandoned her usual makeup.and salon hair to go natural.except now and then when a pricey speech dictates a  more formal and glamorous appearance. I call it her "prison look" which she is practicing so there is less culture shock when she finds herself locked up.

                Well that is one good way to look at it, and I hope you are right.  But it could also be failing health and depression.  She lost an election that was a huge disappointment and shock to her system. She is getting old.  So is Bill.  They both look like dried up old prunes.

             She claims it was a life of alcohol, but if his organs failed, if he is so close and in with HRC and BO then I would imagine he had the pull to have harvested organs.  Something smells rotten besides her husband.

               With the CF  receiving that big bundle already with even more forthcoming?  Do you think there is no pay to play going on here?  Did you just fall off the turnip truck?  When dignitaries, especially a SOS and a Pres. visit a country they are courted by the sitting Pres.  You of all people must know that.  Of course they knew each other.  You think they just breezed into town and out without ever meeting Black?  Nope.

                 My mistake.  I knew he was not Pres. I read the article.  But they are courted by dignitaries. As you well know, since the CF  was getting large donations from NZ I would imagine he knew them. And seriously they must have met him.  Really, you don't think they never did, do you?  I can't believe it.

                  This guy was not even a national politician.  He was a regional councilor.  One of 14 in his region which had a population of 250,000.  Do you think when prime minister's visit the US, they meet the mayor of San Jose?

                   Likely he supplied those who were connected to CF/HRC.  Paedophile rings have been rampant in NZ going back to at least the 70s/80s among the elite.  They certainly employed the "services" of underage prostitutes, male and female.

              Great point.  Also, the wife is probably clueless about the bigger picture if there is one.  See my comment to exposethecriminals regarding the visit by K&amp;Q of Netherlands.

              The King and Queen of the Netherlands were visiting New Zealand just before the election:

             <p>
              They spent Halloween in Australia and the time leading up to the U.S. election in NZ, perhaps to deliver instructions should Hillary lose.  Their last day in NZ was Nov. 9.  Bear in mind that Washington DC time is 16 hours behind Auckland.

               Almost seems like they were all coming to observe.  And why were Hillary and BO there so close in time. I have a feeling they may have thought he was coming off the rails.  Some on here feel that some pedos hate their lot in life and they become ugly to themselves and thus he was drowning his hate and it mentions he was abused so probably horribly so, since he became a pedo himself.  It's an ugly way of life.  Don't get me wrong, my sympathy lies with the victims.  Yes, he could have been murdered.  He must have been the one that signed off on the donations.  I have an idea that HRC and Barry also showed up to clinch the deal on that big bundle of cash.

                In this past spring 2018, BO and HRC both visited NZ.  But I imagine they've visited there at least a few times before

                 The Netherland Royals also visited Christchurch. Amazing.  Everyone seems to be rushing there.  Wonder if they met Kerry for a donut and coffee.  Probably more like a hot dog and coke.

His wife should have known him better than anyone else.  His friend Tony Wilson was crying while giving his eulogy.  Yeah, his pimp is gone.  He will find another way to have his disgusting fun.

              What was his connections to film making in new Zealand? They filmed the lord of the rings movies there, as well as other movies.
