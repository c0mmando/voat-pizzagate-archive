            I must confess this news has sent me into a state of deep depression.....if i had been in the room when this was spoken of I'd have probably had a full blown anxiety attack.

            This is not new and fairly typical in public education. Kids have been taught about pederasty and pedophilia that took place in ancient times and this is indeed a form of normalization.

             I think it was last year when the APA in their manual of psychiatric disorders made pedophilia a sexual orientation, not a disorder. There was of course protest, so they changed it and published an updated version re-classifying it back to a disorder. But its very clear what the goal is.

              Homosexuality wasn't taught as a natural sexual orientation when it was a disorder. Until pedofilia is a disorder it simply must not be taught as a natural sexual orientation.

            For those doubting this video as fake..Look up the school's official website, search for "kerry" in staff.. You'll find her..You can search for her on google images to see how she looks. And here's another video, same place, same seats and this time a person calls her "Kerry".

            Consider: With “sexual orientation” increasingly becoming a legally protected category across almost half of the states already — with Congress working on it too — the implications of defining pedophilia and pederasty as such are hard to overstate. For instance, in California, “discrimination” based on “sexual orientation” is prohibited. If pedophiles simply have a different “sexual orientation,” does that mean schools are required to hire them?

              I wanted to move to Cali back in the 70s.  What was I thinking.  Thank God I came to my senses.  I would never have met My Darling Husband.  There are people I know that visit San Fran and would love to buy a place out there if they only could afford it.  They are great people just a little clueless.  I hope they don't get more money.  Lord help them.  Yes I am sure I meant God help them and not Gold.   You say the school works with McDonald's?  Well Gold Circle's only customer IS McDonald's.  I just can't get that through my head. There is def something up with that Org.  Btw there is also a Blue Ribbon Award for schools.  It is a U.S. Award not a state award I believe.  Possibly the Gold is for Common Core Schools and Blue is for Public Schools? My friend's Grandchild goes to a Blue Ribbon School in another state and it is a Public School.  There sure is some hanky panky they are playing with Our Children..

               I am so glad I never made it out there.  Yikes.  I almost did.  I had a lot of problems then and I thought great weather would solve them all.  Thank God I came to my senses.  They say it will some day fall off into the Pacific Ocean.  Aside from the loss of life, it would be a blessing.  I am not one that believes it is up to me who should die.  I may not like them but that is up to God not me.  But yes, they are hurting the Children.  Morality has been killed by Satan, the devil.

                 ,  your posts are all interesting,  and food for thought.  This one,  however,  raised some questions I'd like to ask you. Near the end of your comment, you state "be careful" in all caps.  Good advice.

                 Why are you asking for personal verification of facts about abuse and corruption?

               Interesting because I've been planning to do a post about the Rotary Club and the two young people who died when they fell from the Whispering Gallery at St . Paul's in London - one young man just a few weeks ago, and the other young woman in 2017. That club is a common denominator.

                   Earlier this year the Racine newspaper ran a series on the criminal scandal that brought an end to Becker as mayor.  Why they chose to rehash that was never made clear.

                   I don't know why Dickert resigned so suddenly, notwithstanding the claim it was to accept a new job.  I thought it quite odd at the time.  Never trusted the guy.
Ryan's retirement to be home to spend more time with his (teenage) children was also suspect.
Scott Walker is a dim bulb not capable of sitting as president.
