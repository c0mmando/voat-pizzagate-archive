            The republicans or democrats do not care. They write and pass bills for their corporate interests. This is obvious. Think of all the legislation that is written &amp; signed into law without a hint to the people who are the ones that are in charge of the government. They should post this information somewhere before they have the right to sell privacy. This is archaic and unconstitutional. Does the government have the right to go into the library and ask a librarian for all the books you looked up or checked out. Hell no.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do they have a right to know what magazine prescriptions you get. Hell no. Can they look through your mailbox. Hell no. I could go on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Privacy is protected. Much more it can not be auctioned off at the highest bidder. Disgraceful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about a company like Media Matters owned by David Brock buying your browsing history, IP addresses. He already openly stated he has NSA contacts so some "Seth rich" things might result.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think of George Soros companies buying your privacy...or HRC...ClintonFondation, etc

            People have been posting links that require a google login so, if you click it while logged in, its logged to your google account and they have a detailed disclaimer about all the data they collect through your account and this is before this ISP fuckery. If you are browsing without a VPN or proxy, you should be more careful now than ever.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been using a VPN for years now. Coincidentally, shortly after I started using a VPN, Comcast shut down my modem remotely and told me I had to have someone come on-site to fix it. I threatened to cancel my problem-free service of 8 years and they came back 10 minutes later saying they were able to fix it on their side and my modem rebooted and I was able to get online again. This happened again months later and, after threatening to cancel, they did their 'magic' and brought my internet back online. Around 6 months later this happened AGAIN and I got an audio recording of them telling me the reason that they need to come on-site to fix my internet was because someone was 'tapping into my line somewhere on my property'. I don't think she realized that I could hear someone behind her coaching her what to say and she would repeat what I would say outloud so that the person behind her could hear it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have 2MP surveillance cameras on all sides of my house and I am the one who wired the coax cabling. I crawled under my house and double checked all of the coax lines and everything was normal. I had my bud who is a contractor double check it and hook up a line tester to test signal and it was fine all the way out to splitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Comcast REALLY wanted to have someone come to my house. I canceled my service and pay a premium for hotspot service now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't trust your ISP, they are your enemy. Look at using a VPN. I recommend

             https://www.privateinternetaccess.com
            </a>
            because they are the ONLY VPN service to prove their 'no logs' claim because the FBI subpoenaed them for the logs and they didn't really keep any.

            Welcome to VOAT.  You must be new.  Did you know that there are other subs here?  This has nothing to do with pizzagate.  At all.
           </p>
           <p>
            And technically, your browser history and ISP addresses were never, EVER private.  This bill killed a last minute bill from Obama that was never, ever enforced as it never was implemented as a law.

             Not new been here on reddit before Voat. Completely understand they were never "private" now being monetized. Your browsing history and IP addresses you use will be sold to the highest bidder.  Your privacy is up for sale. The massive censorship over pizzagate &amp; pedogate on the internet in this investigation shows and is worrisome they now want to monetize it.

              I don't see anything positive about this bill, don't get me wrong.  I'm not sure if it was simply a "let big business make money at the expense of our privacy" or a reverse all the last minute legislation from Obama.  I honestly can't figure it out.  I haven't done the research on their justification.

             I am no fan of Obama's and you may be technically correct about browsing history never having been private in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             My problem is why wouldn't we want to make it as hard as possible to find our browsing history?

             And mind you there are as many Republicans as Democrats who've been pulled into this thing. Think of John McCain, he'd love to go after people who investigated pizzagate.

              Like I said, the law was passed but never implemented so they technically undid a bill that wasn't being enforced.  But I have no idea why they did it.  I need to dig up their justification.

              As far as John McCain, I hope you consider him the liberal democrat that he is.  I think he's more destructive for the GOP than Harry Reid was.

               I don't get it. The bill Obama passed was to prevent people from selling your browsing history to advertisers.
              </p>
              <p>
               That fact it wasn't being enforced is bad. I want that bill enforced. I don't understand why Republicans wouldn't want it enforce.
