I  googled pink flamingo kids and this image came up  <a href="https://ibb.co/cLPAbb">https://ibb.co/cLPAbb</a>
So I had posted on Alibaba before because it\'s so bad but people got mad about the imgbb links (why idk?) And  cause I couldn\'t proove the child porn factor.</p>
<p>Today  After seeing two posts about Amazon  employee getting bustrd for CP I think it\'s worth it to look at alibaba they are definitelyi nto  fucking and into kids and put those two together themselves on the main site.
 I CAN show that</p>
<p>.....after that I think they are providing links and codes to the right people after they get them all signed up they want you to download the app etc... But it seems like there\'s is all this kid sex hype on the general population main site so why wouldn\'t there be on the porn sites by the same alibaba (Chinese?) people.?<br />
Please look at these. Some pictures do not match the text, on purpose I believe, they do match, I just wouldn\'t know what context at all.</p>

<p>There\'s also something odd about the picture frames that makes you think porn, I mean the way they show it, like it\'s just amazing a wooden picture frame but you need to go to the other site to get hooked up. It\'s creepy how it clears up slowly on the page like it needs to download malware into your device every page...probably not but when it clears it then shows the address to the other site. </p>
<p>When their pages open it\'s blurry then clears I got the blurred here <a href="https://ibb.co/dnTspw">https://ibb.co/dnTspw</a></p>
<p>This is in the same triad of photos as the last picture of a picture frame, the choo choo ...this is as is the entire pic which is odd bc only ust the corner of the frame where it says made in China and the tail end of the square measurement x6 inches &amp; x15,cm  supposedly but are they ? Are they ages?  I\'ve never heard of anything x 15 in the art framing world have I? That\'s not standard, I believe not

<p>However This discrepancy, is not only a violation of trust it\'s  a marker and a huge red flag. Two markets one product,  there is law around that,  after looking at the site. This glimpse of the Alibaba wares surely makes you think that with so much kids sex on the general population website that their porn site(s) most likely involve children as well. As it\'s no secret Alibaba sells porn too. Someone better do something about these guys soon. Pizzagate related because the site has mentioned adult and sex and kids in the same sentence too many times. A pattern is there... And they seem ever so sloppy, maybe easy to bust?</p>',

              Aha you got it about to post again... it's ALL about the digital frame. Its porn vids on the photoframes just straight xxx video or gifs or whatever, sexualized content. Words like children.

            If you search almost any product + sex in Alibaba you will get those kind of results. I think majority of sellers are doing that, because they want to rank with "sex" keyword. Of course I could be wrong, but it definitely seems so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just go to Alibaba and do the searches yourself. For example search "sex led" and you get results like
- T10 double-side chinese sex tube tubes8 led light tube UL/CE/ROHS Certificated Led tube light T5 / T8 / T10 / T12
- Modern OEM chinese sex tubo led t8

             Im looking at it right now 4th time and I find it doubt ful as I explained to someone else they sell regular nuts and bolts but they also sell nuts and bolts to stick in your ass thats probably to be filmed ultimately. There's every peop for ever more interesting porn. hence all the acutremon (sp?) The sex equipment sex gear sex tools etc.. doubtful there a language barrier. I really think that's why it's getting so freakish searching here and it's informative. Its fucking gross, but I talked to my sibling who's been to China and apparently  it's really different really so many more people and the gentlemen class are very into porn. On this Alibaba site... just putting two and two together. I found the key to the plausible  proof of straight porn photos being sent in the mail... is the product description below in the details- a long phrase with xxx sexy and hot then ending in the word photos. About to post it I will ding u.

             I moved to Oregon from California 11 months ago. I've heard over the years that Oregon is a hotbed of cults and entire communities pursuing deviant lifestyles. This has been confirmed for me by two Oregon-based YouTube channels, Illegal News and Christina Beauchamp

            <p>
             Several months ago, Illegal News and The Pizzagate Files presented overwhelming evidence (

             </a>
             and [HERE] that the world-famous Voodoo Doughnut (in Portland) is possibly a child trafficking front.

            <hr/>
            <p>
             As I've been exploring the area I've definitely noticed possible signs of underground activities. The most notable, thus far, has been what seems like the ubiquitous presence of pink flamingos in people's yards.

             The pink flamingo thing is definitely a club. Will try to find more I don't know if I'm leaping in saying the fox the way I see it come up of course the site let me search parent child sex toy so alot of fox stuff for sale came up too. It was pretty weird cause your like am I right am I wrong. Is this just a hat? 
Btw!   I j just put my a siblings YouTube video  post about the NorCal firs on conspiracy forum, the metteor  I think maybe the  draconid metteor theory  is right.  More plausible then goverment weapons against us theory by 100%

             I'll have to catch a photo of the 3 pink flamingo s I saw to make me stop and go wtf? On a walk 3days ago. I'd never seen before because they are behind a latice fence but just peeking thru you see just the head they're quasi hidden. Eyes peeking thru 3plastic flamingo heads peeking thru, right next to that wirred up to the lattice is an old 1940(?) School bus? Dumptruck? It's very childish although old, ithen I saw all the other ild metal toy cars and planes. I just said the fuck is that?

            and btw@ESOTERICshade 4 examples (3 should be enough so one more for good measure) to proove a point (Alibaba likely sells child porn via the mail)  and then I think it's a matter of letting the facts sink in.... then go get em boys and girls. Stop this whoring and sexualizing of children.

              In not trying to buy something from anyone.  Its pretty obviously fishy enough...if you look at every screen shot.  That site let's you search  for xxx kids sex toy. That's fishy enough...for me it's more about the standard. I can't tackle the actual vendors of porn obvious again, alone= joke. But the company, no company should have those searched that I have shown by screenshot in the machine.

            went all morning just straight up typing in xxx photo newborn and xxx photo child I went thru kids baby wracking my brain for key words I'll have to post again on that note. It's clear children are being abused and/or abuse is being perpetuated via this site and via this culture. You are so right in that we all need to report them but I also suggest that we all need to go look at this site and just type in anyokd strange thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            you instantly find these people have a strong culture. They have memes, I think it's wise at this time to identify pedophile memes. I found a couple on the site. The pink flamingo stands for kinda person who fucks anything all gokinda person whith self esteem issues. So they constantly Pat each other on the back and send messages to each other about "standing tall" and being a different and secretly better type of individual. Very weird shit
           </p>
           <p>
            , Also The fox, I'm pretty sure we are talking about fucking kids here. I think the fox is like parental incest. And so much more disturbing shit. Go there and learn. We know some is taboo, we don't get up in people biz, but there's taboo, and there's the reason why the taboo. It's probably bad for humanity. But mixing up xxx sex photos of infants it's just illegal. There's no grey. I'm pissed about it and I geuss Asian kids are high in demand. Boys and girls. Really sad.

             It is just terrible and my soul has changed over this last year but i dismiss my feelings in anyway for the sake of hopefully saving at least one child and to hold these sick fucks accountable in anyway shape or form. I remember when i first clicked on a pizzagate video on youtube wondering what it was...and i almost wish i hadnt but since then i felt that it was my human duty to be apart of the citizen investigation and being the childrens voice. What can we do at this point though? Im definently going to take a gander at the meme situation. Where do i start with that?

              I think start with the search engine because it's not like there's only pedos these are catering to an everything go porn industry possibly even snuff so much do it yourself stuff. But I got tired after a while last night just when I discovered... If you type in xxx and it returns xxx Pakistan xxx then your dealing with that whole group of victims, that's how I see it. Little girls really flauted here. I'll post again and keep it short to summarize a theory on all the LED sex equipment.

                  Don't be sorry it's great someone else has heart a brain whatever..so...Just searching alibaba &amp; their whacky search engine, other night I woke up going oh no I didn't cross check xxx photo with toddler. So I woke up and tried that one, I got the weird Carter onesy with lemons on it about xxx photos, but not much else came up on toddler. It got too much for me when i look at the search engine is actually directing a pwrson to see &amp; realize  like xxx Pakistan xxx is an option, a person goes wtf? Realizing how many antnests apon antnests apon antnests is China, is India...so there's alot to do and it's over whelming, I i jyst have this phone, but dolove to get into systems, so I can end up spend ing a long time at it.

             I went all morning just straight up typing in xxx photo newborn and xxx photo child I went thru kids baby wracking my brain for key words I'll have to post again on that note. It's clear children are being abused and/or abuse  is being perpetuated via this site and via this culture. You are so right in that we all need to report them but I also suggest that we all need to go look at this site and just type in anyokd strange thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             you instantly find these people have a strong culture. They have memes, I think it's wise at this time to identify pedophile memes. I found a couple on the site.
The pink flamingo stands for kinda person who fucks anything all gokinda person whith self esteem issues. So they constantly Pat each other on the back and send messages to each other about "standing tall" and being a different and secretly better  type of  individual.  Very weird shit
            </p>
            <p>
             , Also 
The fox, I'm pretty sure we are talking about fucking kids here. I think the fox is like parental incest. And so much more disturbing shit. Go there and learn. We know some is taboo, we don't get up in people biz, but there's taboo, and there's the reason why the taboo. It's probably bad for humanity. But mixing up xxx sex photos of infants it's just illegal. There's no grey. I'm pissed about it and I geuss Asian kids are high in demand. Boys and girls. Really sad.

            I think there's a language barrier going on here, I would guess that sex is in the descriptions because it's the most searched term on the app. Almost all the photos you claim are not of what they describe are actually described by the text... the LED "trapeze" is hanging from a rope and lights up, a 6 inch frame is 15ish cm, which is a standard size, the bondage gear is "Baby Pink" adult size, cheese cat is a poor translation of "Kigurumi" animal cosplay pajamas. I can go on, but I won't. It's obvious that you intend to see what isn't there. On the other hand Alibaba is not child safe, and if you buy sets of photos in the $200 range from there it seems like the potential for CP being mailed to you exists. Although after posting here I'm sure all you will end up with is photos of dolphins.

             I had hoped it's as you say, but it becomes clear when the xxx is placed in the same phrase as photo. That is inconceivable that that's a language barrier issue. And photos mailed to you IS what it looks like they do. I will post again on this and ding you cause I found I found the proof that it's not just me this morning by simply searching the Alibaba site for these key words xxx photo newborn and xxx photo infant and xxx photo kids and xxx photo children and the same search for boy and girl. My results are conclusive. It's clear there a huge descrepancy that is worrisome for the abuse of innocent children. I suggest you go to the site if you doubt my interpretation. Where there is "hot xxx sex photo baby" there is child abuse.  This is rough. I'm sorry. If you speak Chinese and you don't fuck babies and your not protecting the folks who do you are an asset to the children. Not to me. To the children.

                 Q says ...  I can't follow..no computer, I spend too much time on the phone and codefag link hasn't been loading. I did listen to the interview with pamphlet about the baker's, about the angerfest meltdown the comnucations. It's . Totally fucking amazing, the time q told someone to pick up their phone. Wow.But. What are you bummed about really? 
Aside from realizing pedos have been running things their own way, or maybe u knew that.. anyway..I'm not cashing in the crypto cause it's only a little money and it's already doubled so, it's actually comforting to have something else  something different to do with my bucks,

                   That's fuct up about your brother. I feel that pain, my first sweetheart my friend of over 30 years, and we got back together about 5 years ago but It was so bad I knew there  was drinking but found out about meth 3 years ago, have tried to keep the friendshio, but as of this last year, the addiction seems to have overcome my friend and as well my only other close friend admitted to it being addicted to meth,  and lo and behold they got together?!! I haven't spoken to that person in months now and this is so sad cause I literally have zero friends. 
but this is a tiny town, meth is huge here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Ok weird honesty segue... It's weird but this is happeningto me in real time. Im on my phone doing laundry, usually i never go o
ut especially during holiday times, there's no anonymity at all. I opened your reply and attempt to start telling about my cracked out x and the person shows up at the laundry calling my name out, follows me back to the plaza area of town and now im in the bathroom. Because I have to walk away. I swear I can't bear to look at how ravaged away, and how meek and pathetic and I know that the person is gonna still be outside  or around and im gonna have to walk to my car, and that i do love this person but I can't be around meth people. My family is not crazy.  Im so glad. But my parents are dead. . Im sitting here in the bathroom which is cozy and had wifi, making a prayer with a person from out of town that the people  on crack or  meth whatever can find a way free of it, and that im gonna keep loving  them from wherever I am. Eso e ese.

                     Snorting smoking ...god. I wish I had film of me going up to the drug house to try to shut it down, I tried to knock over the table but it was bolted. I tried to shove everything off the table but everything was heavy. I picked up one thing to throw off the table but couldnt lift it up so had to put all my body weight against it to slide it to the edge of the table to make it fall. It landed thunk  and the guy with the flaming incendiary butane device about to give my friend an 8 ball or whatev says " can you take care of that" about me to my friend.

                  I started to buy some crypto bitcoin back when it was really cheap. I did not follow through. I was tempted to buy a thousand dollars worth. If I had of bought it right about now might be the time I would think about cashing it in for something tangible, like a vehicle or something.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The scary thing about crypto is that the government is talking about getting involved and considering it a source of income, or whatever it is they are talking about doing. If that happens it could all go retro active and people might get taxed on it. Something to be thinking about. They might surf back a few years and hit people with a tax bill.

             The site offers regular stuff like nuts and bolts and offers stuff called nuts and bolts that you put in your ass. Regular diapers and super fancy special sexualized diapers (!?!) From everything a perdophile fantasazes about to sm people and other obsessed people who need to put nuts and bolts in their ass.
