He was visibly shaken, He was going to release the info the next day, but then said nothing. The rumor was that his life had been threatened. </p>
<p>During the next few years, Glenn Beck got sad, and reflective, and at times rather weird. He cried on-air. I\'m sure most people are aware of his reputation as an odd duck. But there are some things I didn\'t know, or didn\'t connect, until now. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In 2013 an anti-child-trafficking organization was created, <a href="http://ourrescue.org/">Operation Underground Railroad</a>, with a bunch of Navy SEALs and special forces folks. <strong>Beck gave them $1.5 million to get started.</strong> (Info in Blaze story linked below.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In May 2016, Beck was suspended by SiriusXM after a guest, Brad Thor, made a sketchy remark about Trump being &quot;assassinated&quot;. Beck supported Ted Cruz at that time, with surprising fervor. He warned of &quot;civil war&quot; if Trump won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In September 2016, Cruz endorsed Trump, and Beck had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJYVPCeYb24">an angry, disproportionately betrayed-sounding meltdown</a>. &quot;There is no difference between the two teams any more! ... And so, we will just soak each other in buckets of blood!&quot; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediately after the election, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU0aXBGaUOw">Beck shared his perspective</a>, trying to bring the country together. He said, &quot;We are going to pay for the sins of the past. There\'s gonna be dark days ahead.&quot; He warned that all Americans are going to be struggling to figure out &quot;what the hell just happened.&quot; He said, &quot;I want Donald Trump to know he is my President.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few weeks later, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuSDfVRGI54">Beck did a joint show with Samantha Bee</a>, trying (awkwardly but sincerely) to bring the country together. Notice the date: Dec 19th. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two days after that, <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/21/glenn-beck-travels-to-haiti-to-learn-about-sex-trafficking-and-finds-the-meaning-of-hope/">The Blaze did a story about Beck, Operation Underground Railroad, and Haiti</a>. Let that sink in. Beck sat down with Sam Bee and tried to unite the country, then <strong>he went to Haiti to do a story about child sex trafficking</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, with me so far? Here\'s the next thing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tpAoOIqKPw">Beck appeared on Tucker Carlson on January 9</a>, where Tucker was relatively nice, almost deferential to him, making him the first guest in Tucker\'s new time slot. Beck adopted a wait-and-see attitude about Trump. One exchange stands out: &quot;Do you think being in this business makes you happy? Has it made you happy?&quot; Beck: &quot;No. ... Thinking that my voice was bigger than it is ... that we can move people and change the world, it made me very unhappy. That\'s not my job, it\'s not any of our jobs. Our job is just to be ourselves, and try to be a good example. And by doing that, Tucker, I\'ve learned a lot in the last five years.&quot; He added, referring to the country: &quot;We\'re stronger than we were, than I thought, but we\'re also, um, in more trouble in some ways than I thought, at least eight years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Beck has since criticized Trump on a variety of subjects, and praised him on others. But both Cruz and Beck seem to be solidly behind Jeff Sessions.</p>

            Beck has turned into a mentally ill maniac. I don't give a DAMN about him or what he has to say. he needs to be put into a mental institution and forgotten. I used to listen to him all the time but he went mental the minute he went on television starting with CNN. NOPE I don't care about him or anything he says. After the Cheeto incident I knew he had completely lost his mind. I will never ever have any respect or trust in him ever again. While I like Ted Cruz, His wife is top level at Goldman Sachs and I don't really trust him anymore either. ANY politician that has major donors like them are not to be fully trusted.

            Glen Beck is a proud mason and a disinfo shill and it goes back to his days at CNN
           </p>
           <p>
            He was sent to Fox to capture an audience and establish himself as a conservative
He was used to try to subvert and take over the tea party movement.
            <br/>
            He was then set to cover the more conspiracy subjects and was copying stories from Alex Jones
He quit his Fox Job to start a online radio show to try to capture the Alex Jones type audience
He recognized the Ron Paul liberty movement as a force and pretended to suddenly become a libertarian even though his views were nothing of the sort.
In every election when given the opportunity to back a libertarian he would back an establishment republican who was contrary to his newly adopted tea party or libertarian rhetoric.
He was used to rail as hard as he could against Trump in effort to draw libertarian and the fed up republicans support away from trump and toward anyone but Rand Paul or Trump. This was a hail Mary pass as he destroyed himself with it.
He now is trying to subvert and direct investigations into pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dude has been compromised from the beginning..   With these shills you have to have a long term memory because they keep coming back and keep doing the same garbage over and over.  People are pissed at Glen Beck and for good reason.

             Yeah I will never forget how hard he railed against Ron Paul when he was running for president in 2011. Same goes for Hannity and all the other fakes. I really hope trump is on the side of the people, but I'm not going to be fully convinced until big things start happening.

             I read the same thing, but I now think that's wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Hastings was killed in a very suspicious car crash a few days later, and he was going after the CIA for surveillance issues, so people have argued that Beck's whistleblower was probably Hastings.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Beck never mentions CIA or NSA or surveillance in the video. He talks about something that will absolutely smash Republicans and Democrats to rubble, something horrifying that will change history. Snowden's revelations embarrassed the intelligence community, but they wouldn't (and didn't) have that kind of apocalyptic impact. Politicians keeping kids in cages and raping them obviously would.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beck folded in June 2013. OUR was set up by Beck's fellow Mormon, Tim Ballard, in December 2013. It just fits.

            As a long-long-time Glenn Beck fan and a regular listener (until a short while ago), y'all have covered most everything I would have to say. Just one more small point. I've always been annoyed, and more so since the election, at how  - despite his constant cries for unity - Glenn continues (and often) to use ridicule as a tool. To entertain, to make a point, to win an argument. I understand the effectiveness, and I used to excuse this. But it makes it really difficult to understand why he would expect anything useful, or positive, to come from a sit down with Samantha Bee. So difficult, it's impossible to believe that was anything but a publicity stunt, that went wrong. Glenn's a really smart guy and has made an enormous contribution for good. Trump's win left him, and his crew, with no solid road to follow. It's painful to watch, and I find myself always wishing he'd just stick to whiteboard history lessons.

              If you want to look into more of the Mormon angle.  Look up Sterling Allen and his American Study group and whatever is happening out in Eagle Mountain, UT. Gets weird quick. This side of things, since I grew up in UT, is when I started to think the satanism "scare" in the 80s was a bit more than just a scare. 
Here are some of the links I've gathered so far.

              Also, somehow the study group leads into the Phoenix Project, which is a sort of a cult that has connections to the study group involving some sort of alien communications. It reminds me of the messages from RA book that came out in the 80s. If you read this newsletter, you'll likely see some familiar themes and topics.

            The problem I have here is that Beck more or less hysterically endorsed Hillary who is into and made megabucks from child trafficking and whatever else sick shit. I don't buy that he's some kind of martyr. He either has severe emotional issues or he's paid opposition.

            I have a theory that the crazy religious right really thinks there's a God wanting them to run for president because they are trying to stop the devils that run the world....which they make them look like lunatics for it...I also think they have been planning the Trump presidency for a long time and that's why he had to pal around with the Clinton's and their associates. They probably went to him in 08 after Obama won realizing the power of the shadow government and that they had both the Dem and Repub sides covered with back up even with Obama and that stopping Hillary was not enough and made a plan. Trump started tweeting anti Obama stuff at some point and the media proceeded to make him out as a right wing conspiracy nut even though he donated to Hillary. Trump was told he had to run as a repub cuz the fix was in already with the DNC and to just wing it and pander to what republicans were trained to want and Liberals are trained to hate them for, ex. build a wall to keep out illegals AKA elite sex slaves and terrorists they planned to use to destabilize the country creating mass protesting while deflecting from the process of making pedophilia legal and easier to create access to victims. Hillary's campaign knew for some reason Trump would out of nowhere  run so they had to have intel

            Her campaign knew the media could build him up along with Cruz and Carson while simultaneously discrediting him to protect her from attacks. They took Fiorina down and out quick because as another female gave Hillary less vagina power and that hilarious pic of Christie behind Trump was a panic cuz he realized Trump was taking them down and making a fool of him. If we replay the entire primary without all the censoring and 404ing of content, we would have so many AHAH moments. If you think back to Iowa caucus not only did they have O'Mally drop out so Hillary wouldn't lose to Bernie but Donald Trump had nothing going on or money spent on the ground except a couple rallies and won...I always thought he had to be being helped by the DNC and Clinton campaign just like they were cheating for her in order for Trump to be back up and lose for her but now it looks like others helped Trump and all we can do is hope their plan is way ahead of anything the deep state has the power to screw up and that there are enough good guys.

             I truly believe Trump was contacted by the White Hats of the intel world many years ago to run and save the country from globalization and all of us being made into slaves for the New World Order.  He knew just what to say and he knew who to target to get his point across. Hillary believed she was the chosen one years ago and really thought with a rigged election she would win easy.  Her ego would not let her understand just how much she was truly despised.

              I am with you on this Dressage. I posted on Voat three months ago about Beck being threatened including the videos. Operation Railroad is a CIA smokescreen and was called out ahead of time by G. Webb. They use Mormons and other faiths start these "non profits" use military operatives and rescue a few kids. Beck used twitter to blow this up during the Super Bowl. A few kids in Haiti "allegedly" rescued and all of the suspects have been released now with no charges.
             </p>
             <p>
              The FBI Vault released of Trump's father information as a good man followed by releases of the Marc Rich pardon info of Clinton were signs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also this was followed by releases of instructions on how the FBI can bring someone in as an agent.

             <p>
              I think that has happened.The NWO &amp; pedosatanists are the same people. They have been pushing for WW111 and are currently trying to make it happen to cover up their crimes and push for their sick agenda.

              I also think it could have gone back farther. We had weird hints like the escalator Simpson's scene of Trump etc but his pushing for and donating to Hillary for 08 has me unsure about how that would fit into it. Then again maybe that is fake news....or perhaps just to bring her far enough in that race to hope it was her last chance but then Obama turned out to be one of them too and put her into the perfect criminal enterprise postion.

            Very interesting. When i first started to 'wake up', Beck's vids especially the Soros expose, was great. I was surprised and disheartened with his behaviour in the last year and probably mental breakdown. He was a clear Globalist shill this last year, from the man who could NEVER have been a shill if he had exposed Alinskyite tactics, Obama's background, and Globalist kingpins like Soros.  It never sat right with me, i always felt there was something else going on.  This theory makes sense but I guess we are reduced to speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe he felt Cruz was best in a Machiavellian way, because he knew how awful and corrupt the system was and that Trump had the potential to expose it all. Pedo Satanism, Trafficking, the lot. So he felt the country would be in ruins if exposed, a civil war, and he would rather a 'muddle through' globalist-controlled candidate like Cruz who he probably knows is compromised but at least he's a Republican.

             Maybe. We don't know what Cruz told Beck, or for that matter what Trump told Cruz. Or when the story changed. It's very hard to piece it all together.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I'm betting that Beck at some point read
             <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Document:The_Franklin_Cover-up">
              the foreword to The Franklin Cover-Up
             </a>
             by John DeCamp, where he quoted William Colby about not throwing your life away fighting something too big to defeat as an individual. Colby's remark about his one-man victory parade on Red Square is very poignant.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Sometimes, there are forces too powerful for us to whip them individually, in the time frame that we would like. We have to keep working at our goal. But we have to be sensible enough, not to risk everything and get ourselves destroyed or killed in the process. That victory we seek may take much longer than we wanted, and come in ways we never anticipated.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Maybe, just maybe, you have to have your own private victory parade. You maybe have to face the fact that you cannot ‘right’ all the ‘unrightable wrongs’ That there really are people too powerful, interests too big; that the rich and the powerful, even when doing evil, can and will succeed and you can do nothing about it at that moment.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I won't judge Beck too harshly without having all the facts. There's just way too much that we don't know. But this does look to me like him taking Colby's advice.

            Beck's change in behaviour points to him being compromised. He went from revealing Soros to being a total cuck.
I think he got into financial trouble and they used that and threats to control him. He's a Momo, all they would need to do is have enough on him, or create enough on him to get him kicked out of the church and that's all it would take to get him to fall in line.

            I appreciate that he gave money to Operation Railroad, but he can do far more with his platform by simply getting the information out if he has it.

            Man up, and tell what you know.  It's not ok to sit back knowing more kids are being trafficked, raped, etc just because you fear for your life.

             What about the life of his family...it's easy to judge when we don't know all the facts.
Do you have kids?
Are you willing to lose one or all of them to save another child?
That is a very hard call to make.

              Yes I have kids and NO I would never ever let pedophiles rule this earth as they are now knowingly. Its time we all rise up to end this and we can only do it together. Glen had a huge platform at one time to do this and he didn't.

               I'm not a big Glen Beck fan, I just don't know why he didn't.
If it was a sellout there's no respect here.
If it is fear of death for family, because that is worse than death of self, it is a different story.
I can hardly sleep if I actually think of those kids.
And I am trying to spread the word about it and educate the people in my life...not easy because some just would rather not know...like I want to know...but how can we turn away?
What if it was my child?
