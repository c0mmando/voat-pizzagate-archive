            I'm sure the freaks feel like "god" when they're pandering their pizza treats. If only God had a .38, He could make everything allright again.

             Wow, so that was 2 years before, this guy is obviously consistently weird. I wonder if the sharing of that clip as 'most important' was a joke, or if it really was important to them. The guy could be someone who used to be a kid in their ring and is all messed up now, and escaped or something, and maybe they're worried he might tell someone?
