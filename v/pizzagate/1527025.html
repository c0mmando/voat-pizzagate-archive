            I'd disagree that everyone liked savile....A lot of people thought he was dodgy....Even my mum knew he was a pervert somehow....Pretty much an open secret I think

            Unfortunately a lot of people were fooled by jimmy Saville, that's essentially how he got away with it for years!  This means some folks will be called into question if they were photographed with him.  Some of them are undoubtedly involved others aren't.  Rolf Harris, Gary Glitter and others already convicted all had Saville connections, but so did many others and they have been cleared. Regarding Russell Brand, last year he done a video about elite child abuse and he had to remove it and he went quiet for a while. This leaves the question open to whether he was threatened or is involved, I really don't know but I follow him closely like many others to get a whiff of what side he may be on.

            Pedos generally try to blend as much as posdible; building a shield of legitimacy around themselves. Russel Brand is pretty open about being a mess. I have no doubt he has been inappropriate around kids in many ways, but he doesn't strike me as a psychopath. People get mixed up in weird things though, so who knows.

            I know this about him. His father was an absolute degenerate, shagged women in front of him, and later when he was 13-14 brought prostitutes home and shared them. He's been addicted to crack and heroin. He seems to have narcissistic personality disorder and possibly bi-polar or some other concurrent disorder. He married Katy Perry, and before he got with Katy Perry he made a play for Lady Gaga. He's hosted big MTV awards a few times after having previously being kicked off for dressing as Bin Laden a day or two after 9/11 and destroying the MTV set in London while drunk/high. He is known to be a sexual deviant, he details it all in his books. Wouldn't surprise me in the least. Seems possible as well that he may have been a victim, he was certainly the victim of a terrible, irresponsible, degenerate set of parents.

            Yes I have... and yes I know you shouldn't touch kids nipples ffs. All I'm saying is I can't say 100% that he's touching her nipple on purpose. I think people who don't think like pedophiles might not think it's strange to hold a kid across the chest because they are not aroused at all by children. All I'm saying is it could be an accident and doesn't 100% make him a pedophile . I'd be happy to see more convincing evidence if anyone comes across any

            I don't think so. He is eccentric and invades people's space (of all ages) . His heart is in the right place in my opinion. Don't agree with his pro immigration talk but I believe he only wants peace for all people and that's why he's kind of a hippy. It is normal for a child to sit on an adults knee and it's normal to have your hand around a child. It's only when a pedophile does is that it becomes weird. I don't think we should be accusing an adult of being the worst possible thing you can be with the only evidence is that they held a child in a certain way. It's a horrible thing to be accused of
