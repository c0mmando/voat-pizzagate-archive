            The fact that both the parents are doctors are not a coincidence. There is something beyond sinister going on behind the scenes. Don't know how much american audiences also know they are impenetrably protected by

             The weirdest thing is that people were saying how weird it all was, that the McCanns must have political connections etc, that something very strange was going on - for years. And THEN years later it turns out that those e-fits happen to look like two people high up in American politics?? It's just too weird and coincidental.

            Her Iris is indicative of a condition Coloboma shared by George Soros.  From the Greek koloboma, meaning defect.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the particular link which might interest you, is the fact that the condition is associated with Ashkenazi Jews, who are at increased risk from recessive disease.  These are the Jews whom Israel mentioned in their statements regarding the thousands of missing children.

           </p>
           <p>
            "Their children were taken from hospitals or refugee camps and given to childless Ashkenazi Jewish Israelis of east European descent, including Holocaust survivors."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ashkenazi Jews have been recognised as being far more insular than the Sephardic Jews, who were very much entwined with Greek Culture and holding great respect for the achievements of Arabic mathematics and the sciences.
           </p>
           <p>
            Israel continue the academic trend of humanism in their cannabis research, for example.  The Sephardic Jews and Arabs were excellent neighbours and lived in peace amongst one another for many many years.

            Continuing with our colombo into coloboma, it is interesting that the McCanns would intentionally downplay the significance of the coloboma, despite the fact it could help expedite the process of finding their daughter, a unique feature distinguishing her from others.  This tells us of it's significance.
           </p>
           <p>
            MORGAN: Madeleine had a very distinctive eye pattern, didn't she? Tell me about that, Kate, in case people see somebody they think may be Madeleine. Tell me about her eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            K. MCCANN: If I'm honest, we haven't put too much emphasis on her eye, because I think you have to be very close to her to see it. But her eyes are slightly different colors, and one of them has this brown fleck in it. But you do notice, particularly on photographs, but --
           </p>
           <p>
            MORGAN: Slightly distinctive eye colors and a little fleck.
           </p>
           <p>
            MORGAN: And do you know if that would be still there if she's now eight years old?
           </p>
           <p>
            G. MCCANN: Certainly believe it wouldn't have changed. I think there's been a pattern to be still there. That it's -- the technical term is coloboma, where there's a defect in the iris. I don't think it is actually. I think it's actually an additional bit of color. She certainly had no visual problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, there is speculation that the CAT file of McCann was wiped by Jim Gamble.
Research The Gaspar Statements
           </p>
           <p>
            Which politician are the McCanns friends with?  Why did top political spin doctors immediately come to their aid?  Why did they befriend a pedo in portugal?
           </p>
           <p>
            We know Podesta visits Portugal, per wikileaks.
