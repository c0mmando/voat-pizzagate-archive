<li>
<p>John Ramsey was on independent counsel Lawrence Walsh\'s list of witnesses to subpoena, but he never got called</p>

<p>The phone numbers of Oliver North (a Lt. Col. directing Iran-Contra), Edwin Meese (attorney general under the later Reagan years), and Bill Clinton (protected Mena drug running) were found in Ramsey\'s office</p>

<p>None of these allegations have been verified so far, but if they turn out to be true, they could be a major new clue in the JBR case.

<p>What <em>has</em> been confirmed so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Ramseys hired a media consultant (read: spin doctor) named Patrick Korten, who previously worked for both Oliver North and Edwin Meese</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Lockheed Martin (which acquired Access Graphics in 1991, after Iran-Contra) and Edwin Meese would be involved in a lesser-known scandal that grew out of Iran-Contra called the <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/01/inslaw/">Inslaw/PROMIS affair</a>. It involved the theft of PROMIS data mining software (which Meese played a role in), and its subsequent alteration by the CIA and its proprietaries (including Lockheed Martin) to merge it with artificial intelligence. Also involved in the Inslaw affair was Robert Byrd, a Senator from West Virginia. JonBenet\'s mother, Patsy Ramsey, won Miss West Virginia in 1977 and then <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/horrific-fairy-tale-girl-glittery-life-violent-death-leave-nation-bewildered-article-1.750870">attended ribbon cuttings</a> with Gov.

           <p>
            Jonbenet died in December 1996.
           </p>
           <p>
            Within four months of her death I heard an interview on TV.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time thought it was out there.  But the woman seemed intelligent sincere and sane to me (for what's that's worth.)
           </p>
           <p>
            An adult woman said she had a fairly long romantic relationship with John Ramsey when he was married to Patsy.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what she said:
           </p>
           <p>
            She is an extremely small  blond woman...she looks like a girl for some reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what John Ramsey liked and wanted her to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like a child.  She said he liked that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not  saying her interview was true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone else remember the  interview?
           </p>
           <p>
            Her story also appeared in print with her picture if I remember correctly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Writing this comment only to not leave any stone unturned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also was the John and Patsy Ramsey marriage arranged by the dark deep state?

             Yes recall the same interview. Also reports by various call girls after JBR's death that her father wanted a similar child sexual fantasy carried out by a very petite, small boned, young adult Caucasian.
            </p>
            <p>
             Claims that many who fought in Viet Nam developed an Asian or a child sexual fetish. US military of all levels went with their buds for R&amp;R whenever possible. Not all of the starving Viet Namese and Cambodian prostitutes were 18-years-old.

             The idea that the marriage between John and Patsy was arranged by the deep state is intriguing. Following her 1977 crowning as Miss West Virginia, Patsy was an associate of Sen. Robert Byrd, a deep politician involved in the Inslaw/PROMIS affair and child sex rings. And

             from one of the links you sent me says that Cathy O'Brien mentioned John Ramsey being with Robert Byrd in Michigan during the 70s or 80s.

             </p>
             <p>
              I believe the marriage mentioned above were all  arranged and ordered by the world wide cabal.
             </p>
             <p>
              think ...they did this in centuries past with monarchs.

              Ya gotta have some 'borderlines' in the mix.  This accomplished.

              One more thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pretty much proven that George H. Bush was/is a pedo and cocaine user and has been said that men were brought
to him at the Whitehouse. Can you see how that makes arranged and forced marriages 'palatable"?
             </p>
             <p>
              People in the know say George H.W.Bush liked/likes young  African

            There's a lot of allegations on the web through Cathy O'Brien that the Ramsey murder was covered up for national security:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Alan Dershowitz referred to a military video found in the Ramsey house that was censored under National Security,”
           </p>
           <p>
            “It was reportedly identified as the military video I was used in titled "How to Create a Mind Control Slave using a Stun Gun,”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Dershowitz stated on televised news that justice would never be obtained in the Ramsey case for "Reasons of National Security,"
           </p>
           <p>
            “My father and JonBenet's father were actually documented together on a ferry ride from Traverse City to Beaver Island (so-called "religious" center) near Charlevoix, Michigan,”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Also, Patsy Ramsey as Miss West Virginia was associated with my owner US Senator Robert C. Byrd,”
           </p>
           <p>
            All quotes from Cathy O'Brien talking to Write Into Action:
           </p>
           <p>
            JonBenet Ramsey murder evidence sealed as National Security
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://writeintoaction.com/Cathy%20O'Brien%20JonBenet.html">
             http://writeintoaction.com/Cathy%20O'Brien%20JonBenet.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm personally a bit skeptical about information from CO'B and her (recently-deceased) 'ex-'CIA handler Mark Philips. It would be good to find any such TV statement by Dershowitz.

             Yeah, I haven't found anything to back up Cathy O'Brien's claim about a mind control-related video being found at the Ramsey home.
             <em>
              However
             </em>
             , it is true that
             <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/US/9801/11/jonbenet/">
              the Ramseys had an instructional video for a stun gun
             </a>
             (even if Cathy is wrong/lying about the title), and the Ramseys say in their book
             <em>
              Death of Innocence
             </em>
             that they got it from a spy store in Coral Gables FL in 1994. Coincidentally (or not), security contractor and CIA front Wackenhut (which was a player in the Inslaw/PROMIS affair that involved people mentioned in my OP) was located in Coral Gables until 1995.

             Yep, PROMIS is one aspect of deep politics that ties nearly everyone and everything together: the Reagan and Bush (plus Clinton) DOJs, Oliver North, the CIA, the NSA, Mossad, the October Surprise, Iran-Contra, security contractor Wackenhut (also linked to the Dutroux affair), Robert Byrd, defense contractors (like Lockheed Martin, DynCorp, and SAIC), BCCI, the Arkansas criminal network that gave rise to the Clintons, Vince Foster's death, thwarted air defenses on 9/11, and more.

            I am heavily involved in researching right now or would help.  But here is something I remember in reading a pretty complete report.  That there is opinion that the people at the Christmas Party the Ramseys attended those people were involved and that there was a sort of disgusting party around JonBenet.  There was a man that played Santa Clause that was also mentioned.  I believe that these people were also not interviewed nor was the guest list given to the police.  You can bet that some Lockheed people were there.

             Dave McGowan's book "Programmed to Kill", in the chapter entitled "Boulder", gave a good overview of the theory that JonBenet was ritually abused and murdered at the Christmas party hosted by Fleet White. He also mentions a party 2 days earlier that had a suspicious 911 call, and has not had the guest list released.

              Yes, It was Dave McGown now that you mention it.  He mentioned the man that played Santa Clause and there was something about him having done something to someone in the family that upset his wife.  Yes, I think John Ramsey set up a party centered around the Satanic Sexual Abuse of JonBenet.  For a price.  Sick Sick Sick.  That poor girl.  She is in a better place but how she got there is very sad.  I think sometimes about how  these children feel and what they are thinking,  when their own families sell them off.  So Heartbreaking

              HIs theory did make sense based on the undigested pineapple in her stomach.  She was  killed while being abused at  the party they attended earlier, and they brought her body back to their home and then attempted a cover-up.  No wonder why their boy is so messed up.  He most likely rode in the back seat with his dead sister, knowing she was dead, but his parents telling him she was just sleeping.  Would explain why he would not know any details, too.

               John Ramsey violated and contaminated the  murder scene when he scooped up dead Jonbenet

               Or he could have been involved in the abuse.  Remember how they treated her.  He may have learned to have very little regard for her as well.  A plaything of sorts, as sick and demented as it sounds.  That is the family in a nutshell.  Sick and Demented.

               That's what I think as well. Burke does seem messed up, but the theory that
               <em>
                he
               </em>
               killed JBR has never resonated with me. In my view, the best theory that fits all the facts is the child sex ring theory, no matter how much the JBR investigative community derides it.

                I agree with you.  At first did not think  Jonbenet brother killed his sister in private.  And hid this
from everyone.
               </p>
               <p>
                But wouldn't it be easy to eliminate him as murderer based upon DNA and.bodily fluids?.  If he killed her he was not alone when he did it.  Hopefully they were not putting him through some indoctrination.  Making child kill
messing up, bad, his brain chemistry then for the rest of the child's life they control him with the threat  of exposure: you murdered...then punishment. Death himself?
               </p>
               <p>
                Where's the object used to hit JonBenet over the head? What was it?

                Maybe both things happened @ carmencita.  Maybe they made him participate in some abuse at the party, but  he was not there when she died and did not cause her death.  Knowing how kids think, when he found out she was dead on the ride home, he probably thought that what he did killed her, even though it wasn't.  That may be why I read somewhere that his voice could be heard in the background when Patsy made the 911 phone call.  The Ramseys said that Burke was in his room the entire time, but when his voice was heard he became a suspect.  Wasn't he heard to say something like.."did I do it?"  He probably was wondering if he did it.  He could have just touched her on the ride home, too, after he was told  not to.

             Not just Boulder the entire state is CIA....Military. The Denver Airport was dedicated by Bill Clinton in 1994 as the New World Order Airport ....It sits on top of CIA headquarters and massive military base.
            </p>
            <p>
             The murals on the walls of DIA are an apocalyptic vision of absolute murder and destruction before the New World Order comes to power.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Airport contains occult references in many locations including the black sun iconography which is what the Swastika in Nazi germany represents....

                wow, never made that many connections...the vibe is definitely creepy and out in the middle of no mans land.  There used to be an old airport called Stapleton that people loved, but that was before I moved here.  I'm hunkered down in the Rocky mountains and stay clear of all the "friendly" cia plants that appear to be all over the place.

             Just Lockheed Martin, I believe, but DynCorp was another contractor involved in PROMIS's development alongside Lockheed Martin.

            Tom Henegan is a brilliant lawyer and investigator. John Ramsey was an executive an insider within the United States. The Inslaw/promise affair was a very big deal but most people do not understand it. We suffer from this still today.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Ramsey was alleged to be involved in a Satanic MK Ultra programming operation with Jon Benetton being ritually abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            A name of the alleged killer and the six others that were involved was named a few weeks ago but has been scrubbed from the net.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was a ritual gone bad apparently...she was supposed to be sexually abused in a ritual but died in the middle. Thus the hastily prepared crime scene.....

             Are you able to speak to Tom Heneghan's credibility? I hadn't heard of him until this, and I haven't found much about him, but many sources uncritically repeat his claims about an Iran-Contra connection to John Ramsey without verifying them. I do agree with your theory of what happened to JonBenet. Dave McGowan wrote a whole chapter on it in "Programmed to Kill".

            With so much disinfo here, this is a quality post. A great find and my heart sank reading this new information because these connections make sense. That poor child. There is real evil in this world.
