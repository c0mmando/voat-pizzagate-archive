As soon as I walked in I saw some old friends I hadn\'t seen in a while, said what\'s up, and immediately noticed on the T.V was an Elsa dressed up doing a skit with Spider-Man. I immediately knew it was this weird ElsaGate shit. I had no clue why they were watching it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a minute or 2 of greeting my buddies I directed my attention back to the T.V and noticed there were 2 young girls, about 7 years old, that were watching. They were my friend\'s 2 nieces whom I\'d never met.</p>

<p>Any who, initially I couldn\'t help but blab a little something out about #ElsaGate immediately. Keep in mind, They\'ve never heard of PizzaGate, Elsa Gate, or any hard facts on 9/11 for that matter. He\'s a family guy and doesn\'t really delve into conspiracies much. So for that reason it\'s always fun to talk to him about them, lol... I brought up #ElsaGate and the videos that were on in the other room... He seemed very concerned for his nieces well being and was all ears. I began telling him that many people considered those videos perverted for a variety of reasons. He was genuinely confused but had a little smile on his face because he knows I always have a conspiracy for everything. That\'s when I realized.</p>

We hashed it out for a bit, and he was even aware of some of the stuff like exploding hulks, constant shots, eating poop, but I could see it was probably better to drop it.

            I’m not sure you need to be a conspiracy theorist to see that these videos are harmful.  I mean, programming aside, who wants little children seeing that garbage?

            Wow -- those videos seem pretty self evidently horrid. I'm going to try showing one to a neutral friend and see if they think it's ok for kids to watch them.

            Somehow I feel you must have had on one of the tamer videos...a lot of those videos are obviously messed up, not just a "if you look closely..." kind of a thing.

             Yeah i saw one where an adult makes things with colourful magic sand in each video. They make a human shape with the sand and strap it to the table with tape, decapitate it with a sharp knife to the sound of babies crying and chop the body into pieces. In another video they slowly run over its head with a toy truck. Then there was that Russian girl on another channel who was injected in the butt for real and was crying hysterically while the "mother" and "father" held her down for it.  I can't watch anymore of those videos. Fuck youtube.

            I think you have touched on one of the reasons these videos exist. It is to desensitize parents to images that deeply corrupt the psyche of a child. Above all, this is a spiritual battle. If your friend is at the point where he shrugs these videos off as harmless for kids, he is in tremendous spiritual danger. It is like a sickness. The more the soul accepts this spiritual virus, the more it grows within the person and the more control the individual is under. I firmly believe these videos carry with them dark spells and the purpose is to destroy the mind and soul of anyone without discernment.

             Oh you are so very wise.  I see exactly what you see.  Also I remember someone posting on here that the children that see these things over and over are repeating things they have seen even after the parents cut them off cold turkey.  This is scary and very eerie.  I don't know what parents are thinking nowadays.  A lot of people that have gone to college even don't get the psychological damage these can do.  It is so hard to turn back the clock on  child's brain.

            It's so true.  My sister is on our wavelength, told her to Google Elsagate and she deleted her You Tube app off her devices immediately..she has young kids.

            I tried to tell some other friends...and just get the "I dont get it?" look.  At least we tried.

             Fuck I hate that one... makes me wish that gun from Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy, the one that fires your thoughts directly and concisely into the mind of the person you aim at, existed.

            The line in the matrix movie about how they generally don't unplug adults. That it's too dangerous for the mind. It seems true about people and facing the hard satanic rapey truth of the world.
