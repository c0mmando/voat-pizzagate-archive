Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death.</p>

<p>Now onto the post itself. The basis for my arguments in this thread.</p>

<p>Notice that the problem was actually in her small intestine, which is where Giardia usually wreaks its havoc. It can lead to IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Crohn\'s is one subtypes type of IBS. </p>
<p>Giardia: <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/giardia_lamblia/article.htm">https://www.medicinenet.com/giardia_lamblia/article.htm</a> (Note it says individuals who practice anal/oral sex may become infected.)</p>
<p>Crohn\'s disease: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn</a>\'s_disease</p>
<p>Heather\'s immediate causes of death were:
A) Cardio-respiratory arrest.</p>
<p>B) Suspected septic shock.</p>
<p>C) Acute bowel obstruction (the underlying cause of A and B).</p>
<p>The bowel obstruction was likely in the small bowel because the other significant condition contributing to death was stenosis (narrowing) of the small intestine. </p>
<p>An exploratory laparotomy (opening the abdomen to search for the cause of a problem) was performed on her date of death, 2/1/1988. A bowel resection (removal of a section of bowel) was also performed, presumably due to the stenosis. </p>
<p>She died at 2:43 pm (1443 hours). It doesn\'t say what time the surgery was performed, so she might have died during surgery. </p>
<p>When she died, her bowel had been obstructed for 36 hours, so a day and a half before she died. She was in septic shock for six hours, so that could have begun before or after surgery. She was in cardio-respiratory arrest for 30 minutes, likely the amount of time that they spent trying to revive her before calling the time of death.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Notes: I suspect that Chrons Disease is a lie. The cover up that was mentioned in the blind. The reason Chrons got into the autopsy is because the coroner and the person writing the death certificate were also lied to as part of the cover up, thus unwittingly taking part in the cover up themselves (thus NOT accomplices). The section of the intestine that had the stenosis was not identified. This is important. I suspect that this omnission may have been deliberate or coerced as part of the cover up.</li>

<p>Timeline: 
* Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. 
** Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. 
** Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Happy Days: 
** Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California. 
** Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her rectum. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
** Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples (or an accomplice).
** Accomplice (others): Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsU</a>  The MacCuly Culkininterview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O\'Rourke\'s skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-30.html?m=1">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-30.html?m=1</a> If my deduction is correct, given the above, the Heather O\'Rourke story could be the subject of the threats in this blind. I personally suspect that the bad shit in Culkin\'s life (the drugs) was from trauma due to the horrors he saw (namely the O\'Rourke skin shoes).</p>
<p>🚨 Any producer, actor, or director with the red shoes needs to be identified. This subject matter is worth its own thread (maybe it will help me find the identity of the people who have “trophies” of O’Rourke).
🚨</p>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npXwUnfk6Eg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npXwUnfk6Eg</a>  Around the 24 minute mark, seems Heather didn’t have ANY symptoms until 1987. Based on the account of a medic, its highly unlikely for a congenital birth defect in the colon to go completely unnoticed in terms of symptoms for that long.</p>
<p>I’ll be running an experiment. One who’s results could appear in a future thread.</p>',

           Notice that the problem was actually in her small intestine, which is where Giardia usually wreaks its havoc. It can lead to IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Crohn's is one subtypes type of IBS.

           Heather's immediate causes of death were:
A) Cardio-respiratory arrest.
          </p>
          <p>
           B) Suspected septic shock.
          </p>
          <p>
           C) Acute bowel obstruction (the underlying cause of A and B).
          </p>
          <p>
           The bowel obstruction was likely in the small bowel because the other significant condition contributing to death was stenosis (narrowing) of the small intestine.
          </p>
          <p>
           An exploratory laparotomy (opening the abdomen to search for the cause of a problem) was performed on her date of death, 2/1/1988. A bowel resection (removal of a section of bowel) was also performed, presumably due to the stenosis.
          </p>
          <p>
           She died at 2:43 pm (1443 hours). It doesn't say what time the surgery was performed, so she might have died during surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
           When she died, her bowel had been obstructed for 36 hours, so a day and a half before she died. She was in septic shock for six hours, so that could have begun before or after surgery. She was in cardio-respiratory arrest for 30 minutes, likely the amount of time that they spent trying to revive her before calling the time of death.

            Personal Notes: I suspect that Chrons Disease is a lie. The cover up that was mentioned in the blind. The reason Chrons got into the autopsy is because the coroner and the person writing the death certificate were also lied to as part of the cover up, thus unwittingly taking part in the cover up themselves (thus NOT accomplices). The section of the intestine that had the stenosis was not identified. This is important. I suspect that this omnission may have been deliberate or coerced as part of the cover up.

           The pic here is telling. Shows just how close the small intestines really are to the colon. As in right next to them. Meaning that a penetrative injury to the anus can possibly damage the small intestines too.

           Stenosis can happen in the ileum. That’s the last part of small intestine, nearest to the colon.

           Timeline: 
* Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. 
** Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. 
** Accomplices: Judy Wix

             The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California. 
** Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her rectum. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
** Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples (or an accomplice).
** Accomplice (others): Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice.

           The MacCuly Culkininterview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O'Rourke's skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.

           If my deduction is correct, given the above, the Heather O'Rourke story could be the subject of the threats in this blind. I personally suspect that the bad shit in Culkin's life (the drugs) was from trauma due to the horrors he saw (namely the O'Rourke skin shoes).
          </p>
          <p>
           🚨 Any producer, actor, or director with the red shoes needs to be identified. This subject matter is worth its own thread (maybe it will help me find the identity of the people who have “trophies” of O’Rourke).
🚨
          </p>
          <p>
           Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

           Around the 24 minute mark, seems Heather didn’t have ANY symptoms until 1987. Based on the account of a medic, its highly unlikely for a congenital birth defect in the colon to go completely unnoticed in terms of symptoms for that long.

           I’ll be running an experiment. One who’s results could appear in a future thread.

             Red shoes are made from human skin typically of children who have been murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
             Human skin is a bit more translucent than other species (due to being comparatively lacking hair/fur/scales/feathers, note the emphasis on comparatively). Meaning that when skinned, you can see evidence of residual attached capilaries (small blood vessels). The shoes are dyed red both to conceal the evidence and for the symbolism they’re so obsessed with.

             Learned this when looking at the Hampstead case.

            Are you taking screenshots of the pages you link? These pages will be "lost" in time. I hope you took screen grabs! Great work. I do not believe for a second that she died of a congenital defect.

            How can anyone commit these horrible crimes?  I know a lot of people would never agree with me, but I think a person has to be demonically possessed.  The things they do to other people are the sickest, most vile acts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for pulling all of that info together.  It looks like youtube is quickly taking down the videos.  This one was gone:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsUYouTube">
              https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsUYouTube
             </a>
             The MacCuly Culkininterview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O'Rourke's skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Tells you all you need to  know about youtube.  I am always amazed at how fast they pull stuff down that any sane person would want to see exposed.  They are just as sick and involved I am quite sure.

            <p>
             Hey, can someone help me? I just signed up and I don't have enough points to make a post here yet.
Here's what I want to say:
            </p>
            <p>
             Hey guys,
            </p>
            <p>
             Been following this pizzagate thing since the jump. Never bothered to make an account here, but I've recently come across some very disturbing information that I don't know what to do with.
            </p>
            <p>
             A while back, poking around the internet, I kept coming across comments/rumors about a certain production company in the southwest of America that was said to produce child snuff pornography. What was baffling to me is that there were people naming names, yet it still seemed to be a sort of urban legend. I made a post about it on another form. I got a few private replies from people saying it was true, but without saying much more than that. One person told me they'd tell me their personal story about it, but never did.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just a few days ago, this person sent me a video they made, detailing their personal experience with this company/people involved with this operation. I just watched it. I don't know what to do, because it sounds like this person's life is in danger. I want to help this person get their story out, but I don't want to further endanger them.
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesn't sound like the police can be trusted. From some cursory research, it's more than likely they're complicit. This person says that they've reached out to every governmental agency in the state they can think of, and nothing has been done. All of us on here know the people involved in these things reach high-levels, and I'm personally distrustful of just about every governmental organization when child-abuse is involved. We know that CP didn't become a billion-dollar industry from broke bois are purchasing the videos.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, I'm in a bit of a bind. This is one of those things where I feel like I'm complicit in allowing evil to flourish/exist if I don't try to do something, but I also don't know what to do. Does anyone know of a trust-worthy organization that I can reach out to or put this person in touch with? Was thinking about e-mailing Timothy Holmseth and seeing if he could do something, as he's been pretty fearless in putting pedos on blast. We're talking about hardcore criminals that have the Hells Angels on their bankroll here, so I want to approach this with the upmost caution.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
(also trying to be vague here as I know pedos lurk this board, and I don't know who knows, etc.)

              Have an UPVoat and Welcome!  Don't forget when you do your first post to always follow the Rules in the Sidebar.  We are always happy to have new members we can wake up with well sourced research.

              Was your friend locked up and tortured and abused?  Was this involving the Catholic Church or another Religion?  Do not take any dangerous steps.  Also, do not start blaming yourself.  All the guilt is on the people that did these horrible things to the Victim.
              <br/>
              Since the Hell's Angels are involved, possibly this could be MS-13, and if this is the case,  tread very carefully. You are right when you say that some of Law Enforcement is compromised although some are not, but it's hard to know who is and isn't unless you personally know of someone.  If you are not a trained professional, you should not take any of this on yourself.  This sounds like a dangerous game.  I would say that you might contact Holmseth for I believe that he is one of the few you can trust.  There are so many out there that are fakes, be careful.   You can always come here for help.  Always ask us or me, God Bless You and Take Care.

             Any of these is plausible. That takedown is evidence that yes, what is being claimed did infact happen.

              I hope someone with skills comes to help.  I know a lot of people do not do a lot of investigating into this stuff.  I think it is easier to look away and pretend it is too horrible to be true.  That is why these people have gotten away with this for so long.

              People will spend weeks talking about Pocahontas or Horseface, but  a story like this will be gone within a day or two, no one talks about it.  And those that do are labeled crazy.
