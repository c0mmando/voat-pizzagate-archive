<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pope Francis acknowledged Saturday that the Vatican has a 2,000-case backlog in processing clerical sex abuse cases and says criticism of the slow pace was justified. But he says more staff are being added and insists the Vatican is &quot;on the right path.&quot;</p>
<p>Francis was making his first comments about the criticism leveled at the Vatican\'s handling of sex abuse cases by Marie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor who resigned from Francis\' sex abuse advisory commission in March. Collins quit because of what she said was the &quot;unacceptable&quot; level of resistance within the Vatican to implementing the group\'s proposals to better care for victims and protect children from priests who rape and molest them&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that the Pope sets the tone for the rest of society as to how to stall and attempt to stifle the increasingly strong public revulsion with the issue.  This is shameful.</p>',

            Heard on the news this morning:  Pope looks forward to his meeting with Trump.  Bingo.  This should be an experience for the Pope, if Trump really will drain the swamp, especially when he turned down Kissinger when he asked him to drop the pedo purge.  Will he attempt to give the Pope a gift of red shoes?
