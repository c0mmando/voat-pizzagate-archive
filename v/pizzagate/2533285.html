The 28-year-old was found in his hotel room in Oman last Friday, April 20. Oman police ruled out any criminal wrongdoing in his death, and a new statement from his family heavily implies suicide; however, until official police and autopsy reports are released, we won’t know for sure.
Then, on the other hand, we have K Theory, who seems to be feeding into a conspiracy theory that Avicii was murdered for his hand in trying to expose a pedophile ring; that theory holds that Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave, and Chester Bennington, of Linkin Park, were also apparently “murdered” for the same reason.</p>
<p>“Avicii was murdered,” posted K Theory. “I knew there was something sus about his death &amp; this breaks my heart. The news is saying this is fake news but I know there is truth to this in my heart. The world is a lot [scarier] than any of us want to admit but it is time for us to wake up out of the matrix &amp; realize what is going on, especially in the music industry. RIP Tim, Chris, and Chester”</p>
<p>K Theory goes even deeper into the rabbit hole in the comments, with gems like:</p>
<p>“They already got you if you are fighting for their agenda online”
“if avicii was not murdered by hand he was murdered by the industry, run by evil people that are linked to pedophilia”
“if you are attacking a newsource that is trying to out the pedophile, sex trafficking, and human trafficking around the world you need to question whose side you are on”
“all three deaths do not make sense, the claims are real, the industry elite love doing evil things to children, it’s well documented”
It goes on…</p>
<p>While we’d love for there to be some deeper meaning to Avicii’s passing (though not necessarily something so insidious), the truth is likely far more mundane. Occam’s Razor applies. As for K Theory, we suggest he stop drinking the Kool-Aid and come back to reality for a breather.&quot;</p>

            GTFO. Avicci was a raised as a satanic tranny and placed into the the position he was in. Where do you think he got his name?

                 Go ahead and try to paint me as a shill while sticking to your anti-Satanism propaganda, you're either blind or, quite likely - given your tactics - a Scientologist shill. I might glow in the dark, but, tis light which makes darkness flee; it's about time for you to scurry away, roach - though, I'm sure you won't, you seem stupid enough to keep trying.
