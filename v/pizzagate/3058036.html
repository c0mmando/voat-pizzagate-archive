<p>Why was she \'selected\'?
                               Ginsburg supports the degenerate pedophiles among the Elect!
Who appointed her?                                     <br />
                               Ginsburg was appointed by Bill Clinton a violent serial Rapist in Revenge over Clinton\'s Impeachment </p>
<p>Remember [her] history</p>
<p>Ref: 230-page book called             &quot;Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, published in 1977 by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights&quot;</p>
<p>Highlights:
           &gt;Called for the sex-integration of prisons and reformatories so that conditions of imprisonment, security and housing could be equal. She explained, “If the grand design of such institutions is to prepare inmates for return to the community as persons equipped to benefit from and contribute to civil society, then perpetuation of single-sex institutions should be rejected.” (Page 101)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Called for the sex-integration of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts because they “perpetuate stereotyped sex roles.” (Page 145)</p>
<p>Insisted on sex-integrating “college fraternity and sorority chapters” and replacing them with “college social 
societies.” (Page 169) 
Cast constitutional doubt on the legality of “Mother’s Day and Father’s Day as separate holidays.” (Page 146)</p>
<p>Called for reducing the age of consent for sexual acts to people who are “less than 12 years old.” (Page 102)</p>
<p>Asserted that laws against “bigamists, persons cohabiting with more than one woman, and women cohabiting 
with a bigamist” are unconstitutional. (Page 195)</p>
<p>Objected to laws against prostitution because “prostitution, as a consensual act between adults, is arguably 
within the zone of privacy protected by recent constitutional decisions.” (Page 97)</p>
<p>Ginsburg wrote that the Mann Act (which punishes those who engage in interstate sex traffic of women and 
girls) is “offensive.” Such acts should be considered “within the zone of privacy.” (Page 98)
Demanded that we “firmly reject draft or combat exemption for women,” stating “women must be subject to the 
                                                       draft if men are.” But, she added, “the need for affirmative action and for transition measures is particularly 
                                                       strong in the uniformed services.” (Page 218)</p>
<p>An indefatigable censor, Ginsburg listed hundreds of “sexist” words that must be eliminated from all statutes. 
Among words she found offensive were: man, woman, manmade, mankind, husband, wife, mother, father, 
sister, brother, son, daughter, serviceman, longshoreman, postmaster, watchman, seamanship, and “to man” (a 
vessel). (Pages 15-16)</p>
<p>Wanted he, she, him, her, his, and hers to be dropped down the memory hole. They must be replaced by 
he/she, her/him, and hers/his, and federal statutes must use the bad grammar of “plural constructions to 
avoid third person singular pronouns.” (Page 52-53)</p>
<p>Condemned the Supreme Court’s ruling in Harris v. McRae and claimed that taxpayer-funded abortions 
should be a constitutional right.</p>

              Not sure about all of it because I didn't check or read it all, however the part about her wishing to lower the age of consent is disinformation. And if you argue with a (rare)  well informed liberal they will destroy you in a debate, which almost never happens. The idea comes from a opinion she wrote that the legislation written tends to be sexist in that it usually specifically calls out men, and not women. In this opinion letter she cites two bills as examples. One or both of these bills were to lower the age of consent. She didn't write these bills or support the bills she just used them as examples in the opinion of hers that bills and laws tend to only say "he" and not say "he, or she" which means literally all laws are only against men, unless we assume he also means she..
             </p>
             <p>
              But because we dislike her liberal ways, it's common disinformation that she supported lowering the age of consent just based on people never research fully and assume since the text shows up in her opinion it was hers. Looking more closely shows it's not hers its an example of a bill that shows what she considers to be sexist language.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't fall for that trap against a well informed liberal unicorn, or they'll make you look like you're a mindless conservative..

              <p>
               I researched it, and you are right. She didn't call for reducing the age of consent. The book OP quotes has disinformation, he needs to delete this from his OP.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, RBG did something interesting - she pointed out that sex offender needn't necessarily be male. A stance that was quite revolutionary at the time where no one talked about female abusers or sexual harassers.
