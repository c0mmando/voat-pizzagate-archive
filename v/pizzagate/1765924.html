            here is a timeline on Laura Silsby leading to her Haiti arrest
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Now before this, in 2007 she was divorced from Terry Silsby, but it took till 2010 to finalize agreements, in the meantime, she is sued by an employee of her company  Personal Shopper Inc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personal Shopper is the subject of a host of lawsuits and unpaid wage claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Employees won nine of those complaints and Silsby was ordered to pay $31,000 in wages plus another $4,000 in fines
           </p>
           <p>
            she stiffed her lawyer for $19,000 in regards to these suits
           </p>
           <p>
            The $358,000 Meridian house at which she founded her nonprofit New Life Children's Refuge in November was foreclosed upon in December. A check of Silsby's driving record revealed at least nine traffic citations since 1997, including four for failing to provide insurance or register annually.
           </p>
           <p>
            the mother of three was named eWomenNetwork's international businesswoman of the
           </p>
           <p>
            Silsby had a history of failing to pay debts, failing to pay her employees and failing even to follow Idaho laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            The woman arrested with her, Charisa Coulter, was her 24 yr old nanny.
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I can find, her ex husband Terry is President at M C Squared , which employs 1 person, and he makes $60,000
           </p>
           <p>
            Where did they get the money to live like that?   Something is so wrong here. And now she has started up 2 more businesses, think post would be above somewhere,

            She is also apparently just one degree of seperation away from both James Alefantis and David Brock through the lawyer who handled their $850,000 blackmail case. He sits on the board of directors of "Friends of the Orphans of Haiti" which is the exact same orphanage that Laura Silsby stole the 33 children from.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clintons, of course, are connected to both Alefantis and Silsby in completely different ways. Now the question is, can the Clintons be connected to Maccoby as well? Does anyone know?

            She was kidnapping them and did not even have an orphanage. The children were not even orphans, they had parents. The parents called Silsby a liar. She was told several times to stop attempting to smuggle children out of the country and warned she would be arrested. They finally arested her and the Clintons got her out. It is not plauasable that you believe what you say you do if you had read any of this. So I can only assume you did not read it, or you are a shill.

            Laura Silsby and the 9 other Baptist missionaries were the satanists that stole the kids. They were the sex traffickers, members of Congress are even starting to say this now. It is being reported they took at least 100 kids out of Haiti before they were caught. These kind of satanist don't even realise what they are doing but the kids always end up in the end in the hands of sex traffickers. The demonic Baptist sex traffickers were let off scot free and roam around America free now! That's justice for you!!

            Nice to see a girl land back on her feet after a trying time, and in a job she, no doubt, loves. I thought Sean Penn was in charge of Haiti.

             i feel the same way, its actually starting to piss me off. "good work finding this and spotting her changed name. well researched." how did op not feel he was wasting time and energy and peoples attention by posting on something already so thoroughly covered. other people way before now did the leg work and all the research, this is like scratching the surface at best and isnt even possible to be original. silsby has been discussed in her own posts numerous timesand been brought up in other ones numerous times also. idk just feels fucking retarded and is pissin me off lel

            This is old, old news, and you didn't even hit on some of the more interesting points. She got caught with 40 kids and let go before being arrested with 33. And more than likely got away with stealing 100! From a friend of James Alefantis. Read up on what citizens researchers have found...
            <br/>
            That said, yes! This, to me, is the most clear-cut straightforward part of pizzagate. It's what I use to try to redpill people. It so obviously cries out for an investigation, especially with all the connections investigators have found.

            I know it sounds weird! The one Pedo they did you YouTube. When they did reverse speech on him. Backwards he talked about the 10 yr old girl he had brought to him, said she was brought in by sea on a raft, and what she ate. Someone said they thought they heard him say she lived off of eels, crows, and rats. Poor girl! It's very interesting but I don't know how scientific it would be!? No telling what we could find out by reverse speech

            CBS (60 Minutes) recently interviewed Mike Cernovich and tried to blame him for the Pizzagate shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cernovich eviscerates Scott Pelly by exposing Hillary's connection to Laura Silsbey and Jeffery Epstein and CBS edited that part out, but the transcript is here:

            Laura Silsby was a satanist stealing the children. The worst kind of satanist is the one that attends a church. I would go so far to say that some of them don't even know they are satanists! You are going to see a lot of pastors, ex pastors, and church going people arrested in the future! It is already starting!

            I don't know why people don't see this? Who took kids out of Haiti? 10 Baptist missionaries, they were stealing the kids. Evidently they all came back to the U.S. And never got any jail time, but got a free pass!!! The head honcho is working for Amber Alert now! Hope your child doesn't go missing!!

            It is good that this bubbles up now and again...for us long timers we have seen tons on Silsby.  If you are new here..this is a MAJOR thread which ties human trafficking to both the Clinton Foundation and to Haiti where we know the Clintons were uber active.  WJC made a call to get Silsby off.  Then in what is a common thing for these people...she changed her name (how many frickin' names does Alefantis go by...) and is now working for THE AMBER ALTER NETWORK...
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting thread which may resurface but similar is that every missing child report goes thru the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children...how comfortable are YOU with a Podesta on that staff???

             Because the govt and most big companies are run by pedos and criminals.  They protect each other, every now and then they sacrifice one when their actions because too obvious and they threaten the group, i.e. wiener, hastert, epstien.  Then they get pitifully small sentences and most of their actions are scrubbed from the news when they get out of jail.
             <br/>
             The only thing we little people can do is keep shining the light on these perverts.

              We can pray and fast. Fast one meal a day or a couple of meals a week and ask God for help fighting this. It does make a difference! God hears our prayers when we fast especially. This is a spiritual battle of evil vs good. Laura's connection to Pizzagate is more important than what people think! The bible says the Kings of the earth commit fornication with the whore of Babylon. This is what we are seeing take place between Laura and the Clintons. Laura (associated with the whore of Babylon) was left out of jail and given a job by a King of the earth (Clinton). If you understand this, you will understand what is happening with Pizzagate! In other words some kind of religious organization will always be involved with the governments satanic activities of the world. The Catholics, the Baptists, ex pastors such as the one just arrested in St Louis, are greatly involved in Pizzagate. Reminder-the South Korean leader was just impeached for being satanic basically! This stuff is real!!!! Don't let anyone tell you it isn't.

               Funny, I am both fasting and praying at the moment, so your message is affirming to receive : ) Thank you!  Believe me, I believe you. I'm in the midst of a big research piece just now after finding something extremely important. It's connected to all you've stated here. Your mentioning this part from the bible has made me connect something else, just now, so thank you for this too.  Keep praying and fasting !

            You claim there were bff's and she was working for the Clintons?   Prove that Clinton even knew who this woman was prior to this.

             Correct me if I'm wrong, but The Clinton Foundation through Bill Clinton and Hillary too (it's her foundation too after all), did play a big part in defending Silsby, and ultimately, their assistance ensured her release.

                The embassy is Santo Domingo got notified that 10 Americans from Idaho got arrested by Haitian police.  They told the Haitian Desk at Consular Affairs.  Consular Affairs emailed Michelle Bond.  Michelle Bond emailed Cherly Mills.  Cherly Mills told Clinton.  At the time, these were sent, nobody even knew the names of these American Citizens.   This is routine state department stuff.

                 From my understanding it was Hillary that helped her get free, so she did seek her out! People need to see the Baptist connection here and they ARE NOT as usual! Giving them a pass cause Christians would never purposely be involved with something like this. /sarc When  IN a FACT they were! It is what the sheep are not seeing and I have been trying to say it on this board. My post are taken off! The churches are in fact where the demons are and they are spreading out from there into government!!! It's in plain sight and people are just to content to live in their comfortable deceived lives. It's called being willing deceived!! If anyone can't understand clearly what I am saying. I'll say it real plain. Our churches are possessed too. If our churches are possessed, you can expect the government to be even worse!

              There's no way that 2001 can be the correct date on that email.   Clinton was not at State yet.  That has to be a typo.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT.  That document is not an email.  The State Department has no to or from listed on that document.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think that document was inserted into this email from Jan 30 2010.  Not as an attachment, but inserted probably as an image.

              This seems to be the one of the first emails on the Silsby case.  She is not identified yet.  They just refer to her group as 10 AmCits  (American Citizens)
             </p>
             <p>
              You can search the Clinton emails for that phrase and you'll see a bunch emails about AmCits including issues regarding pirates , an incident on a cruise ship and others.   That is because it is routine State Department business to deal with/monitor situations like this.

             Would love that, but arrest her for what? A case could be made however that she should not, because of her past history,
             <em>
              under any circumstances
             </em>
             be permitted to work anywhere near a childrens' organization.  That could be possibly done through a campaign.

               Although I'd dearly love that to happen, as it didn't occur in the US they wouldn't be able to arrest her there. The fact that she intended to take them back to the US, could may make it possible, however we know this is never going to happen : /

                i do consider working with the Amber alert to be a government job. You can say a private company but it is with a government client! Duh anything involving Amber Alert is definitely government connected!!

                 That's fantastic but you're wrong.

                 She works in marketing for a techonology product.  The customers of these products are not children.   There's nothing about her job that needs to involve children.

                 I work in a technology and our product is used in classrooms among other places.  Mostly college and highschool, but some grade school.   The government among others buy our products.   Just like AlertSense.  I never have to deal with kids or college students  or any other end users.  And in AlertSense's case, the end users are adults.
We are a private company and the government has never, ever been involved with our hiring.
