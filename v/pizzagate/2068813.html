             Seymour Hersch already told us it was Seth Rich. Hey Rohrabacher, in case you didn't hear, Hersch knows who the leaker is.

             Assange would NEVER release a source, even under the best of circumstances. If he did, it blows up the whole thing.

             Rohrabacher says he "can't remember" if he talked to the White House about a pardon? Yeah, right.

            <p>
             Seymour Hersh did not tell us that.  Seymour Hersh never published that story.  This is a key thing.  Journalists get told a lot of things, they try to verify before they publish.  This is a key thing when you talk about intelligence work too.  Just because the CIA has a document, doesn't mean the CIA believes it's true.   This why they have analysts.  And why their work is reviewed and crosschecked.  Raw intelligence is viewed with skepticism.  A CIA "report" means the raw intelligence has been evaluated and the analyst community is rendering a judgement.   Often the raw intel gets leaked by folks with an agenda.  In this case Seymour Hersh did not put his name on this.
            </p>
            <p>
             And in a interview he seems doubt the "insider" who told him something.

             .....I just went to look for that link, when I see there is a follow up published yesterday

             <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/08/16/543830392/the-role-of-ed-butowsky-in-advancing-retracted-seth-rich-story">
              http://www.npr.org/2017/08/16/543830392/the-role-of-ed-butowsky-in-advancing-retracted-seth-rich-story
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's what Hersh says
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Butowsky follows the lead, speaks five days after Trump's inauguration with the legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hersh by phone. Butowsky says he doesn't know who Hersh is and records the conversation, which he later shares with others. And the audio recording obtained by NPR shows Hersh referring to an insider source who describes an FBI report reflecting that Rich had leaked information to WikiLeaks.
             </p>
             <p>
              The tape shows Butowsky is eager to leverage information to knock down suspicions about ties between the Russians and Trump's circle. "The most important thing is this: ... So many people throughout Trump's four years, maybe eight years, are always going to fall back on the idea that he's not legitimate, and the Russians got him elected," Butowsky says to Hersh. "This changes all of that."
             </p>
             <p>
              Butowsky tells Hersh he will be able to resolve the question of Rich's death for his parents. "And, second, we solve the problem about Russians are the ones that gave the emails," Butowsky says, "because that did not happen."
             </p>
             <p>
              Hersh warns Butowsky against believing anything Assange might say. You can hear Hersh also give this caution to Butowsky at the end: "It doesn't make it true. It doesn't make it true." Hersh tells NPR he meant that the report might be wrong or might not exist at all.
             </p>
             <p>
              In an interview with NPR, Hersh says he is skeptical of the official account by intelligence officials that the Russians hacked the DNC. But Hersh now says he was fishing for information from Butowsky.** "I did not talk to anybody at the FBI — not about this," Hersh tells NPR. "Nothing is certain until it's proved. And I didn't publish any story on this."**
             </p>
             <p>
              Assange would NEVER release a source, even under the best of circumstances.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I bet you could find a lot of folks in 2009 talking about things Assange would never do.   People change.  It happens.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              If he did, it blows up the whole thing.

             He's currently living in an embassy, perhaps he's ready to blow up the whole thing.

            But Rohrabacher hasn't even talked to anyone in the White House about the pardon, so this is really just nothing. He doesn't have the authority to go handing out pardons. Not to mention the fact that Wikileaks has never revealed a source. I don't expect them to start now.

              What part of "never" wasn't clear? That could potentially put Rich's family, friends, and associates at risk. Not to mention scaring off potential future leakers.

             The RNC thing feels like a cover story to paper over why Assange and Rohrabacher actually spoke.  I mean Assange has a lawyer right?  Could his lawyer convey any information/offer to the Justice Department?  Has anyone heard of Rohrabacher having any special pull with Trump previously?  I have not.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other odd bit about this is Julian Assange has steadfastly denied that accusations that he works closely with Russia.  Yet he chooses Rohrabacher as his intermediary?   Rohrabacher is known as "Putin's favorite Congressman" and people have even speculated that he is a paid Russian asset. In 2012, the FBI warned him that the Russia was trying to recruit him.

             House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy was recorded saying he believes Putin pays Rohrabacher (and Trump.)  This was denied at first until the Washinton Post produced the recording.  He said this  Paul Ryan, Steve Scalise and other House leaders.   The story was then changed to, it was just a bad joke.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A month before Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination, one of his closest allies in Congress — House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy — made a politically explosive assertion in a private conversation on Capitol Hill with his fellow GOP leaders: that Trump could be the beneficiary of payments from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
             </p>
             <p>
              “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, according to a recording of the June 15, 2016, exchange, which was listened to and verified by The Washington Post. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is a Californian Republican known in Congress as a fervent defender of Putin and Russia.
