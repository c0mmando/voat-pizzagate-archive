            , we can't see your screenshots because you left them on your desktop. You have to upload them to an image host like catbox.moe first. What I really need, though, is the direct link to the Chandler tweet itself. Consequently, this thread doesn't satisfy Rule 2. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since this guy pushes the "Cabal are Extra Terrestrials preying on Earthlings" thing, though, I may have to flair this as Disinfo or remove per Rule 1 when I see them, depending on what his claims actually are. The appropriate subverse for pure speculation about "Pledieans" is
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            For now, though, you can fix the links and I'll take a look.

             Well, personally I have to defend both the Q community and this subvoat for coordinating on this thread of corruption. Look, if you go to voat's QRV or GreatAwakening, they talk about us pizzagaters just like you do right now; obsessed or deluded with only one part of a larger whole. The truth is, it's two threads to the same goal. From what I can tell, most of the investigators here are wise enough to keep a very close eye on QAnon activity, and vice-versa for those in QRV. Despite what the loudest say, many people there have a very invested interest in the well-being and select pursuit of saving children. If anything, do not downplay our intent. Sure, maybe this twatter guy is a tad unhelpful or desperate for the limelight, I don't know, it's too early &amp; unnecessary to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll grant you the politics look very left versus right-wing in Q's favour to Trump, and I'd even accept their taskforce, if real, is immensely biased towards Republicans and that this has increased some unhelpful polarity, I don't really care, because it's also much more about constitutional versus non-constitutional / immoral / evil enterprises. Do not forget how much headway we've made because of Q, and I'd dare say how much their movement has benefited from our top researchers. His clues are invaluable, including this very person of interest right now, which has given us a lot to build on. We aren't on different sides, like it or not. You have to recognize some of their legitimacy.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the argument itself, well the whole point is to not disclose the vulnerable and to safeguard anonymity, so of course Q never shares pictures of his team on the ground, unless their coded or purposefully ambiguous. How exactly, if he did show images of kids, would you believe they were real or from him? Sure, it was a long time ago, and maybe you're impatient and sick of all the waiting when we have enough to supposedly take them down. Once again, it's not about the ones you know, it's about the ones who own them, or source them, fund them, and it's way too fucking big to compromise the whole for a few public names. Sorry to rant, but if you're a vet here you should know how many more dimensions this encompasses than just pizzagate. I'm not even mid-twenties, and I know enough from my years to see how many threads there are to come down. If you think you've seen the unbelievable, or the darkest, most twisted &amp; existentially challenging, please believe me you have not.

               of interest, Ray Chandler.
You've only been registered on voat for the last year. Q first pointed to Chandler on April 7th, 2018, almost a year to now. As far as I know, this is the first mention of Chandler on the subvoat, by a user who knows her:
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1436568">
                https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1436568
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Progress was immensely slow, with very little interest. We didn't get anywhere near the traction of shutting down her instagram and archiving all her posts &amp; insider pics until Q went full focus on directing the movement towards it.

                Nope it's all old info and not even particularly interesting.

                It is really pathetic how you small-brained types want to have it both ways: "Q is maybe not totally trustworthy, but he says some true stuff, growing "the movement", albeit with boomer women who believe fairy tales."

            Okay just been searching anywhere else online that name turns up, via Yandex, Yahoo, DuckDuck, Google, QWant, Bing, and the last five research threads on 8chan. He doesn't seem to be copying from any place I can see, even the dedicated Chandler thread. This from his reply feed directly:

            Yeah, look I'm not gonna invest too much into this until further info. He's just too random, the source too unsubstantiated, the name itself is unhelpful and yielded no results I can work with. I'd discard this for now. Thanks for the info, you were quick enough it seems nobody else picked up on it but that anon in the image above. Couldn't figure out where that was, btw, indicative of my detective skills.
