            This is not Pizzagate.. Don't let politicians watching porn turn this into a 'you touch yourself' witch hunt,  OK ??

            There is a rash of these stories in recent days and it could very well be an INTENTIONAL diversion.

             You can tell from the story he doesn't speak English well. We know there's child sex trafficking involved in smuggling from Latin American countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also owns a taxi cab company, and we know transportation is one component to trafficking too:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Representative-elect Ramon Perez, D-Providence, is a taxi cab company owner. He’s a native of the Dominican Republic who came to the United States more than 20 years ago."

             Actually, no one knows if it's pizzagate or not. He's a politician apparently looking for pornography of young girls and if his explanation isn't true - which is hardly unlikely - perhaps he's done more than that. He could easily turn up to be the known friend of people we believe are connected to pizzagate. Politicians need friends to get into and stay in office.

            'Teen' and 'MILF' and 'Young' are user-tagged to porn videos of all kinds based on the actors therein. This isn't really incriminating let alone shocking. He just forgot to close his porn tabs before screenshotting. Definitely guilty of being an idiot. Source: I've watched a fair amount of porn over the years.

            Could someone have set him up?  I don't know much about how that is even done, but it could have happened.  But he shared it right?  So his only explanation is that he did not see it?  I don't know, I guess that does not leave him much wiggle room.
