His handles are Jabbaroos, Cutterfingers, and possibly JimAroo. His instagram <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1481849">was posted to this subverse on 12/12/16</a> because he had a lot of creepy child-related stuff that Jimmy Comet publicly liked. At the time I was just a lurker, and I was hoping other people would notice this guy\'s online trail. I archived everything and made offline backups. Since nobody seems to have followed up, I\'ll post what I found here.</p>
<p>For starters, <a href="https://archive.fo/oRKco">his instagram</a> contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/nrqZJ">A mural with an adult and children holding hands</a>. The smallest child has been corroded away. JoeWills comments &quot;That degree of corrosion only occurs with regular application of urine.&quot; JimmyCommet liked the post.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/zMo1N">Three men wearing various winter face covers</a>. The man in front appears to be Barrows. The man behind him appears to be Podesta.

Jabbaroos tells werkinonmahnightcheese &quot;I didn\'t get his number&quot; which is possibly a joke about how his sexual partners die violently (or perhaps it\'s replying to a deleted comment).</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/qRhbnH.png">Colorful cartoonish drawing of a firefighter without a face</a>. A spiral is drawn on the firefighter\'s helmet. A triangle within a triangle is drawn on a second helmet. Both are pointed out in a comment.

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/MrxNh">A closer shot of his damaged fingers</a>. He claims it\'s due to lime mortar, aka quicklime. <a href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-52211.html">Snopes says</a> hydrated or garden lime isn\'t useful for corpse disposal, but quicklime is. It\'s used to mask odors. It\'s also very caustic.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/lVqmh">The hands of a dark skinned person covered in dirt and white gunk, probably carpentry related</a>. Jabbaroos says &quot;S\'mores.&quot; He seems to have <a href="https://archive.fo/S1C7d">multiple pictures</a> of dark skinned kids.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/Bcqaf">A man with a small happy child</a>. Jabbaroos liked <a href="https://archive.fo/UebQM">an image of the same child\'s pants pulled over a man\'s head and face</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/9BuXM">A motorcycle owned by a member of the &quot;Organized Chaos Ryderz&quot; biker gang</a>. They apparently <a href="https://archive.is/EjdFf">use a lot of masonic symbols</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He also has <a href="https://archive.is/fZvRQ">a flickr account</a> from 2006 with pictures of <a href="https://archive.is/Kxqgj">a slaughtered pig\'s head</a> and himself in drag (<a href="https://archive.is/Xl5sZ">1</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/mZpSl">2</a>, <a href="https://archive.is/MCKhH">3</a>).</p>
<p>His YouTube account has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QEC3S-Ao88">a single upload of a Heavy Breathing concert from 5 years ago</a>. The performer uses a &quot;demonic&quot; voice changer and makes multiple references to child sacrifice and satanism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6500884/">His IMDb</a> says he was in the TV show &quot;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3240366/">Queen Dad</a>.&quot; The description says &quot;A homophobic boy finds the father he\'s never seen and must learn to adapt to a new reality when his plumber dad turns out to be a drag queen.&quot;</p>
<p>If Jabbaroos = JimAroo, <a href="http://www.ecatholic2000.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=18621b3d2233408f66708c02c39a8aeb&amp;topic=310.msg772#msg772">it\'s possible that he was making knowledgeable posts on Catholic forums in 2007</a>.</p>
<p>I don\'t know what to make of this. Maybe he just has a sick sense of humor and happens to be friends with Podesta and Jimmy Comet. But somehow I don\'t think that\'s what\'s going on here.</p>',

             I had a similar idea, but it seems more likely that this type of evil just isn't carried out in as brilliant and careful a manner as fiction might imply. They probably get off on making inside jokes that seem innocuous to normal people. Clearly they didn't anticipate the internet.

            Lots of urban dictionary definitions basically state that watermelon represents semen and the seeds represent kids. I don't know if that helps or not.

            I'm fairly sure that "AreWeSure" is a shill or an idiot. He pulled the same thing about Tony Podesta's decapitated golden boy hanging from his ceiling. AreWeSure said it's just the "arch of hysteria" and nothing to do with Jeffrey Dahlmer posing a victim in the same position. To which I said a figure WITH a head is the "arch of hysteria". One withOUT a head is a tribute to Jeffrey Dahlmer.

             It's not a tribute to Jeffrey Dahmer and is not the same pose as the murdered victim.  Note the arms.  Note the Legs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guess what? Lots of statues are made without heads that have nothing to do with murder or decapitation.  And I'm not referencing something generic when I said Arch of Hysteria. Louise Bourgeois titles her piece The Arch of Hysteria, in capital letters.  It's literally the name of the artwork.  It's a big freaking clue as to her intentions.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, she's made multiple artworks called the Arch of Hysteria. The "arch of hysteria" as a concept goes back to the 1800's and she was familiar with this concept decades before Dahmer. She was in psychoanalysis and identified as an hysteric herself. And was very familiar with Jean-Martin Charcot, the neurologist who first named this pose.    She once while on a break from the art world produced some pyschoanalytic writing herself.

            </p>
            <p>
             One of the later arch of hysteria pieces is a female form with a head and bold colored stripes, but not arms.  Also no relation to Jeffrey Dahmer.

            <p>
             Now try Louise Bourgeois and Charcot and you'll find a lot of art history pieces like this one.

              Let me rephrase what I said then. To any other person Louise Bourgeois's work is simply an arch of hysteria. But to a sadistic Pedophile who enjoys Spirit Cooking and birthday cakes shaped like a baby's semi-erect penis Bourgeois's work takes on a distinctly Dahlmeresque connotation. Is that easier for you to understand? ;-)

            You  made a statement that you'd vote for her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now,  you've decided to explain  your statement  AFTER  making a very leading and baiting comment.
            <br/>
            You're  statement is trolling and baiting.
The fact that you don't realize that's what you've done, makes me consider that my original position stands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next time you might try  explaining your full position about one of the most fucked up families on the planet, BEFORE   expecting me to be psychic, and BEFORE criticizing me for not being psychic, and forego  telling me to grow out of the inability to not know what the fuck your talking about her being elected  BEFORE  you explain yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otherwise, you're just baiting and trolling with misleading comments.

            The only way you'd think that's a good shill is if you're a moron with an I.Q. and E.Q. of  1

            I'm guessing  Chelsea's   foundation will be investigated, along with her perverted  parents CF.
If Cheslea was groomed to accept bad behavior as  okay, and is found to be complicit and cooperative to criminal activity,  then  the only thing she'll be getting is prison in 2020.
           </p>

            Maybe she has a moral compass and backbone  and will come out as a whistleblower.  That's the only way she could ever run for presidency as a hero - otherwise there's better chances of her running  as a cafeteria ho  in orange.

            Usually at flea markets they sell bags of barbie  dolls for a dollar or two most of them are undressed cus what kid doesn't take the clothes off their barbie the second they get it, shit I know I did and I don't even know why, thus the dolls donated to the thrift store are often naked if not new.

              the questioning for the original pic puts it in a much darker context. Truthfully I saw the pic awhile ago didn't think too much of it but you're right it's not quite the normal pic to be having on your instagram for a grown ass man.

            I agree he's like a deus ex machina here. Then again they aren't wearing masks for nothing, the resemblance is striking (baggy eyes, same smile, facial hair, nose and glasses) and the hungary reference along with the coal (schwartz) closes it for me.

            The minions at CTR are not policy wonks, just sort of grunts who archive and create reports of what they see. Very low level staff, maybe even interns.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they also have big snooper companies working for them, who send them daily reports. So they have live eyes and electronic eyes on everything.

            Even with his Soros bags, the middle guy is way too young to be Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Podesta is always clean shaven, his nose has less breadth and his glasses are higher up the bridge.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do believe this guy being Soros jr. is an even more important lead.

            The drawing of the 'fireman' is VERY suspect especially because someone mentioned the 'swirls on the helmets'
           </p>
           <p>
            the fact he used the plural 'swirls' and 'helmets' means he is aware (or believes) that the artist drew the 'triangular spiral' known pedophile symbol, even though that is not clear to me. Looks like it could just be a triangle or a triangle within a triangle. But the commenter specifically said 'swirls on helmets'.

            Pretty sure Pajama Jeff has his own "kill room" pic that was somewhat less circulated and famous than James bare gray walk in cooler looking #killroom the the patch in the floor against the wall same size and shape as that single hole instagram pic with the two dudes staring at it....So, I still totally think gray walk in cooler #killroom is under Bucks, meanwhile I believe Pajama Jeff literally wrote Killroom on a door or section of that shop in PA...Pretty sure we have 2 "killrooms"....Jeff and Coffin/Portland guy are both talented craftsmen no doubt, pretty sure Portland Coffin guy was with Squareform who did the design of Comet and built the "hidden" bathroom doors.

            I'd have to see the pic again, but didnt that coffin coffee table have a cord connected at the base? I'm on my phone and it's too hard for me to find it.  If my memory is rigbt, and there's a chord attached  what's the purpose of a cord in a coffee table. 
Any ideas?

              Yeah..I can't even enjoy any social network, I'm done with Instagram except for lurking certain ones. Knowing they're fairly blatant makes me look around at my own area. There's about 10 within a mile of me that I KNOW of. Then there's ones you don't know yet :(

            I think there's little to nothing (conscience or values) to kill inside.
The troll posting as chelsea_2020  has a set response....saying  it's fake or using childish responses, makes me  think their highschool students.

            My husband used to build 3400 houses a year. He built a lot with stucco.  He said not uncommon for hands to look like that using stucco.  Also, the lime mix is common for stucco.

            My theory on the social media posts... at some point getting away with the most dastardly thing you can do must get boring... like, the rush would stop being so intense... so the next logical step to bring that rush back is to start flaunting it in public to make it dangerous again.

             Well observed. Pretty much what I read yesterday in an article by Michael Maccoby:
             <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/sexual-misconduct-by-men-in-power/2011/06/13/AGmaS4SH_story.html">
              https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/sexual-misconduct-by-men-in-power/2011/06/13/AGmaS4SH_story.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It’s possible they have gotten away with their seductions for years and have come to believe that they are invulnerable, that the rules don’t apply to them. Also, these are people who have chosen a very risky career path. The same personality type may also be attracted to affairs where the sexual thrill is enhanced by the danger of getting caught.
             </p>

            Great first post. I think that there is no stopping a civilian investigation when the lurkers even come out with quality posts like this. You can't hide the truth forever. Kudos to the postet

            It's from 30 rock with Tina fey. They work for NBC in the show which had a scandal with specializing their young boy pages, but it's most likely just a joke. It's a funny scene. Tina's character where's a snuggie and eats cheese at night, singing that to the tune of night moves.

            Let me start off by saying, no I ain't a shill (but that obviously proves nothing). But yeah, sometimes I get the feeling these guys are distractions because they make their activities so obvious. I wouldn't be surprised if others are going underground further, while the Podestas etc. are gonna take the fall. Not dismissing the OP's research, just trying to be as objective as possible. Their psyops were already sophisticated, but the more savvy we get to the system's habits, the more sophisticated their control of the situation has to become.

             They made their activities so obvious because they could. You had 8 years of Obama cramming everything gay down our throats. A world was created where the perverts were considered normal and normal was considered wrong.

              Unfortunately there could be something to that, I won't deny it. Still I'm erring on the side of caution, but definitely support the investigation. I have believed in the abuse for years after watching/reading about the Franklin scandal. I obviously want justice and a cessation of their activities, but I want it permanent, so am cautious of smokescreens, if the podestas are guilty they need to fry, but they ALL need to fry.

                I think we will get through this. Evolution is evolution. Can't think of how long it will take though, do know it may require a lot of blood, but hopefully just that of those who support this system.

                  I respectfully didsagree. If we were fooled by the system and are becoming wise to it, that's evolution my friend. People are altering their diets and lifestyle, the internet has its negatives, but a shit ton of positives. That's just thre examples. The 20'the century's death rattle is a long one, but I see positives.

            I think is pretty to clear to anyone with a brain now that western democracies have a problem with organized and networked pedophilia, and have had this problem for quite a while. Those involved are wealthy or influential. The exposure began with the lawsuits against the Catholic Church, a worldwide organization of immense wealth and influence.They have paid 4 Billion dollars in hush money, so it obviously isn't "fake news". One would have to be incredibly naive, and willfully ignorant to believe that influential pedophiles (they have influence, none has ever been jailed) within the Catholic Church would not use their connections to network and aid pedophiles in government. Compared to the population at large there is a disproportionate number of members of Congress arrested for child molestation, and pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only real question to me is whether or not we are "a government of the people",  and free. We will find out who is in charge after Jan. 20.

            I am the person who originally posted Jabaroo's Instagram.  Thank you for making this great and detailed post.  That guy always seemed extremely suspicious to me, really interesting that's he is Jimmy Comet's contractor.  Really good work, keep it up everyone.

            The Instagram post of the adults and child corroded by urine has the comment "Soon" by plus_ultra which is very suggestive. What will happen soon? Plus_ultra has a Tumblr account called Night:Of:Pan which is related to Thelema and occult, taught by Alistair Crowley.

            even if you are a non-pedo who appreciates lolita as literature doesnt identify with the book enough to take glee over a 1st edition. Come the fuck on.

             A first edition of "Lolita" can set a collector back thousands. The copy in the photo looks similar to this one, which is currently priced at £3,850 (US $4,838.68).

            The swirl on the helmet is not Jabbaroos. It's from an artist called Zach Storm.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was the one or one of the ones digging at his instagram, "_zachstorm
            <em>
             ". In fact, it's still online:

           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the helmet one:

            I can't remember if I found him through Roberta's Pizza or Jabbaroos. I'll dig through my notes. I'd also like to point out that many of these accounts were deleted/made private just a few hours after that thread.

            He might just be a goofball artist, though.

             Zach Storm did an art installation at Transformers DC with an artist named Cheyenne Seeley. The installation was titled "Dark Organics" couldn't find much in the way of what it was about. I found it strange that she was an inspiring artist yet couldn't find out much about her. She did do an artist in residence at the university of Wisconsin. She doesn't seem to have any family associated with her name and I thought her description of her "Butterfinger" at was peculiar.

            That is some weird stuff.  It's almost like he a child handler - he feeds them and gets them toys??

            Good point about the song (it's by Eurythmics), I think anyone who knows that song would immediately connect the phrase "sweet dreams are made of these" with "some of them want to abuse you".

            I wrote this about the Lolita book in another Topic:
           </p>
           <p>
            Now check the review at Amazon by Folantin of the book:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The story is narrated by middle-aged Humbert Humbert. He's a pedophile--although he's tried denying it, tried disguising it, and tried channeling his baser instincts, but as luck would have it, Humbert finds himself as the lodger at the home of a buxom, lonely widow, Charlotte Haze and 12-year-old daughter, Lolita. Humbert doesn't particularly even like Lolita--he actually finds her rather dull, but she becomes a vessel for the fantasies left by Humbert's unfulfilled first love affair."
           </p>
           <p>
            Does he have any kids?

             Good catch on the name change.  He made his IG private around 4 hours after I first posted it here in this sub.  There are people in here who tipped him off and I have stopped making submissions like that one here because we can't tip any more of these fuckers off that we're investigating them until there is a new justice department in 2017.

              You know, I've been wondering the exact same thing. How do you research and keep any kind of cover? I don't think there is a way. Also, when I see a name or company in a submission, I'll often Google to find out more about it. The Voat threads show up right at the top of the search results because they're recent. Everything we do here is public, as I'm sure most already know. Makes it difficult to get a leg up on any of these people.

               You just have to do it privately and then share results after archives have already been made.  That was my mistake when I first shared the Jabarooos instagram account.  I should have archived everything on it first.  I'll always regret having failed to do that, however we managed to archive just about everything before he went private and clearly his instagram is a hot lead and this guy is involved.  Personally my own theory is that Alefantis is part of an underground adoption ring helping gay couples and single people adopt who would otherwise be rejected for adoption by way of a black-market adoption business.  Certain users who post the most frequently all appear to be somewhat normal single parents.  More than likely not everyone connected to Alefantis is a pedophile, some perfectly normal people may have used his services to adopt illegally with no intention of harming or molesting the children.  Others I am convinced used Alefantis to help them to access children for more nefarious reasons.  Best thing to do right now is to continue researching (particularly through social media) all of Alefantis friends, their friends friends, etc and archive every single page, comment, post, everything until we have a new Justice Department in place.  Then we can start moving forward with exposure.  The group objectives need to be 1: Research. 2: Archive for use in future court battles. 3: Exposure.  We are still on steps 1 and 2, it would be foolish to do anything towards exposing the criminals at this time because law enforcement is still fucked.  We have a better shot on 2017, but we're almost there!
              </p>
              <p>
               Keep up the research, archive, then post.

            Lots of this stuff is good, but the "pizza shaped watermelon" is stretching it. That's a normal shape of a watermelon slice after cut.

            How the heck do all these wacko photos get so many likes???  The image of the kid with the pants over his face is just a blob of nothing and got several likes. I have a decent well ok pretty small following on instagram and even my cute as fuck pics of my dog hardly gets as many likes.  Why so many likes on the metal box?  It's a metal box!  It's just so obvious there's an inside joke (child lovers?? Satanism???) to all of this.

             That is a very good point I don't think anyone made before. If I posted a picture of a box, I would not expect to get many likes, I would expect people to think that it was boring at best and creepy at worst. Let's face it, it is a bit creepy.
            </p>

             The likes to me suggest there's a an unmentioned "inside joke".

            Nice work. With time, more and more connections will be made. A couple of those tweets went to Breck Omar Brunson who used to sing for the Apes (same lineup as Heavy Breathing). One of the Apes songs may refer to a murder, possibly at a biker do wah diddy festival, I'll look into that Organized chaos ryderz gang. I'm hoping to randomly come across a name with initials J M C or perhaps Jane C.

             In the photo of the anatomy puzzle is a set of drums. The drummer for heavy breathing has clear drums and these are black but maybe they'll show up somewhere else while you're looking. The kick drum has an emblem of a monster and the word toronado on it, probably the brand name.

            Great work.

            Can you explain the Hungarian coal miner terrorist thing? I couldn't find what that meant in that email (I admittedly didn't trudge through the whole thing, just skimmed and term-searched).

            Isn't "bizarre" porn pedo porn? Just guessing based on ads in some old (adult, duh) porno mags I have (I collect magazines, shut up!). It's always like, "forbidden porn, bizarre porn, can't mention ages." It seems to mean pedo or bestiality.

            Really great cataloging job here, well done.
           </p>
           <p>
            A couple further observations I'm not sure you noticed or not:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             The baby shoes tied to the ceiling: tying shoes together and throwing them over a telephone wire is common signal that some shit goes down here, like drug deals or hookers. It could be that kind of a reference.
            </li>
            <li>
             The fireman with no face also appears to have an arm holding him by the shoulder, forcing him along - an arm with no body.
            </li>
            <li>
             In the completed anatomy picture clearly meant for children, there are a couple of photographs, like actual developed pictures, of a group of black kids, looking about 6-10 yrs old, sitting on stairs outside. I can't make out the photo next to it but it gives me the creeps for some reason.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            A couple observations of items that should be removed, in the interest of maintaining sure focus on what is suspect:
           </p>
           <p>
            -the "metal box with concrete on it" is in fact a job box. His comment is saying"thanks for dumping concrete on my job box, concrete workers." Sarcasm. His fingers being all jacked from lime in mortar add up to one pretty obvious thing: dude is most likely a stonemason or concrete worker. That kind of injury happens when someone doesn't use gloves and works with that material - it's an occupational hazard for those trades.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would remove those posts from your analysis before we start seeing "jimmy comet's friends bury babies in concrete" type headlines on here. Unless you see some additional things to corroborate the idea that he is doing something nefarious with concrete. Fucked up people post totally normal shit right alongside their sick shit, and I think the job box and the fingers are the normal stuff.

             You made a valid point that the job box and concrete MIGHT be nothing. Because those are things I am around on a daily basis, I'm surprised I didn't question it myself. All I could see was a couple more recent really big cases where that was exactly how they disposed of the bodies.

              Well, as you said, he's a carpenter of some sort, and they all use that type of job box on larger jobs, and it's in broad daylight in what appears to be a regular old job site, so I would say it's extremely unlikely that it's anything other than a regular pic of day-to-day activities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Probably he tried to clean that concrete off his job box with his bare hands and it fucked up his skin with chemical burns.

               I followed a situation where the reason the guy wasn't caught for years is that the evidence was all buried in plain sight and no one suspected that. Someone close to me has been in concrete for several decades and talks about instances they are positive they saw evidence buried on the job. Sicko's really get off on committing their acts in plain sight or hearing of others.

            Good work, OP. This is a real life social network of adult homosexual men with a completely inappropriate interest in pictures of children. Random children.

            Going on a wild guess here, and I can't source anything (newbie here, been a lurker for some time), but isn't that blue ski mask awfully similar to the red one used in one of those weird nighttime CPP bands? Like from a video clip, or something? I'm not sure if they're all just generally similar, I have little experience with it.
Other than that I'll leave this one out for police and those with weaker gag reflexes. I'm on the verge of literally puking at this stuff.

             Great pick up on that one! After a little deliberation I would happily wager $100 that I don't have that that was Alefantis.

              Hey thanks, I suppose it might be rigorously nothing, but it's worth keeping an eye out for similar masks. That Alefantis guy just seems connected to pretty much everyone in D.C.... It's scary.

            Dear Lurker-no-more, GREAT JOB on this and PHENOMENAL organization/explanations!
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think Podesta is one of the 3 men in winter headcoverings, although at first glance the guy does look similar.  Just seems too different than Podesta plus, I think this guy has a mustache. Also, very dated glasses. John seems hipper than that.

              I agree. After reading the comments I went back and looked at the photo and I had an instant positive reaction that it is James and I think it looks like Podesta too. The nose.  I mean,   We know that they are friends correct?

             The glasses look like safety goggles to me. Without them, it might be him, but it's the mustache that's throwing me off.

              They certainly look like safety goggles and the mustache might just be a bit of scruff (not a full 'stache).

             I think that the second guy might be Alefantis. Look at the mouth. It's very similar to the mouth of the person in the Majestic Ape mask, who is claimed to be Alefantis.

            JimmyComet has some interesting friends. He knows a chickenlover. One is into making child coffins. Another is into lime. If we find a friend into duct tape that's pretty much a wrap no? ......I'm going to go vomit now.........

              The Bob Seger song  'working on the night moves' seems to be the 'parody' behind nightcheeses name - the lyrics of that song reference a teenage sexual (not love) affair, but there's nothing otherwise telling or sinister in those lyrics. Seemed a dead end to me but maybe others can make other connections

                AreWeSure you're either a shill or an idiot. Which is it? "Working on my night cheese" takes on a whole new meaning for someone referenced as "My favorite pedo" who should consider getting a job with the PennState football team. Sorry. I don't make the rules. ;-)

                 Yes, it's from 30 Rock.   And just checked youtube, I'll be darned she does sing it and the commenters are saying it's a parody of Bob Seger.

                  What am I talking about? Are you serious? I have to explain to you how Pedophiles use coded language to communicate with each other? Do I have to point out how innocuous food items like "cheese pizza" or in this case "night cheese" can have more than one meaning? Really? Are you that dumb? Do you really think one brother honestly thinks the other brother should apply for a coaching job with Penn State football because he's really into coaching football? Oi-vey........

             DarkMath, I am new here and don't know a thing about replying or getting a reply back. Or about researching on here. Can you tell me more about the one who makes child coffins or where to find more?  If it is who I am thinking, that family out in OR, I need more info than I have been able to find yet.

              I think he is in Pennsylvannia in a large space with lots of rental units and some suggested it may be the location for the kill room, hopefully the OP who did the digging will comment or you could try searching for posts regarding kill room.

               From the pictures it looks like the instagram #killroom is the Bucks Fishing and Camping basement...Realtor records show that Comet is a no basement building but Bucks has a basement...If you check out the now well known instgram photo of two guys digging a hole (long hair guy and white gloves/dust mask guy) in a basement with a folded up ping pong table in far background against the wall...Now find the #killroom shot, check out the concrete floor, about halfway back on right wall is a patch that is the same shape as the hole they were digging....By the way, there's also a documentary about pedo's trying to legitimize their sickness called Chickenhawks, in this they refer to men picking up on kids as "Bucks" and talk about how much they love taking kids camping and fishing...So, in short if you're looking for a pedo symbol at Buck's, it the name itself and if you are looking for the famous basement or #killroom my money is on the basement of Bucks.

            Something that stuck out to me was the pic of the dead bird with a band around its leg. Apparently breeders put bands around birds' legs for sale in pet stores. Was this bird bought, and then killed or "sacrificed",  all in the name of (satanic) art? I guess he could have came upon a bird that had gotten loose and died or something, but what are the chances of that?

             Birds like pigeons and crows are tagged with antennae, all over Seattle. I've been afraid to mention it. I've seen them hurt, dying on the ground, but I can't get close enough to grab one.

             Pure speculation here but what are the odds that secret groups, pedo rings, etc. May use pigeons to communicate? I realize that these people are retarded and not that concerned with their OpSec but in this day and age I wouldn't rely on digital as far as secure comms go. I've read somewhere that secure comm in DC is often done through courriers.

            I remember going through his pics and found a neatly dugout / excavated  square  hole  into the side  of a hill.  It wasn't completed, but absolutely square.  I wanted to dig to see if it was an insulated   killroom, as these freaks do like their killrooms, what with their  animal hunting and all.   I also saw a partial pic of a very heavy door, something you'd find, um,  nowhere, ever.

            his youtube channel has of course a young boy as an avatar.   Maybe it's his own childhood pic, but could the police actually do a fucking investigation on these shitheads because anyone who's into heavy breathing/majestic ape concerts should be investigated right out of the chute on grounds that the band puts out  pedo  images.

             How does hunting have anything to do with killroom? The animal is already dead when you bring it back home.

              He made his Instagram private something like 4 hours after I posted it here in Voat.  I'm not sure what tipped him off but I've been very cautious of what I post here ever since because it's pretty clear someone close to the Comet crew lurks here and feeds info back to them.   No other explanation for Jabbaroo making his IG private just hours after I posted it here.

               Well, someone here may have also harassed him via instagram as soon as they followed your link. But, judging by some of the commenters here who still claim to be in denial, it would seem that there is an army of active shills just like everyone has been saying.
