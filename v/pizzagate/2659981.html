            Cheese Pizza was a 4 chan phrase and "cheese pizza" never appears in Podesta's emails.

            Here's actually where CP comes from.  Cheese Pizza was used a way to parody people on 4chan who were calling for people to post CP.

            "Cheese Pizza" meaning child porn contradicts the white supremacist's claim, so you have mutually exclusive situations but somehow you claim both as evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy who got arrested used the Cheese Pizza phrase after pizzagate and thousands of web posts speaking about cheese pizza.

              And you are making shit up about the quote.
             </p>
             <p>
              No shit it's direct quote.  Nobody is claiming the emails were quoting incorrectly.  It's that you made up the meanings of the quotes.  The code list is invented, it never existed before pizzagate.   There is no code used in podesta's emails, even the shit that seems oddly worded makes sense on its own.

               What about the Email from Tony Podesta that says "Still in Torture Chamber." When in your day-to-day life have you referred to something as a torture chamber? I'd be willing to bet never. But its pointless; replying to you is like screaming at a brick wall.

What about the paintings that adorn his home? Paintings of children in abuse situations. He also has a gigantic framed picture of a baby's lower half with a pair of adult hands holding it, and pictures of NAKED TEENAGERS all over his house.

                  I'm assuming you're speaking about Biljana Đurđević's work.  Yeah, those are disturbing, deliberately so. The paintings are about man's inhumanity to man, the horror we humans can create.  The context of those paintings is growing up and watching your country tear itself apart in an downward spiral of nationalism and ethnic tensions, a country whose leaders could have worked together to avoid violence instead chose to stoke these passions until the country broke open in a spasm of violence and inhumanity culminating in multiple genocides.

            Relevant thread regarding a missing code word I found.

            Vino = blood. Remember that vino in normal context means "shitty quality wine". Elites would not be interested in such crappy wine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, wine as a slang for blood does get used in the criminal underworld. ie Claret being code for blood in british criminal underworld.

            Walnut sauce could be code for adrenochrome rather than "person of color".

             I think this is likely, as these elites are high on adrenochrome 24/7. I'm convinced that this is 100% the source of their mental derangement; they are all essentially drug addicts who do this shit to get their sexual kicks and to get high. They have to surround their activities in layer upon layer of mysticism and secrecy, but at the end of the day, these are just the elites doing what they do: getting fucked up on drugs and abusing their power in whichever way their twisted minds desire.

            Were other foods mentioned at all? Everything was going well until you summed it up with a lie and then some strong hyperbole.

             Remember, the criminal underworld uses code words to cover their activies regarding various trafficking operations, such as drugs, sex, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason its believed as such is because the normal context is non sensical. Refer to my thread correlating vino with blood drinking.
