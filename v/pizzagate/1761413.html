            Absolutely agree. So many reasons to take the steps mentioned above. During Occupy we left big banks for small local credit unions, and during the recent no DAPL (oil pipeline) protest, the same thing happened, with big stars like Susan Sarandon pushing the idea. Hopefully by now the more aware among us are no longer supporting big banks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Internet has been so interesting lately that I really quit watching everything on TV and cable for the past few months. I hadn't realized this until the other night when I got really bored and did some actual channel surfing &amp; watched stuff I had recorded. Shows that used to be tolerable seemed quite the opposite, though I know it was me that changed, not the TV. Everything was so over the top, in every scene there wa someone either acting completely crazy, and/or there were people yelling. In normal life I don't hear people yelling or acting crazy like this. Where does Hollywood get this idea? It permeated every single thing I saw on TV. Hollywood isn't trying to imitate our lives, they are trying to make us act like that, to normalize rage and insanity, jealousy, envy, materialism and downright STUPIDITY.
           </p>
           <p>
            One reason it became so clear to me was that I was simultaneously cooking, and trying to be very mindful of the energy I put into the food. Because my mind was peaceful, the craziness coming from the TV became very obvious. It struck me that across the board this same idea was displayed: yelling and being angry is normal. Responsible wives make fun of their husbands, and gossip as a rule. Husbands are stupid, and heterosexuality is not really a thing. These were the messages.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scariest thing is the intentional dumbing down of society, and the normalization of insanity. The commercials were of course, even worse: pushing the idea that smart phones and getting new emoticons was a sufficient goal for millineals. There are also no women over 29, unless they're an insecure mom or all knowing grandma. Children are no longer the cute, freckled, chubby or awkward actors we knew in the 70s, all of them look like a pedophiles fantasy. They act, look and dress like adults now. They're usually depicted as the smart ones in the family, unless it's a boy, then more often they're depicted as stupid.
           </p>
           <p>
            TV is sick and is the reason we are too. Kill it.

             Best thing I've done...firing cable and tv.  You're right tv yells in our face and it's been going on for some time.  Nothing ever worth seeing in hollywood either.  Not a dam thing.  They are totally mind controlling the younger generation through their screens.

              I meant to add that too, movie suck just as bad, if not worse. Do you have any tips on cord cutting? Or is it just cold turkey? I really love Netflix, even though it should be boycotted too (Soros-funded)...

               Geez, I just wrote out a comment and it disappeared.  Too long of a rant, I guess.

               Yes cold turkey.  It was the only way and the best thing I've done for myself.  I fired Netflux (I had no idea it was soros funded, but a good reason to delete them), along with amazon, cellphone, bank at credit union (and pay cash as much as possible) paypal, apple, credit card (yes, I cut the dam thing up), unilever, starbucks, the whole shebang.  If it looks or smells like global, I don't want it.  Still buy gas....sigh and have the internet, but if it continues to be censored, that'll go too and I'll use someone else's wi-fi and I'll start taking the bus or riding my bike, or walking even hitchhiking!
              </p>
              <p>
               I support local business whenever and wherever I can.  Local merchant rents movies still but it pains me to find one worthwhile.  Can't stand hollywood and won't ever give them another penny.  If I have to, I'll find a free movie on youtube, but they are far and few between.  A good one though, Brave New World (no big name actors) is very revealing.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm finding reading and nature much more entertaining than any depraved garbage on tv or netflix.  Growing food, really important.
              </p>
              <p>
               I guess you have to look hard at what you can live without.  My life is much more satisfying, although with an edge now, knowing I'm supporting as few global corporations as possible.  I live near a town of over 10,000 and they have managed to keep out starbucks and the small town where I live has managed to keep out cell towers!

            They're going to end the world before we take back the Earth. Let's push them to make that decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if you guys have realized yet, but Pizza is symbolic of ritual sodomy, and it is the core of the Illuminati/Freemasonry ideology. Uncovering Pizzagate IS uncovering the heart of Illuminati practices. They believe that the third eye (butthole/pineal gland) is opened in ritual sodomy. The symbolism is pretty fucking unmistakable:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjiPOC8yurzsnPXA9DWmxVKRoUtNCMzku">
             https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjiPOC8yurzsnPXA9DWmxVKRoUtNCMzku
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizza = AssPi
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus, the shilling against Pizzagate is going to be extreme. It is of the highest consequences to the brotherhood that runs the world. Pizza itself was likely invented and brought to the United States in 1950's, purely as a symbolic worship of ritual sodomy, as the sheer extent of the symbolism implies.

             They could just take some mushrooms... but nope.. let's rape some kids.  I think it's called the Key of Solomon, this ritual rape you speak of. It may even be a "degree" in some lodges.
