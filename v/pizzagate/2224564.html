           <p>
            So much silliness here.
           </p>
           <p>
            First of General Flynn has a Pedo list?    What's he doing with it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Second   There was no bribe and no conflict of interest, therefore no need to recuse him.   His wife ran for State Senate in VA and was supported by the State Party.  That's the supposed bribe.  Routine, non-illegal stuff.  Furthermore  McCabe told the FBI ethics offices about all this.  So no conflict, no needs for recusal, nothing unethical and absolutely nothing illegal.   That's the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Flynn.  He was not illegally wiretapped.  Agents of a foreign power like the ambassador to Russia are legally valid surveillance targets.  If any illegality occurred it was by General Flynn, who had a phone call with the ambassador on the day that the US government announced new sanctions against Russia Intelligence officials and told 35 Russian diplomats that had 72 hours to leave the country.  Flynn not only spoke with the ambassador on that day, but discussed US policy with him which is a potential crime.  When the call was revealed in January, the incoming administration tried to claim this meeting happened the day before the new sanctions.   After he was appointed NSA, Flynn claimed in February he did not discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador.   This is when we learned that ambassador Kislyak was under routine surveillance.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what was so important that they had to meet that day and for Flynn to lie about it?  Flynn was the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and had to know that Kislyak was under surveillance.  (I"m going to bet they tried to communicate secretly for this call.)  He also most likely knew that any discussion of policy would be a violation of the Logan Act.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also important to note how the Intelligence agencies discovered Flynn's call.  At first Russia announced they would kick out a number of US diplomats
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We will definitely respond to these actions. Reciprocity is a basic tenet of international diplomacy and international relations. Therefore, the Russian Foreign Ministry and colleagues from other agencies have submitted a proposal to the President of Russia to declare “persona non grata” 31 diplomats from the US Embassy in Moscow and four diplomats from the US Consulate General in St Petersburg.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            But a day later Russia changed their tune and Putin announced he would not retaliate and would not expel any US diplomats.  It was this complete about face that sent our intelligence agencies scrambling to find out what happened.  That was when the discovered the Flynn phone call.

            Oh, I bet that Porsche was involved in the bribe.  I think policy was you were not to drive to FBI in flashy cars, but that did not stop McCabe.  I think McCabe broke against policy plenty of times on plenty of issues. God bless Flynn. I can only pray he is still involved as he knows the score on this sick Cabal.

            "McCabe wearing a T-shirt supporting his wife’s campaign during a public event and then posting a photo on social media urging voters to join him in voting for his wife.” The Justice Department IG is investigating whether McCabe properly disclosed payments to his wife’s campaign on his ethics report, as well as possible Hatch Act violations."  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ---  This is an absolute fucking violation of The Hatch Act.

            The Nov 11 date?  That's fucking weird.  JW doesn't make mistakes like that.  I'm wondering if it was supposed to be embargoed.

            My God this is something.  If this doesn't shake shit loose, nothing will.  I'm wondering if POTUS had something to do with this.
