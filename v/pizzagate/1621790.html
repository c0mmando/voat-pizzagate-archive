<p>Here\'s a small piece...
Most notably, the increasing “irregularities” began to occur in another area that Monika noticed, through the course of her work, but did not jump to the forefront of her mind due to the extreme harassment and bullying she was experiencing because of her support of Donald Trump. This had to with child sex trafficking. Publications from her office would display stories of foreign examples of extreme child sex trafficking in places like Africa, but did not inside the United States. However, her office is a stone’s throw away from the alleged “Pizzagate” location. Across the Potomac, where Monika lives is Fairfax County, VA.  This county has the highest incidence of sex trafficking in the country. It is also where former Congressman Frank Wolf was from and he was driven from office for the attention he gave to this elicit endeavor.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found what lead up to everything...

<p>Edit 2: They took her son away!
The state of Virginia claimed “Dylan is a child in distress,” (Dylan has special needs/ Autism.) They claimed he needs a psychiatrist and needs to be possibly medicated, Monika disagreed so they removed him from her care- permanently! <a href="http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/is-loving-your-child-a-crime/">http://www.thelibertybeacon.com/is-loving-your-child-a-crime/</a></p>',

            This guy brings up an excellent point about Obamacare. That there are specific things in Obamacare that slant against parents, setting them up for being charged with neglect and losing their kids.

            Thus guy on twitter said in the middle of night/early morning last night/thus morning, men came and messed with his security cameras and drilled a few small holes in his wall.  He called the cops and gave them their license plates and there was no such plate.  The cops came and then the men returned!  He emailed his friend that he can no longer tweet and his last tweeets were his babe and that he's healthy Avd would never commit suicide.  She lives 2 hrs away, so called cops to check on him after no word from and not being able to reach him in 5 hrs.  This was around 8pm eastern when she called.  I haven't heard anything since then

              He's ok for now.  I'll let him know about the possibility of the holes being to gas him.  I still don't understand why they want to go after him.  Maybe he's lying?  Idk.  I asked for the pictures of the holes.  Hopefully he'll post them

             <p>
              I got a twitter account about 4 days ago to specifically spread awareness about pizzagate.  (I'm still learning how to be an effective tweeter)
             </p>
             <p>
              When I created the account, it automatically asked me to choose people to follow.  I chose Wikileaks, Seaman, FBI, and Trump.  Seaman tweets ALL. DAY. LONG.  and has a lot of traffic and replies, so while retweeting his tweets and commenting on things, a woman reached out to me and 2 other people that were commenting on a video or something and she asked us to read his tweets and linked us to him with the @ thing.  So I went to his twitter page and read it.  She then started private messaging me with more details since I replied to her tweet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today she told me he was fine.  He started tweeting again that he's saw but regrets tweeting to podcast.  He thinks his tweet to podesta is what ticked them off.  I tweeted to podesta and Hillary and Soros and Alefantis before all this, but nothing has happened to me.  Thank God!
             </p>
             <p>
              So I don't know.  It's weird.  He teeeted something about Muslims running some computers for the dnc I think it was.  I think that tweet may have set them off maybe.  It was info i had never heard b4.  Maybe he was onto something?  Maybe he was lying???  I don't know.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today he said his kids are staying at his moms house.  The woman that reached out to me said he told her he'd post the picture of the holes.  If I get the pics, I'll post them here.

              No look at my reply to Freemasonsrus how I got "involved" in this.

             They've already been trying to crash the economy so they can blame Trump. The podcast I posted of the guy telling Monika's story, he said that him and several others think a big false flag is coming because the democrats have tried everything else and that's the only thing they have left. All he'll s breaking loose. Wasn't that scary how her voice disappeared off the recording? Pictures being deleted. Phones of people she talks to stops working. She can't run from the State Department. I'm sure they know everything about her. I'd be scared to death if I was her.

              Trump, being elected, is giving us all a bit of time, but they are closing in....fast.  If he can make it through this year and trust some people around him, it may give us even more time.  If the nasty bitch would have gotten in, it would have been game over, immediately.
Remember, this is bigger than Trump, democrats and republicans.  These are "people" who have been compromised and they don't like having their game interrupted.  This is worldwide and they are using Trump as the mascot.
