            This is sending me red flags.  The Celtic Boy's Club reminds me of Jerry Sandusky's Boy's Club.  This guy was guilty of two abuses and now they say there are probably going to be many more coming.  "At home with his wife Tuesday morning, Gilbert said Torbett is a close family friend of 20 years and is in Modesto visiting them. He said Torbett has been “a father figure to both my brother and me” since their police sergeant father died decades ago."  I am feeling that if he was a father figure, he also may have abused this guy and his brother years ago.  Are they also pedophiles now?  Otherwise why would they allow him to visit?  Could they be running some operation in Modesto or Cal.  connected to the Boy's Club.  Part of a global ring and connected to Sandusky?  I know I am running away with this, but something just sounds fishy to me.

             I don't think the boys club back in Britain is affiliated with the boys' clubs here. But how crazy is it that California has a law that 30 day visitors from foreign countries don't need to declare any sex offender status? That's plenty enough time for a molester tourist to do his thing. Our government just sucks so bad. It's like an invitation.

              It would be interesting to find out who sponsored that bill before it was passed, and who voted for it. That's something we could spread around.

            . Suspicious to me that they first find him hosing off their car in sort of a desperate manner before they realize that they are about to get confronted by the BBC. Fingerprint removal of a victim after a crime?
           </p>
           <p>
            And they finally confront them picking up clothes at the dry cleaners. So the creeps are cleaning their car and having their clothes professionally cleaned. Looks like a red flag to me. I think I'll look into Modesto, CA missing children in the last few days.
           </p>
           <p>
            Found one:

            What do you think? Crazy coincidence going on there.
           </p>
           <p>
            It says now that the found the child safe. Doesn't mean he wasn't abducted I guess.

            It would cause a lot of problems for Britain if one of their molesters came over here and started molesting our kids. I think the government dispatched the BBC to find him and curtail any future embarrassment that would lead to stricter travel guidelines. Or else suddenly the BBC is anti-pedo. Not likely.
