            The fact the mother is disassociated from the outside madness goes to show how it is common in our society for children not to be heard when they see the real monsters. In fact these real monsters are people, people who want to hunt, abuse children, or kill them. Yet no one listens... not even the parents.

            Frankly this is a fucked up twisted song AND video now that I have seen it for what it is.... THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE BANDS PEDO WAYS. Like I've said in many of my comments on Voat, this is all just to normalize this sick twisted shit.

            Every time I see "Jew" sprinkled in the comment section like cops with crack  (a la Dave Chapelle)... I figure someone found something worth discrediting.

            5:58 supposed savior becomes monster and eats kid... totally a disassociation technique
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think this is basically what happens? Some of your pedo pals show up in their best monster costume to terrorize your child until they disassociate?

            On June 3, 2009, MGMT released the official music video for "Kids". It was directed by Ray Tintori, who directed MGMT's previous videos for "Time to Pretend" and "Electric Feel." The video was released to the Oracular Spectacular version.
           </p>
           <p>
            The video follows a toddler menaced by monsters that his inattentive mother (played by Joanna Newsom) cannot see.[16] It begins with a quote ostensibly from Mark Twain, on a background of fire. The quote at the beginning of the video ("Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you..") attributed to Mark Twain is actually a quote from Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.[17] Then, with pictures of kids, crudely designed numbers counting from 5 to 1 appear. After that, we see the toddler in his crib. Suddenly, monsters show their claws at him. He is then picked up by his mom and she walks out of her house, then down the street, while the child sees humans as bloody monsters. His inattentive mother then places him down and he begins to walk down the street, and then begins to cry and run in fear of the monsters. We then see the toddler smile as he comes across the band performing the song in futuristic costumes. The toddler gains an MGMT headband before being retrieved to his mother by a faceless policeman. The mom throws the headband down, thus ending his only chance of happiness in the video. As the mother drives him home, the toddler sees monsters and a creepy sheepdog outside and in a DVD. Suddenly everything becomes animated and the van is revealed to be a scab on a naked woman.
            <strong>
             The toddler tries to run but his body parts disappear and then his head explodes into hot dogs
            </strong>
            . Various surreal things begin to happen in the animated world. The boy appears again and his eyelashes grow large and more strange things happen, including multicolored ghosts and a pig in a ballet outfit.
            <strong>
             The pig is knocked out by
            </strong>
            flying sandwiches,
            <strong>
             pizza
            </strong>
            and ham and the child is chased by a zombie in a hoodie, then climbs onto the hand of a giant Andrew VanWyngarden. The boy happily waves his arms at VanWyngarden, but watches as he explodes and then spins into darkness.
           </p>
           <p>
            The video has been criticized for its treatment of the toddler who appears to be truly frightened throughout the video,[18] although it is stated on the MGMT website, "No children were harmed in the making of this video."[19] Stereogum noted that the video "essentially polarized everyone old enough (but not too old) to know what the internet is." [20] While MTV noted that "They really don’t make videos like this any more … mostly for legal reasons",[21] The band later released a "behind the scenes" video through its official YouTube channel that shows the toddler laughing while interacting with the puppets and actors in monster costumes.[22] **The animated sequence was done by Christy Karacas, director of the Superjail! TV series, as well as Henry Thurlow and Lizzi Akana. **As of November 2015, the music video has received over 50 million views on YouTube.[23] The video was featured on the eighth season premiere of Beavis and Butt-head, "Werewolves of Highland".

             Months ago, I believe it was when Maddison Welch acted as pizzagate "investigator", there was another movie discussed with something about "... at sea".
Does anyone remember or have a link?

             <pre><code>On a whim, Eve, a young Swedish traveler, accepts an invitation from Peter to vacation on his family's private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of the island gives way and Eve finds herself trapped in a state of surreality punctuated by bizarre visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza.
