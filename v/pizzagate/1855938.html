<p>Welcome to Skull and Bones. The Foundation for Art and Preservation of Embassies is made up of dozens of billionaire families and politicians with ties to the global elite who are able to ship artwork around the world without passing through conventional security channels. They have partnered with the Rothschild, and Alefantis, The Podestas and Hillary Clinton are involved. </p>

<p>50 years ago, the museum of Modern Art decided to spread “cultural diplomacy” by establishing a program whereby artworks could be spread around the world through American embassies. This matches similar exchange programs by the UK (GAC) and France (Foundation Pompidou, French-American Foundation). <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2013/02/hillary-clinton-art-embassies">Hillary Clinton wrote an article for Vanity Fair</a> celebrating the 50th anniversary of the program. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6bxyWUV.jpg">Here are some of them posing for a photo.</a></p>

Take a close look at that member list. It’s absolutely baffling how much money they all own.</p>

<p>the M.I.T. Negropontes, <a href="http://rense.com/general95/swartz.html">tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu</a>, are in FAPE (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/QZ6MAUd.jpg">Pictured: Diana Negroponte</a>).Also, the M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu, linked him to a Cambodian location.

<p>My research into the Embassy Art shipments began when the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10114694/US-state-department-accused-of-covering-up-prostitution-investigation.html">Howard Gutman Belgian embassy pedophilia scandal</a> appeared on Voat, and somehow no one in the state department did anything to stop Gutman from doing his job. </p>
<p>An ambassador, believed to be Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman, who &quot;routinely ditched ... his protective security detail,&quot; and inspectors suspect this was in order to &quot;solicit sexual favors from prostitutes,&quot; some of whom were underage. The investigation into Gutman was called off after his meeting with Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy. </p>
<p><strong>Beth Dozoretz</strong></p>
<p>Today, Art in Embassies in run by Beth Dozoretz, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/06/rich200106">a close friend of Hillary Clinton and famous for helping Bill Clinton pardon Marc Rich on his final day in office</a>. To quote Vanity Fair, Dozoretz became drew attention to herself when &quot;she played a key role in persuading her friend Bill Clinton to pardon her fugitive billionaire ex-husband, Marc Rich”. As is the case with most Hillary Clinton confidantes, the more effort they put into covering up international crime and trafficking, the higher they climbed. And even though Hillary’s state department did little to oversee embassies during her tenure as SoS, she still invested a ton of time and effort into promoting Art in Embassies. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770143">Dozoretz has worked with Alefantis before and they are closely linked among the D.C. elite</a>. This shows that Alefantis, at the very least, is closely tied to the center of globalist power in America, and with the podesta brothers &amp; company</p>
<p><strong>Skull &amp; Bones, kings of opium and smuggling</strong></p>
<p>The Art in Embassies program is run by many members/alumni of the Yale circle of elites, including John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Robert Storr (Dean of Yale School of Art) and many other industrialist families behind some of America’s best-known brands. The Sackler\'s, the family behind Purdue Pharma (Valium and Oxycontin), clearly took time away from their role as drug-pushers to promote the arts with the global elite. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/F9wpq7x.jpg">Here they are with their esteemed lapdog Alec Baldwin.</a></p>
<p>This is an important detail I can’t stress enough. They literally controlled the Opium market with a prescription drug, exactly as the United States did in Afghanistan, all the way back to the era of the Opium Wars in China…which Skull and Bones controlled. Remember, these families are primarily located around connecticut.</p>
<p>The Sacklers, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1530742">who have coordinated events with James Alefantis</a>, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2013/02/hillary-clinton-art-embassies">presented medals to Marina Abramovic and Jeff Koons</a>, both of whose work have been transported on these aircraft multiple times, some directly through the Tony and Heather Podesta collection. <a href="http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/exhibitions/terrains-of-the-body-photography-from-the-national-museum-of-women-in-the-arts/">In fact, Podesta “gifted” transported some of Abramovic’s &quot;bloody&quot; work to Whitechapel, London</a>, supported in part by the &quot;UK Friends of the National Museum of Women Artists&quot;. Notice how they conceal their organizations--diplomatic groups functioning <strong>within</strong> art galleries. </p>
<p>The event shows that it’s not simply celebrating art, but actually announcing the sending of the paintings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The event marks the beginning of a landmark collaboration between the Sackler and Art in Embassies. In coming years, <strong>the Sackler will host exhibitions of works by contemporary Asian and Asian American artists before their installation by Arts in Embassies at new U.S. embassies overseas.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s where it gets weirder. <a href="http://www.gettyimages.de/ereignis/jeff-koons-honored-at-french-american-foundation-gala-157184148#american-artist-jeff-koons-attends-the-annual-gala-evening-of-the-picture-id157049776" title="http://i.imgur.com/UmdBz5T.jpg">Jeff Koons was actually socializing with Philippa Rothschild days before the event</a>. Previous parties where they’ve been seen together in France include cameos by The Hearst family, the Lauders and other globalists. [Jeff Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.</p>
<p>In light of the French election, it’s worth knowing that the Rothschilds and the Clintons are two major pieces in a secretive, international group with access to cargo planes. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettyimages.de/ereignis/jeff-koons-honored-at-french-american-foundation-gala-157184148#american-artist-jeff-koons-attends-the-annual-gala-evening-of-the-picture-id157049776">Please Note Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event. </a>.</p>

<p><strong>Masterpiece INTL Shipping - Proof of Security Bypass</strong></p>
<p>One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php">https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.multimodalintl.com/">http://www.multimodalintl.com/</a></p>
<p>The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This includes in-house consultation and coordination of shipments requiring specialized expertise with other US regulatory agencies such as US Fish and Wildlife Service (for shipments that contain <strong>endangered species or animal products</strong>), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (for shipments containing objects whose country of origin is under current embargo with the U.S. or where cultural property restrictions are in place), Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF – for those works that contain such products), among others. <strong>We also operate and maintain a TSA Security Program which includes National TSA Security Coordinators on each coast, and worked closely with the TSA during the preliminary phases of the Certified Cargo Screening Program to facilitate the early approval of museums, galleries and fine art warehouses into the program.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let me get this straight. I can’t even carry a laptop on a fucking flight anymore, but anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings? </p>
<p>This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world. </p>

            Jeff Koons was actually socializing with Philippa Rothschild days before the event
           </a>
           . Previous parties where they’ve been seen together in France include cameos by The Hearst family, the Lauders and other globalists. [Jeff Koons had literally just met the Rothschild Family in Paris, an annual meeting that appears to be coordinated with the Art in Embassies event.
          </p>
          <p>
           In light of the French election, it’s worth knowing that the Rothschilds and the Clintons are two major pieces in a secretive, international group with access to cargo planes.

            Masterpiece INTL Shipping - Proof of Security Bypass
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php">
            https://www.masterpieceintl.com/finearts/history.php
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.multimodalintl.com/">
            http://www.multimodalintl.com/
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            This includes in-house consultation and coordination of shipments requiring specialized expertise with other US regulatory agencies such as US Fish and Wildlife Service (for shipments that contain
            <strong>
             endangered species or animal products
            </strong>
            ), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (for shipments containing objects whose country of origin is under current embargo with the U.S. or where cultural property restrictions are in place), Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF – for those works that contain such products), among others.
            <strong>
             We also operate and maintain a TSA Security Program which includes National TSA Security Coordinators on each coast, and worked closely with the TSA during the preliminary phases of the Certified Cargo Screening Program to facilitate the early approval of museums, galleries and fine art warehouses into the program.
            </strong>
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So let me get this straight. I can’t even carry a laptop on a fucking flight anymore, but anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings?
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world.

            great find. elite have their own cargo shipping.  nice.  art has always been used to launder money.  that's probably why the beauty, or lack thereof, does not matter anymore.  it's just a blob of $ representing some shady transaction.  I'm so sick of injustice.  so sick of it.

            Awesome post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hollywood is known for throwing this stuff in our faces.
           </p>
           <p>
            This reminds me of something I was thinking of. Season 4 of the TV show Ray Donovan, subliminally illustrates a lot of what is going on in PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is even a lot about what the OP is about, especially elites having special shipping acess for human and art smuggling linked to politcians and Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wanted to make a thread about season 4 of the show and describe how in my opinion. the creators/producers of the show were trying to let us know about something or maybe even openly bragging.
           </p>
           <p>
            The show is full of subliminal PG references, and it all aired way before the Alefantis instagram feed was exposed. If you have seen season 4 of Ray Donovan please let me know if you think it relates and if perhaps the creators were throwing in some subliminal signs?
           </p>
           <p>
            That show may be full of clues...kind of like Eyes Wide Shut.

            dope stuff.
Another key layer to this arts and port thing I believe, is that art imagery is used as portals for the worship or traffic of metaphysical beings from other dimension.

            Great post swordfish69. You should try to get this information to Jeff Sessions. I'm sure he's compiling all sorts of evidence for all sorts of surprises that may come do later this year.

            I'm fairly certain the effete pallet and soft living of some of these art patrons may come back to haunt them in the event they are forced to downsize their living quarters.

            You say that the artworks bypass screening, them back that up  with a quote about them working with the TSA on the Certified Cargo
            <em>
             Screening
            </em>
            Program. It's not called the Certified Cargo Non-Screening Program!

            To add to your excellent post, I wrote about that Diplomacy of Art article  a little while ago.  You'll see in the comments section that I've linked Soros in as well:

           </p>
           <p>
            has other locations which are interesting like West Palm Beach and Miami Beach; places famous for all kinds of "cargo" so bypassing security is very convenient for them. Here is the list of offices:

           </p>
           <p>
            The founder of this shipping outfit is David B. Epstein (his genealogy is scrubbed as it that of Jeffrey Epstein so I couldn't see if they might be actually related. Not much about David on the web, but there's this:
            <a href="https://www.corporationwiki.com/New-York/Great-Neck/david-b-epstein-P4269592.aspx">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            (Of course there are other David Epsteins like this guy:
            <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/david%20epstein%20incest/">
             http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/david%20epstein%20incest/
            </a>
            but that's another story. The middle initial is important.)

            When I noticed that Masterpiece International has a business relationship with the largest shipping container firm in the world which is 49% owned by the govt of Israel, then it got interesting. You can see ZIM on this rate increase PDF from Masterpiece Intl:

            ZIM is global, even has a port in Turkey:
            <a href="http://www.zim.com/countrysites/asia/turkey/en-us/pages/aboutzim.aspx">
             http://www.zim.com/countrysites/asia/turkey/en-us/pages/aboutzim.aspx
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Information that ZIM moved radioactive remains of WTC and sold this "steel" to China had been completely scrubbed, but most people have heard of them because they broke their lease to get out of the WTC before 9/11, losing $50K in the process.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Zim-American Israeli Shipping Co. moved their North American headquarters from the 16th floor of the WTC to
            <strong>
             Norfolk, Virginia
            </strong>
            , one week before the 9/11 attacks (VIRGINIAN-PILOT, 9/4/2001).  More than 200 workers had just been moved out; about ten were still in the building making final moving arrangements on 9/11, but escaped unharmed. (JERUSALEM POST, 9/13/2001; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, 10/18/2001) There's a lot on that topic, but here's a link with documentation:
            <a href="http://historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=zim-american_israeli_shipping_co">
             http://historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=zim-american_israeli_shipping_co
            </a>
            .
When ZIM moved out of WTC, an Israeli moving company occupied their floors but escaped unharmed on the big day as well. [How many Muslim owned companies moved out of the WTC complex just before Sept. 11, 2001? 0]
           </p>
           <p>
            A year later, ZIM was busted with US/Israeli weapons heading to Iran:
            <a href="https://100777.com/node/83">
             https://100777.com/node/83
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, crime scene evidence, armaments, what else?
           </p>
           <p>
            The closer to the top of the pyramid, the more interconnected it all is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't forget that all major art transactions are highly suspect and that "modern art" which is a farce, at best, is without value but is great for money laundering. See Miles Mathis excellent paper on this topic here:

              ZIM is so huge, it is unimaginable. the guys who own the controlling interest in that company are definitely involved in human trafficking but so much has been scrubbed, particularly in the past seven months or so. When I look at my saved links most of them are dead now. Guess how rich these guys are (from their now skeletal Wikipedia article, which used to have pictures of them); do you think they qualify as "elites"? :

             <p>
              "This prompted speculation that the Ofer brothers might have been helping the Israeli security services spy on Iran". Three guesses who killed the old man and why:

             Kerry is a crypto Jew and has no doubt been an asset since he was president of the Yale Political Union 1964-65

             The secret societies used to take nude photos of all freshmen to look for "posture" problems.  Those photos when discovered in a tower were ordered burned. Includes HRC, Diane Sawyer, Maryl Streep, HW Bush

            OP is thorough but I will add that the major auction houses like Christie's, whose chairman is British royalty, have custom storage facilities in London and NYC and get crowb exemptions iirc, possibly from inspection I hazard to speculate.

            You have hit the motherload. Explaining how opium has been used to create wars for hundred of years tied directly to Yale the birthplace of Sull &amp; Bones in the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who do not know a lot about drugs opium is heroin. It is processed from the poppy plant and 90% is grown in Afganistan/Pakistan. It is central in overthrowing governments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the next processing step is taking Opium and creating phamecutical pain medication or opioids. This is one of the reasons the US cause of death has been moved to #1 for opioids. But is not legitimate patients who live with chronic pain.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pakistan ISI has infiltrated the US and works with a faction of the CIA where this is funneled into the US through these type of shipping services bypassing customs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once in the US many "pain clinics" will be set up under false pretenses and purposely set up people for addiction to create a vicious cycle.

            If I were a Voat owner or admin I'd be freaking out as Podesta and the child rape ring stop at nothing to shut this down. 
Podesta's pulled the "Russia" narrative straight from Saul Alinksy's Rules for Radicals as pre-emptive strike on pedo investigation.

            I wonder if this has anything to do with the insanely high prices associated with otherwise plain "works of art".  $4 million for a white canvas with a single black stripe or some other such nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that I think about it, I wonder if that's happened at some point. Someone hears a noise from a crate, so the curator opens up a quickly thrown together collection of monochromatic noise exclaiming " Pssh, peasant, don't you even recognize a priceless Merde du Chevalier?"

             Thanks. There's a lot more to this that I didn't cover. There are several Comet Ping Pong/Transformer Gallery duplicates around the world. You can find these networks because they do auctions together.

            Astounding connection and I do believe you've probably hit the motherload. Just an amazing collection of epiphany's from understanding a possible trafficking route and venue (most DEFINITELY for illicit substances) to an angle on Aaron Swartzs' death and more, great work.

             This is 100% Skull and Bones. Not simply that they're mostly Yale/Connecticut globalists--the family links are unmistakable. People need to understand how connected the Comet Ping Pong gang is to this operation.

               The FBI is still part of the DoJ.  I have firsthand experience with this so know it is a FACT.  That is NOT to say that the FBI isn't involved with some DHS operations.

              Exactly. I see you mentioned Sussman, another important connection here. "They're mostly Yale/Connecticut globalists" - my sources tell me that the island retreats of Vinalhaven and North Haven where the Turner Farm and Nebo Lodge are provide exclusive 'services' and mk-ultra training.

His art tastes are as big as his wallet, I wonder how interested he is in the styles of art like those of James Alefantis, Tony and John Podesta?"

              A bit of news today, Aaron Dover, who wrote this piece here on Voat.co has been reported as having died by The Times, UK. Aaron was a student at the same Christchurch primary school in Hampstead, London that Ella Gareeva's children attended and testified about having been complicit in their abuse. Aaron's mother, Jenny Dover, worked at the school as well as the Tavistock Centre in Hampstead apparently.

            I think this an excellent post. I believe there is a lot more than art being shipped back and forth across the pond. It could be kids, drugs, money? Take your pick.

               This was a plot device in the movie True Lies if you recall.  Middle Eastern fake statue had device inside.  The curator was the seducer.  Also, note that both the Iraq invasion and recently ISIS, resulted in relic art trafficking.  Some argue that the destruction of ancient sites was a front for the selling of that art work, much like the destruction of the communities there is a front for child trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               The statue sized traffic could literally be trojan horses, filled with God knows what.

              Awesome, yes, it's good to see such a follow up on Yoichi's work, his expertise and experience in these matters is invaluable and highly underrated. Most criticism of him is elusive and not convincing although he himself is as elusive which lends to his mystery and intrigue.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am slightly disappointed that he did not remain in the arena although he did contribute a lengthy 10 essays. I have looked for venues to contact him and have failed.

            Amazing post! I'm telling you Jeff Koons is the centerpiece to this all. He was the centerfold of this weeks Vogue. We should launch a hashtag #BoycottLVMH since they recently launched a line with Koons, who was accused by his wife of raping his own child. This will get mainstream attention.

             I've been following this story since
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
              r/pizzagate
             </a>
             and knew the name Koons through that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently a friend went to Tasmania and came back talking about the Museum Of New Art and a Jeff Koons piece in particular.
            </p>
            <p>
             The story behind the MONA is that the founder made lots of money on blackjack and then decided he wanted to start the museum out of the goodness of his heart. I find that story to be quite suspicious but don't really know where to start in digging into his story. Just figured I'd put it out there for anyone reading.

            The Transformer Gallery hosts an annual silent auction, but few have picked up on the detail that every auction requires the transportation of art from another country that we can now know is shipped through diplomatic channels and part of the same larger network of diplomatically-exchanged art. Per the Gallery program:
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the 13th Annual Auction and a celebration of Transformer’s 15 year anniversary. The Italian Ambassador is our diplomatic chair this year – highlighting year long collaboration with the Italian Embassy in D.C., and artistic exchange with artists and art spaces in Rome and D.C.

           </p>
           <p>
            There’s more than 175 works up for silent bidding this year – I think we actually have 190 works! We say this every year – but I truly feel this is our best selection of work up for bidding yet.

            Alefantis’ connection to Skull and Bones is rather subtle, but it’s telling that all news media has reported Alefantis’ role as an event organizer for this group. This is two-pronged. First, he coordinates events with the Sackler Freer gallery owned by the Opium family. Secondly, regular Comet performer

            The fact that he and Dozoretz are closely linked in hosting these parties, and that major news networks seem just as involved in the afterparties, there’s no question why the entire Beltway wanted to shut this all down.

            Uribe and the Colombian connection

           <p>
            The Colombian ambassador to the United States worked for a law firm that, around the time that Comet Ping Pong first became a household name, became involved in a case of satanic abuse homicide in Bogota. The murder of Yuliana Samboni by Rafael Uribe would not be so intriguing were the diplomatic chair at Alefantis’ 10th annual Transformer Gallery auction not connected to the same law firm as the assailant.

             The blog ‘Blueberry Perspective summarizes the link very well.
            </a>
            Alefantis has political ties to the same colombian oligarch family where the rich architect son is involved in a satanic ritual abuse case with other people of a rape and murder of a seven year old poor girl, and it's being covered up in the colombian media, and by the colombian police, and colombia is a country that at the same time has the clinton foundation, carlos slim and frank giustra heavily involved in raping the natural resources, fake foundation activities, that all deal with youth and children, and banking regulations, are tied to haiti, robbing oil money killing union leaders and workers rights abuses, running illegal investment slush funds, etc

            The reason that the wealthy run art galleries is that they have a lot of money and want to engage in improving civic culture. That would be all fine and dandy if nearly every major family involved in the Skull and Bones network seems to have a connection to this Shipping lines. James Alefantis, in a sense, works for the Maccoby family because of their links to the Folgers, one of the families involved in FAPE.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Folgers are heavily involved in the so-called Skull and Bones power circle, and they share both the credentials of being an early connecticut settler family and having an ancestor who was ambassador to Belgium. Notice Alefantis’ proximity to the Folger family. From this Voat Post:

             The Folgers, are a secret power elite family since at least the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lee’s mother is Barbara Sue (Bitsy) McElroy.[8] She was the daughter of Harvard’s Neil H. McElroy, former president of the multi-million dollar corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble, and October 9, 1957, appointed President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense. Neil’s grandmother was Mary Camilla Fry of England- baroness, suspected British Knighthood bloodline lineage.[9]
            </p>
            <p>
             Neil’s father is financial advisor Lee Merritt Folger– a child sacrifice (Moloch, also spelled Molech) pagan member of the Bohemian Grove.[10] Lee’s father was investment banker, John Clifford Folger (1893-1981), U.S. Ambassador to Belgium (1957-59)- Alfalfa Club.[11] The Folgers are descendants of Peter Folger. Peter was an early 17th century English settler of Martha’s Vineyard.

            Texas Democrat writes to John Podesta asking to be Ambassador to New Zealand after her and her husband donate to HRC. This fits in line with the pay-to-play allegations surfaced by Guccifer 2.0, when he released the ambassador names and the amounts paid to Obama/HRC to get an ambassadorship.

            Not everyone wants a gilded posting in a European capital. Ellen Susman, a Texas philanthropist who contributed $100,000 to the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Obama, has alerted people involved in the decision-making of her interest in serving as director of the State Department’s Art in Embassies program, responsible for managing the art collection that hangs in American embassies around the world.

What is important to note is that the auction at the Transformer gallery hosted by James Alefantis was always patronized by a guest ambassador, who made a special art donation to the gallery. Is it proof that he’s smuggling children? No. But does it prove that his connections—including to the Rockefeller’s through Luzzatto, to the Rothschilds, to Skull and bones.

                That's not much to go on. You're putting speculation on top of speculation. That's never good. Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation is the right one. JA's grandfather was born in Buffalo New York. End of story.

                      "The Jews(tm)" don't have a monopoly on corruption. There are evil and psychotic demons of every race, creed and religion. The Bush Crime Family are Protestants, ditto for the Clinton Crime Family.

                        It's not only the Mossad. And that's not fair when you ignore other players. If you can't be object you lose credibility, that's just how it works.

                        Everything we're seeing is the result of a unholy alliance of nations that are polar opposites of each other. It's as if each in the alliance was a magnet and are tied together by like poles. You can arrange the magnets like the following and use a bunch of chewing gum and duct tape to overcome the inherent instability but it ain't gonna last too long:

                        The problem is Israel and the Muslim Brotherhood switched places just after Obama took office. Things were great during and just after the honeymoon. They had a baby and they called it ISIS. A short time later the sex went out the window and was replaced by postpartum psychosis that took way to long to go away. When it finally did ISIS was arrested for burning the high school down and

                        I'll check out that video. Regarding the Saudi's being crypto-Jews, that doesn't really mean anything. Both the Saudis and Jews are Semitic peoples. The only difference is one worships the Kaaba the other doesn't.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You're correct that the Saudis and Israel are allies at the moment. But that's only because the Saudi are scared shitless by Iran. The U.S. is too unreliable for the Saudis to put all their faith in. Just look at what Barrack Obama did in his 8 years. He removed the sanctions on Iran so they could buy the latest cutting edge weapons from Russia who quite amazingly are about to surpass the U.S. in the design and development of stealth aircraft.

                        You can't dismiss entire classes of people. Not only is it ethically wrong it's also counter-productive. What if Hitler hadn't stigmatized "The Jews(tm)"? What if he'd only gone after the elite bankers? Easy, all those Jewish physicists would have stayed, Hitler would have gotten the A-Bomb first and Germany's eastern border would today be at the foothills of the Urals.

                          So what if Hitler had Jewish ancestors. He had plenty of other ancestors who weren't Jewish. Stalin also had Jewish ancestors. I don't care. Both men were atheists and did all they could to destroy religion in their countries.

                          Simply because someone has an ancestor that was part of a particular religion doesn't mean he is also part of that religion. My mother is Catholic but I'm not. I also have some Native American blood in there way back. I don't worship mother Earth.

                           Its possible this has nothing to do with religion.  The Jews are a race and the Talmud might only exist to show what they would be doing anyways even if it wasnt written in black and white.

             So your assumption here is that the system set up to ship artworks to embassies is actually used for all of the art shipping in the universe? Why would you assume that?

             Great post. "One initiative involved working more closely with U.S. businesses that owned large art collections in order to facilitate their exhibition overseas. More spectacularly, the State Department established the Art in Embassies program in 1964, which sought to turn U.S. embassies into small art galeries." - Fall-Out Shelters for the Human Spirit: American Art and the Cold War By Michael L. Krenn

             The Art in Embassies program also links back to the Pilgrims Society and Racine, Wisconsin.
