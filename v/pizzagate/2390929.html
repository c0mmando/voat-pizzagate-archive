             Former Merck Scientists Sue Merck Alleging MMR Vaccine Efficacy Fraud
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Stephen A. Krahling and Joan A. Wlochowski, former Merck virologists blew the whistle by filing a qui tam action lawsuit — U.S. v Merck &amp; Co. — in August 2010. The scientists allege that the efficacy tests for the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) were faked. The document was unsealed in June, 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a major federal case alleging fraud in vaccine testing; it encapsulates how medical research can be manipulated to achieve desired results, and why it may be wise to question the integrity and the validity of “science-based medicine.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The suit charges that Merck knew its measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was less effective than the purported 95% level, and it alleges that senior management was aware and also oversaw testing that concealed the actual effectiveness. According to the lawsuit, Merck began a sham testing program in the late 1990’s to hide the declining efficacy of the vaccine. The objective of the fraudulent trials was to “report efficacy of 95% or higher regardless of the vaccine’s true efficacy.”

             <p>
              Making the circuit with
              <strong>
               Podesta
              </strong>
              , you can see how the game operates - and occasionally doesn't - on behalf of technology companies. Case in point: Genentech. The biotech giant was Podesta Associates' first client a decade ago, when Podesta's lobbying style tended toward the splashy, media-directed side of the game. (When the California Poultry Industry Federation asked him to fight legislation that allowed its competitors' frozen chickens to be labeled "fresh," Podesta carried a crate of the icy birds to Congress and set up a bowling tournament with them in the halls.) His work for Genentech began conventionally enough, as he guided the company through hearings on human growth hormone or numbingly dull negotiations about R&amp;D tax credits. But it was Podesta's more out-of-the-box tactics that paid off for Genentech in 1997, after nearly three years of dogged lobbying for a pharmaceutical coalition, when he won sweeping changes in the operations of the Food and Drug Administration. "The opportunity to do this kind of stuff comes along once in a generation," says Walter Moore, Genentech's vice president for government affairs. "And Tony provided the bipartisan glue that made FDA reform happen."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Reform" of the FDA had been on Genentech's agenda from the beginning of the first Clinton administration. The company felt crippled by the agency's arduous drug testing and approval process, its labeling and advertising regulations, and its restrictions on the experimental uses of approved medicines. Podesta knew that Genentech could not get new legislation written through traditional insider negotiating alone, so he launched a brash public-relations campaign that took the fight into the open. "The FDA was well thought of," he says. "We didn't need to bash [then FDA head David] Kessler. We just needed to be more energetic and compelling with our message than the agency was."
             </p>
             <p>
              And biotech's message was loud and clear: deregulate. By the mid-'90s, a rift had opened between older pharmaceutical companies - large, diversified, heavily invested in infrastructure - and the newer, more audacious start-ups churning out not just new drugs but new processes for making drugs. The older companies, fed by a steady stream of profits from existing "classic" drugs and thus able to devote years and years to research, wanted a strong FDA to help them keep tight control of their patent. The younger companies, surviving on venture capital, needed to slash through regulations and get their innovative products to market as quickly as possible.

            He needs to be canned. The few people left in this forum that have stuck it out in spite of him despise him for his censorship and want him gone. He is nothing but a force of destruction. This post is exactly the sort of genius mental associations that used to occur here on a daily basis. Falcon has systematically deleted research like this until there is hardly anybody left here willing to spend the number of hours it takes to produce work like this. The number of weeks it takes to learn these associations, and the dedication it takes, requires an enormous amount of time. Falcon zaps it in an instant.

            I think its intentional and nobody will ever convince me otherwise. No, of course I can't prove it. Its an opinion, but its the one I have. The pizzagate community has had enough of him. The few left speak loudly and hope for his dismissal.

             The Wellcome Trust actually does a lot of work with other organisations that are linked to the biotech industry and Michael Hintze, who is a figure related to the Hampstead case and written about in voat is very tied to the biotech industry, partly through Oxford and also his connections with the Prince's Trust :

               The post was removed primarily due to lack of clarity (Rule 3).  It is a list of claims/links with no attempt to explicitly connect much of it.  Does it not seem like one of spamalek's "baffle with bullshit" posts?  As for the Pepsi thing, yeah it's largely nonsense, but the point is that it has nothing to do with pizzagate.

              </p>
              <p>
               The very article you linked (first one) starts by saying "Bottom line: There are no aborted embryonic or fetal cells in any of PepsiCo’s final products." From looking at both articles, it appears that they never will. Basically, some cells were taken from a fetus way back when. Those cells have been continually cloned by a biotech company for use in testing flavors (i.e. they use the cloned cells to see how they respond to certain flavors). The cells never go into any products.

              <p>
               Perhaps because child sacrifice for gratification is an entirely different thing from, say, using cloned stem cells to save people's lives, including children's lives, and end immense amounts of human suffering. Pizzagate is not about abortion politics. It's strange to see your comment after seeing that you removed a post about a woman who literally killed her children in a Satanic ritual, although I know the relevance of that was questionable, because no apparent connection elites, but it certainly is unusual to real confirmation that that sort of thing happens.

You clearly have no intention of stopping with this exceeding your mandate problem. We do not care what your opinion is of what they do with tissue harvested from sex slaves, and its none of your business how we feel about it.

                Nobody in this forum cares about abortion politics. We care that a fetal tissue market is being served with the fetal tissue of minor children that are trapped in sex trafficking. They trap these children in sex trafficking partly to feed their abortion tissue business in a circular loop.
               </p>
               <p>
                They groom our children to be sex trafficked. They run them through Planned Parenthood and harvest the tissue. Then the tissue is used in their money making schemes. This is not in question and it needs to be discussed.
               </p>
               <p>
                You are the one making it political, not us.

                clearly showed the connection between flavoring companies, god forbid, using the clones of aborted fetal cells in flavorings. It is relevant. This is what the researchers do and OP and vindicator clearly showed you the links. These people kill babies for fun and nothing is obviously too sick and depraved for these people to do. Planned Parenthood provides abortion services to pimps that sell underage kids. They do a lot of things with that fetal tissue. This issue has been resolved an is relevant. You need to step down as mod we are tired of your censorship. You need to go.

                  There are a lot of people that believe the "millieum falcon" that is tied to Comet Ping Pong is our mod because of his behavior. Even though its probably not true a lot of people wish it could be proven true if that is what it takes to get rid of him. Pretty sad state of affairs when the posting community hopes their mod is connected to Alefantis so he can be gotten rid of.

This post is clearly relevant and you are clearly censoring. The post met the rules by a long shot. It is not in the rule set that you understand and agree with all the connections. This is a brilliant post and the best one we have seen in a long time.

He is not a member of staff, does NOT have a regular salary from us, is not on our pension scheme and pays his own tax as a freelance.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The reality is that Tatchell contributed a chapter to a book compiled by members of the sinister Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) – a book with the sole and stated goal of abolishing the age of consent entirely, making children, toddlers and babes in arms fair game for paedophiles of all ages. Even today Tatchell advocates reducing the age of consent, albeit now just to 14.
            </p>
            <p>
             The book, ‘The Betrayal Of Youth’ (BOY for short) was put together by convicted paedophile Warren Middleton (aka John Parratt), former vice-chairperson of PIE and published in 1986, only three years after Peter Tatchell stood as the Labour Party Parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey.
            </p>
            <p>
             In chapter after horrifying chapter members of PIE set out in detail the insane paedophile plan. The first chapter, entitled simply ‘Incest’ equates a child climbing into bed with a parent to be read a story with an 8 year old boy climbing into bed to have his genitals fondled by his mother.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Tatchell’s own chapter 9, entitled ‘Questioning Ages of Minority and Ages of Consent’ he asks ‘What purpose does it [the age of majority] serve other than reinforcing a set of increasingly quaint, minority moral values left over from the Victorian era?’
            </p>
            <p>
             The chapter just after Tatchell’s is entitled ‘Ends and Means: How to Make Paedophilia Acceptable….?’ and opens with an account of sexual activity with two 8 year old boys before describing it as ‘all very normal to a libertarian, even to some open-minded parents’.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite the book’s notoriety, the Labour Party took no action against Tatchell and allowed him to continue as a prominent member. In 1990 Tatchell became a founder member of OutRage! supposedly a ‘gay rights’ group which adopted a sort of half-way house policy on age of consent, reducing it to 14 for all youngsters and further in restricted circumstances – in some examples given by Tatchell, as young as 8 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Labour Party continued to take no action in 1997, when Tatchell published an interview with a boy ‘Lee’, who had been a victim of sexual abuse by adult paedophiles and older children since he was 8 and a half. Tatchell quoted repeated claims by ‘Lee’ that he enjoyed the abuse, ‘I liked it a lot. It was great’ .
            </p>
            <p>
             That same year, shortly after Tony Blair’s victory, Tatchell wrote a letter to the Guardian saying that was aware of several instances of paedophile sex with children of both sexes as young as 9 and claimed it brought the children ‘great joy’. He states,
            </p>
            <p>
             “[…] Several of my friends gay and straight, male and female had sex with adults from the ages of nine to 13. None feel they were abused. All say it was their conscious choice and gave them great joy […]”
