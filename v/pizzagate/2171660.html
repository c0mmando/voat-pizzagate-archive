             In the biography included with the poems it says Poe married his cousin Virginia in 1836, who was 14 at the time. What? Should we suspect that he may have been a pedophile? She later died of 1847 of tuberculosis. Oh, please, not another one of my favorites.

            <p>
             On January 19, 1809, Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Poe’s father and mother, both professional actors, died before the poet was three years old, and John and Frances Allan raised him as a foster child in Richmond, Virginia. John Allan, a prosperous tobacco exporter, sent Poe to the best boarding schools and later to the University of Virginia, where Poe excelled academically. After less than one year of school, however, he was forced to leave the university when Allan refused to pay Poe’s gambling debts.
