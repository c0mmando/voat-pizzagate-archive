<p>Pizzagate is a bi-partisan investigation (remember Hastert?) and we do not need to become embroiled in partisan politics.  Devos can fight her own battles.</p>

            I think this "demonstration" is a jew shill honeypot, to gather info through JewBook on anyone who might be a threat, divert the discourse, make some money, and install another bogus Zio-"savior" similar to Bill "alex jones" Hicks, who will ensure the trail never leads to Zion. See after the march if I'm wrong.

             btw, how is it that the ad for this march is appearing here on this site? Is that space available for advertising? Who paid or placed the ad there, and how did that come about? I don't see other ads here, so why that one from the website with two triangles very similar to the Israeli flag in their logo? Were the people responsible for the ad given some special dispensation to post ads there that no one else gets?

            Blair is pedo central in the UK. Clarence Thomas, driver of the Maddie McCann kidnapping false narrative, was Blair's spin doctor/damage control expert. The John Podesta of British politics. Find a high profile pedo in the UK, a Blair connection will follow. Close friend of the Clintons and Obamas. Need i say more??  A bona fide piece of subhuman shit on all levels. His wife has been linked to child abuse her whole life, always on some sort of 'child protection organisation' board. Simple rule of thumb: if they are a politician or business leader and they are involved in a children's charity, they are a pedo or pedo sponsor.

            No reason to be sorry; it does sound disgusting.  It's very minerally, so it helps to have a familiarity with organ meat so you have a sort of tolerance to the taste.  If you've learned to like organ meat, then you can give it a try and might like it, but it does have a strong iron flavor and it works best with other big, bold flavors.  I actually think it's better than liver, so if you can stomach that then blood would be no problem.

            Yeah.  I don't think I'd ever try fresh blood.  Closest I'd get is maybe a soup thickened with fresh blood, but I've never come across that.

            Be forewarned, any protest efforts will do absolutely nothing except detract from the credability of this investigation.  It goes against the very point of having a public demonstration, which is to shed light on an issue via media attention.  You can gaurantee the only media covering the event will have a field day with headlines that make you all seem crazy, using out of context quotes from protesters etc.  I can't go as far as saying David doesn't have benevolent intentions, but imho if you don't see how this can only detract from the credability of pizzagate, youve been baited.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can see it now
" Far right wing alt right maniacs, bother business owners with demands about debunked pizzaria in DC"
           </p>
           <p>
            Or "20 or so crazy alex Jones supporters and Christian's crusade against pedophiles they claim infect government, and gather in streets."
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way it pays the cause no good, and evangelism in the streets with broshures is not gonna "redpill" anybody, it just gives news media a chance to pay disrupters to attend, or take unflattering pictures of on of the crazy lookin ppl. Loose loose loose

            I want to give everyone attending the Pizza-Gate Demonstration a thumbs up.  I normally speak out against protests, but you have my support and well-wishes as long as you do not in anyway resemble anti-Trump protestors, Black Lives Matter hooligans, or recent Day Without Women protests.  I will be watching and commenting and defending any live webcam sites and podcasts to lend my support.  May cool heads prevail.

            I think the meme needs to be something with the word "pedophile" or "pedophilia"  in it.  We need to keep the focus on that.  There are many people who think pedophilia should be normalized and try every which way to explain it.  Here is just one example of  an article written on about it in a sympathetic manner.

            Thanks for your reply. I suppose it could be. I didn't read very many of their articles or watch their videos in detail, mostly just looked at the headlines. There is SO MUCH to read on those web sites. This ongoing CNN project surprised me. First, because I've been doing hundreds of web searches related to human trafficking, and never hit any of these CNN pages. And, the sheer volume of info, and the fact they've been compiling it for
            <strong>
             six years.
            </strong>
            CNN
            <strong>
             brags:
            </strong>
            <em>
             There are more slaves today
            </em>
            [Jan 2011]
            <em>
             than at any point in human history. And yet, most of the public is unaware of this. CNN is
            </em>
            <strong>
             <em>
              changing that
             </em>
            </strong>
            –
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            <strong>
             <em>
              unleashing its unmatched global reach and resources
             </em>
            </strong>
            <em>
             upon the battle against human slavery.
            </em>
            It's terribly discouraging to read this, knowing that the
            <strong>
             <em>
              battle
             </em>
            </strong>
            isn't even close to being WON. Add to my confusion, the current, outrageously despicable behavior of CNN "news" in general.
           </p>
           <p>
            On this
            <a href="https://twitter.com/CNNFreedom">
             CNN Freedom Project Twitter page
            </a>
            , I noticed CNN has been tweeting about
            <strong>
             March 14 -  # My Freedom Day
            </strong>
            since at least January 26. The original message wasn't focused on human trafficking, and seems user-driven, with
            <strong>
             all kinds of ideas
            </strong>
            about
            <em>

            Hashtags like
            <strong>
             Modern Slavery
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             Stop Human Trafficking
            </strong>
            started up later. I'm finding this all very weird right now.

             Exactly. If they've been doing this since 2011, why has no one heard of it? And have any slaves been freed as a result of this project?

              And that hashtag was probably a George Soros creation.  And since David Seaman is apart of this and is a puppet of George Soros the #allchildrenmatter was another creation of theirs.

            Or we could completely appropriate this hashtag! This has several benefits:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Red pill democrats who are doing research.

            <li>
             Show the power of our movement.
            </li>
            <li>
             Create some actual debate over the fact that Democrats are for once/twice on the demonstrably wrong side of helping those who need help most: abused children and also urban school children (it's not like charters will affect anyone else much---it's mostly about choice for the impoverished inner city kids).
            </li>

             Just curious - how is it that you got this space for advertising? Why don't other people advertise there? Why was a special dispensation given to you to advertise your "march" there, (the one you'r shilling for 'donations' for)?

               Look up what, "css trick to put ad on voat"? Why can't you just answer the question in a straightforward manner? btw, I'm a web designer and very familiar with CSS, so I know CSS is used to post the ad, but that's not what I asked. Why don't you want to answer my question? I already know the answer anyway: The jews running this site gave you space to push your jew shill honeypot "march" and "donation" outlet. Thanks for exposing yourself, jew boy. Say hi to Alex Soros for me at your bathhouse next friday night. I hear that big black guy he pays to fuck him is willing to do you too.

             What an utterly stupid idea. Please stop with the "…matter" bullshit. That's a soros meme, everyone is fatigued with idiotic Soros-funded "protests" like the COMPLETELY INEFFECTUAL "occupy wall street" kindergarten playpen, where the dummies clapped their hands, and sang songs together, and Soros had a good laugh watching it all from 40 stories above.

              think about it this way. If the Norweigian bust of 150 Terabytes of child porn was broken down into half hour 1Gb High Definition videos, that may well be the equivalent of 150 000 child rapes

             <p>
              That's just one country's bust. Holocaust of Innocence it is, and even the most zionist jew would be wise not to play that worn out tired card

            I agree with this. Hijacking a hashtag is actually a great strategy for getting the word pushed outside the echo chamber of the already woke. If Pizzagate can that easily be dismissed, we've got bigger problems -- we're not showcasing what we have found well enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would be publicizing this under many hashtags to get it out as broadly as possible, including: #draintheswamp #bringdownthering #Vault7 #CIAHacking #savethekids #humantrafficking #AbuseofPower #littlelivesmatter #Pedogate #pizzagate #NotFakeNews #stopthedeepstate
           </p>
           <p>
            The big question I have after the Vault7 release is why hasn't child trafficking been eradicated like polio if our government has searchable audio, visual and text data collected on everyone with a smartphone, smart TV, laptop, desktop or other device with an internet connection? They could put them all away and free the kids. So, why haven't they?

             This thread makes me very sad, I can't believe you people think that I'm working for Satan, and even more so with David Seaman! Yes, there are youtubers out there like Pewdie Pie, NasaChannel, Chris Green, that are solely out to pump out disinformation for cash. I'm really dissapointed, you guys think you know me but you dont, I sacrifice my life, time and energy to expose pedophiles and government corruption everyday, engaging with subscribers and supporting those who are sick of this scripted media bullshit. May God forgive you for judging me.

               Well thanks, and this is the kind of conspiritard bullshit that gives independent researchers a bad name, I'm appalled by the idiocracy of this whole thread, even some people that I thought supported my efforts are in here saying some crazy nonsense about me. Really aggravated by this post.

             Of course it was deliberate...the call for action/protest has brought out the snakes/satanists from their holes and they are ready to highjack this movement.  Dont forget these people are also fighting for the survival of their "cult-ure"

              Im not sure if Honeybee is really a shill. She did expose all that brian podesta stuff. Wouldnt that be going a little too far to be a shill? People were blicked from twuittter for mentioning it. Idk if a shill would reveal that.

              Sea Shepherd is a group that goes out and protects whales and other marine animals, and they don't mess around. They don't just talk about it, they've scuttled whaler ships and because they physically put themselves in front of the animals so they can't be killed they've been rammed and had their own vessels sunk.  They fly the skull and crossbones because they are considered to be pirates. I really doubt they have anything to do with any of this.

              Ever noticed how Badguac and Honbee hangout on voatdev and kiss mod ass whenever possible? Don't have any links, just noticed it after lurking for a while after you told me about voatdev and protectvoat. The actors are easy to spot: use keywords like 'anti-semitic' and 'racist,' etc. with HUGE emphasis on Identity Politics -- being a 'face' for the viewers. A person or identity that people can
              <strong>
               <em>

              </strong>
              to and then people let their guard down and believe everything they say.

             <p>
              Here is Honey Bee discussing how YouTubers cull millions of views and subscibers by spreading fear and misinformation, and are simply doing it to make a few bucks:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               A realization that many YouTubers that cull millions of views and subscribers, pump out new videos every single day, and making the masses paranoid with fear and misinformation, are simply doing it to make a few bucks, and by bucks, I mean thousands of dollars a day. www.socialblade.com/youtube/'username'. Although I do believe that some of these topics do warrant research and are relevant to our lives, I do not believe binge watching is healthy and some if these videos only benefit a pocket, not a brain.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              So why is she making videos with a guy who has a new "insider" on his channel very frequently (whose predictions rarely pan out to be truth), and also has crazy click-bait videos such as
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJYZg0h2rrw">

             <p>
              She is probably trying to cash in on the gullible, or worse, she could be trying to prove a point about "fake news" and using the very real pizzagate to do it.

                I'm not saying she is or isn't satanic, just that listening to the Misfits can't really tell you much about somebody. I will say that all the girls I've known that have talked about magic have been batshit crazy, but most of them were good people. One of them just parrotted the crap coming out of her lesbian moms' mouths and I wouldnt be surprised if those two wildebeests were into some satanic shit.

              I don't think all that is indicative of them all being in on it, come on, if none of these people were doing what they do then PG wouldn't even be a thing, so why would 'they' get these people to keep exposing stuff and putting it out to hundreds of thousands/millions of people?
             </p>
             <p>
              You also have to remember that these symbols are also found on loads of things that are not occult-y. Moon and star is a pretty thing to a lot of people, other people think a skull motif is just edgy, or they like a band so got the band's t-shirt. Sure the band might be evil and using the skull that way, but you can't say that everyone who buys the t-shirt is cognizant of that meaning and wearing it to 'show allegiance' to the Illuminati!
David Seaman's picture - that is not necessarily showing allegiance to the eye, is it? He reports truth he says, and about money and PG and politicial corruption - the eye above the pyramid is on the dollar bill and is also well known as being linked to the clandestine powers that be and all the dodgy shit they get up to - so having this symbol indicates he's going to report on the weird messed up stuff about the financial system and the shady cult that runs the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              Generally, I think you're forgetting that a huge number of the people invovled in genuinely investigating this are just normal people who have been embedded in a culture that includes these symbols and motifs and that they don't really know what they mean and just think they look cool or whatever. Like the satanic bolts thing, I had no idea that kind of picture represented anyhting Satanic, or that an O crossed out was satanic, I thought when placed over something (like in Honeybee's video where it is placed over Wshington's face) it means 'say no to this thing' or 'don't do whatever this picture represents (e.g. smoking)'
             </p>
             <p>
              The Titus Frost thing is weird, I don't see how you can work in that industry with those companies and genuinely be into stopping PG and Illuminati/government corruption stuff. It means he is insincere at the very least, unless he is using his company to somehow get insider info or bring them down from the inside.
             </p>
             <p>
              All in all, I think you are too paranoid and should give people the benefit of the doubt a bit more unless they do something that is clearly wrong and disabling to PG investigation. The attacks on David Seaman in particular are ridiculous, so what if he was a bit of a douchebag years ago? When you're investigating the stuff we're investigating, that shouldn't even be a blip on the radar and people who bring it up are therefore under suspicion themselves in my view.

               Their weapons are fear, obfuscation, signs and symbols.  They wouldn't constantly use these symbols if they didnt think they worked on the human psyche.  People have just been blinded to them all their lives.  Our weapons are information and exposing the truth and I have just provided information so people are free to accept it or reject it but most of all I would people research understand all these symbols for themselves and how they are used against humanity and also to not blindly trust anyone putting their face out there seemingly exposing pizzagate.

               David Seaman is the huge weak link in the chain here and now he has met with Neil Wolfe to discuss what?...David Seaman has the funding to fly round trip to Washington DC twice in one month and felt it necessary to meet with the one "leading" the march?  What is he planning?...
              </p>
              <p>
               David Seaman has connections to George Soros and George Soros gets his funding from the Rothschilds bankers and David was recently flown to the Superbowl for free.  We all know how George Soros funds the Black Lives Matter protests and causes chaos at other events with paid provocateurs...

                Soros seems to be funding every march and protest. I actually would not be surprised at all if Soros were behind this in some type of chess move whose purpose  isn't clear yet.

                 Look at the evidence: "allchildrenmatter" - gee where did they get that idea. This is SO TOTALLY a jew honeypot. Not sure if it's soros or not, but probably is.

                  Yeah, I have 'em all.  :)  They're into horror, and gothic shit.  Most of it is camp, and tongue-in-cheek, and the rest is to scare idiots like you.  Looks like it's working.

              um. would be interested in further explanation of honeybee? similar to seaman i've only seen a couple of their vids but can't see how wearing a music t shirt and winking is verification of satanic ties. If anything it's indicative of symbolical influence culture

                referring to the idea that people can express symbols without necessarily being conscious proponents of them. Because of how powerful these people are, their symbols have a decent chunk of the collective share. So someone could be wearing a t-shirt with satanic symbols without being a part of the groups that spawned the symbols because they've taken a hold of the collective unconscious.

               I had no idea the shirt was the Misfits...but when researching the artist who drew this pizza themed image that Comet Ping Pong featured on their instagram;

              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
               I was led to the artist deladeso who does pizza themed shit and The Misfits skull/pizza was his primary symbol;

               Also when she is burning the dollar bill with Pedogate on it like casting some kind of spell and the letter "O" has a slash through it "Ø" which is occult lettering.

              Are you serious? That's definitely not what I meant. I mean getting us (which includes all of the people you've listed) to use a hashtag while they have some kind of plan to steer it toward something else; to try to use some of our social media moves against us.
