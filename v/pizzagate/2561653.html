<blockquote>
<p>Human Rights Watch/Americas delivered diskettes to the ministry in June and, despite repeated follow-up visits and calls, had not received a copy of the document as this report went to press. <strong>Asked whether the U.S. Embassy would consider financing such an endeavor, given its earlier failure to support the truth commission, Amb. William Lacy Swing told Human Rights Watch/Americas that the U.S. government had more urgent priorities.</strong> </p>
<p>The MOU\'s second set of conditions, which require the presumptive excising of the names and identifying information of all U.S. citizens, is far more objectionable, yet it is the condition on which the U.S. government has been most insistent. U.S. Ambassador William Swing and Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck argued that this measure was necessary to protect U.S. citizens\' privacy rights. </p>
<p><strong>Emmanuel Constant, the founder and leader of FRAPH (the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti), has stated repeatedly that he received payments from the CIA from 1992 until 1994 (of U.S.$500/month) and that he collaborated with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) during that time. Constant identified DIA attaché Col. Patrick Collins as his handler.</strong> </p>
<p>Constant now has a warrant pending for his arrest in Port-au-Prince on charges of murder and torture based on November 1994 complaints by an organization known as Anti-FRAPH. FRAPH\'s brutal activities under the military government included political rapes and other torture, executions, and mutilations, and the notorious arsonattack on Cité Soleil that killed at least fifty residents. </p>
<p><strong>....several months after Constant was detained and found deportable by the U.S. immigration authorities, the Clinton administration decided to release him into the United States on June 14, 1996, rather than return him to Haiti.</strong>  </p>
<p>An April 12, 1994 cable from the U.S. Embassy to Secretary of State Christopher acknowledged increasing human rights violations but expressed skepticism about victims\' reports of abuse: &quot;The Haitian left manipulates and fabricates human rights abuses as a propaganda too...&quot; Regarding political rapes, the cable stated: &quot;We are, frankly, suspicious of the sudden, high number of reported rapes, particularly in this culture, occurring at the same time that Aristide activists seek to draw a comparison between Haiti and Bosnia.&quot; <strong>The cable was written by U.S. human rights officer Ellen Cosgrove, approved by Amb. Swing</strong>, reviewed by in-country processing Refugee Coordinator Luis Moreno, and leaked to the press in May 1995. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government must examine its own involvement in human rights abuses in Haiti. <strong>The Clinton administration should launch a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations that agents or units funded by the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) were involved in serious human rights violations.</strong> The findings of such an investigation should be made public and disciplinary or criminal action taken where appropriate. U.S. government documents regarding human rights violations committed by the <strong>SIN (the National Intelligence Service [or [Service d\'Intelligence National]</strong>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_d">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_d</a>%27Intelligence_National)) and FRAPH should be declassified to allow informed public debate about U.S. policy towards Haiti. </p>

Ms. Bolkovac discusses her story of human trafficking, and other topics with Tanya Domi, whose reporting broke this story. Kathryn Bolkovac's post was with the International Police Task Force which was arranged by DynCorp Aerospace. She was assigned to run the IPTF office that investigates sex trafficking, domestic abuse and sexual assault to support the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. 
Thanks to the evidence she collected, she won a lawsuit against DynCorp, publicly exposing their human rights violations.

             Inner City Press earlier in the month first reported and asked about two ten new cases, by a Burundi soldier in the Central African Republic, and a Gambian police figure in Liberia, before that UN Mission closed. The CAR mission MINUSCA is very much ongoing, making the alleged sexual exploitation by the force sent by "Eternal Supreme Guide" Pierre Nkurunziza all the more problematic. Since South Africa has been allowed to get away with not even suspending its accused soldiers - the UN even tried to cover this over with a colloquy, see below

             Amid the UN's decade long claim of “zero tolerance” for sexual abuse and exploitation, on March 13 a press conference was announced with decade long, now part-time, UN official Jane Holl Lute. Inner City Press asked her why the UN Peacekeeping mission UNMISS has denied South Sudan's request for a role in investigating alleged sexual abuse of South Sudanese IDPs in Wau by UN Police from Ghana.
