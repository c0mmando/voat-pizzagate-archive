   I like to think this sub doesn't have a partisan bias. I'll document how long it takes this post to be censored. Our sitting president has over a dozen rape allegations against him.

            If he were compromised, either 1. he would be playing by their rules or 2. already have been blackmailed into stepping down. I didn't start out a Trump supporter, but I sure am now. There's no chance in hell he's one of "them".

            I've known quite a few individuals who have turned out to be pretty bad guys. I do find it strange but i dont know of any firther details aboit their relationship. Did Trump fly around on the Lolita express?
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the exwife thing, she says he didn't rape her in a literal or criminal sense, sooo i don t know what she means. I think (in girl language, at least) she is trying to say they had a fight or something or she felt something new that was unpleasant? I don't know.

            Trump probably did some of that, and I don't know how bad or illegal any of it is but he does have some kind history going on with women.
           </p>
           <p>
            More importantly though, I dislike how many here worship him like he's going to secretly pull off a bunch of moves attacking child sex trafficking and that he's "on our side". He's most likely an amoral, independent businessman looking to enhance his own power, control, and relationships with other influential people.
           </p>
           <p>
            But nah, he has to be a GOD EMPEROR playing 10D underwater backhanded invisible chess and this is all part of some big master plan to save the kids! And any one who disagrees with us is a Media matters shareblue shill and a dirty liberal! Two party politics has people fucking brainwashed to the fact that for most personal interests come first.
           </p>
           <p>
            If taking down larger child sex trafficking rings en masse directly or indirectly affects any of his business interests or relationships with his partners he won't do it. I think it's an integral part of some higher perverted society of elites that we can't see or touch.

            During their divorce in 1991, Donald Trump's ex-wife Ivana accused him of "raping" her three years previously. But she has since clarified it was not in "a literal or criminal sense".

             Damn skippy. If you've been over here a year or more and are linking to Snopes, then you're behind on the DNC's ties to various media, Snopes included.

             Epstein is most likely a Mossad asset, probably in place to garner blackmail on people of importance: politicians, celebrities, socialites. Trump, back in the day, hit two out of those three. No doubt a coup of sorts if successfully blackmailed-- and given that Epstein's island/mansiion were rigged out with cameras and audio, it seems very likely that is what the case was. Question remains of whether Trump was successfully targeted. I'm thinking not so much; if so, they would have pulled out the big guns before election. Best they had was that hot mic comment (disgusting as it was)... so if they had an actual rape vid/audio, they would have unleashed that, laughing all the while. The fact they haven't done so speaks volumes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Want to know what gets me? People who think if Trump was impeached, Clinton would get the White House. How fucking dumb are they? Gee, replace Pussy Groper with someone who openly invites human traffickers to their kid's (charity-paid-for) wedding, someone documented on the Lolita Express a shitton more than Trump, someone who speaks of her feminism, but takes $$$$ from countries that kill gays and treat women like imbeciles. If that's the brand of feminism the establishment libs adhere to, no fucking wonder they're drowning in their own blood.
