<p>&quot;‘The Tale’ depicts a grown woman (Laura Dern) working through the realization that she was sexually abused at age 13, graphically depicting those horrifying sexual-assault scenes.</p>
<p>In many respects, The Tale has been in the making for the last 35 years. But its <strong>Sundance Film Festival premiere Saturday afternoon—the first of this year’s festival to receive a standing ovation that we witnessed—is so timely it could very well have been called: #MeToo, The Movie.</strong></p>
<p>The Tale is a memoir film in which writer-director Jennifer Fox confronts the sexual abuse she suffered when she was a 13-year-old girl, having spent the next three-and-a-half decades of her life convincing herself that she was engaged in a “special” relationship with a 40-year-old man, facilitated by a woman she trusted.</p>
<p>Both were people in her life she loved: “Mrs. G”  (names were changed from Fox’s own life) was her equestrian trainer, and “Bill” was her running coach. Thirteen-year-old Jennifer is intoxicated by the regal, beautiful Mrs. G, and trusts Bill because of it. When Bill starts to coax Jennifer into a sexual relationship, she convinces herself that they’re in love. But she was just a girl. It was child rape.</p>
<p><strong>Immediately following the post-screening Q&amp;A, in which stars Ellen Burstyn and Jason Ritter broke down in tears talking about the movie, it became clear that this is the film everyone at Sundance will be talking about.</strong></p>
<p>Its resonance—a woman realizing that what she had thought was a consensual sexual relationship was actually child rape—is one thing. That it shows, with purposeful unflinching detail, Jennifer’s rape at age 13 is another. (We witnessed multiple people walk out after this.) But that it doesn’t direct you how to feel about it, or moralize, or redeem, or reassure is its greatest power.</p>
<p><strong>The Tale is relentlessly uncomfortable, and sometimes even aggravating.</strong> It wades into the murky waters of a complicated debate currently consuming culture, but doesn’t seek to satisfy or conclude it—which can be infuriating but is also necessary. It lacerates right through that conversation, letting the full range of opinions spill out. Yet it doesn’t seek to stitch it back up again and heal. Because that’s not it’s job.</p>
<p>Eventually she pieces together an explicit, clear-eyed recollection of the relationship with Bill, and we watch it play out on screen. It’s sickening.</p>
<p>But The Tale isn’t a linear narrative about a child who was raped. It’s an adult woman’s journey to the horrifying realization that her innocence was preyed on; that she was abused in a way that impacted the rest of her life. It’s her struggle through frustrating notes of denial, rationalization, misremembrance, and anger as she tries to piece together what really happened to her—not what her memory of it was—and why. How she feels about it now is almost an afterthought, until, at a major climax, it isn’t.</p>
<p>Throughout the film, Fox plays with form, storytelling structure, and the truth in jarring ways here—at one point Laura Dern, who plays Jennifer as an adult, is actually in conversation with Isabelle Nelisse, who plays her at age 13—to illustrate the myriad ways in which a person needs to communicate, with others and themselves, past and present, to reckon fully with an event like this.</p>
<p>When we meet Dern’s Jennifer, her mother (Burstyn) is leaving her a litany of emotionally charged voicemails, having just discovered an essay Jennifer wrote when she was 13 titled “The Tale,” which discussed the loving relationship she had with two adults: Bill (Jason Ritter) and Mrs. G (Elizabeth Debicki.) Her mother is beside herself. Suspicions she had 35 years before were true: these adults had taken advantage of her daughter.</p>
<p>“This is why I didn’t tell you,” Jennifer says, dismissing her mother’s concerns. “Can’t I just sit with my own memories?” she pleads, preferring to remember the relationship fondly instead relitigate it as assault. <strong>Nearly every line of dialogue hits you like a cannonball, its relevance to the stories and confessions that have been chronicled in the #MeToo movement these last months uncanny.</strong> “No,” her mother says. “I want you to nail them.”</p>
<p>She starts to visit people she hadn’t seen in decades, attempting to get a more detailed picture of that time that the years have blurred—part of her desperate search for a reason this happened to her. Or even to answer if anything happened to her.</p>
<p>“You were raped,” she’s told multiple times. “It’s complicated,” she instinctively retorts. She rages at the word “victim,” an indictment of the inherent lack of sensitivity in imposing a victim narrative on anyone who comes forward with a traumatizing story.</p>
<p><strong>Eventually she pieces together an explicit, clear-eyed recollection of the relationship with Bill, and we watch it play out on screen. It’s sickening.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill baits her with lines like, “You’re not afraid of life, right, Jenny? You’re not afraid of living?” He and Mrs. G flatter her by telling her that she’s special, that they think of her as an equal, that they think they can trust her with secrets. Then we start to see the rape happen.</strong></p>
<p>Would the film be as powerful if the acts were implied, instead of shown to wincing eyes on screen? Perhaps. But arguably, too, the impact is in bearing witness to the things Bill says and does and their brutal reality.</p>
<p><strong>It starts with Bill getting Jenny to cuddle with him under a blanket. He says she deserves better than silly young boys; that he wants to “save” her from them. He phrases things in a way to make her think it’s her idea, like to take her top off, giving her the false comfort of an agency she doesn’t have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We see them make out and it is grotesque. We see him, over multiple scenes that take place over a series of weeks, attempt to penetrate her. “We have to keep stretching you open, slowly,” he says. And then again: “No young boy would do this for you.” We see her give him a blowjob when it doesn’t “fit.” Eventually it happens, the camera switching between her face and his as it does.</strong></p>
<p>The film ends with a disclaimer that the sex scenes were shot using an adult body double. Nelisse, who was 11 at the time of filming, only shot the dialogue parts of the scene, which are graphic in their own right. Fox would coach her on how to react properly to the pain of losing one’s virginity: ”Act like you’ve been stung by a bee.”</p>
<p>It would be impossible to list the myriad tenets of the conversation surrounding abuse and victimhood that the film explores. Should there be guilt or shame? Is she emotionally scarred? We wouldn’t purport to answer any of those questions, and maybe the film doesn’t intend to either. And that’s the prickly part of it, the thing that will keep us and anyone who sees it itching long after it ends.</p>
<p>While watching it, you’re not exactly sure what Jennifer wants the outcome of this whole journey to be, and you’re especially not sure what you want it to be either.  What are you rooting for, if anything at all? It all builds up to a confrontation between Jennifer and Bill. Is it satisfying? Could it possibly be?</p>
<p><strong>Casting Jason Ritter as Bill was a crucial decision. His image, based on the characters he’s played in Parenthood, Girls, Kevin (Probably) Saves the World, is that of the consummate nice guy—the adorable, safe, all-around “good” guy. “The whole idea was to take out of the closet the idea that perpetrators aren’t monsters that we can pick out,” Fox said after the film. Mission accomplished.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There was an air of speechlessness as the standing ovation died down. How does someone talk about this film? What do we even say? It’s something that Burstyn herself acknowledged, before beginning the dialogue in an impassioned, immediate way: “The exploitation of innocence is a deep, criminal crime, and it’s time now, right now, in this moment in our history, to change it.”</strong></p>
<p>But she wasn’t done. <strong>“And I want to thank Donald Trump for that disgusting tape that he made that we all heard that was the final straw that broke the camel’s back,” she said to rousing applause. “And we can now at last deal with this problem that has gone on for centuries all over the world. This film is giving voice to it.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Good grief.  Burstyn had to go and ruin it with a non sequitur about Trump.  As if the tape that &quot;he made&quot; had anything at all to do with child rape.</p>',

             I've been away so apologize for being very late in answering your question.  It's the recording of Trump making crude comments about grabbing women in the private parts:

            Thank you poster, for bringing this here. I have some simple questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did the offenders receive any kind of justice in this story?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there a hope or expectation of justice, if not?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does this movie encourage victims to oppose predators and come forward to prevent the abuse of others?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does this film encourage society to support victims and oppose this criminal behavior?
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I have read here, one good thing has occurred. Hollywood has endorsed a film that reveals the sickness. It may be that this movie is designed to push an agenda of normalization. Good. The more that these fools try to push that crap, the more that they admit their sickness is real. Their normalization will not succeed. They cannot simultaneously cover it up and ask us to accept it. If the answer to some of my previous questions is “yes”, then this may be an important movie, but  based on what is written here, that is unclear.

              I will keep my eyes open for a chance to watch it. If you get to see it, let us know how it goes... a sequel to your post. Hopefully enough of us caught your post and keep it in mind before this video fades into obscurity, which will likely happen.

            “And I want to thank Donald Trump for that disgusting tape that he made that we all heard that was the final straw that broke the camel’s back,” she said to rousing applause. “And we can now at last deal with this problem that has gone on for centuries all over the world. This film is giving voice to it.”... Give me a break. He was talking with a friend about how he seduces women. How is that connected? This sounds like an agenda movie, as all movies push the agenda now. I heard Star Wars was even social justice warrior riddled. I doubt this movie connected any dots to the controllers.

             True, and they also haven't yet filmed a trafficked child's blood and organs being harvested, but I believe this movie takes a step in the right direction.

            Nathan Forrest Winters who was raped on the set of Clownhouse wanted to do a documentary several years back describing the abuse that occurred in the past from director Victor Salva. However he insisted that every individual on the set be o er the age of 18. This movie you are describing no matter how powerful, no matter how impressive, no matter how many teary eyed actors or standing ovations looses as soon as it casts a 11 yr old to relays it's message. Do not care if they use body doubles, do not care if she was given great direction, do not care if the movie seems more edgy or relevant. Make no mistake the movie industry is into making money and as much as the director may want this as a artistic move the financiers of this project want a solid return on investment. They understand that this movie will draw a greater audience with controversy as well as sick as it sounds get people who enjoy the exploitation of children as a audience. The child pornography business is a billion dollar entity and to many of these financial backers money is money. There are many ways that this movie could of created an impact without graphically depicting child rape, most movie critics would agree that it is the easy road to directly shock viewers with graphic details it is much more difficult to take the time and create a strong script to convey the same message. When Brooke Shields was exploited in another critically acclaimed film The Baby shortly after she appeared in the pages of Playboy fully nude. Again the correlation does not vanish. It is now 2018 and directors are still using children as props for their artistic endeavors. The welfare of the child comes first don't care what some Sundance hopeful thinks will be artistically impact full,. How about telling that same story and at the end putting a disclaimer 
out of respect for the topic of Child Exploitation and Rape we decided to have no cast members or people under the age of 18 on this set ever. That is a movie showing courage and understanding the real problem of child exploitation.  So my advice is ban this movie and if it is in book format read the book.

             Even years ago, I would cringe when I heard kids cussing in movies. Now, in the post pizza era, I won’t tolerate kids doing/saying adult things in a show. I mirror your sentiments exactly. Damn them for using a minor in this film. Entertainment and drama should never be put ahead of a child’s well being. The parents failed that kid.

            Aldous Huxley's quote about slaves not having to be coerced because they love their servitude us what comes to mind. If you corrupt and sexualize a whole generation of kids, they'll grow up talking about 'agency' and 'choice' never realizing they are still beholden to their masters and are still slaves. It's something that's often said about liberal feminists too. Great post.

            I'd guess Donald Trump orchestrated the recording and leaking of "the" tape, foreseeing that it would cause a dynamic turmoil. He would be sure there would exist no dirt on himself; and he knew of plenty of dirt in the swamp of DC and Hollywood. So he expected correctly the upheaval would effectively turn at some point against the bad actors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Ellyn Burstyn's grateful words could be interpreted that way:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “And I want to thank Donald Trump for that disgusting tape that he made that we all heard that was the final straw that broke the camel’s back”
            </p>

            Thank you for letting us know about this movie ...
There's a lot of course that's not said ...
            <br/>
            like the suggestion that this went on for 35 years.
I'd like to know her view on that -- and his.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does the movie every address anything that is know about what he is
thinking during this time?
Whether he's a pedophile which seems to be the case?
And what Mrs. G has to do with all of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            It took me back to my early years and what I was thinking and feeling about human sexuality.
Males I knew.  One I'd had a crush on since I was 5 or 6 years old.  But that was a crush - 
not anything like what happens in this movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always had an awareness, however, of the threat of being raped -- sexually abused.
My Mother had related a story to me of an older man trying to fondle her when she 
was young.  A neighbor.  Later, when I was 6 or so, playing on the NY streets one 
even just before we were all being called in for dinner, a male approached me and 
asked if I'd read him the address on a mail box.  It was a small open lobby so I wasn't
concerned as we were basically still visible from the street.  But then when I couldn't
read it, he picked me up and I didn't like where his hand landed.  I wiggled out and on 
home.  A little difference in timing, a little difference in dusk being darkness.  Fewer
children on the street still who would have heard me call ... and who knows what might
have happened.  There are other stories I've long been thinking about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the review is very optimistic on the way the story was presented, I'll take that
as fact and will try to see it.  Also I'm a fan of Ellyn Burstyn and her acting/movies.

             It's not odd that the *relationship went on into her teen years. That's the mindfuck that is grooming and child abuse...you think you're complicit. That's why you feel shame. Some part of you tells you it's fucked but he's bound you to him and you think it's love.

              A PEDOPHILE is interested in children of specific ages -- 
Pedophilia is all about the AGE of the child ...
             </p>
             <p>
              There are different names for those who are interested in a 4 year old -- and different
names for those interested in a 8-9 year old ... and other names for pedophiles interested
in teenagers who are still minors....
             </p>
             <p>
              And THIS relationship went on for thirty five years ... !!!
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm saying is that this case is quite different from what we're discussing here .. child trafficking and MKULTRA ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Torture of children, as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              I agree that this kind of rape and sexual abuse does exist -- but it doesn't have a lot in common with the stories
the public is more familiar with -- and the stories we deal with here.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, on the level of the trauma and PTSD that all victims of sexual abuse/rape suffer it is what they all suffer.
And, sadly, it is life long.  I do think that being able to tell the story also helps, especially when they are believed.

               I see where you're coming from, but many pedos keep their victims eg Woody Allen married his. There's the guy from Mamas and Papas who 'had an affair' with his grown daughter for years.

               <p>
                I think it's a toss up as to whether Woody Allen married Soon Yi because if he dropped her she 
likely would have quite some stories to tell ....
               </p>
               <p>
                or whether he really wanted to marry her.

                Re -- John Phillips ....

               <p>
                NO ... HE DID NOT HAVE AN "AFFAIR WITH HIS DAUGHTER' ....
               </p>
               <p>
                Phillips was engaged in the crime of INCEST in his rape of his daughter when
she was a child.
               </p>
               <p>
                Phillips was an excellent example of a Heterosexual male engaged in pedophile activity.
               </p>
               <p>
                Heterosexual males are the majority of those involved in pedophile activity -- rape of children.
               </p>
               <p>
                For one reason or another, these young children hold the FEAR -- they are traumatized -- and
they cannot challenge the adult father, even later in life.
               </p>
               <p>
                But it is NOT "an affair" as we normally understand it between two consenting adults.

               No, the relationship did NOT go on for 35 years.  It merely took her 35 years to get to a point where she was willing to look honestly at what happened to her when she was 13 years old and he was 40.
              </p>
              <p>
               My problem with this movie is that if the woman was able to be fine with what happened for all those years -- some will argue that the relationship didn't actually harm her.  It was the REACTION to the relationship that was harmful.  That is EXACTLY what pedos are trying to push.  They believe that sex with kids isn't harmful as long as adults don't "over react" to it.  Which is total bullshit.  This movie is designed to purposely blur the lines in cases like these (which are the majority of child sexual abuse cases -- but certainly not the most extreme ones).
              </p>
              <p>
               It seems impossible that pedophilia could ever become normalized, but then I take a look at New York and realize that they recognize 31 (yes, THIRTY-ONE) different "genders", some of which are fluid which means it could change daily/hourly, and I realize that making pedophilia mainstream may not be as impossible as I thought.  That is terrifying!

                Thank you -- I see that now ... 
I've re-read it ... and not sure where I got that idea ... 
somehow the 35 years and "relationship" seemed to stay together in my mind.
Again -- thanks!
               </p>
               <p>
                I haven't seen the movie ... so I have no idea what she did with the trauma...
many victims (See: CIA's MKULTRA) "disassociate" which means they develop
another personality which is unknown to the host to carry the trauma.
However, I think if that had happened it would have been mentioned.
               </p>
               <p>
                Still there are many stories where this stuff stays buried -- especially when victims are very young.
However, the mind will eventually begin to try to straighten things out ... usually by moving the info
into the conscious mind in flash-backs.
               </p>
               <p>
                This man was a pedophile ...
but we don't know enough about him to know if he was a heterosexual male.
               </p>
               <p>
                This buried trauma is always harmful to the victims, sometimes showing up in other failed relationships,
sometimes with abuse of alcohol or drugs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sex with a child is a CRIME ... and it will never be anything different ... because a child cannot grant "consent."
               </p>
               <p>
                As I've said, I haven't seen the movie ... if I do I'll comment further on what I think of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                True pedophiles are thought to have NO sexual orientation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Males are our sexual abusers of children ... and 95% of them are heterosexual males involved in pedophile activity.
This is called "situational pedophilia."
               </p>
               <p>
                I think your last paragraph suggests that you're being loaded up with nonsense by right wingers ...
There are very few cases of trans-gender for anyone to worry about. 
I applaud Bradley/Chelsea Manning because of what he did in releasing information the public needed
to know and be aware of being committed by our US government.
There was a character named "Jazz" appearing on one of the networks for a while ... very sad in the
choices she was going to have to make in order to become female.  Fortunately, she had full backing
and understanding from her family.
               </p>
               <p>
                What truly worries me about our bathrooms is how filthy the men's rooms are ...
Many men don't even want to use them.  Keep ALL males out of women's bathrooms!!  :)

                 I'm actually a liberal, not a right winger.  I wasn't trying to imply that pedophiles are transgender.  I'm sorry if I worded it poorly and it came across that way.  I just meant that the very idea that there could even be 31 genders is, frankly, ridiculous and if we can get to a point where we've gone way past acceptance of someone who is transgender to the idea that we can allow individuals to make up their own categories of gender (without some hard scientific evidence to back up those new gender definitions), then all bets are off.  I have no problem with people who are transgender living their life as they choose.  And I do know that most pedophiles identify as heterosexuals (although I would argue that those men molesting young boys and who still claim to be heterosexual are not being completely honest with themselves about their sexual preferences).  And, sadly, while it may be primarily men who sexually abuse children, that is changing as more women are now engaging in these types of behaviors themselves -- in addition to supplying their children to other adults.  But, again, I didn't mean to make any disparaging remarks about transgender people -- merely the trend of thinking that being liberal means that you have to accept any and everyone's self designation of gender.  Maybe there really are 31 different genders, but I'd like to see the scientific data to back that up before we pass laws to prevent people from asking for proof of gender or impose punishments for not using the pronoun of that person's choice (especially when the concept of gender fluidity is added and you may not know -- unless they are literally wearing a sign that tells you what gender/pronouns apply today -- exactly how you should address them).  That was my only point with that last paragraph.  Just thought I should clear that up :)

                  I didn't think you were suggesting that pedophiles were transgender ...
I was pointing out to you the NOISE by the right wing in reaction to transgender issue rising.
That it's "much ado about nothing" given the numbers.  And given the "bathroom" issue.
Have you ever had to use a man's bathroom -- ??!!
So worrying about 31 genders is even more inane.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, your comments here are confused ....
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   And I do know that most pedophiles identify as heterosexuals (although I would argue that those men molesting young boys and who still claim to be heterosexual are not being completely honest with themselves about their sexual preferences). And, sadly, while it may be primarily men who sexually abuse children, that is changing as more women are now engaging in these types of behaviors themselves -- in addition to supplying their children to other adults.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Pedophiles are thought to have NO sexual orientation...they have "preferences"
however for children whether male or female - and very specific preferences as to eye control, etc.
When the child moves out of the age group they are attracted to they are no longer interested in them.
Pedophilia is based on AGE ... not gender.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, 95% of those males who sexually abuse children are called "situational" heterosexuals ...
In other words they are men who generally desire sex with adult women... but when one isn't 
available they will sexually abuse a child - any child.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And you continue to be hung up on the idea that if a male sexually abuses a male child then he is a 
homosexual.  No; it doesn't work that way.  Anyone who sexually assaults a child is a pedophile.
There are two categories of pedophiles -- those with NO sexual orientation and the majority (95%) who
are heterosexual.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Women are NOT our sexual abusers of children .... UNLESS they are under the influence of a
heterosexual male which is often the case.  The female may have previously been sexually abused
by a male.  Look at Catholic nuns:  Many of them have sexually abused children, but they are 
under the influence of a male-supremacist religion and under its control.  And, 40% of Catholic nuns
have been beaten and/or sexually abused by Catholic priests.

                 <p>
                  What is happening on this issue is that homophobia which is still very alive in our patriarchal
societies causes confusion in regard to understanding pedophilia.

                 <p>
                  We also see a lot of right wing involvement in this issue -- as in late term abortion -- to distort facts
and to keep the right wing in "raw meat."  These are very MINOR issues as late term abortion is.
Late term abortions are necessary because these are pregnancies -- wanted pregnancies -- which 
go wrong and the pregnancy is effecting the life or health of the pregnant female.  These are a very
small number of abortions every year in the US ... about ONE in every county of the US every year.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  These pregnancies -- again, wanted pregnancies -- can do great harm to a woman's life and health.
EVEN prevent her from having future children if she is forced to continue on with the pregnancy -- 
or forced to a natural birth.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Many people discussing this issue don't realize that there was a time when ALL late term
abortions were banned.  For instance, Debbie Reynolds/actress was pregnant at one time
with a pregnancy gone wrong.  The child was dead in her womb.  It was affecting her health
both mentally and physically, but she was not allowed to abort the dead child.  She was 
forced to carry the dead child in her womb for months before it was delivered naturally.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Some time after that she became pregnant again -- and even earlier the child again died in 
her womb.  She was forced again for even longer to carry the dead child to term.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Eventually, they figured out that she had lost the second child because her system was so
depleted from carrying the first dead child to term.  In other words, it had seriously effected
her health.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  These are the kinds of "late term abortion" which the right wing makes so much NOISE about...
and tries to excite their right wing followers about.  The NOISE is intended to prevent citizens
from understanding what these abortions are really about and how FEW of these abortions take
place.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That's what I'm saying to you about the transgender issue -- it's a very MINOR issue as to numbers.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, again -- the bigger "bathroom issue" is the filth of men's rooms.

                   I don't know if "hung up" is the right way to phrase it, but I just can't seem to reconcile that someone who claims to be heterosexual and who exclusively molests young boys is truly simply a heterosexual.  Of course, the prepubescent bodies of girls and boys are not very different, aside from genitalia, so perhaps the attraction is merely to that body structure and not necessarily the genitals.  Although, it is still hard to imagine that someone who prefers that undeveloped body type could possibly be interested in an adult body type, too.  But, mental illness doesn't really have any limitations, I suppose.

                   As for women abusing kids, men are by far the majority of the abusers.  However, there is evidence that more women are engaging in this type of behavior.  When I was a kid (a long time ago), it was almost unheard of for a woman to be sexually abusing kids -- but now we see many teachers, baby sitters, etc. being convicted of this type of behavior.  Some of it may not fall into the category of pedophilia (because they are post-pubescent), but they are certainly taking advantage of authority positions and engaging in inappropriate behavior with children.  In my city, there are quite a few women who are on the sex offender registry for sex crimes against minors.  But there are even more women who provide their children knowingly to significant others or to strangers for profit.  Even if they are under the influence of a male, that doesn't absolve them from their part in the crime.  Neither does being abused as a child themselves.  I was sexually abused as a child and I would NEVER have any inappropriate relationships, sexual or otherwise, with a child.  Never.

                   Yes, homophobia is real and there are many people who assume that a homosexual will also be a pedophile.  But, it is just as wrong to assume that a homosexual cannot be a pedophile, too.  Some of them undoubtedly are because it appears that the percentage of pedophiles is pretty consistent -- even across every type of demographic.  You can't say it is simply a heterosexual or caucasian or male or lower income problem.  It is pretty much a problem in every community.  People like Kevin Spacey who defend himself against a claim of sexual assault where the victim was a minor do not help that by deciding that is the perfect time to come out as a gay man.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Personally I am inclined to think that a large percentage of what we call pedophiles are truly sociopathic narcissists.  They are interested only in sexual gratification for themselves.  Children tend to be favored by them because they will be more compliant and are easier to manipulate and dominate than a peer would be.  They would probably be more accurately labeled as pansexual, though, if they have no preference for sexual partners, wouldn't they?  Those who are only sexually attracted to children, I view as strictly pedophiles.  And I do think that if you have a preference for one gender -- regardless of the age -- that is still significant.  I think people are understandably concerned about linking pedophiles to homosexuality, but it seems a little silly not to call a man who is only attracted to underage boys a homosexual pedophile just as a man who is only attracted to underage girls would be a heterosexual pedophile.  The problem is that homosexual pedophilia is seen as somehow worse because it is homosexual.  That is often why it gets reported more and prosecuted more because parents are more likely to press charges in that case.  Pedophilia is pedophilia, though. I don't think it matters whether the person who is targeting a child is gay/straight/bi/pansexual/whatever.  The problem isn't in their preferences for genitalia -- it is, as you said, the age preference that makes it horrible.  As long as people are consenting adults, I absolutely do not care what they do in private.  I may not agree with their choices (like polyamory, for example) but it is their right to live their lives as they see fit.  If it involves people who can't consent (like someone who isn't conscious or someone mentally challenged or kids) or animals, though, those people need to be separated from society and only released if rehabilitation can be achieved.

                    Wow ... you just continue to confuse yourself.
If you truly want to know about pedophiles and "situational" pedophiles who are heterosexuals then go to basic articles -- not right wing or anti-abortion websites and read about the studies.
What I see over and again here is the FEAR that right wing instills in those they brainwash about reading anything that might help them figure anything out -- or enable them to think for themselves.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    One of the things you miss about human sexuality is that really it takes place in the BRAIN...
that's why transgender suffer as they do.  The BRAIN is out of sync with the body.

                   <p>
                    Pedophiles are very specifically attracted to children of a specific AGE.
Some very young children, some older children.

                    Yes, you see more pictures of women on Yahoo -- as we just saw with the tortured children.

                    True -- even if a heterosexual is involved when a women abuses a child -- or if the woman has been sexually abused -- that doesn't absolve her.  But it does make clear the harmful influence that heterosexual males can have over females in regard to cooperating in the sexual abuse of a child.
And that's important to know.  Step-fathers and brothers are the most common sexual abusers of children.

                    Same with the number of homosexuals who may be found sexually abusing a child -- 
or a woman who may be found sexually abusing a child.  It's meaningless.
Concentrate on the overall numbers and facts - -MALES ARE OUR SEXUAL ABUSERS OF CHILDREN.
Homosexuals are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child.
Women are generally NOT our sexual abusers of children.
So -- who should families be aware of when they consider their children's safety?

                    Pedophiles seem to be a case of "arrested development" ... as in boys who were turned over to seminaries when they were like 12-14 years old.  They're not prepared for the brainwashing they get about human sexually.  Emotionally they remain 12-14 years old and will be attracted to other 12-14
year olds even when they've aged and become adults.

                   <p>
                    The important thing now is that society is listening to women and children.
The less oppression of women, the less sexual abuse of children.

                     I'm just trying to point out the obvious.  Yes, sometimes homosexuals are actually pedophiles.  I would guess that the percentage of homosexuals who molest kids is about the same as the percentage of heterosexuals who molest kids (of course, I'd have to research the numbers to back up that statement -- but that is my guess).  Overall, the vast majority of offenders are heterosexual because heterosexuals are the vast majority of the population.  Homosexuals are a minority.  Therefore, even though the same percentage of that population may be offenders as the heterosexual population, since they make up only a small percentage of the population overall, the raw numbers of homosexual offenders is much, much lower than the raw numbers of heterosexual offenders.  Perhaps you should study some statistics to understand the point I am trying to make here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I'm not trying to blame any group or make connections to pedophilia and homosexuality.  You are projecting that on me.  You seem to be very devoted to proving that it is ONLY heterosexual males who are sexual predators and I am simply pointing out that ANYONE can be a sexual predator.  It may not happen as often, but it does happen.  And it is important to recognize this because we don't want a mindset where we think that a child who reports being molested by a woman or a homosexual is not believed because those groups "don't do stuff like that".

                     I get why the homosexual community is very prickly about this issue because people have wrongly connected pedophilia ONLY to homosexuals (and I don't condone that mindset or excuse it), but it isn't an excuse to pretend that pedophilia can't exist within the homosexual community, too.  It is clear that you have your agenda as you keep accusing me of being brainwashed by right-wing articles when I have clearly stated that I am a LIBERAL.  I'm not a Fox News watcher.  I do actually have many friends (and a nephew) who is gay.  I have NO prejudice about homosexuality.  I just think it is kind of ridiculous to assert that a man who only molests boys couldn't possibly be considered as having homosexual tendencies as well.  The fact that you can't even consider that possibility shows that you aren't open to considering any possibilities that are outside your own political views.

                      Your guesses would be way off -- homosexuals are more than 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child than a heterosexual male.  That indicates that for every 100 heterosexual abusers, there would be 0 homosexuals abusers.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You should be dedicated to letting parents/families know who the sexual abusers of children are ... IF you don't want to see children sexually abused.  It is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children and they are in the majority heterosexual males as "situational" pedophiles.

                      The Catholic Church/CIA has been trying to label homosexuals as pedophiles for 2,000 years.

                      Homosexuals have had to overcome 2,000 years of vile homophobic preachings against them by the RCC which taught not only their own members intolerance and hatred for homosexuals, but caused even the parents of homosexuals to HATE their own children and throw them out of their homes.  All American society was infected with this hatred for homosexuals.

                       Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.

                       Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
                       <br/>
                       A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

                       Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

                       A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

               Wow you are always all over the place with your thinking, and always missing the points others try to make. One thing you are consistent with is the rigidness of your thinking. You seem to be confused about what you perceive the larger public to think of regarding child sexual abuse with your own personal experience. You make it really easy to point out the flaws inyour reasoning and comments, but now I'm seeing that you really are the suffering victim I just thought your "feminism" ideology was telling you that you should be.
              </p>
              <p>
               For your own sake, you really DO need to find a good therapist and work through your issues, they are obviously not resolved and it seems to be effecting you. This isn't my usually snark, this is the truth.

            I can guarantee none of those Hollywood stars feel anything bad about child rape.  It is all crocodile tears.  Everything is an act cuz that’s what’s they do best, they’re actors.  The below commenter was right, this is a movie to desensitise

            I think that sounds terrible, actually. Like a pedo's dream to see this mainstream. What about the actual girl that acted in the scenes? Won't she be a bit fucked up as a result? This sounds fucking terrible to me. Anyone else?

             <strong>
              The film ends with a disclaimer that the sex scenes were shot using an adult body double. Nelisse, who was 11 at the time of filming, only shot the dialogue parts of the scene, which are graphic in their own right. Fox would coach her on how to react properly to the pain of losing one’s virginity: ”Act like you’ve been stung by a bee.”

             I do, however, share some of your concerns -
            </p>
            <p>
             And also -- while I have no idea what I'll think AFTER I see the movie -- I am concerned that
this rape" followed by a 35 year relationship could suggest a fuzziness quite DIFFERENT from
what generally happens in a sexual assault - gang rape -- sexual harassment -- situations where
Weinstein was masturbating in front of women he had cornered and blocked from leaving....
            </p>
            <p>
             or the many cases of women being raped after being drugged by Bill Cosby.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to understand this young female's experience and the harm done to her and 
the ways that pedophiles groom their victims.  Because this movie is very sexually explicit - and 
likely doesn't have a PG rating -- can this movie serve as a warning to girls the age that "Jennifer" 
was when this happened to her.

             I understand your points, but I think sometimes it takes a shocking experience to wake people up--so in your face that they can no longer pretend to look the other way as they've been doing for so long.  Pedophilia has flourished when it's just hinted at or softened in movies--that's normalization.  It's "funny uncle" instead of pedo predator.
            </p>
            <p>
             Agree about the dialogue scenes.  There are plenty of older teens who can be made to look age 13, and they should have chosen one of them.

                thats quite an accusation, but no. i havent even clicked your name. you and your nonsense means so little that i didnt even think of the fact that i didnt even hover my cursor over until just now. youre trying way too hard.

                  what are you talking about? while i wait for the chimp shills to respond i browse voat. if i end up in a post you happened to be shrieking in, so be it. i still havent downvoted you a single time, even though you are stone-cold retarded.

                    you call that abuse? thats whats pathetic. additionally, ones background does not make them immune to criticism. ever. deal with it. you can keep being wrong though, i just dont recommend it.

This film is giving voice to it.”

             Good grief.  Burstyn had to go and ruin a great thing (the movie putting child rape in the spotlight and also her talking about the horror of exploitation of innocence and how it's time for it to stop, even crying about it).  The way she ruined it was by dragging Trump into it with a dumb statement that doesn't even make sense--that the tape Trump made (he didn't make the tape) was the straw that broke the camel's back (which it wasn't because the tape didn't have anything to do with child rape).

              Is everyone forgetting that Trump was accused of raping a then 13 year old girl (provided to him by Epstein)?  You do know that she had corroborating witnesses to back up her claims, right?  She dropped her case and no more was heard about it.  Payoff?  Threats?  Why is Pizzagate totally believable but an accusation that Trump paid for a 13 year old prostitute -- considering that Epstein had dozens of phone numbers for Trump in his little black book that was entered into evidence -- not worth considering?  Pedophilia is NON-PARTISAN, people.  And have you really looked honestly at his relationship with his daughter?  Those photos of them together when she was younger and he is more hands on with his daughter than he is with his wife.  Come on. Let's not be blind here.  If Trump brings down the pedo elite, I'll gladly admit I misjudged him but all signs point to him being a pervert of the highest order.  Pedophilia is a big draw for the rich and powerful because they view it as a "delicacy" that is expensive, hard to obtain and that only the rich and powerful can get away with.  That is the reality of the world today.  I say we investigate them all.  If Trump is innocent, he can prove it in a court of law.  I don't think that Trump or Clinton or Woody Allen or any of those powerful perverts deserve to be treated differently simply because they are rich and powerful.

              What I was asking was, did you agree with Burstyn or not?

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Trump did "made a tape" in the sense that he spoke on the tape about his inability to control
himself sexually around beautiful women.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump made clear that he regularly would go up to beautiful women, kiss them
and also "grab them by the pussy."
             </p>
             <p>
              Burstyn is commenting NOW on a man who has since reached the Oval Office.
And you see no connection to Trump's confession about his own sexual aggressiveness 
towards women he encounters and the recent revelations about sexual harassment and 
rape as revealed by women over the last week?
             </p>
             <p>
              When Burstyn says Trump's tape was "the straw that broke the camel's back" what she means is 
that it is so outrageous that someone like Trump reached the White House that it very likely caused
women to begin to tell their stories of sexual harassment and rape by men like Trump -- celebrities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sexual harassment and rape -- and what Trump describes he is doing to women -- are able to 
occur in our patriarchal societies because women are still unequal, still without equal power and thus
without equal protection in our male-dominated societies -- and very importantly without power within
our male-dominated government.
             </p>
             <p>
              Re this ....
              <strong>
               (which it wasn't because the tape didn't have anything to do with child rape).
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              When women can so easily be sexual harassed, raped and sexually abused by males in our
societies ... so can children.  Women/Mothers do not have the power, therefore, to protect their 
children from sexual abuse by males.
              <br/>
              And sex trafficking of children in America is a clear sign of that reality here and globally.
             </p>
             <p>
              Further, many have commented on Trump's very odd behavior to his daughter Avanka - -calling her 
"baby" today.  Having made previous comments about her allure.
              <br/>
              For a father/parent it's inappropriate comment/behavior.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand, I'm much happier when Trump is spouting off ridiculously and telling the world
who he is and what he's all about.  It's helpful in many ways for the world to see him as he is ...
though it may be highly embarrassing for Americans everywhere.

               Big lie in there....Trump didn't grab anyone by the pussy or say he did.  Ever.
               <br/>
               Trump was mocking the whores that throw themselves at famous people, saying that if he wanted to, he COULD go up and grab em by the pussy and they'd let him.
Claiming Trump actually DID grab pussies is a stupid, willfully-ignorant smear of grade-school-level sophistication.
The MORE interesting part of the story is that :
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Billy Bush, a member of the Bush clan, taped this secretly in 2005....2005!!.....W was already President...the Bushes were ALREADY planning for little Jebburito to run, and wanted to clear the potential field.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 This was no interview.  Billy was wired like a snitch.  Billy introduced the subject of women throwing themselves at him, and spoke so badly about women that the network he was working for in 2016 fired him for those comments made 11 years earlier..  He totally set up Trump to get an obnoxious comment from him.
Funny they never made the whole tape available.....
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               This is more evidence that Trump is not a member of the swamp, and that the Bush crime family considered him an enemy 11 yrs prior to the last election.

                Actually, the guy who wrote "Fury and Fire" is pretty much suggesting that Trump is already
involved in another affair right now.

                She probably knows it would be dangerous for her to even try to leave --
especially that she has a son with the Moron.

               <p>
                Trump is a fascist -- as becomes more obvious every day.

                 YOU said in your post that he'd actually grabbed em by the pussy, so you are already in the stocks for overstating your case.  Pieces of conversations aren't convincing either.  So he talked like lots of men do in private at the gym or a men's club.  PLUS he was "encouraged" by an agenda-driven Bushite.

                 Yeah, some guy says he's having an affair now...oh, and Melania looks like she hates him....fricking TIRED and PETTY as hell crap from tea-leaf readers.  The fact you're focused on this stupidity shows how petty and small you are.

                  Who knows what Trump actually does ... he can't control his mouth and he says he can't control
himself sexually ... and he was advocating that he could "grab 'em by the pussy."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I find what Trump says all on his own to be quite revealing of who he truly is -- which is generally disgusting.
Someone who "talks this way about women" should not be in the Oval Office.
Trump is a grown up man responsible for his own behavior and what comes out of his own mouth.
And generally his mouth is a cesspool -- showing us that so is his mind a cesspool.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sorry .. but when a First Lady looks threatened by the guy she's married to it is everyone's business.
Recall Ivana's story of Trump's rape of her -- after a rage about some plastic surgery he'd had on his head ...
beat her first.  Yes ... she denies it now but was part of divorce hearing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trump supports authoritarian ideas -- fascism.
He's a bully from start to finish just as Hitler was.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is not someone who is interested in democracy or equality -- or respect and protection for all
of the people.  This is a rich billionaire interested in sopping up the wealth of the nation for himself
and other Elites/wealthy.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The attempt to overturn reproductive freedom is, of course, but one example --
but he looks and acts like a "white-supremacist" ... and he is of course a criminal.
Where are his tax returns?  Why are we paying $20 million every weekend for him to go to Florida?
How many bankruptcies?  And how many investigations of him right now?
How many women have accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, sexual abuse? -- 17-18?

                   How is Trump worse than Obama?  Who put his Mother-in-law in the White House at taxpayer expense....practitioner of Santeria, she sacrificed a CHICKEN in the White House.  Barry has a long history of drug abuse AND DEALING.  Plus there's the Man Country membership in Chicago, and all those other stories....
Is Trump worse than Hillary?  Ever get a load of the way she conducted herself in the White House the FIRST time she was there?  A RAGE machine, vicious and deadly..there's a list, you know....
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "when a First LAdy looks threatened"...thats just the purest crap imaginable.  Compared to the beast that was wiggling her ass and fist-pumping the last 8 years?  She acts like a LAdy, all the time.  You don't have any IDEA what she's thinking.  Again, there's that pettiness....  Rational people don't make public assertions about character by "reading" tea leaves like that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And another thing rational people don't do is fail to take what's offered in a DIVORCE proceeding with a grain of salt...especially when the lady retracts the statements as being from an emotional (she didn't want the divorce) place while negotiating.  Plus they have a great relationship now, she endorsed his candidacy and denied her divorce charge was true....You, latching on and deciding to believe the repudiated story are, again, being petty as hell.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Love your last paragraph-- the scattershot, angry muddled non-rational thinking of a hard-core Lefty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   How about the ONE question I asked you---how is Trump a Fascist?  A big charge, no examples even offered.....  You really think you covered that with "Trump supports authoritarian ideas" and he's a "bully"?  REALLY?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I was asking for an example....Fascism would have actual POLICY behind it....what policies are fascist?  You can't support the bald, unsupported assertions of "fascism" that you made in your prior post by making ADDITIONAL bald, unsupported assertions.  I'm still waiting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Just because fascism sounds bad doesn't make it a good club to use on everything.  I question if you know what it means.  Let me help:  When Obama circumvented normal bankruptcy procedures in order to FUCK GM bondholders, who should have gotten paid off FIRST in bankruptcy...thats FASCISM.
When he gifts the company to the union, THAT'S fascism.  When he leaves Federal Government "minders" in paid positions at GM, to report back to him and represent the Obama Administration at the company?  THAT'S Fascism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You, thinking Trump sounds like a "bully"?  Doesn't cut it.  POLICY, please?

                    BOTH parties are responsible for fascism here.
And likely that Obama was CIA . . .  in fact, it may be that Obama, Hillary and Bill were in MKULTRA program.

                    We would all be fools to ignore what Ivana said about Trump in the divorce - and it was a very detailed and painful story of being beaten by The Donald and then raped.

                    Trump continues the assault on labor and women -- on reproductive freedom -- that's fascism.

                   <p>
                    He's also obviously a sexual abuser of women -- which is done to exert power and control over women.

                   <p>
                    This is not a man interested in democracy -- as his racism also makes clear.

                   <p>
                    You don't think that expanding demands for more intelligence/surveillance of the American public is fascism?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You don't think that warmongering all over the world is fascism?
How many "illegal wars of aggression" does the US/CIA already have going?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You make clear where you've been hanging out and getting "educated" ... what you sum up is that 
if democracies attempt to reign in corporate-fascism then that's fascism . . . !!!
Good circular thinking.  Look up corporate-fascism.

                    Trump is an authoritarian fascist trying to exert his will on the nation -- racism, sexism and homophobia.
All while attacking the most vulnerable citizens among us - children, seniors, handicapped.
He's a bully and always will be.

                     BOTH national parties are against Trump.  If they're fascist, why do they oppose him so overtly?  When  was the last time the leadership of a party turned on their own (elected by rank and file) candidate and tried to cause him to LOSE?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Ivana said she voted for Trump.  BTW--that divorce is just about the only mistake I've ever heard Trump admit to....Their relationship is good, as reported by BOTH.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Trump is assaulting labor?  He's CHAMPIONING blue collar workers by evicting illegals, and wages are RISING, a stated goal from the campaign.  Its the REAL globalist fascists in both parties that are waging war on Labor.  Trump WON because the blue collar vote understood that, believed him, and its paying off for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     ABORTION?  If being pro-life is fascism...well, at least we all know who we're dealing with now....
BTW, according to a big Gallup poll in late 2016, 46% of Americans call themselves "pro-life".  47% call abortion "immoral".  Just to demonstrate how ASININE it is to call pro-lifers "fascists".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Last, you try to support the Obama Administration's takeover of both the banks and the auto industry as merely "reigning in" corporate fascism.....that is so fucking dishonest...its a slick lie.  Appropriating entire industries is GOVERNMENT fascism.  Do you think Federal fascism would necessarily include a complete takeover, and a change of GM's name to "Obama Motors" or something??.....the rules and the implanted "minders" (banks have them as well!!) ARE government fascism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Trying to "exert his will" is more horse-s--t.....  NAME a single policy that Trump is trying to implement that he DIDN'T run on during the election.  You can't.  Americans VOTED for that agenda.  The fact that Trump won doesn't make you snowflakes into victims.  Grow up.

                      Where does the GOP oppose Trump?  Have they censored him in any way?
Have they responded to calls from citizens to limit his access to nuclear codes?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Have they stopped him from charging us $20 million every time he goes to Florida?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Have they forced him to supply his tax filings?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Elites who own both parties do not always agree -- Koch Bros. for instance/John Birch Society said that they thought Trump
was too "volatile."  Think most of us would agree with that.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Ivana's vote is secret -- no one can prove who she voted for.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Trump has $300 million .. is that the figure.  That would be intimidating to any ex-wife.
And I imagine it is also intimidating for Melania, especially since she has a son to think about.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Trump is damaging labor -- in every way possible -- wake up to reality.
Are you going to take the job that some "illegal immigrant" leaves?
It's Elites who profit from this illegal immigration.
And it could be stopped immediately by doing what other nations do -- 
create an INSTANT SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK...
Yet, our government continues to refuse to do that.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Wages are rising because we had an 8 year depression -- which Obama brought to an end two years
before he left office -- not because anyone cares about the people, but probably to try to help the 
Dem Party which he largely destroyed.  That's a huge backlog of things the public needs.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Americans support abortion and reproductive freedom ... and more than 50% of Americans support simple CHOICE.
If you have a link to your "Gallup statistics" I'd like to see it ... as even Catholic women have abortions and just as 
many abortions as any other women.  Catholic women in Ireland travel to the UK by the 100's every week to get abortions.
So who is it you don't think are having abortions?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Anyone who wants to try to impose their religious beliefs on someone else by using the government to do it ... is a fascist.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Look for the mention of "corporations" in the Constitution.  Let me know if you find it.
What do you think fascism was in Italy except corporate-fascism?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Corporations exist to serve the public -- but what they're doing is serving themselves with high levels of criminality.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But presume you do think that corporations are people?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      How about National health Care for ALL which this nation has been crying out for over decades now.
How about Americans not supporting these "illegal wars of aggression" or the MIC/Intelligence Complex?
How about our government permitting spying on citizens?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      No one voted for Trump's agenda ... he lost by 300 million votes.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Our elections are also by the way "rigged."

              <p>
               I think bringing up adult-to-adult sex crimes and misdemeanors, especially hot-button political ones, is not helpful when the discussion is
               <em>
                finally
               </em>
               about child rape.  It dilutes and redirects the focus.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sexual abuse of adults is also disgusting and utterly unacceptable, of course, and it's good that the truth is emerging on that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Child rape needs its own spotlight, though, and at long last we have a film that is drawing attention to the insidious and revolting nature of child grooming and sex crimes.  Even elite pedo-huggers have been shocked into publicly speaking out about the horror of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               The focus needs to remain on this until people everywhere are so sickened by it that they can no longer turn a blind eye and pretend it's not happening. A widely talked-about movie is a great way to make this happen.
              </p>

              <p>
               <p>
                Fact --
               </p>
               <p>
                It should be more obvious to you that MALES who disrespect females will also disrespect children.
That's what we see right now with the GOP budget -- and they'll also harm seniors, handicapped 
or anyone else.
               </p>
               <p>
                When you can rape a woman and get away with it, you can even more easily rape a child and get away with it.
               </p>
               <p>
                No -- Nature made females the natural protectors of children -- when women have no power to do so ...
then children are sexually abused by males.
               </p>
               <p>
                You may not like to see that connection, but it is reality.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think you're expecting rather much of a film which not everyone will see ....
               </p>
               <p>
                Does it make clear, for instance, that our sexual abusers of children are MALES?
               </p>
               <p>
                That would be important information for families to have.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also feel -- though I have not seen the movie, of course -- that there will be a lot of confusion where
a 35 year relationship/intimacy continued on between these two -- the abuser and the abused.
That's something very hard for the public to understand as we've seen before.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also what we are talking about here are children being TRAFFICKED which is a very important subject.
Children being kidnapped.  And children being sexually abused in their own homes by male adults in their families. -
Grandfathers, Fathers, Step-fathers, Uncles, Male Cousins -- and Male friends of the family.
INCEST
               </p>
               <p>
                Many of the children turned over to CIA/MKULTRA program had already been sexually abused by their fathers
who turned them over to the program for financial rewards, or business deals.
Looks like the CIA is the actual "Satan" throughout the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                This unraveling of the sexual abuse of females which we've seen recently is what is leading into sexual abuse of children.
It's beginning to happen and it will happen ... as long as women are listened to.
As long as the oppression of women continues to life.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's the irony of Trump in the Oval Office ...

             Do you actually see Trump as a man who can control himself sexually?
            </p>
            <p>
             Or even control his mouth?

             And, since I'm here, I'd like to appeal to all females to STOP agreeing to having your
baby son circumcised because you husband may think it's a good idea or wants to avoid
having him be "different" from the other boys.

                <p>
                 Your talking about NOT getting the point, while I made clear that I agreed to have my son
circumcised, sadly.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And you reply saying, I probably have no children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Obviously you don't read the post you're reply to.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also mentioned that one reason that males will suggest it's a good idea to have
their sons circumcised is because they don't want them to "be different" from other
children who are circumcised.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They you come back and ask ... "What does 'being different' have to do with anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nothing will make sense to you if you don't read and can't comprehend what is being said to you.

            As I read about how it started, Bill cuddling Jenny under a blanket, I thought back to Breitbart author Patrick Courrielche's revelation about the Hollywood "Creepy Dad." He and his whole neighborhood knew the guy crept into bed with other people's children during sleepover parties but made the decision at the time not to report him to authorities.  I hope to God someone has stepped up by now.
