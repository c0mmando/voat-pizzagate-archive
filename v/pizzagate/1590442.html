<p>This is a really great talk/article by an investigative journalist with a lot of experience and apparently integrity. I highly recommend reading it to understand the context and history behind pizzagate, and why investigations like those of the &quot;Finders&quot; cult were shut down so quickly. This is also why it is so significant that the CPP neighborhood is reportedly &quot;80% CIA agents.&quot;</p>
<p>Just one of the new pieces of information from Rappoport\'s talk was the name Loretta Bender, who performed experiments in LSD among other things on very young children with the excuse that they were &quot;schizophrenic&quot; or &quot;autistic.&quot;</p>

<p>This study by L. Bender was particularly shocking. It tested LSD on &quot;prepubescent children.&quot;

            "Committee on Radiation March 15, 1995, she says, " ... the research programs [that her clients were submitted to] included radiation, drugs, mind control and chemicals ... my clients have reported all of these being used on them, although technically they were considered to be part of the mind control experiments. Generally it appears that therapists across the country are finding clients who have been subjected to mind control techniques. The consistency of their stories about the purpose of the mind control and the techniques such as electroshock, use of hallucinogens, sensory deprivation, spinning, dislocation of limbs, and sexual abuse is remarkable. There is almost nothing published on this aspect of mind control used on children, and these clients come from all over the country having had no contact with each other. "

            If you look at the insane number of these people, entire cities of these freaks and the amount of children the import and kidnap, it's not too far of a stretch to say they are steadily replacing the population with mkultra slaves. They breed them and convert more and more every year and it's been going on decades.
