            Q is very real but I do not know to what end and the people that oppose Q are here. I asked srayzie to explain why she was connected to known shills I have never been given an answer. Last person I shared my info with deleted their voat account.

            What does being "woken up" mean? "Woken up" to what? The phrase is too vague for the pressure it's being asked to bear. Much of what the Q-team refers to is already common knowledge. Widespread pedophilia is common knowledge. People trafficking is common knowledge. Modern slavery is common knowledge. Much or all of the political system is corrupt: that too is common knowledge.  So what is the special part of Q's message that, going beyond common knowledge, is so important? The idea that Trump is a saviour? This is a major part of the Q-message and it is obviously false. The idea that there is some kind of (hot) civil war going on between American intelligence agencies? Don't see any definite evidence of that. Does the Q-team seem concerned about the influence of AIPAC on American politics? Does the Q-team seen anxious to expose the role of American-Israeli dual citizens and CIA/Mossad in 9/11 (and many other projects)? Not so much. There are clear indications that the Q-team links to Wikileaks/Cicada/Anonymous i.e. the CIA. Why are the CBTS people on 4chan linking to Luciferian propaganda films? Including a propaganda film made in 2012 which predicts Trump's presidency? That doesn't mean anything? If you're not interested in whether or not Q is a psyop then you're not interested in whether or not you're being deceived. And while you may be a good person you definitely aren't 'awake'.

             To us it’s known. That’s what it means to be awake. We are aware. The average everyday person does know know all of this and they won’t find out watching mainstream media. They will start waking up when people are sharing with them over social media because a lot of people go there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate discussed in a forum isn’t going to reach people unless we are taking what we know and showing the world. It’s people like us that need to expose it!

              "To us it's known" is not an argument - it's a way of shutting all discussion down. I could say the same thing back - where would that get us? If you want to convince people about the Q-narrative you have to engage with the gaps and fractures in it. If I was a Q-believer, I would do that - I would attempt to explain why many of the predictions made by the Q-team are wrong. I would also not try to steamroller people who think that Trump is something other than a saviour. And I would not try to pretend that there are some things the Q-team does not want to talk about.

               The jump you make from what I was saying to 'Jew-hate obsession' is absurd. For the record (and I Imagine you're probably keeping some), I think anti-semitism is ridiculous. I mentioned American-Israeli dual citizens - included on that list, for example, would be Henry Kissinger, Richard Perle, Richard Haass, Douglas Feith, Paul Wolfowitz, John Bolton, and Dov Zakheim. Any of these names ring a bell? Obviously the list could be much expanded. Do you think there might be a problem if many members of the U.S. Government/state apparatus were American-Iranian dual citizens? Or even American-French dual citizens? Might not a question of conflicted interest arise in, say, matters of foreign policy? Might there be a problem if a group lobbying for a foreign power, like AIPAC, managed to exert an enormous grip on both political parties? I think it might be a problem - and if the Q-team is as interested in rooting out corruption as you and others claim you would think it would be just the kind of thing they would be interested in exposing. But just as Wikileaks -
 with all its supposed whizzbang hacktivism - hasn't exposed what really happened on 9/11, the Q-team, with all its supposed insider knowledge, doesn't seem inclined to either.

                Yes, I take note of many things, not literally writing them down though. Glad that's your thoughts on the matter, I apologise for jumping the gun - we do get jew-hate trolls in here from time to time though, I was quick to assume.

                I'm inclinced to agree, the key word is "might", though; Is there already policy in place to prevent dual-cit holders from taking up a govt position? If it comes to a need to 'ban' Govt officials from holding dual-cit, then by all means, [Trump et al should] do what needs to be done in order to keep things clear and transparent.

            The bl4ck h4nd of P0desta = La M4no N3ro a blackmailing and extortion mafia imported from Italy into Chicago and New York in the 20th Century. I obfuscate this so I don't pollute Google searches, because there is very little mention of this. No mention at all in Twitter.

            My friend,
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you so very much for acknowledging the fact that there is a .00000001% chance Q is real, but that it is still beneficial to help wake more and more people up to the truth.
           </p>

            I've been trying to say this on this board, and I get called a shill and get down voted. Simply for stating that this is likely the LARP of the century. I am convinced 100% that it is. Great post.

            It's been said many times, but I'm sure you need to hear it again: how much more info do you need for this to ring true with you? It's all laid out in front of you.

            IDK, I stopped following Q when it started seeming super psy op-y so I don't think that it really matters. From my brief exposure to alternate Q theories it's a deep state LARP or AI

            Let's say Trump and fam are uber friggin smart. Plus he has awesome intelligence sources. Who's not to say that it's an orchestrated red pill op? One I wouldn't  mind taking credit for myself if it were the case🤣 Gosh, early on I was led to a website about word magic, deep programming and related to kek. I remember reading "like we did in the election." On that page.

            My only concern has been israel, hoping for a long play. We cant be licking their balls while talking about freedom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, disinfo is necessary? And go back and re-read crumbs? I found some ish back in Nov, I don't have an audience or platform, really. I sent it to a few peeps, nothing. So I guess I gotta do it my damn self. 🤣 Plus, maybe it was too early. Seems more relevant now.  Seriously ... 10 years into this stuff and you think nothing can surprise you anymore.
Wrong and wrong.

            NK = Deep State controlled country aka CIA black site = torture, human experiments, big pharma, synthetic drug manufacturing, super notes, WMD technology, sex trafficking, modern MK, digital weaponry.  That is the problem.  Nice way to close the loop.

             Even though we may not agree on Q I still think it helped people open their eyes to the organized chaos that has been going on for ever and at the same time is giving some people hope ..

             no matter what Q turns out to be ,🤗  my hope is we all get back on the same track  .. whatever track that may be , because I sure and the heck don't know anymore 🙃

               You say what you feel but do it respectfully. You are a peace maker. Even tho you and I have always disagreed about Q, we’ve gotten along.

            I read Q posts, and I think they are entertaining, and sometimes even informative, but they are absolutely an intentional campaign to keep /pol/ from doing what they've done. Don't you just love how Q implies that everything is going to be taken care of, and that everything will be a-ok? I guess we can just rest on our laurels then. I suppose we don't have to do anymore digging. Don't you love how Q tells us not to go looking into the Jews, despite it being fact that they are wholly implicit in pizzagate, and all of the governmental corruption? Q sure knows how to make us feel secure and complacent!
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the danger of Q. The Q campaign may have tied a lot of loose ends together, but if you had paid any attention to /pol/ during this time, he wouldn't have told you anything you didn't already know.

            <p>
             President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is once more under intense scrutiny after new reporting revealed that his lucrative financial relationship with Israel has deepened even as his influence over U.S. Middle East policy—from his leading role in Trump's effort to "derail" a U.N. vote against Israel to his sway over the president's Jerusalem move—has continued to grow.

              Congress Quietly Passed A Bill Allowing Warrantless Searches Of Homes—Only 1% Opposed It
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             (TFTP) A bill that will allow homes to be searched without a warrant was passed with overwhelming support by the United States Congress, and signed into law by President Trump—and it happened with no media coverage and very little fanfare.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the surface, House Joint Resolution 76 looks harmless. The title of the bill claims that its purpose is “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The text gives the Commission the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System “without limitation” and without a warrant, for the purpose of “making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing.”

              I read your post and it is, in my opinion, a direct reflection of allowing non pizzagate related material into the sub. Allowing political posts into this sub has angered many and a lot of people don't like it. It has divided the community and none of this had to happen. It has gotten to a point that it needs to stop because it has fractured the community in a terribly destructive way.

              could stop it anytime he gets ready by going back to the RULES that say pizzagate material only in the pizzagate sub. I don't have a problem with

              personally but I think it has been proven that dragging Q, "the storm", etc...into this sub was dismal failure. Since it happened a lot of people have drifted away, include me now, because I don't pay as much attention to this sub as I once did, and its a direct result of the political posts, I can get those all over the web.

               If people are going to complain about things not getting done, arrests not happening fast enough, about what Trump did in regards to Israel, on rather or not he’s a Zionist, etc... then YES, things get political. I’ve never said it’s about republicans or democrats. McCain is a piece of crap. Many from BOTH sides are. But, if “pizzagate” is the result of sick satanic elites, including politicians, that are into raping, torturing and killing children, then politics is part of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why is it ok to post stuff about celebrities but not about somebody that involves politics? Why is it ok to post about blind items and rumors from that crazy days and nights site? Things are not black and white. You can’t fit pizzagate in a little box. It’s global and involves many. The elite involve politicians and the ones running our country are the ones making decisions. Those decisions effect everything.

            The problem with allowing government agents to demand identification from anyone they suspect might be an illegal immigrant—the current scheme being employed by the Trump administration to ferret out and cleanse the country of illegal immigrants—is that it lays the groundwork for a society in which you are required to identify yourself to anygovernment worker who demands it.

            <p>
             <strong>
              On October 20, 2017 Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13814 extending the state of emergency.
             </strong>
             Like all of the Presidents since 1933, Trump maintained the unconstitutional powers the state of emergency authorizes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under federal law, a national emergency declaration lasts for only one year, meaning that the 9/11 terrorist-threat national emergency has now been re-declared 16 times. And the number of agencies the White House has created to deal with the ‘national emergency’ has grown to over 600 – the worst and most insidious being the Department of Homeland Security.

            <p>
             While the United States Congress has struggled to pass legislation governing taxes and healthcare, it had no problem uniting on the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act—a bill that will ensure the U.S. continues to wage wars around the world, and that promises taxpayers will cover its costly expenses.

             The price tag on the latest NDAA is a massive $700 billion, which means that for every day in 2018, American taxpayers will spend nearly $2 billion on war.

             Still unknown to much of the U.S. population is the fact that they reside within a “Constitution-Free Zone,” as it has been dubbed by the ACLU for many years. In fact, it is estimated that 200 million people (2/3 of the populace) are likely to have their 4th Amendment protections completely disregarded by border patrol, as well as to encounter other routine violations unbecoming to a land of the free.

               , we’re fucked. The odds are pretty insurmountable and we haven’t a chance in hell. Do we give up now or just continue flogging the dead horse? I read yesterday and today that you stand for change, yet given the odds what can we realistically do? It’s depressing.

              I am not saying that we are fucked. What I am saying is that is is VITAL for us to have an accurate picture of what is going on so that we can come up with a creative and accurate narrative to expose and fight this. Anybody with half a keen eye can see that not only is Trump not fighting the deep state but is it's leader and integrally tied to it. People don't want to see that. All they have to do is look at what is actually happening instead of focusing on what they wish were happeing.

              Q has pretended that Soros and a bunch of people and intel agencies have already been neutralized and people are burning endless hours of valuable time distracted by it. Also people cannot fight what they cannot accurately see.

             <p>
              Q's basic message is "we got this, look how many bad guys we took down, we will handle it, you guys don't have to fight it anymore, sit tight watch us do this." Well bullshit. It is a psyop. Soros just got through heckling Trump in Davos when he is supposed to be locked up at Camp David.

                If you don't understand that Israel, funded by the Rothschilds, is the global seat and head of the satanic globalist movement, then I am not sure I can help you out. Kushner is Chabad. If you don't understand that Chabad is literally a fang of the Illumaniti snake then I can't help ya there either. If you are not making the connection between the Repblican Neo Con Zionists, Israel, and Luciferianism then I don't know what to say....

Q might be a Psyop, my concern was how we interact with new individuals coming here for answers regarding PizzaGate... Wanted to discuss that. Not the Middle East.

            Well...  Q and Corsi can both be in on it.  However, they are discussing a lot of the issues that we have been trying to get out there- pedophilia, ritual human sacrifice, cannibalism, etc.  That part is good, whether or not it is a larp.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not agree with some of the things that were posted, like SA (+++) being the top, then the Rothschilds (++), then Soros (+).  What about the Vatican/Jesuits?   Has Q mentioned the Vatican, Jesuits, or Pope?  I believe our tax money goes there.  Same with other countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Will Trump go after the Vatican and Jesuits?  Will Trump help stop these people from stealing our tax money?
           </p>
           <p>
            If the very, very top of the pyramid is not dealt with, then this is all for nothing.  My fear is that we will focus on the lower levels and stop there.  This cannot happen.  It is all or nothing.  If the top is left in place, then they will eventually regroup and try again.  They do not perceive time like we do.  They implement their agenda over time, and it can be 1 year, 10 years, or 100 years.  They do not care.  They just keep making progress over time.

              ran off most of the brilliant researchers by deleted work that took them years to learn and then many hours to research into a great post. Check out the deleted submissions. Some great stuff in there, stuff on par with the old days before Falcon ran off the researchers.

            TBH (Q=psy-op person here), the only thing that I really found useful that came from Q was him pointing out that some weird shit is going on in the Standard Hotel - confirmed by their website, their program, and the people who hang out there.

            I'd like the pizzagate sub to stay focused on pedophilia, not discussing memos, the whereabouts of Soros (who turned up really healthy looking in Davos) or other stuff not related to pizzagate.

            If their should be Q posts in the future who
            <em>

            It's painful for me to see that great researchers like you,

            invest so much time in Q research - but then, I accept it I guess. Still, I hope that you will re-focus on the core of pizzagate again on day.

             I live in Los Angeles. I've been to The Standard 10000x. It's a normal hotel. If there's some weird freaky shit going on in some rooms by individuals, I wouldn't be surprised, it's fucking Hollywood. It's a weird, creepy, perverted place. But the chain of Standard hotels does not have any weirdness going on other than some of their guests.

             There are very good and obvious reasons for keeping the "Q" community divided from the pizzagate community. If all the people united, then there would be no stopping us. It is unfortunate that it causes you PAIN that others are engaged with what is clearly, by far, the most hopeful and plausible phenomenon that all concerned with truth have had ever. It causes me pain to see the absolutely relentless subversion happening on the internet. The desperate flood of shilling that beset the Q threads on /pol/-- that didn't surprise me. It showed that the those in charge of controlling internet discourse wanted to discredit Q. To this day, anti-Q threads appear on /pol/ daily. What does that tell us? Do the shills that control the internet swarm on Q for no reason? Is there a plausible explanation for the shilling? But then how do we even entertain foolish claims about "LARPs"? That makes no sense.
I hope you can get over your pain. It does make sense that those that seek to control internet discourse would penetrate and insinuate themselves everywhere the truth is discussed. And will alway alway always push pretenses to divide.
So you're in PAIN because the community is not divided enough. But I expect pain will increase. Because all the dirty little tricks will keep failing. You can repeat the lies and scripted talking points over and over, but nobody is buying it. Hence the painfully awkward absurdity of your simulated PAIN.
Quite laughable.

               There is no ad hominem. Please don't use terminology improperly.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is a fact that divisions weaken the collective force of all those "seeking truth", as opposed to accepting mainstream beliefs. It is a fact that the pizzagate community, and the "Q" community both fall into the former category. It is a fact that Q is being relentlessly shilled against on every forum he is discussed on. It is a fact that Q is being propagandized in precisely the same manner as 'pizzagate' was, by getting labeled, attacked, and then quarantined.
              </p>
              <p>
               None of the preceding facts could possibly be called "ad hominem" in regard to you, as they are true entirely independent of you, nor do they bear on you in any specific way. They do, however, put your PAIN into context. Whereas you would appear to wish to restrict the context of consideration of your PAIN to some woozy realm of free-flowing objectivity, that realm doesn't exist. We are in an information war. Therefore, I have good reason to suspect that you are seeking to divide the community. I claim no more than that.

                It is a fact that people who follow Q are spreading the word and waking people up. I welcome ANYONE that wants to see change happen. Division is what the goal of the NWO. Whatever. I’m not wasting time on you.

             I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, even if Q turns out to be a LARP, I will STILL see this as positive because people are WAKING UP! I believe what Q has done, and continues to do, is what will break pizzagate wide open! It’s become an amazing movement of people that have gathered together and researched, formed bonds, have meme wars and support each other. You can meet someone new and we’re nice to each other because we realize we’re on the same team. We don’t tear each other apart. It doesn’t matter what race or religion you are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q has helped redpill so many people about pizzagate. It’s amazing. It’s beautiful to see people in 8chan with prayer requests and make memes that are patriotic. People have hope again. They are pumped. Everyone I’ve come across that follows Q also believes in pizzagate! If people don’t see how evil these sick elites are, then pizzagate will be looked at as nothing more than a conspiracy theory. When you don’t have strict rules and can spread everything, INCLUDING pizzagate, it opens people’s eyes and they see the whole picture.
            </p>
            <p>
             The negativity in the pizzagate sub is tearing this place apart. It doesn’t even feel like we’re on the same team anymore. People are divided and it’s like a competition on who can pick someone’s post apart the most. It’s all about JEWS JEWS JEWS. It gets old! Which Jews?! All the negativity is too much. It’s hard enough seeing and hearing about children being tortured daily. The last thing we need is to be torn apart here too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last time I posted something showing that there was a big child trafficking bust with a lot of arrests and children rescued, even tho it was on several legit news sites and spread all over social media, only pizzagate picked the story apart and said it must be fake. I just deleted it. Fuck it. Arguing with everyone isn’t helping kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s like people aren’t willing to accept that there ARE changes happening. A lot of good things are happening. But so many here choose to focus on Jews and call Trump a Zionist. Therefore, no matter what changes take place, even if they are fact, negative people will just say nothing is changing or it’s not happening fast enough. Until they see BIG arrests then forget it. Of all people, you all should know how hard it is when the deep state is against the president. He’s fought every step of the way. People can’t accept that this is a process. They put more effort in talking shit to anyone that supports Q that they don’t get anything else done except make people not even want to be here.
            </p>
            <p>
             At this rate, everyone is just going to lose hope if they are told daily that everything we’ve done for over a year has been for nothing. I’m working my ass off daily, I’m running a sub and just became a mod of another. I never thought I would do something like that. I’m not brave. I was nervous. But SOMETHING has to change. I’m researching, gathering, organizing and spreading. All while assholes find fault in almost everything here.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of my last posts on pizzagate was showing that an innocent search term resulted in child porn. Then I have some asshole tell me that the Jews made duckduckgo so don't use it. Wtf. People like that and all the negativity is tearing this place apart. I know people that are afraid to even post and have left. They are afraid to post or comment because people jump down their throat.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m not directing my irritation towards you

             . You are great. Even tho you haven’t followed Q, you’ve always been respectful. I appreciate that you thought of me. I’ll be around. I used to be here daily almost all day long. But I can’t deal with so much negativity.  Right now I have hope and I am working on doing my small part in the world trying to make a difference. I choose to be positive and do something. People like

              @are_we__sure
             </a>
             choose to not post anything of their own. Just pick others posts apart. “Sarah’s” daily shill posts stay up. Good posts are deleted. The shills are winning here. It’s really sad.

              I'm with y'all on this. It what it is. Q got a really thin, straight line he gotta walk, I hope he stays on it and don't get weird, as if giving any credit at all to the cracked out orangutan in office isn't weird or wise at all anyway but oh well lets see how many normies he can red-pill before the next phase of learning how evil trump and his cadre are. What can you do? Its gained too much traction.

                Laura, everyone knows you work for the CIA and everyone knows Duck Duck Go is used to search the dark web.

                If Sarah is mentally ill why do you bring her into every conversation. I think we all know why.

                You should try and develop a soul, i know the CIA have probably robbed you of your own but I am sure with time you can develop your own personality and stop sucking Roger Stone's dick, you infowars piece of shit.

              I can't post on the pizzagate board.   I can only reply.   The rules are such that anyone who doesn't follow the herd will lose the ability to post.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have my point of view, mainly nothing about the original pizzagate conspiracy stands up to logic and scrutiny.  I don't see concern for truth and that claims are supported by evidence as negative.  I'm not a fan of witch hunts.
             </p>
             <p>
              And because of that point of view, I'm accused of being a paid operative or a pedophile.  And if you're concerned for negativity, perhaps, you should make an objections when someone is called a kike kid fucker or told to eat a bag of diaper flavored dicks.

              To bracket the letters L D R supposedly referencing Lady de Rothschild just days before a private plane crashes INTO an airborne helicopter nearby the Rothschild's  estate is beyond coincidental.

              I can appreciate the uncertainty to connecting Q to these Voat pizzagate threads, but any attention whatsoever brought to bear upon these unspeakable atrocities is a step in the proper direction.

              Pizzagate sub is for pizza bread.  a massive pizza crust is being baked by some peculiar gourmet bakers.  The breads sticks in this place suck however.  Somebody cans the hot and fresh ones on the regular because they don't get enough seasoning or enough bake time or whatever.  That is very annoying.  Overall this is just a shitty pizza joint.  Sad because it's really the only one in town.  I think we all could go for a good crust but damn.  while you all work on that colossal thing let us have the hot fresh and sloppy breadsticks.  I mean why cant we have garlic bread too?  I understand keeping the cheesy breads to a min and nsfw'd but can we please mix it up in here and let us roll with what is fresh out of the oven once in a while?  I think most people agree with me on this.

                Yes  I promise it will Blow Your Mind.  From the 2nd link:  “I seen a large ditch being dug on the field. And then later that evening, right before dark, those two tractor trailers pulled in,” he said.  Then they guys got out, shut the doors and walked up the ramp.  The 50 foot hole was then filled in.

              .  For better or worse Q believer or not - if Q curiosity is what gets new members engaged then it raises the profile of PG and opens them up to what we DO know for fact- then all for the good of the cause.  I too am fed up of the negativity and admit that for the first time in all these months I find I have stayed away because of it.  I’ve hust in fact posted a DM to a member of some potential findings of my own - and your post has made me realise that this is me possibly putting out the ‘feelers’ before making my ideas and thoughts public for fear of being lambasted and slaughtered for having them.  You’re right. 
People get afraid to post because of the negativity and sometimes downright viciousness of some members.  And I’m no newbie, but I remember being nervous at the beginning - I shouldn’t have to be now, but find myself being cautious because of how this sub is going.  What the hell would a new member be feeling.  We’re on the same fucking team, surely. No?

               Yes thank you. I’ve already had people send me DM’s saying they are afraid to say something. I remember when I was new. I don’t blame some people for staying lurkers. Some people don’t have personalities that can deal with this. Especially if you’re made to feel like nothing you do is right or helpful.

              You need to stop bluepilling in here. If you're getting tired of hearing about the Jews, then you need to find a different line of investigation, because, if you had paid ANY ATTENTION AT ALL, you'd discover just how deep that fucking rabbit hole goes.
             </p>
             <p>
              If hearing about "Jews, Jews, Jews!"  gets old, then maybe it's because we are fucking
              <em>
               ON TO SOMETHING
              </em>
              . Now look, I'm going to try and break this down into tiny, edible chunks for you, and I want you to listen so that you don't have to make another blue/blackpill post, and look so stupid in doing it.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Which Jews?

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Most of them. Want me to be more specific? There are two main echelons of Jew behind this. The secular, and the mystic. The secular Jew is the one who takes part in the ownership of The United States' government, and popular culture (Hollywood). The Harvey Weinstein type of Jew. The John Podesta type of Jew. Now, while this type of Jew may or may not have a vested interest or fascination with Jewish Mysticism, he's probably not in active practice of Kabbalah.
             </p>
             <p>
              Speaking of Kabbalah, let's move on to the Mystic. Kabbalah is Jewish Mysticism. Yes. the Jews believe in Occult Magicks. No, Judaism is not as closely related to Christianity as you may have previously believed. In fact, what the Jews call Kabbalah, is what the Christians call
              <em>
               Satanism
              </em>
              . Yes, ma'am, this is where Satanism comes from. I can elaborate on that far more if you'd like, but I'm far more interested in laying down the basics of pizzagate, which you clearly don't understand in its full breadth, than delving into what I know about Kabbalah. Ask me about it in a reply if you want.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Why do Kabbalist Jews want the children?
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              As a sacrifice to Moloch, as a toll they must pay to gain more power. See, remember when I said that Christianity and Judaism aren't really derived from the same source? Judaism is an evolution of the prototypical Caananite religions, which focus on gods such as YHWH (Not the Christian God, but rather, El), Moloch (Their god of Fire), The four Ba'al dieties, et al. Kabbalah assumes that these gods are still active, and that you can negotiate with them, which is, in fact, the basis of the etymology of the word "Israel" (lit. "Wrestling/fighting with the gods/angels").
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               What does the Secular Jew get out of this?
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              On top of being a pawn for the Mystic, being able to carry out the Mystic's wishes in the world, the Secular Jew takes joy in sexually abusing/torturing the children, as they are more inclined to pleasures of the flesh, but it doesn't exactly stop there. If you've ever watched
              <em>
               Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
              </em>
              and
              <em>
               A Clockwork Orange
              </em>
              , you know what Adrenochrome is, and how it is derived. When someone is under a very high, nearly lethal level of stress (i.e. torture), Adrenochrome is released by the body, into the bloodstream. Adrenochrome is an insanely powerful psychostimulant, not unlike DMT. Where the Kabbalist gets his "spiritual events" through human sacrifice and intense meditation, the Secular can get it from taking Adrenochrome. You can liken this to taking Dimethyltriptamine, either by smoking it, or by taking Ayahuasca, to achieve the kind of "spiritual experience" that a Buddhist monk would get through years of meditation. Even in the Q posts this is referred to through the "A-head and Y-head" allegory.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              How does your appeal to emotion detract from the fact that Jews are behind this? Does your perception of "muh negativity" somehow make the Jews not responsible for the largest share of the world's human trafficking industry? You must live in some surreal world if your feelings take precedence over what is observed to be fact. Sure, there are indeed changes happening, and things are looking EVER SO SLIGHTLY brighter than they were a couple years ago. But does that mean I should sit on my hands and let things assume that everything is going to be alright?

             <p>
              Now this all sounds really fucked up and hokey, but hey, it's the kikes that buy the religious aspects of this shit, not me. All I want is for them to stop killing children.

               Most pedophiles are males too! Is that what we should say everyday? Or how about an age group? No because that includes millions of people. That means nothing! Narrow it down! So many people are sick of this. Maybe you should find some hate group sub. There are religions of every kind here. If you can’t deal with it, then hit the road Jack!

              Agreed. If Q is a LARP, it's the most useful LARP/ARG ever, because it's having an actual impact. I really don't care if it is or not, people are digging and meme:ing like crazy.

             <p>
              I know that many good researchers have left (I was a lurker from the beginning.) So lets try to create an environment where everybody feels respected.
             </p>
             <p>
              Everybody should be welcome, no matter whether he/she writes comments, posts links or does lengthy research posts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please realize that many people are lurking, and they, too, do a great job when they use the info here to redpill family and friends.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nobody should be dissed because he 'only writes comments' or 'only provides link posts'. Not everybody has the time to do research, all kind of contributions should be welcome. (Apart from the obvious shill posts, of course.)

               I’m not talking about lurkers. I know people have jobs and lives. I’m lucky enough to have more time. What irritates me are the ones that ARE here and do nothing but bitch and complain about others posts. Who find fault in anything and everything.

                I followed you?    LOL.  That's pretty amusing.    I read posts and if I want to respond I do.   I usually don't notice usernames unless someone has been nasty to me.

                 Yeah, you followed me to another sub! A new sub! Which means you at first would have had to be looking at my profile so you could see my posts. I must be a threat to you. I guess I’m on Brock’s list. Leave me alone.

                  No it would not have to be that.   I don't look at new subs on voat, I became aware of it because people on /pizzagate linked to it.  That's the only way I knew it existed.  I clicked on a link and then read the sub.

               - I totally understand what you've said. It's tough right now. The war is raging; this is certain. I am so hopeful for the future. As a human being, I was nearly broken, but the emergence of Q and what is happening now; it brought be back. I saw you, and others, just like you said ; saying prayers, making, searching, digging, encouraging, - trying to do something; anything. This is humanity, and what's happening right now is important. - Keep doing what you are doing. Don't worry about anything or anyone else. You're simply documenting what's happening, and you're doing a great job. I wouldn't ... I've been so glad and thankful to you. Yes, Q may end up being a LARP. He may end up being a hero. Either way, these past few weeks are shaping us all, and I agree. We are woke; for better or worse. - To follow this person (Q) who you're not even sure about, to seek this ...kind of torturous drama; every day. Hoping against hope that justice is finally being meted out properly. ... It takes a lot of courage and fortitude, and... just hang in there. I don't sweat the shills; constantly berating, talking down to others, causing chaos, insulting and misconstruing facts, trying to shut down logical discussion - The real here have never done these things. We are able to see each other clearly.

               Will dig tonight as much as I can.  thanks for the shout. I can't really do pizzagate though.  It's too much.  :(  the only contribution I could make to pizzagate is with a rifle an axe a gallows or a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  And that would be just the beginning. Even the idea of it makes me shake like a purple haired faggot on election day.  I will go down if I follow that dark road.  No doubt about it.

              We can all agree Podesta is scum, so why not question his response "I doesn't get any better than this" . He sounds like a man full of sarcasm. That statement struck me as massive sarcasm the first time I read it in wikileaks. He's just creepy.

              I know - it's a charming scene. The only even remotely distressing part of it is that they're eating pizza from paper plates and not using knives and forks. Maybe it's an American thing...

                 I like family reunion clips.  I like those dogs see their soldiers return from their deployments clips too.   NK is scary place, so I'm glad these Americans imprisoned there.
