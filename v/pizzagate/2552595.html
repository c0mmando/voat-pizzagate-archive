            The possession charges are all over but it's the making of the content that is the problem. And 50% of it is made in the U.S. (according to FBI) What the authorities are worried about is the "clear evidence of crimes" that comes from politicians and CEOs and other high profile people being seen in these videos. That's why the FBI imposes itself on all other countries with sharing networks, to suck up the proof of America's world leadership in this business and then "national security" is invoked to remove all traces of this from the record. So I am not that encouraged by arrests for possession. It probably means the person targetted possessed content that was problematic to important individuals (i.e. blackmail material).

            “As the trial established, Clarke collected child pornography at his home for years, using a peer-to-peer file sharing system that allowed others to download child pornography from him,” said U.S. Attorney Donoghue.  “When his crimes came to light, Clarke lied and attempted to hide behind his badge, claiming that he had accessed child pornography for his job as an investigator for the New York City Department of Correction.  This Office is committed to aggressively investigating and prosecuting consumers of child pornography.”
           </p>
           <p>
            According to court filings and evidence introduced at trial, over several years Clarke downloaded thousands of video files of the sexual abuse of pre-teen children, including sadistic material, which he kept on computer equipment in his home.  Clarke knew that these video files, some of which he watched repeatedly, also were available on his computers for others to download.   During a court-ordered search of his home on July 28, 2015, Clarke initially claimed that he was downloading child pornography in connection with his employment as a Correction Department investigator.  Clarke admitted at the time of the search that he was not authorized to access or download child pornography for his employment.  Clarke was arrested at the time of the search and subsequently fired from the Department of Correction after his conviction.
