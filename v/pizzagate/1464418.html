           We need a companion book for THE FRANKLIN COVERUP. I don't know if there are any writer types out there, I hope once enough material has been gathered, that some talented writer would catch this football and run with it. That person could combine enough material from The Franklin Coverup , the Craig Spence Call Boy Coverup and Pizzagate to get anyone to wretch.
