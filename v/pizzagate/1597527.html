<p>A little context about the island of Jersey.</p>
<p>Jersey: The richest offshore tax shelter of them all &quot;Among all the world’s offshore tax shelters – the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Gibraltar – the one at the top of the list is Jersey.&quot; &quot;Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, sits squarely in the driver’s seat, conservatively representing at least $5 billion a square mile.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2012/10/10/jersey-the-richest-offshore-tax-shelter-of-them-all/">http://fortune.com/2012/10/10/jersey-the-richest-offshore-tax-shelter-of-them-all/</a></p>
<p>&quot;A subsequent investigation exposed a history of sexual abuse at the orphanage, tainting the good name of the people of Jersey in the world\'s media. The list of suspects in the case included British government officials and—according to the detective who led the three-year child-abuse probe—media personality Jimmy Savile was also investigated by police, four years before the full extent of his crimes would eventually be exposed. The problem is, because Jersey is self-governing and has its own, slightly unorthodox court system, decades of possible crime against children in the orphanage may remain almost entirely hidden, unexamined, and untried. &quot;</p>

<p>There is MUCH more on Jersey if you look. My point here is that clearly Jersey is involved in nefarious activity. It was my suspicion that with the tax haven laws and history of child abuse cover ups it was a likely spot to hide money involved in this crime.</p>
<p>Everyone remember HSBC, the bank accused of money laundering for drug cartels? The same one in which FBI director Comey sits on the Board of Directors? Well they have intimate ties to the Clinton\'s as well. A subsidiary of HSBC called HSBC Expat is headquartered on Jersey, and HSBC comes up frequently in the Panama Papers.</p>

<p>That\'s when I found this.</p>
<p>&quot;Transactions linked to the Clinton Global Initiative have occurred in countries such as Panama, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, British Anguilla, the Bahamas, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Guernsey, Jersey, etc...&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article72215012.html">http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article72215012.html</a></p>
<p>I wanted to find these transactions.</p>
<p>So I kept digging.</p>
<p>&quot;One such connection is to Jean-Raymond Boulle, a one-time diamond miner from the volcanic island nation of Mauritius whose company was once based in Bill Clinton’s hometown of Hope, Ark. In the mid 1990s, Boulle was listed as a director of Auk Limited, a British Virgin Islands offshore company, and Gridco Limited, a Bahamas offshore company.&quot;</p>
<p>Auk Limited owned by Clinton associate Jean-Raymond Boulle.</p>

<p>So from there I searched the Panama Papers database for Auk Limited and found this.</p>
<p><a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10072989">https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10072989</a></p>
<p>Auk limited is registered in the country of Jersey.</p>
<p>I have no solid proof that these entities are involved in child trafficking however with all the other circumstantial evidence surrounding the DNC leaks, Clinton Foundation and the Country of Jersey, I would say this should be a focus of the investigation into this world wide epidemic. Please feel free to share this with other researchers. You\'re welcome Alphabets, its time to step up.</p>
<p>Edit: An important documentary on the subject for any skeptics or interested researchers, about corruption in Jersey. Called Sun Sea and Satan.</p>

            I have friends that live on Guernsey Island, close to Jersey. I've visited several times.
            <br/>
            Almost went to Jersey but you have to take a ferry and the waves were too big that week
Sark is another Chanel Islands and the locals on Guernsey have said that its still legal to beat your wife in Sark as long as you dont kill her.  Now, I do not know if its true.
           </p>
           <p>
            My next trip to visit Guernsey, I'm definitely taking a trip to Jersey.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've read this story and its very true and disturbing.  Sick sick sick

            This is the 3518 11st NW property also owned by JA, Pegasus is in the 3518 Rear property, which is basically the garage/building at the back of this blue house. Pegasus abuts the alleyway, and the blue house faces the street.

            And here's a close up of the statues outside the house on Jersey, featured in the Sun Sea and Satan documentary - sometimes the statues were clothed other times naked and in odd positions:

            Unbelievable documentary and devastating that the producers sister was murdered because of the film. He and the crew were being followed throughout their stay in Jersey. They also had their hotel room and belongings gone through as he talked about leaving tiny objects near the door when they left their hotel to see whether anyone had come in when they were out filming and, sure enough, they had. His sister was a victim of that terrible place. It should be renamed The Isle of Satanists, hence the satan statue in the pond. SICK pedophiles.

            Archive. Also The HSBC bank was exposed then brought to NY, Lynch to settle no charges. Comey installed as monitor by Obama, whistleblower goes to congress. Obama shuffles everyone again. Holder out.. Lycnch moved to A.G. Comey moved to FBI director.
HRC leaves office as SOS...Bennghazi.,,CF...

           <p>
            President Obama says I am proud my administration has had no scandals. Flies off on vacation leaving mass corruption. The FBI, the justice dept,, are embroiled in these horrible scandals,'the press failed the peopl and covered up the crimes, 
There are now 32 countries involved in the global war on terror.A massive crisis in Syria 300,000 dead. Check for yourselves.
Obama and HRC go to Tax havens and not only attack Pres. Trump, there is no contact no remorse, no words, no nothing.'There own Democratic operatics instead are caught plotting in CPP. Soros Caught funding 
organizations where riots happened and still happened.

            Jersey and shell companies caught my eye in your post title. I want to throw in some random connections for you because this also came up in the Hampstead case in London two years ago. Ricky Dearman, the father of the children was involved with a number of web based companies that on closer inspection looked like fronts for something else. We could never work out what, and most of his information has been scrubbed a long time ago. His companies were registered at an address at the infamous Hatton Garden in London (Office 36 88-90 Hatton Garden, London, EC1N 8PG). There is more information on his 'health' companies in one of the comments within this article:

           <p>
            The Hatton Garden robbery happened around this point in time.  And some of us who were researching the Hampstead case still wonder if there was a connection, as this address was one of the places for

            That documentary, is that the one where they discover the weird kids toys/ statues of little kids naked and in sexual positions outside a house, even though the house is just down the road from Haute de la Garenne, where all those children were abused and murdered?
           </p>
           <p>
            When I saw the weird statue outside the building that Alefantis owns, the one directly in front of Pegasus 'museum,' thats what it made me think of. Like this is how they signal they have kids available, or not available, or whether they have a girl or a boy etc. It's all so sick.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree that unearthing connections with Jersey and the pedophilia in the UK establishment is a good way to go, because at least some of that is now public knowledge, so connections to anyone involved in that will hopefully awaken people from their stupor.
