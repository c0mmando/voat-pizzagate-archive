<p>Here\'s a mother reporting what happened to her, when she saw social media messages between a local pedophile and her daughter on her daughter\'s phone.</p>
<p>1) She went to the police, they took her report, and for six weeks went dark on her. Just told her to leave it to them. They wouldn\'t keep her informed.</p>
<p>2) So finally she finds the guy is going for the brass ring and is trying to set up a meeting with their daughter.</p>
<p>3) She takes that to police, and they <strong>still</strong> won\'t commit to arresting the guy or protecting their daughter.</p>
<p>4) She decides she <strong>has</strong> to do something, so she decides to use her daughter\'s phone to set up a sting meet so she and her husband can stop  the guy themselves.</p>
<p>5) She asks the police once again to arrest the guy, and tells them what she is thinking of doing.</p>
<p>6) The cops tell her not to do it, and to &quot;let them handle it.&quot;</p>
<p>7) That\'s not good enough for the mom, they go ahead and capture the guy, call up the cops and they come and arrest both the guy <strong>and them</strong>.</p>
<p>The police then have the effrontery to issue a press release saying that nobody should take the law into their own hands.</p>

<p>Here\'s what it was like for a mom, though, facing her very own nightmare of a predator stalking her daughter, and being refused help:</p>

<p>Now before any American Pizzagaters get all smug, and start claiming that that\'s all you can expect from a deranged liberal madhouse like Canada, realize that\'s exactly what can happen in America too.</p>
<p>I\'ve already posted about what happened when a guy I know tried to report a pedophile blatantly advertising on Craigslist to the police:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2412061/12007726">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2412061/12007726</a></p>
<p>and here\'s the experience a woman had trying to report a person to the FBI:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1113557/thought-child-had-been-kidnapped">http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1113557/thought-child-had-been-kidnapped</a></p>
<p>I think the real problem is, that while there are some police officers who are motivated and who will take the crime of pedophilia seriously, and are motivated to do everything they can to protect parents and their children, <strong>there are far too many who are clock-punching time-servers who don\'t want parents and other non-police people to bug them and slow down them clearing their caseloads and paperwork</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>But let\'s talk about <strong>solutions</strong> now.</p>
<p>What should these parents in Canada have done to protect both their daughter <strong>and themselves</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>They should have gotten a lawyer involved</strong> as soon as they found the police ignoring their daughter\'s safety. (A take-no-prisoners, pitbull kind of lawyer who would be outraged by this kind of police misbehavior.)</p>
<p>A letter from an attorney to the police force\'s legal counsel, describing the misbehavior, and demanding positive action, would produce far more action than a frantic mother at the desk of a police station.</p>
<p>But then let\'s hypothesize that the police ignore the lawyer and the couple decides they have to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>After they had captured the predator, <strong>they should have called their lawyer and had him arrive to be with them before they called the police</strong>.</p>
<p>I can tell you from what I\'ve seen, the** police behave completely differently when they go to a house and a lawyer is present** than they do when a distraught couple is talking all over themselves and filming them with a personal smartphone.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>they should have been prepared by having a covert camera set up to film what happened separately from what the woman was doing with her smartphone</strong>.</p>
<p>It\'s just a given that the police will try to seize the smartphone from a person filming them. ( A lawyer can help prevent that, but not always.)</p>
<p>The smartphone, or a personal camera should be used as a decoy, so they think they got the embarrassing materials, and so they won\'t do an extensive search for the camera that\'s <strong>really</strong> recording the evidence. (Note also, that having a lawyer present means that they would have a much harder time getting approval to tear the place up without a warrant.)</p>
<p>Another place a lawyer can help is by pre-emptively taking the story to the media. Local news stations won\'t often publicize the case of an aggrieved &quot;Average Joe&quot; until after the injustice has happened, but a media-wise lawyer has more credibility to talk to reporters about how police inaction is endangering a child.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOTE: It\'s the same when a parent is under threat from the CPS</strong>. Every family lawyer I know and have read online says:</p>
<p>1) Get a lawyer right away</p>
<p>2) Record everything</p>
<p>3) Don\'t let the CPS people know that they are being recorded</p>
<p>This is easy for so-called one-party consent states, You definitely need a lawyer\'s advice about how to proceed in a &quot;two-party consent&quot; state, though.</p>',

           now.
          </p>
          <p>
           What should these parents in Canada have done to protect both their daughter

            It was a pretty tough lesson to learn but in reality, we can't expect action from this FBI until much later, perhaps if Trump ever drains the swamp, which has become questionable. This is why the second amendment is important, and why home school is a much safer plan these days. Keep your kids safe any way you can and don't expect the police to help you!
           </p>
           <p>
            The double edged sword is that if you don't report it you can get in trouble, so perhaps parents should just make a paper trail, copy all of their correspondence to multiple agencies or authorities, etc. I bet you could get a few free consultations from attorneys willing to sue the police for civil rights violations under section 1983 of the U.S. Code, and official oppression, which is what this is.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my jurisdiction you have a 6 month statute of limitations to do that. You guys in Canada need to consult with someone about that.

            Good luck getting anyone from the police or FBI to do anything about pedophiles. Try it and you might get assaulted by someone on the force or in the secret CIA gestapo. When you have proof of real crimes, and go to the police, unless the crime is something EXTREMELY easy for them to bust, they normally don't care. They're way more keen on doing traffic stops for DWI or speeding, or busting people for pot. You pretty much have to have a lot of money involved in a mortgage scheme or fraud scheme that is worth seizing or a bunch of drugs worth stealing for the cops to do anything. They don't care about most pedophiles, and besides, they will only arrest them if they can be used as informants and errand boys to do the trafficking that the elites need. Perhaps this pedophile was already doing his job and was going to keep his mouth shut so they were determined to leave him alone.

            , can you please add a line to your OP stating that this cops refusing to investigate pedos is directly related to elite child sex abuse because corrupt law enforcement suppresses reporting, making all child trafficking easier? I'm giving you the flair so you can edit. Please reply to my comment afterward, and I will remove the flair.

            WHOAH, I am the most openly anti-Canuck person here, and I would never. This is the kind of stuff that led me here. Sarasota police are corrupt, and so is North Port. I am not sure if it is top down though. From what I have gathered, they operate in actual gangs. Like getting other guys hired.

            Last year a mother in England ran away with her son's because a judge would not take her evidence of sexual abuse by their father seriously. They removed the boys from her and she still does not have them back.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were lots of similarities with the Hampstead children. The judge also sits on the board of  foster agency.

            I have never had enough excess money to hire an attorney to come hang out at my house and write letters to the police department. I suppose some people do, but for many this isn't really a workable solution.

             That is what I thought then, and later I found out I was a two legged idiot. I could have got the Oriental kid from across the street to video and Audio everything we needed circumstantially, for free, to get a raid. I really did not want a raid on my own house. Who in the heck would, if not for a cause? Nowadays you can do that with that toy the kids play around with all day, and are going blind from.

               It was a room mate who we all suspected of being a child molester, I went to a cop that lived in the neighborhood and he said "those cases are hard to prosecute." Went to the command, and the guy at the desk took a license plate# and did nothing. This was pre computer for me, and I still have regrets about what I should have done. Smart phone is what I was referencing at the end.

             That means that screwing a 14 y.o. is child-molesting, dolt.

             Did a bad man "touch" you when you were a little boy?  Tough.  You're a pedo now and no longer have our sympathy.

             I'm guessing that the way things are going, the pedophilia defenders on such message boards everywhere are not only being tracked, but will be confronted at some point.  You aren't as anonymous as you think.

              You're an actual card carrying moron.  A 14 year old girl does not go to a pediatrician and being attracted to her isn't pedophilia.  The definition of the word implies she is pre pubescent not a sexually active teenager.  Moron!
