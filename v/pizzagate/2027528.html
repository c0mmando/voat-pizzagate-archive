<p>Hacker Can Send Fatal Dose to Hospital Drug Pumps
Email-ID

<p>When security researcher Billy Rios reported earlier this year that he’d found vulnerabilities
in a popular drug infusion pump that would allow a hacker to raise the 
dosage limit on medication delivered to patients, there was little cause
for concern.
Now Rios says he’s found the more serious vulnerabilities in several models of pumps made by the same manufacturer, which would allow a hacker to surreptitiously and remotely change the amount of drugs administered to a patient.
“This is the first time we know we can change the dosage,” Rios told WIRED.
The vulnerabilities are known to affect at least five models of drug 
infusion pumps made by  <strong>Hospira</strong>—an Illinois firm with more than 400,000 
intravenous drug pumps installed in hospitals around the world.
The vulnerable models include the company’s standard PCA LifeCare 
pumps; its PCA3 LifeCare and PCA5 LifeCare pumps; its Symbiq line of 
pumps, which Hospira stopped selling in 2013 due to concerns raised by the FDA over other quality and safety issues with the pumps; and its Plum A+ model of pumps. Hospira has at least 325,000 of the latter model alone installed in hospitals worldwide.
These are the systems that Rios knows are vulnerable because he’s 
tested them. But he suspects that the company’s Plum A+3 and its 
Sapphire and SapphirePlus models are equally vulnerable too. 
Hospira did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

            All of this based on the assumption Seth is really dead which so far has not been proven and in fact from what is 'known' proves he didn't die and this is a psyop.  If it is a psyop the 'producers' must be amused to no end while the debate of who killed Seth Rich rolls along.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not much different than the where is Julian, is he doa, tortured, cloned etc.  This still drags on in various alterations from the original wag the Julian.  Julian is controlled opposition.  I wanted him to be the real deal and overlooked his stance on 9/11.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not going to fall into the same delusion about Seth.

            This is not by any means a new thing as far as hacking goes. I don't know the numbers but it is estimated that the wannacrypt attacks that happened about a month or so ago likely killed people as well. The UK health care was hit particularly hard. When you have people in critical condition who depend on some of those machines to survive and all of a sudden those devices are locked with encryption well, you see how it happens.

              They were phished as verified wikileaks emails prove. If he knew about PG and only gave us coded emails hes the worst leaker ever.  He was a butthurt Bernie bro socialist jew and his death means little to me.

               Why would Seth Rich have maintained/established access writes of any sort to Podesta's email account without having used phishing tactics?

              <p>
               This would more likely than not be the case if there was double-factor authentication (such as through a VPN server for the DNC).

                Wtf are you talking about.  I assume that everyone else assumes that he got access due to his DNC job. Anyone could have phished them.
               </p>
               <p>
                You shouldnt want him to be the Podesta leaker; he didnt expose PG.  You can fantasize about him assuming someone would notice the pizza codewords and being a martyr, but thats pretty gay, and supremely unlikely given Richs known loyalty to the foreign state running PG.

                 I 100% agree with you in terms of the martyrdom aspect. In my opinion - in a world where Seth was in fact the leaker then he had no clue the extent to which the emails would go on to detail PG. Along that same line of thinking tho is that if he was the leaker how the fuck would he have any time to do subsequent investigation on any of this when he had to spend all his time avoiding the Clinton death squad (for lack of a better term).
                </p>
                <p>
                 My other point holds consistent tho but I do understand your train of thought too. My thoughts are that a staffer would not have had direct access to Podesta's emails simply for working in the DNC in the capacity he was in. I'd assume only Podesta's and his top staff (maybe solely his secretary) would typically have access.

            I work in a hospital and am around a lot of these types of pumps. Can confirm that many have wireless connectivity to receive software updates, and interface with other equipment.  When I am at work with my laptop, I can see these pumps when I try to connect to wireless.  I can also state that hospitals are not that secure...when you see a keypad odds are 12345 or the department phone number will open it.  I'd wager they didn't take default passwords off these pumps either.

            If I recall correctly the hospital staff acted shady as fuck. While this is definitely possible, I think the more likely scenario was they just let him die.

              Ya I think this is very good info to get out there - the masses have no clue the abilities of our intelligence services or the scope of what they use if for.

              As I previously stated I don't think this is necessarily pertinent to Seth Rich situation (as I have yet to come across any definitive proof in this respect) BUT with that said I'd be shocked if this has yet to be used against PG "whistleblowers" of sorts over the years.

              Thanks for letting us know about this.  Sometimes we have to get creative when trying to get news out.  This is shocking news.
