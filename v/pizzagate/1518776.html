They didn\'t sing some of the written lyrics, but what they added is most interesting, at 2:53 the added lyrics are (did wa-diddy know how must I live, when the ma ra presidents all dead,  going into town just to get ahead when you know by the wheat field miss wa\'s dead,  cream grease) (instead of green grease) and at 4:42 the added lyrics are (can you erase a small blouse,....up they turn our duracell, this light is getting brighter, what diference made the plastic).
Brock Omar Brunson is the singer for this version of The Apes band. It was easy for me to find his location on the west coast now. Probably law enforcement should question him on the lyrics and on any other murders he may know about, for instance near the river that youtube user kempa8 uses in his video uploads. Can anyone save the videos kempa8 has uploaded?  He has already deleted a creepy video of a little girl playing in a playground  by herself (posted just a month ago after not posting anything for 7 years) Also a friend of Kempa8, named Amon, who did the music that kempa8 added the video for can be located here,  <a href="http://www.subvertcentral.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?tid=41938&amp;highlight=world">http://www.subvertcentral.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?tid=41938&amp;highlight=world</a></p>',

           Some detectives have indicated biker involvement in human trafficing, so I think this belongs in the pizzagate thread, especially since Amanda Kleinman is in this band.
