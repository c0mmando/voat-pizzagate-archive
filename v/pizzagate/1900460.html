<p>In last x days GW has claimed to have solved the murder of shannon gilbert in LI, the two teenage girls in iowa i think, Johnny Gosh and several others.  Without any evidence he just spouts this is what happened and why and by whom.   
</p>
<p>Stuff like this should be enough to give anyone some pause.   On Seth Rich he has been all over the place.  Claiming he wad drugged, shot by the fbi, his organs were harvested etc.  He claims SR was working with Jones, Ratner and Gavin from Wikileaks.   He claims  IC were monitoring Jones and Ratner  and killed them because they were passing on info for WL.  He claims that Gavin, Assange best friend, realized that Jones and Ratner had been ID, and so sent someone to meet with SR in person and get the information.   Wait, what???  WL and Gavin were sending leaked info over the internet and only after Jones and Rattner are killed do they figure out communicating via the web is not safe.  He claimed SR and Shaun lucas were friends.  It was SR info that he gave to SL that led to DNC lawsuit.  That SR was going to be the star witness.  Finally, he talked to jared who filed the DNC suit. Jared basically told GW that they didn\'t even know SL and they just happen to use a process server that SL worked.  You would think that would give GW some pause, but no he comes roaring back with fbi shot SR, fake parents signed docs agreeing to give up his organs, and Dr S did the harvesting.</p>
<p>GW claims that Robert Muller the special counsel has declared state secrets on SR case.  He claims the FBi shot him, although today he suggested that was done through using a patsy.  He claimed KimD and Guc2 were working for Donald Trump.   He provides no evidence to back this up.  He keeps going on about metadata but then just spews stuff. He pretends to have connections with IC around the world, but I think it is very suspect.  
</p>
<p>Today he did crazy videos saying he was about to be taken out. He was going to flee to the russian embassy.  He claimed that a guy who was meeting him at his hotel had been intercepted, when the guy posted GW gave him the wrong address.  Now he is driving around meeting with Jerome  Corsi etc.    
</p>
<p>I think people need to exercise caution and think before endorsing GW theories as facts.</p>',

            George Webb reminds me of Alex Jones. They say stuff that we know are true, then something ridiculous like "they are all psychic vampires" and of course some bullshit we wished where true. Is it an intentional attempt at discrediting us or is this just what happens when independent journalism is only done by the particularly enthusiastic Joe's on youtube?

            I missed the first 54 days of 'Where is Eric Braverman', but have kept up from day 55. My take early on is that his goal was to take out the Clinton Foundation (CGI)-a good thing-but not for the public good. The Clintons' rise to power had created an imbalance between crime families. The Clintons went with oil (the Rockefellers). And banking (the Rothschilds) after seeing Hillary's private army take out Libya and almost Syria, needed to slow that down or annihilate it. George Webb is doing the work of the bankers.

            I was following George Webb Sweigert when he deleted his first 50 or videos from YouTube, long before most people knew who he was, I actually have a copy of some of those deleted videos. In some of his first videos he truly comes off as a slightly deranged Paranoid / schizophrenic, claiming that the government is tailing him, etc
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought his research was interesting, but too disorganized, and IMHO, he came off as some kind of Bipolar dude who starts making crazy connections and patterns out of nowhere.
I have lived with bipolar roomates and i known what they are like when they are in their "highs" and George fits the pattern.
           </p>
           <p>
            I started to get serious doubts about him when he started taking roads trips (i wonder who's financing those?) and saw him in a Long Island Jewish cemetery whining about the Jew rosenberg spies.. and i thought..only a hardcore zionist would worry about those two traitors..
           </p>
           <p>
            I realized George Sweigert was a phony when i saw him making claims he had cracked the Seth Rich case when he named Alpha Jalloh as the Seth Rich killer. 
The funny thing is that this "killer" had been named almost a year ago at
            <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm">
             http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm
            </a>
            Some of the stuff he was parroting on the video came straight off www.whatdoesitmean.com.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow.. some deep research, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, when he took credit for his "discovery", he never named the source of the info, only the name of the "russian intelligence agency", which sounds a lot cooler, than some cheesy website, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing this genius didn't investigate, is that there are at least two differently-aged criminals named Alpha Jalloh, one from NY, the other from Newark NJ.
Any of these two could be the ones that got caught in Washington DC.
           </p>
           <p>

            If the younger Alpha Jalloh was the one caught in DC, (not the one involved with the car theft operation), that means the other AJ from NY, the one that is supposedly an FBI informant linked to the DNC, is probably still locked in jail, and has nothing to do with Seth Rich.
           </p>
           <p>
            To conclude this, i can truly say, George Webb is a phony zionist disinfo agent, who has accomplished nothing, other than to steal research and fake news from various sources.. and claimed credit for them.

            Part of the whole "Discredit the Truth" psy-op is to flood the population with so many fake events and lies that when actual truth is there, most people will be unable to recognize it.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many people who are tagging GWS as fake, have pulled apart all the fake events / shootings et cetera.. ? No, they believe in Orlando and Bataclan, but think Webb is fake. They have yet to discover the "planes" on TV on "9/11" were digital artifacts, yet they claim they know GWS information is dis-info because he admits he's a Jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet GWS comes out with much more good info than that appears on this board. And I could make a list of that if I'm ever so moved.
           </p>
           <p>
            They claim he's bad because he changes his viewpoints. That's when I realize no one here has actually done research? Because if they had they would know how the process works. They are just used to getting from "on High" i.e. knowledge from authority .
           </p>
           <p>
            Is that why there is the emphasis on the undifferentiated "sources" here; in order to get one's post published and free from deletion?  Is an article from the NYTimes a good source? I guess it would count as one here?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also what is said among TVFakery researchers, FWIW, is
           </p>
           <p>
            "why do they [ the perps ] keep on lying even when they might not have to?"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Because unless it's a lie, no one will believe it"
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words the population is so acclimated to lies; they wouldn't know the truth if it bit them in the ass and stood right in front of them. And if the Perp Media told some little  truth; they'd be called liars and would be disbelieved  ; since the folks wouldn't know what it tasted like and would spit it out - as what's happening here with the GWS info / travelogue.
           </p>
           <p>
            WEBre gave the keynote address at the Madison conference on "unacceptable" 9/11 theory; WEBre promotes "Galactic Federation" material.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did WEBre give a better speech on the subject than , could have, anyone else there?; Dr. Judy Wood, whatever?
           </p>
           <p>
            !
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and Webre is connected to Alephanits and likely Podesta - does that mean his speech was bad at the 9/11 conference? No, not at all. It was very excellent
           </p>
           <p>
            [However, You should witness the fellow now - freaking out about Trump and the Russians. psht. ]
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because someone works for Intel doesn't mean all their work is bad; quite the contrary. [some here would use the example of "Jones" - "He's helped many people see the truth. blah blah blah"]
           </p>
           <p>
            Because the best educated and most talented work for the State Apparatus
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately for them, the shills they send over here, though they may be good, have a limited palette since they are proffering lies and confusion to a board where most present are questioners and skeptics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the Sophist - icated trickery is easily pulled apart once it's tagged.
           </p>
           <p>
            People tag GWS as fake. Some of the tells which tag him as such, in their mind, are less than convincing to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Steele is a total fake, and many people here swear by him; same with "Jones"
           </p>
           <p>
            GWS admits straight out he is getting info, much help, from the Mossad Network, and is himself Mossad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously these other "Truth Idols" also are working for someone, but as long as they don't admit it people can fool themselves into the delusion that the others are totally clean?
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider this: Isn't it likely that without Institutional help our research will be ZIP in 50 years? or 500 ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone here know how to start a movement which will be free from infiltration? 
Think about it: Those who created this site are unable to even create a BBS site free of that..!

              The more little details people *think they know , when they don't, the less likely it is for the true methods to be discovered. 
They hit us very hard. The man who wrote the research above died of fast , 2 - 3 weeks cancer, 7 years ago .

            Wow, the good Mossad. However revealing that may be, I am tired of the PG community saying that GW has not covered this. He did extensive work on Haiti, Dyncorp, and human trafficking. He exposes the Hill-Billy CF, I think he gave us a lot of useful connections. If that info is incorrect, or misleading, or misdirection, I don't know. He said early on that he is a Zionist. I am strongly opposed to that world view, but it doesn't make the info invalid. A limited hangout is better than no hangout. I can still learn from people I disagree with.

Trial looms as judge denies FBI request to keep 9/11 records secret for privacy reasons
Filed under 9/11, A1 TOP STORY, FBI{5 COMMENTS}
           </p>
           <p>
            New York World Trade Center’s North Tower ablaze on Sept. 11, 2001
In a ruling that could lead to the release of significant new information about 9/11, including details about who funded the al Qaeda terrorist attacks, a Miami federal judge has rejected FBI assertions that many records should be kept secret due to privacy considerations.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the same time, U.S. District Court Judge Cecilia Altonaga granted summary judgment in the FBI’s favor regarding more than 1,000 pages of classified records it withheld from public view citing national security and other exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Those records, about which little is known, will remain secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            A trial could be needed to resolve outstanding issues in the case, the judge said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Florida Bulldog’s parent, Broward Bulldog Inc., sued the FBI last June seeking records of the 9/11 Review Commission kept by the FBI. The commission, whose most prominent member was Reagan-era Attorney General Ed Meese, was authorized by Congress to take an “external” look at the FBI’s post-9/11 performance and to evaluate new evidence. Instead, Meese and two other members were chosen, paid and spoon-fed information by the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among other things, Judge Altonaga analyzed the legality of FBI redactions in 28 partially declassified documents that were disputed by the Bulldog’s attorneys. Again and again, she declared as “unconvincing” FBI arguments asserting a need to veil the names of agents, suspects and others for privacy reasons – specifically citing FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(c).
           </p>
           <p>
            “Release of this information could further the public interest in learning about the September 11 attacks and may outweigh any privacy interest individuals mentioned in the document may have,” she wrote. You can read her order here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miami attorney Thomas Julin represents Florida Bulldog. “The FBI must stop being so secretive about the events of 9/11,” he said. “Excessive assertion of privacy is harming national security. The next FBI director should put a stop to this.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s what the judge had to say about numerous privacy deletions made to an Oct. 5, 2012 FBI memo about an active but previously unknown investigation by New York authorities, who were actively looking to indict an unidentified suspect with providing material support for the 9/11 hijackers:
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘Significant public interest’
           </p>
           <p>
            “Plaintiffs have identified the significant public interest in information about who may have been involved in the September 11 attacks…Given the significant public interest in learning about possible suspects involved in the attacks, the FBI has not met its burden of showing Exemptions 6 and 7(c) apply to the selectively redacted names.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The October 2012 document was also censored for national security and other reasons. Those redactions were upheld by Altonaga and will not be made public. Also not to be released: draft copies of the 9/11 Review Commission’s final report, which was released in March 2015.

            I just need to solve this ratline thing, wait I just need to solve this Awan thing, wait I just need to solve this Seth Rich murder. Deletes ratline videos, all tweets, goes from youtube to Periscope. I can't believe I drank the Koolaid for 6 months. It is crystal clear for me now. The time spent trying to get and parse data to try to use it is lost with all the switching to a new investigation to pursue. Once you find lies it is inpossible to determine what is truth. Meanwhile we have been missing net nuetrality, the Obama surveillance issue, DNC major $300 million lawsuit.

             LOL that is how it goes.  I do think the research put together on the awans was great and it really had the potential to expose a ton of corruption.  I think it will now be burried under all the crazy stuff he is saying.  I think today he is planning to solve eric braveman's run to the russian embassy and prove soccha fall russian intel reports are really data.

            Jason Goodman is trashing Voat on their new move to periscope. They finally opened up the comments and when one flew by about VOAT shills he replied oh yeah the "genius's" on Voat. Alot of anti jewish comments. George does the suave rico good and bad cop then says you can go to another channel. The attitude and disgust he had came right through. They are slowly destroying interaction and comment trails. People are starting to politely wonder on Webb's channel.

            I still think he needs to be looked into for the Libby/Abby rape and murders. The pic Libby took of the guy on the bridge, that guy is a big man. George put out details only a killer would know. He's either lying about it, which makes him a sick individual or he's involved somehow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same with Jon Benet. Same with victims of Long Island Serial Killer. Webb gave out details only the killer would know. All of those victims killed with a garrote or strangled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sent his vids on Libby/Abby to the FBI tipline for their murders. If he's lying about the intimate details, they will know and it wont matter. If he's not, they may have some questions for him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless, he's done damage to all those legitimately looking into these things by the "running from the killers" act yesterday.....which may have been his purpose all along...to cast the tinfoil label on those who are really trying to investigate pizza/pedogate and Seth Rich.

             I agree with you.  At first I couldn't believe the details he was giving about the various murders and was shocked.  Heck if what he was saying was true it should open up all the investigations.  Later on I came to realize he never offered any facts to back up his claims, so for all I know he just made stuff up.

             He was told to stay away from PG and 9/11; but if his exposure of the ratlines come out, which it may or may not, there will be a "sea change" and the 9/11 will be exposed too. Truth is: many of us have thought the 9/11 was meant to be exposed at some point ; to destroy the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the first funding of the "Truth Movement" came from Adnan Kassogi. So wrap your mind around that one.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently the notion came to me that the original event in NYC to jump start the "9/11 Truth Movement" was like a controlled release bomb - so the perps could see exactly where it was going, who was involved and could monitor it; Like a forest fire that's kept at a certain low level to be certain , later, there would never be a conflagration.

            You reminded me about Alex Jones - Pierce Morgan 2nd ammendment debate on CNN (when he made an absolute ass of himself - on purpose?) and how Alex was being followed by men in black in the dark corridors of the Orwellian media eddifice and how he feared for his life. His fans bought it!

            Dr Of Common sense is more legit than Webb. Less than a month after TS Williams exposed Comey &amp; his Howdy Doody obsession, Comey was fired by Trump. Now here is the thing - we as citizens of good will have intrinsic affinity toward vibes that tell us about the intent of the messenger. For instance I have zero doubts about Honeybee and perhaps .05 % doubt about Dr Common Sense with regards to Pedophilia. When it comes to the likes of Webb and Steele those doubts go up a notch. 'Can never trust a spook' line rings true. So I agree - Webb's info should be posted with the phrase 'proceed with caution.' He is a limited hangout. Still better than Fake Jones.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS Just take a look at Alex Jones Christmas Special (few years back) when he has a 'break down' live - sobbing and crying about the children that are being molested and tortured by the powe elites (evil losers - thnx Donald) and when Pizzagate breaks Alex does 180 and shows his true colours., All talk and no action. Pied piper - takes you around in circles.

              He aint the prosecutor. This is why many haven't jumped on the shade campaign. He's made jumps like a mother fucker concerning the evidence and testimony he's accumulated, but who gives a fuck what he thinks, or more importantly says , when it comes to prosecution since he has no power to do so. Also, Guy says a lot of cheeky shit. Still he's given  more dots to work with than the majority of those here, esp lately.

            Meh, you either give him your attention or don't. Dude's putting on a show, and we all knew he was some sort of intel op from the beginning. He's also said he  was jewish early on and that he roots, root, roots for the home team. He's said some very relevant and verifiable things, and some not so. The idea he's a discrediting force when you're working within the realm of SRA and the occult, well, I don't know about that. He gave you a narrative that maps out utility, you know, makes it less about proving Moloch exists, which is not such an easy task. Whateves tho, do what you will (quoting Rabelais not crowley). One more thing, his "working theory" is that Kissinger mossad wants Pence. He on the surface does not. Me, not a trump voter, but don't want pence either, so maybe consider the enemy of your enemy is maybe not a friend but an enemy with utility.

            The George Webb thing just wreaks of disinformation. It's divide and dilute tactics. Already half the people here are either "with him or against him." I say fuck that, they all need to be brought down. And no amount of Webb filming his computer screen garble and waving his hands around point is going to convince me that fucking Podesta doesn't need to hang.

            While we are at it, I still think WikiLeaks was compromised at the end of last year.  That would explain them endorsing a guy who has claimed to be a Zionist and that Bill Clinton is a "great guy."
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to mention changing his video titles from "Where is Eric Braverman" to "Killing is Good Business," and seeming to enjoy saying it more than the average person would, knowing the implications of the statement.

            That's cause of the PDF. Every post with a PDF gets flared.
           </p>
           <p>
            How to remove the flare - take the archive link that someone posted. Edit your post to remove the PDF link and add the archive link.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then ping @ sensitive (@ and their name without the spaces) , and ask them to remove the flare as you've replaced the PDF.

            It should also be noted that several dozen of his early videos disappeared. Was this just him generating attention? We need to fully understand who he is so that we can understand fully the value of his information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless of whether or not he is just some guy spinning wheels, ex-mossad, or anything else...just like reddit or voat, there may be valuable insights. His insights may also be purely theoretical, but focused in the right place and there is some value to that so long as we employ critical thinking and feel confident diverging where evidence suggests we diverge.

             It's in the still YT video (last before Periscope), of the recorded call when he was talking to his film guy, I think from the hotel.

              He admitted to deleting them himself? Interesting. I started watching right when they were deleted and he claimed he was trying to find copies and also work with somebody who was transcribing the early ones. Wow. Okay, that tanks my trust level.

               Yep, I recall people here talking about that although I wasn't following him. It's in the call where he's rambling, in that call he also said he's working for old Mossad. Here goes -

             What nerve is he hitting??   Periscope is not great.  GW totally made up he was going to betaken out this morning?  If it were true do you think he would just be driving around after.  The people who were after him would just back off.   I challenge you to post any evidence GW has presented for his most recent claims, and there have been many.   Sad part is he has been given great research especially around the Awans

              Finally someone else mentions this. The big black guy with cornrolls and a black "bag" in the hotel elevator with a guy that ate way too much pasta..He had people scared shitless calling the hotel and trying to find his address even called the Russian embassy where he said he had to get rushed to, but that was a farce which he explained later as to show us how Braverman must have felt. Followers were generally scared for hours.

            There does seem to be a big push right now to conflate and confuse two separate issues: one being the Dem candidates voter data breach and the other being the Seth Rich murder. It's weird to have so so many scandals, mini or major, that they start to blend together.

            I'm beginning to think that George is a  schizoid with a very high IQ or suffers from a similar mental illness or maybe this work has driven him into mental illness.  Assange and others who sing his praises may not be watching him on a daily basis. They watch a handful of videos and come away duly impressed by  the dot to dot connections he makes, his use of spy craft lingo, his command of historical antecedents, etc. Only if you watch him continuously and are yourself well versed in the subject matter will you see that he's a smooth operator unleashing a torrent of bullshit.  Use him for leads and verify everything that interests you and  discard the rest.

             I totally agree.
I actually have a copy of some of those deleted videos. In some of his first videos he truly comes off as a slightly deranged Paranoid / schizophrenic, claiming that the government is tailing him, etc
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought his research was interesting, but too disorganized, and IMHO, he came off as some kind of Bipolar dude who starts making crazy connections and patterns out of nowhere.
I have lived with bipolar roomates and i known what they are like when they are in their "highs" and George fits the pattern.

             To convenient an explanation.  I wanted to believe Julian did a 180 after being tossed under the bus...but nah.  Too many flags with him, cgi interviews, no window peeps for months while ppl discussed his dead/alive scenario.  And it's rather convenient that the podesta emails were dropped a month before the election.  It 'could' look like Julian was working various deals to walk out of the embassy and things just aren't quite working out.  He has an agenda, he sits on more info than we see.  Depends on how he decides to use it.  I mean really, look at the Clinton body count.  Julian orders take out from regular favorites.  At any time in the last 5 years he could have been taken out.  Plausible to sheeple bc the story floats he is in ill health.  Why no selfies with Pamela?  There are major inconsistencies surrounding Julian.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kim...he built mega and thought that by turning in his competitors for illegal content would keep him safe.  Whatever else he was involved in riled the Clinton's and I seriously doubt it was for illegal file sharing.  The term via charges money laundering...so who was he laundering for and how much of it tied to the CF?  What about child porn and how many of the deep state were either hacked or used his services?

              Assange is an absoulte Spook. But with Assange they give him the pass.. Why? He was promoted by the Mass Media, so brain -dead people who watch the Tube and follow the Mainstream sewage , believe Assange is more real. [than Sweigart" ]  Assange aslo has a name assigned by MKULTRA.. ASS ANGE , he was allegedly on the run from a child trafficking cult.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, Assange doesn't look well now, as he came out on the balcony for a scripted sentence, which sounded robotic.. So who is under the MkULTRA?

              Disinfo, in that Seaman never really did his own research. Many times, Seaman would repeat info already out on Twitter, Reditt, Voat ect...
Nothing new was ever revealed by Seaman.

               And Seaman kept on ranting how the spooks were after him, sighting unmarked car parked by his appartment.

              <p>
               To Seaman's credit - he kept the Pizzagate alive when it was about to be swept under the rug so kudos to him. Give credit where credit is due - which is a lot more than I can say about Fake Jones who appologized to American Psycho just 1 day before thev PG march. Absolute scum.

                We were never going to allow it to be swept under the rug. Voat didn't allow that, Seaman had zero impact on our resolve. He sent his shills here to post threads with 'URGENT, David Seaman has benn poisoned!". He makes everything about im. He is about the "buzz". After saying he was afraid for his life, he next shows a video of himself at the Super Bowl. I detest the perpetual phony zionist hack.

               That's not the correct definition of disinfo. He gave out correct, well researched info. But to my knowledge, and because i've heard this personally, he gave credit to other researchers, and mostly stuck to the Podesta emails, which he looked at himself. He said he was mainly less of a researcher, and more a loudspeaker to get the word out since he has such a huge platform. And as you can see by the hit pieces done on him, he did get the word out. He had his life eviscerated for it too.
              </p>
              <p>
               Disinfo is what Webb is doing. Seaman put out accurate info. This is not to say there are no character flaws in him, but i have yet to hear a viable reason for the extreme Seaman hatred around here.

                Twice he said he was poisoned. When he got word that some truthers put videos out about his past and Soros connections to GoldMoney, which Seaman shills for, he deleted all his videos and said he was afraid for his life. The guy is a clown, has no info, repeats the same things like Podesta using code words in emails, and is a proven opportunist. He admitted as much in his past.

                From my perspective, he incited a lot of anger and hatred in people.  And threw up more Illuminati hand signs than I could stand to watch.
               </p>
               <p>
                I followed him for a time, but when you critically think back on people you've watched, you have to ask yourself what you gained by watching.  With Seaman, it was his anger about the situation and threats to Podesta, without adding rational logic or critical thinking to the PG issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                Honestly, he looked like a PG victim to me.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think watching Alex Jones or Webb may be useful, as they mix truth with lies.  That is what disinformation is to me.  Telling you logical truth, then ranting a complete bullshit lie, and the viewer's brain is just absorbing all of it like it's the same trustworthy thing.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I don't think Seaman even did that.  He just parroted information and got people angry and homicidal.

               <p>
                Yes, I've felt a wish for the criminals to die, but I don't need to dwell on the thought.

                 I hear you. I feel a bit like a mother to him. He's a young guy and was just reporting the truth. No one stood by him, it seemed, and there does seem to have been an attempt to take his life. He lost his column at HuffPost for saying that Hillary was sick. Next he's being called a nutjob and worse by major mainstream media. All around him people are dropping away - Alex claims Comet is innocent, other investigators are being silenced after watching what happened to Ryan Oneil. David doesn't stop talking about the Instagram and Podesta emails, he did 2 videos about them just today. And he's not emotional about it at all anymore. But the few months of high emotion, there is a part of me that just feels like he deserves a break for not keeping his cool. We don't know what pressures he was dealing with. And he did bring the info to a lot of people. I don't think i've seen proof anyone became homicidal due to his videos ;)

                I have to agree with you about Seaman. Up to date, he's not put out disinfo about PG. He's a narcissist, yes, but that doesn't make him a disinfo agent. Imho, he's being real.

            GW's videos are too erratic to really follow. Where's the beginning? So, I watched interviews that he gave. He seems to be quite well versed in every "conspiracy" there is. During his interview with Kerry Cassidy at Project Camelot (which I became familiar with because of the interview with Benjamin Fulford -- note, good interview) many suspected government projects were discussed. If you are familiar with Dutchsinse and his videos on weather modification as well as simulated earthquakes, you will see just how knowledgeable George really is. --

           <p>
            And so, I've been trying to find the end game -- or the meaning of his wild goose chase of phantoms. I wondered if the point wasn't so much to solve the Hardy Boys' mysteries -- but to use the pizzagate and Hillarygate platform to inform the public about OTHER stuff he knows. You know, stuff that goes on, and the names of the operations they do, and the capability of government technology, and the dangers of Dyncorp. Some of that stuff is outrageous and is quite true. He is not a dummy.

           <p>
            Like the game of chess, there are corresponding players on each team, each using that piece's strengths. At one point I wondered -- with all these capabilities of our government if he isn't telling us that we... are... in... checkmate. All the conspiracies are true. Those who hold power, hold it exclusively to ensure they will win. And they are saying "hello" from the control panel. Pretty sick, eh?? Maybe, just maybe, he is Anonymous.

            Edit: While watching the interview with Project Camelot -- knowing that "Camelot" was often referred to during John Kennedy's presidency -- a much loved president with a lovely wife -- and hearing the two of them discuss a "brotherhood" that the Dulles brothers formed within the CIA -- I hoped that the Kennedy's set up a "brotherhood" of their own to fight what they saw coming. In order to fight it, we must understand it, and George Webb is teaching us. hmm???

            I read the thing earlier and immediately dismissed it on absurdity when I was asked to believe that the Democrats put the future of their party and their freedom outside of a jail cell in the hands of a couple MS-13 hoodlums. Why wouldn't they use cops to do the hit? They could always use the "thought the cell phone was a gun" alibi if worse came to worse.

            If you get a Warning post about you, surely a nerve has been struck. By the way the Seth Rich shooter he identified (FBI informant Jollah)who was in the gunfight with D.C. Police on July 12, 2016 was arrested again within the last hour, after being identified in the Seth Rich murder.

            I'm just gonna ignore Webb. I know some of his info is good, but some of his info is obvious baloney. His antics today (didnt watch, just heard about....btw, if FBI wanted him dead, he would be dead, and what little I saw was ridiculous) anyway, his antics, coupled with disgusting Kathy Griffin makes me wonder from what "they" are trying to deflect....on what do they not want us to focus?

            If the guy George named as killer turns out to be correct, then bless George.

            If not, he is the scam artist we thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just dont know anymore so I'm just setting George, and all his info, aside until he is proven wrong or proven right. Also, I dont follow Corsi, but wasnt he supposed to make some kind of bombshell announcement today?

             Julian said a couple of days ago that there were fake twitter accounts using his name, so be careful. Twitter won't verify him and I have to assume it's all part of the strategy to downgrade him.

             They don't make it easy for us, do they? Assange is also a limited hangout. Remember, Dr Steve P outed him as such  in his video about the intel agencies leaking to Wikileaks in order to defeat Hillary/soros. And seriously, he's not exactly married to the truth:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              What about 9/11? "I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."

              All of them are limited hangout. Dr Steve P told us we won, and Trump would take care tof the rest. I laughed hard on that sad transparent attempt to get us to believe we won a civil war and the white hats were now inn charge. Fuck Steve P, the admitted spook. William Cooper was the only truther I back. Took a bullet from pigs in his own front yard. Predicted 9/11 in june of 2001 on live air, said why they would do it, said Osama bin Laden was CIA asset and CNN was garbage propaganda. This was back in 2001. He broke everything down. Was murdered in front of his house 3 months after 9/11. I listened to all his broadcast online.

              I'm not sure about this source. MSM are full of crap. They could have made this up, just like the "PG is fake" bullshit. Is there a video of Assange on video saying 911 is nothing but a conspiracy theory? For me, that would be a major red flag, especially because a year earlier, in 2009, Assange released about half a million text messages from pages which were sent on the day of  the event, many of which contradicted the official narrative...

               The Telegraph isn't know for fake news. He said it. It's been out and articles reference this, both 911 blogger and Infowars, so if this was an egregious lie, Assange would have addressed it, or sued.

                He didn't say it on video and he didn't address the issue publicly. Why would Assange say that it's a conspiracy theory when it is precisely WL that has published the texts which contradict the official narrative? It would be kind of silly, wouldn't it? I tend to want to discredit it, because it has not been confirmed by Assange himself anywhere to date. And you bring up infowars here, but aren't you the one that says and believes that infowars and Alex Jones are CIA operatives? I'm confused.

                 Please read my full comment in context - it was on Infowars, therefore he's likely aware that people have complained or brought it up, since that site is seen by many. I've never trusted Assange or Wikleaks either, they are limited hangouts. I love the leaks, but hate the limits. So we perhaps won't ever see eye to eye, and that's ok. I must admit you're the first person to ever claim he didn't actually say this. I kind of don't know where to go from there.

                  WL and Assange have done more for humanity than any other group or intel agency. When I see hard, concrete, accurate facts and results like that, I have to be grateful and stand by whomever is responsible for bringing those out. And remember that If it wasn't for WL, Pizzagate would have never happened.

                  Please read my comment again, I never claimed that he didn't say this. I said that I can't find a video of him saying it (before October 2016) and I don't think I can trust MSM 100% because they've lied so much in the past. And because of those facts, I tend to want to discredit the claim, especially because he did the exact opposite of what the MSM is "reporting", (he and WL have published half a million text messages sent on that day, which many go against the official narrative). I just ask for irrefutable proof that Assange actually said that 911 was a conspiracy theory. I might be wrong, of course, and if anyone can provide proof that he did, in fact, say it,  than I'll be the first to denounce him for it. And I don't think that my stance on the issue is as isolated as you want to make it sound, either.

              Steve has also been caught in lies/not married to the truth either.  I'm not going to site individual examples.  For inquiring minds just listen.  He is full of disinfo.

               For sure! I'm not singing his praises, but what he said specifically about the Podesta leaks and intel infighting, and their intention to get Trump in, but to limit the leaks so as not to bring down the whole thing (also limited to not be able to easily prove crimes), has all proven true. He has also been right about calling out recent hoaxes, and for his warning to the Clinton cartel not to use them to get out of this mess.

                When he showed up shortly before the election he came out with some off the wall stuff/I stopped watching.  Of course he is going to have some info that proves true/predictions etc/otherwise the disinfo would not stick.
It occurred to me back when that disinfo agents will either verify or vilify each other to keep everyone guessing.
It effectively sidetracks investigations/promotes squabbles/and keeps ppl effectively divided which is the main goal.

            Whew!  When it is put all together in one place, it is really quite confusing.  So many accusations and revelations with out Sources or who told him this or that or what.  George should really stop eating those Wild Mushrooms and Voodoo Donuts.

            I'm keeping my eyes on GW, undecided on what he is, but he definitely isn't giving us any evidence. Just says he's got it but we never see it. I was
            <em>
             shocked af
            </em>
            today when I heard him saying this, which I posted over on another thread ----
           </p>
           <p>
            What the hell is
            <strong>
             this?
            </strong>
            I quote GW below talking about the alleged money laundering of organ business between Pakistan and the US.  What the actual f**k ?  Is GW saying that the
            <em>
             old business of taking the organs of condemned prisoners
            </em>
            <strong>
             is much better???
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm not trying to destroy the
             <em>
              old business
             </em>
             , it's the
             <em>
              new business
             </em>
             I'm taking about..... and I don't think anyone will watch this... eyes kinda glaze over when you talk about this...., no I don't want to bring down the
             <em>
              entire network
             </em>
             .

            <p>
             It's the
             <em>
              new business
             </em>
             which is really really nasty. We've gone from taking the organs of condemned prisoners to all of a sudden shooting 7 year olds in the head and shooting two in Chicago to get the size and weight right for cardiac implants, and that's.... like I said.... if we just go back to the
             <em>
              old business
             </em>
             it would be much better.
             <strong>
              Because these things could collapse the whole network.

             Sort of mission creep.  Taking body parts from road kill is one thing.  Deliberately causing car crashes in order to get usable organs is something else.

            <p>
             Much like the Rothschilds, having discovered that War [Napoleon?] is good for business, move to creating wars to boost business.

            <p>
             Taking advantage of an accident of Fate is one thing.  Trying to interfere with Fate seems wrong.  Where does this put prayer and propitiation?

            I agree with the part that we should not treat George's words as facts. 
I disagree with the assumption that he is disinfo agent or he is misleading us. Sure, he changes his story and he works quickly, but his least concern is what people like you and me think. He knows powerful people are watching him. I know OP didn't make this claim in his post, but it has been mentioned in many other posts as this seems to be the "theme of the day" here on voat.

            I will say that with every source you cannot just sit back and hope they are going to take care of this problem. Same thing with Trump, you cannot hope he is going to drain the swamp. You have to keep the pressure on as citizens.

             However, it is important to remember that a great way to spread lies is to sometimes tell the truth to make it hard to make out which is which. We should not reject all of his information on face if he turns out to be a big troll---we just have to consider it plausible/unsourced and consider the level of information games being played.

              That's my point. I believe that he is telling a great deal of truth, in order to further his Zionist agenda. At the end of the day, we all still lose, though.
             </p>
             <p>
              I feel as though it is an experiment to see how far and how long they can keep us on a tangent; and the seams are beginning to crack as he make outlandish claims and repeatedly has to apologize for what could be considered character defamation if not waged against the other actors in the same play.
             </p>
             <p>
              What he does not say is most telling, IMHO.

            <p>
             He has also said he likes Obama, he states that he is a Zionist (though Dark Math can probably even excuse that one), and at the end of the "OMG we interviewed Seth's family investigator!!!" video from yesterday, he straight up claims Donna Brazille is innocent, didn't do anything wrong. His own (sudden) sidekick had to correct him "I don't think we can make that claim yet".

             This is a disinfo agent of the highest order. And why wouldn't he be? Someone had to infiltrate our group.

             We were worrying who? Exactly! John Podesta and Donna Brazille, among others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now he's blaming Muslims for everything, just as the Podesta/Clinton/Soros cult are wont to do. And y'all demand no proof beyond his word. Because he's got a great track record of telling the truth? Um, no. I'm not sure why.
            </p>

             No one of you has been able to account for his atrocious lies, lies that should make his word equal to dog shit in any truth community:

             Pizzagate researchers, please put your investigative caps back on and don't be lazy. I get it. I would love to trust some well equipped,  square jawed alpha male to take on the deep state for us, but if someone truly does that, they are taken out just like Ben Swann, David Seaman, Liz Crokin.

             He claimed multiple chairs were thrown at the NV convention. Besides claiming he was going to interview Seth Rich's brother, he claimed he was looking at logs which DON'T EXIST. And he's claiming that he has passed info to Wikileaks, in a manner that they don't accept, so this appears to be another wild lie. He also claimed that if we tweet out a certain hashtag, he would find us and we would each get at least a million dollars. He's deleted all those early videos though, as well as all of his Twitter feed up until about a month ago. No reason given. Just makes it hard to track his lies, is all.

              Altho I have not watched GW's ongoing investigation~ reading he thinks Seth was drugged, tossed in a van, roughed up for info, tossed out and the assassins were called to finish him off? So he was drugged, beat up, then calls his lady friend but what, doesn't mention he was just beat up and interrogated? Or if he did mention somehow that information was kept secret?

             at the very end he goes on about chairs being thrown at the NV convention - which NEVER HAPPENED, let alone that no one ever claimed there was more than one chair involved.

              I only managed to listen to half of the George Webb promo on Hagman. I had to stop when I heard him banging on about Wikileaks.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know why he is talking about thumb drive drops to Wikileaks when they themselves clearly state [and recommend] that
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              They also state: "WikiLeaks has a history breaking major stories in every major media outlet and robustly protecting sources and press freedoms. No source has ever been exposed and no material has ever been censored."
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet here is George Webb openly stating that he has made "drops" to Wikileaks, which is completely against their policies.

             Is it really worth scraping through the lies and bullshit to get whatever it is you're getting from Webb? Do you enjoy being caught up in another person's web? A complete stranger who has in the past taken part in pedophile entrapment schemes ("Brownstones") with the CIA? Weren't we doing just fine following our own leads that arose from the evidence? Why believe we need some Knight to take over, is it from laziness? Or frustration since thus far our efforts have amounted to little? This is exactly the opening intel agencies need to infiltrate a movement and suck it dry; see his definition of "School Play".

              Just for inquiring minds, as GW tells it he went to 3 different ones in 3 different cities doing dominatrix role playing for 'research'. If you understand the purpose of brownstones, vid cameras to entrap high level fill in the blank why in the world would one advertise on craigslist where any run of the mill perv could show up? There is absolutely no logic to his story at all. Oh wait, you are generic perv, let me turn the camera off/oh wait generic perv don't want you, can you send someone who is important? And he had the choice (according to him) of a child or dominatrix? So george, you had the choice of a child and yet did not report it asap bc you were just doing research? What happened to the child george? He is so phony I'm amazed anyone still gives him any credibility.

              I've been thinking about rather I should share this or not. I don't want to start gossip about George Webb, since he has given some great info. But, I also feel that if I don't share this, then I am not warning those who are believing everything he is saying. Also, if what this woman is telling me is true, then there could be other victims out there. I think my record here should show you guys that I'm not a shill.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, this woman on Twitter has been telling George Webb to leave her family alone.  Her and I wrote back and forth. I asked her if it was ok to share this and she said yes.
             </p>
             <p>
              This relates to Pizzagate or pedogate, because many of you use the information that George Webb provides in your own research. I'm sure some of what he says is true. But, I'd be careful after this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here is some of our discussion. What stands out is that she says he works for Epstein.

             EDIT 2: As expected, George is suddenly (since this post) claiming to be in trouble with the FBI - and explaining away what is being claimed here. Apparently he's on periscope right now claiming they're after him because he has put it all together

            <p>
             One reason i've wanted to hold off on showing clearly how much we have on him, is exactly for this reason, because he changed his story in accordance with what we are saying here. And right now he's squirming out of his past, making excuses. Of course, as we all know, if the FBI is after you, you're definitely one of the good guys, right? And of course, if Webb claims he is suddenly in fear for his life, it's definitely  true, right?

            George Webb admitted he was Jewish in a recent video w/Jason and worked for the 'old' Mossad.
Not saying that's good or bad but I personally am weary of anyone working for ANY CIA-like organization.

              George Webb Sweigert, is a Mossad / CIA disinfo agent, he  gives himself away at 9:10:

             <p>
              Notice, he doesn't say he's an American and he is rooting for the USA.. NO, first and 
foremost and he JEWISH and he is "ALWAYS ROOTING For MOSSAD"
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you think a hardcore zionist jew like George Webb Sweigert, is going to say anything bad 
about Israel and their involvement in the US government??

              So true. Henry Makow one of the greatest truthers out there 100% legit) is Jewish but not a Zionist unlike Alex Jones who comes across as Christian Zionist.

               "Jones" is a fraud. No idea who he works for., but it's not us. Also, Makow is "Jews Did it" guy; which is a psy -op. Israel is a colony of somebody, as is the United States.

               Spooks have no emotions towards morals. Spooks are trained to find effective ways. Morals are not to constrain them. Once you know he is a spook, the malfunction is yours if you are still fond of him.

            Totally agree. I tend to think some of the Voaters have done an amazing job digging up clues. I'm astounded by the community here and am proud to be a part of it. I'll also add in the 4chan and reddit investigators. Hat is off to all of you.

                Take your pick really. Obstruction of justice for walling off the Haiti investigation. High Treason for ignoring evidence the Awan brothers hacked Congressional Intelligence Committees that led to the death of Extortion 17.

                That last one's gonna leave a mark. It's never a good idea to murder in cold blood members of an organization containing 8,985 highly trained assassins. You can look up my posts about it in

You're just someone who's in denial about what really happened. You're just like my entire family of Enlightened and Progressive Liberals who can't entertain the possibility that rich white people who went to Yale could lie so egregiously about running what we now know to be a consciously constructed "Coin Operated Democracy and Fascist Oligarchiatorship(tm)".

                   ?  I'm not going to spent extra time digging into the loopy shit you believe.  Being as I don't read conspiracy news sites, I had no idea what you were talking about with most of those charges.

                   The President is a rich white person who went to Wharton and he obviously lies every day of his life.   George W. Bush went to Yale.    It's not a problem at all for me to believe rich people can lie.   Also don't you feel silly caveating people as white .....as a white person?  Look the common targets of liberals and progressives.......often rich white folk.   I don't get this whatsoever.

                    Thank you Captain Obvious. That's why I specifically used the analogy of you still being asleep. And I hate to make you feel bad but you'll be waking up whether you like it or not in pretty short order. And once again when you do regain consciousness please don't be too hard on yourself or anyone else. We were all lied to for years. Why were we lied to so egregiously?

                    Simple answer: money. Money = Power. And power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely:

                      Like I said AreWeSure, you're still asleep and can't see through the massive wall of lies. Underlying this entire fraud is the CIA running drugs for their black budget. Your wake up should start there. Once you realize how and why they did that everything else will fall into place.

             His name is George Webb Sweigert and he's leading people on a merry dance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another self-confessed ex-CIA creep who's trying to misdirect, just like Robert David Steele and his "nothing to see here" bullshit about the Rothschilds and child abuse. ("Podesta is a pedophile-lite." Remember that bullshit?) And just how exactly did Webb get access to all of this "information" that he seems to piss out in an almost endless stream??? Why is he not getting trolled to death and shut down if he's legitimate??? And why was he making freedom of information requests to the FBI in regards to his own file around the time of the election???

             The guy stinks.

              Too much talk. He is a spook. Do you or do you not know what they do, what they are about and who they work for? So why so much speculation? You think there are good guy spooks? Tell me what good guy projects they do? They know all their comrads are off doing evil, but they sleep well knowing they are in the handing candy out dept and have nothing to do with those things. What is wrong with the lot of you? He is a spook. That is that.

              Great point. Real truthers are being trolled all the time. Just mentioning Brian Podesta - Skippy connection would autoban you on twitter. Look what they did to Ben Swann for his 5 min gem about Pizzagate - for simply calling an investigatiion. Hell, look at Sean Hannity - mainstream heavyweight - and the troll campaign against him. Webb is a limited hangout indeed.

               I know. Whether you're a shill, retard, or If it's me who's being retarded... I'm sorry.  I always feel bad 10 minutes after making those types of comments, even though I'm usually drunk when I make those kinds of comment... Sober me knows that regardless of my opinion, being an emotional  dick does no good.  Drunk me says " Fuck it"

               Your problem DonKeyhote is you can't tolerate a difference of opinion. You want everyone to think like you do because you're evidently 4 years old and need a diaper change.

              You have the attention of people who recognize telling people on Reddit and youtube to get to the Marriott in the Bronx to save George from a big black guy with a black bag insinuating its a gun is reckless &amp; irresponsible and smells like a false flag coming to me (Comet pizza shooter). Then to find him say it was a farce and he wanted people to see what it would have been like for Braverman is fucking sociopathic. I'm really shocked he would do this. People were actually calling the Marriott.

               That's an interesting comment about the Marriott. The Marriott is known to be a staging area for ALL the false flags. Their hotels are also used in pedo entrapment schemes.

                Timing. We have been outing him here on Voat for the past couple of days in comments, which he reads. It became something too large for him to scramble out from under. That's why he also had to makes excuses for being a Mossad agent 'well there are actually two types, I'm the good type'. I always expected him to pull this, because he changes his behaviour in accordance with what is said here often times. We were mentioning that all the real truthers are having their personal safety threatened (latest being Liz Crokin), and videos removed from YouTube. In my opinion, he did it to look legit and to muddy the waters since here, a site he frequents and recommends to his viewers, we were on to him. In my opinion he had to get out in front of the story, as well as create a distraction. And that he did.

                  He said before we started questioning him. The pieces that call him into question only began yesterday (prior to that they were simply in comments sections, not very prominent).

                  That's not how I saw it. In fact, there were so many posts using his word alone as the title, that I actually approached mods about getting a separate sub for him. Because his word does not hold true much of the time. For instance the other day there was a post "Webb is going to interview Seths brother!" Or something to that effect. No interview happened and no word was uttered about having spoken in error. His words mean shit.

                   He changed his mind about interviewing someone; means nothing. Where's you're judgment. 
He's on the road. If you follow it you recognize he's very busy and jumping from one thing to the other.

                  <p>
                   Here he is on the subject of "Pizzagate" which people claim he denies. 
He says Clinton shows off children there; but he believes they are using "Satanism" as a cover. 
His expertise is in $$$ flows rather than occultism. so what?

                    Nope. He's not been on the road since this happened, that's incorrect. He has been in DC for about a week, and it was midweek that he announced Seth Rich's brother wants to get the truth out, and that he will be interviewing him.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He is not covering pizzagate, and if you find his Voat account, you can see in his comments that he announces why this is, he says he won't cover pizzagate unless you all can provide him with hard core evidence.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    IF his expertise isn't in occult, that's fine. But he shouldn't make false statements about the subjects of our investigation if he doesn't want to be questioned or criticized, sorry.

                     As I see it, George WS backed off the interview with Seth's "brother" because that part is much deeper than most people realize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     One also should be skeptical of the interview with Ron Wheeler. The sidekick of GWS , named Jason Goodman, is all sold on Wheeler; and that's a mistake as I see it. 
Goodman is naive compared to GWS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     They did a long interview with Wheeler which should be released soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The "father" who appeared in the clips is likely CIA. The "family" they showed on TV and had news clips of,  is likely a "school play" ! Were somehow look alike actors. ?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In many cases, Gary Webb killing, 9/11 "victims families" on and on - the FBI can get control of the family for PR. Wheeler is a PR man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You can see it if you study the photos and what and how the parties speak..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But the Seth Rich case seems to be breaking? And I believe George WS helped to jump-start  it. 
It also helps that all the Bernie people will push for it to be exposed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Geroge WS doesn't believe any of the human testimony around the Rich case. He says that all you can know, for real evidence, is that the FBI has his laptop and his phone.

                     It's being claimed now that Burglers stole an FBI gun just hours before the shooting of Rich.
It's because an informant who was reliable reported that the bullet which was recovered from Rich's body was ID;d as FBI

                     If you listen to his Ritchies of Ireland interview he says he knows they were using Comet Ping Pong to show off children. And the Alephantis was suspicious
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have no idea of what he considers hard core evidence. He was all about child trafficking at the beginning #monicapeterson; He's very broad in his coverage. So he narrows down to details in the areas he's told to. He's working for insiders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     How do you know he "doesn't want to be questioned" ? He said he was staying away from Pizzagate, and also away from 9/11. I'm assuming it's because he's under orders and plans to bust the case against #hrc wide open. He said Kissinger turned against her. And that Kissinger runs who is next FBI guy. He's a PR guy trying to get something done.

                     The Big People own both sides, and they've turned against Hillary; that's why Trump won; or so goes the speculation.

                I agree. It's a perfect example of "Baffle them with Bullshit". His videos are amateurish and rambling so that he can keep people engaged, confused and overwhelmed. It goes right along with their belief that they can do any harm as long as the victims are complicit.
