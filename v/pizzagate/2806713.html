            Corey is a joke. He is a perp and probably a former victim. The guys is opportunistic and is one of them. This sub loves bullshit. Remember when we used to post daily about pizzagate, not pedogate. Pedogate was an attempt to not specifically focus on pizzagate, and have the type of threads we have hear now. You know, like, this person is a pedo, or this person knows Hollywood is full of pedos, or Puliter prize winning author spoke about human trafficking, we are winning! Mission accomplished. The online investigation is dead and it is find the pedo in the haystack now, not the DC/CIA kidnap, rape, torture, murder, organ harvesting operations spear headed by James Rothschild Alefantis. Corey Feldman still, for fuck sake.

             Part of it is that the mystery is solved and the gaslighting that it hasn't still remains.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Intelligence Community, before and during World War I, began studying trauma and learned, scientifically, at what point a man breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
             They set up a host of international non-profit and intellectual bodies to study and employ mass persuasion and mind control techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
             With an army of people and an unlimited budget, they perfected their art and it still operates by power in the hands of a small few who have their tendrils in countless compartmentalized sections that are subject to this type of persuasion. On an individual level, it can be a full reset. Like sensory dep for a few weeks straight to blank a mind, then rebuilding it. On a mass persuasion level, it is about manipulating Basic Assumptions, a la Wilfred Bion, manipulating dopaminergic reward systems through chemistry and technology, and manipulating attitudes, focusing on hate, division and anxiety.
            </p>
            <p>
             The machine is working very hard to program predictable emotional triggers into the population and they have very much succeeded and refined their efforts. The only way to be a real adult and an educated voter is to disarm every emotional trigger that has been programmed into you and to carefully select which stimuli is worth your time and will benefit your happiness. The opposite is devil worship, or close enough so it doesn't matter to a normal, healthy person.

            Sorry Corey, Don't trust you since your still Hollyweird. Not that I won't take anyones word. 	Tiffany Brissette, Small Wonder robot Vicky. Ricky Schroder silver spoons. Soleil Moon Frye, Punkey Brewster. There are a lot of child stars who chances are have seen and been put through some shit. If Corey wants credibility he needs to interview a few who have stepped out of the limelight for various reasons. Fred Savage will be a good one since he lived in the pedo acting apartments while a child.

            He has been paid off by the bigshots who raped him that's why he only tells the names of the low-level men who raped him and Haim. The very high-level powerful movie moguls paid him long ago when he first threatened to go public with their names. They realized it was safer to pay him than to kill him although they could easily kill him with a drug overdose. He won't ever mention the names of the powerful men who raped him and Haim but it's easy to figure out who they are. Most likely Rob Reiner and Spielberg and a couple others who were happy to pay Feldman  to only mention the lower players.

            Corey was horribly abused and it appears that he is still controlled by some of those same elements, (understandable, we havent gone through what he has, who are we to judge) he was activated after the metoo movement blew up in their faces, to steer reactions and sentiments.  It will be hard to believe anything coming out of hollywood as being truth.

             If you listen to him closely he is saying things just not outright. What he says outright is pretty much bs, but the subtext of what he says has something real there. Notice how he kept repeating "It's the parents" I think that was his way of saying investigate the parents of these kids.  I could be reaching but it makes sense if you believe was these MK Ultra presidental slave people keep saying.  According to them it was their pedo parents that sold them literally. These super rich people can have their records wiped but are they going arouond and wiping all these pedo parents records, and given these people were caught to begin with wouldn't they keep getting caught hence constantly creating new records? Just a thought.

              A lot of the children who were sold, came from parents who were themselves pedophiles and often involved in satanic cultism.  AS far as Hiollywood goes.. It is the parents.  The parents crave fame by association, crave  easy money and bathing in the limelight, easy lifestyle and all it cost them was the ass of some child that they diont even love.  When will people see that there is a problem?

            I think Corey is lost in his supposed career as an actor and is grasping desperately for something to carry him onwards. A child rape story is appealing to Hollywood gossip rags, but it has no meat for the real world that demands FACTS. Corey is short on facts.

              Got you. I want to stay as far away as I can from Feldman and Alyssa Milano. They had to both be handlers of Haim and Haim got into a fist fight with Feldman over introducing him to a pedo.

             Did Cosby take one for the team, and what do you think about the rejected appeal? Corey(bad at money) would spend 5 million on a regular house in Ca. and think that normal because he never left La La Land. How do I know this? One look. The other 5 Mil? Taxes. 45% in near future to live in a 5 bedroom. Tax calculator says 1,281,174$ a year for 2017. Maybe you are right, but he is a product of Hollywood.

              They took Cosby down.  And now they are going after Kat Williams.  Now as far as guilt I doubt anyone can be in that industry on that level and be clean.

                 It is in the wording." Now as far as guilt,, I doubt anyone can be in that industry on that level, and be clean." I am defending the people that went to Hollywood in search of a better future. Clean? Dead in a ditch, or the desert? Watch   Stoked: The Rise And Fall Of Gator (Full Documentary)
