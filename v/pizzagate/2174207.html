            Note - the link in the headline of this post goes to another Voat post that was deleted.  Despite being deleted and ineligible for an upvoat, the link in that headline still works and goes through to the original post, in case anyone wants to see it.  It's worth a look IMO.

            No links, but before this gets taken down, here are a few things that I've noticed that got my pizza senses tingling since this went down....
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Steve Paddock's very sparse online presence.....if anything, people his age tend to be pretty slack about what they share online....of course professional spooks/crims tend to be more careful
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              For someone who made millions in real estate, I've not seen much evidence of his suggested career...the only property sales record I've seen is for a ranch that does therapy for kids using horses....now that is a thing I know, autistic kids respond well to animals, but even so, we know how shit like that attracts pizzalovers
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The picture with powerpuff girl background, and related email address
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              His brother may be a furry (I've not seen that picture again since his brothers details were first found), did anyone archive it? Also his brothers interviews are seriously strange
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The shady stuff around his filipino gf
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I know we aren't allowed to mention the occult here, but there is some serious and obvious occult shit around the actual shooting, and I know many of us feel that is an intrinsic element of pizzagate
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Basically the whole thing stinks, and certainly there is way more to it than we are being told atm

            Taken down 4 x....the last for link not working although it worked when i clicked on it after it was deleted.  hate to sound like one of those suspicious posters ranting about the mods being shills and such.....but c'mon.  at least be honest when taking this down   and say you're scared of your bosses or whatever is the truth.   (note i have to link to the deleted submission cuz after the latest b.s. take down it says i've exceeded the number of times i can try and post the url  --- convenient.  so anyway just click on the link within the link).
t : 1. Elites n deep state involvement in child trafficking around military bases in the phillipines. 2...contains plenty o links. 3....title say it all for anyone able to comprehend the entire article......Kudos to the author
