            Having watched scores of videos produced by victims/survivors in various stages of healing, and (now) also way too many videos made by pedos, I'm not buying it.  What is "cathartic" about those inclusions?  If anything, this crap will trigger/retraumatize victims.  No, this is just more pro-pedo filth the likes of which we've seen too many times before.

             I went on his site, sentimentalcorp.org, I don't recommend you go, it but it has warnings not to watch if you've been traumatized because there are triggers. Some unsettling videos on there, all of them seem cynical and anti-pedo. He seems to know a lot of inside stories.

            My wife has been talking to him quite a bit lately and he seems genuinely upset by the way people have taken his "art".  He claims it was meant to help people, to de-program them.  To me it seems pretty fucking hard to ignore the terms and content of these videos given the timeframe they were produced.  If this stuff came out in the last few months Id be the first to shout ""LARP", but as it stands, I really can't say.
