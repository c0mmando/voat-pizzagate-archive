<p><strong>Exclusive:  Feds Refuse to Divulge Records of Assaults on Orphaned Immigrant Children in Their Care</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Despite reports of rapes and other sexual assaults, federal officials refuse to divulge any information to the public about the safety of orphaned Central American children in facilities run by third-party contractors....</strong></p>
<p>....2014 Freedom of Information Act response to the Houston Chronicle that there were <strong>101 “significant incident reports” of sexual abuse of unaccompanied children in the contractor facilities.</strong></p>
<p>Federal officials with ORR....<strong>depend upon contractors to self-report any crimes.</strong>  
</p>
<p>Agency spokesman Victoria Palmer told TheDCNF Friday that ORR officials don’t regularly compile sexual abuse or assault data of the immigrant children living at the facilities, stating, “the statistics you are requesting are not compiled or readily available.”</p>
<p><strong>....secretive approach to ensuring the safety of unaccompanied immigrant children held in federally funded facilities managed by government contractors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The entire program is shrouded in secrecy....They don’t tell you where they are placing them....&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell has not prosecuted a single federal employee for abuse of the immigrant children and claims ORR cannot discipline employees who work for the contractors, even when cases involve violent acts such as sexual assaults.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“There are no ORR employees currently being investigated by law enforcement for sexual misconduct or abuse involving unaccompanied children”....</strong></p>

<p>2014 Houston Chronicle investigation, referred to in the article above</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Crossing alone: Children fleeing to U.S. land in shadowy system”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The full extent of sexual and physical abuse in the federal shelters is unknown.</strong> </p>
<p>But for the first time, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Chronicle, the government has released copies of 101 &quot;significant incident reports&quot; from March 2011 to March 2013 involving abuse allegations against staff members. </p>
<p>Among the Chronicle\'s findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Children and teenagers reported having sexual contact - ranging from kissing to unwanted touching to intercourse - with staff in Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youths in ORR custody in Texas were molested as they slept, sexually harassed and seduced by staff members....They were shoved, kicked, punched and threatened with deportation if they reported abuses....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No shelter worker has been prosecuted under a 2008 federal provision that makes sexual contact with a detainee in ORR\'s care a felony.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cases repeatly fall apart</strong></p>
<p>The Chronicle\'s investigation found that case after case fell apart after landing on the desks of local law enforcement.</p>
<p>A 39-year-old temporary worker at a Catholic Charities shelter in Cutler Bay, Fla., was fired in September 2011 after a 15-year-old boy told shelter administrators that she awakened him early one morning and led him into the shelter\'s laundry room and had sex with him. The case was referred to the Miami-Dade Police Department, <strong>but prosecutors ultimately declined to charge the worker.  In the memo closing the case, the Miami-Dade State\'s Attorney\'s Office noted that the shelter &quot;had custody of the child and did not wish to pursue prosecution of the subject.&quot;</strong>  
</p>
<p>A second boy, 16, reported to his aunt in California after he was released from the shelter that he had oral sex with the same worker. Police eventually interviewed the boy and told him he could press charges.  By then he had turned 18, and he declined.</p>

            The Governments along with the CIA and FBI are all tied up with mind control / Ritual abuse.. Along with most media outlets.

            Ritual abuse “skeptics” with CIA connections are covering up the latest phase in Agency-sponsored mind control experimentation. For thirty years Agency scientists have collaborated with cults (many of them founded by the government) to conceal the development of mind control technology. Jim Jones and the People’s Temple was one product of the alliance. McMartin was another. Both episodes have been buried in disinformation. The campaign to mislead the public about ritual abuse is ambitious, rivaling the campaign to conceal the facts in the murder of John F. Kennedy. The smokescreen is also explained in part by reports implicating the CIA in child prostitution for the purposes of political blackmail – a variation on the age-old sex trap. CIA agents have been directly involved in organized child sex rings. In Enslaved (1991), an investigation of the worldwide slavery underground, Gordon Thomas found Agency participation in the kidnap of Latin American children “flown across the border in light aircraft, and sold to child sex rings, or sold so their organs could be used in transplants.” Some of the pilots, Thomas discovered, “made two or three flights a day. The more experienced used Beech 18s because of the aircraft’s capacity and maneuverability. The majority of the fliers were mercenaries who had flown for the CIA.”

             Thank you for this information.  It seems like it would be very easy for the FBI and CIA to put minors through MK and SR abuse/torture/programming, and recruiting, in any secretive UAC situation, especially if there are underground areas/tunnels accessed through secret rooms.  And the Enslaved quote is really disheartening, but we need to know what's happening.

            Who would be keeping those records anyway.  So difficult especially if there is a language barrier.  Explaining to them how to ascess  their case.  Etc.   who is responsible for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are they in a shelter anyway,  to be protected.   When they are hurt you would think they would have to refer back to the shelter.  Catch 22?  It’s money.  All about the money really .

             The Office of Refugee Resettlement actually does have the records, but they are "not compiled or readily available."

             And yes -- there is so much money involved!
