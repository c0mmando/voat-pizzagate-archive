            , but I will have to remove the post, since the headline is blatantly false, and also your two sources have disinfo. (When both the body of the post
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            the headline would need to be edited, we remove the post, since titles cannot be edited here on Voat.)
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Wikileaks doesn't / didn't say 'Obama, Clinton &amp; Soros Overthrew Pope Benedict'.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) In fact, there never was a Wikileaks report about this topic like your first source claims (' In a new report from Wikileaks, it’s now alleged that these three oversaw a coup to remove Pope Benedict.')
           </p>
           <p>
            3) There is only an e-mail exchange between Sandy Newman and John Podesta (please see below), published by Wikileaks when the other hacked emails were published in 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sandy Newman suggests there should be a 'Catholic Spring', but John Podesta replies
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this.
             <strong>
              But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up.'
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <strong>
             So, in fact, he argues
             <em>
              against
             </em>
             the proposal to instigate a 'Catholic Spring' from above.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            While I personally believe that an alliance of globalists within and outside the Church forced Pope Benedict to resign, these two particular emails published by Wikileaks don't confirm this, but, quite to the contrary, show that Podesta wasn't enthusiastic about the proposal to iniatiate a 'Catholic Spring', and obviously didn't want the two organizations mentioned to get involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Whether this may have changed later is another matter, but the Wikileaks emails don't confirm your claim.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Removing per Rules 2 and 3.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you.
           </p>

             Hi, John,  This whole controversy with the bishops opposing contraceptive coverage even though 98% of Catholic women (and their conjugal partners) have used contraception has me thinking . . . There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in  which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic church. Is contraceptive coverage an issue around which that could happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bishops will undoubtedly continue the fight. Does the Catholic Hospital Association support of the Administration's new policy, together with "the 98%" create an opportunity? Of course, this idea may just reveal my total lack of understanding of the Catholic church, the economic power it can bring to bear against nuns and priests who count on it for their maintenance, etc. Even if the idea isn't crazy, I don't qualify to be involved and I have not thought at all about how one would "plant the seeds of the revolution," or who would plant them. Just wondering . . . Hoping you're well, and getting to focus your time in the ways you want. Sandy

             It often bastardised itself to grow its power, influence and to stay alive . The Roman Empire had a habit of building their temples on top of older holy sites of the Indigenous peoples land. Why not religions too?. If you wanna secretly worship Talos in

            Well if he was actually a Nazi or believed their ideas, he would have been one of the globalists most powerful enemies. It would make sense that they'd want him replaced with a fellow pederast.

             And certainly not a leftist....since he was supposed to have helped with the extermination of leftist priests in Argentina. Everything is not left or right, esp. with the catholic church.Well, maybe...they did help the top grade nazis escape Germany.Maybe old pope looked too much like something out of a scary movie.

            I've wondered about this for a while...  since it's obvious that the actual pope was ousted, and some agent has taken his place, what does this mean for Catholicism?  I don't know much about religiousity, but my incredibly basic understanding is that the difference between Catholic Christians &amp; the rest of Christians is that Catholics follow the pope.  Well, there is no pope.  Or, the pope isn't recognized by the church.  Or, the pope is an agent against the church?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where does that leave Catholicism?  Is it no longer viable?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know.  I'm curious what Catholics, or former Catholics, think about this.

             Christianity itself is an anti-Jesus occult invention of Paul the Jew scrapped together and imposed by pagan Romans.  Jesus wantEd to restore Old Testament Jewish law,  full stop.

               Hes partly right.  Jesus never wanted men to worship him as God.  He always always directed their worship and attention to the Father when the matter arose.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus' own words -   "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee** the only true God**,
               <em>
                and
               </em>
               Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent"
              </p>
              <p>
               According to scripture the Father gave Jesus all authority of God.  But He did not put Him above Himself in that respect.  And Jesus never claimed to be above Him.
              </p>
              <p>
               1 God.  The Father.
              </p>
              <p>
               1 Son.  Begotten of the Father.
              </p>
              <p>
               1 Spirit.  The Fathers Spirit which the Son was given freely and gives to us freely.

             His brother had, albeit indirectly. In retrospect, it looks like Benedict was taking concrete actions to address the abuse, whereas Francis talked the talk but in reality rolled back on a lot of Benedict's progress

            “Podesta, a longtime Clinton adviser/confidante and hand-picked top activist for left-wing funder George Soros, revealed in a 2011 e-mail that he and other activists were working to effect a “Catholic Spring” revolution within the Catholic Church, an obvious reference to the disastrous “Arab Spring” coups organized that same year by the Obama-Clinton-Soros team that destabilized the Middle East and brought radical Islamist regimes and terrorist groups to power in the region.The Podesta e-mail is a response to another Soros-funded radical — Sandy Newman, founder of the “progressive” Voices for Progress. Newman had written to Podesta seeking advice on the best way to “plant the seeds of the revolution” in the Catholic Church, which he described as a “middle ages [sic] dictatorship.”

            The Vatican has been dirty since its inception. It's never been a champion of Christianity. Becoming a religion was simply a strategy for controlling the truth that was spoken by other religious orders. It also helped wage war and maraude and loot, and also slaughter orders that held onto Christ's words.

              I can't find the quote but some great man once said of the Catholic Church - "For men who speak of giving up materialistic things, they seem oddly preoccupied  with collecting and amassing wealth"

               It has dawned on me too.  All those gold chalices, hand embroidered vestments, beautiful stain glass.  Think of what all that would buy for the refugees Francis is always crying about.  Wastefulness in grand proportions.  I remember the ad campaign to make us think he was frugal and a man of the vow of poverty when he drove around in his old car.  What a joke.
