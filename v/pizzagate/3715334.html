<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYrkhUf_e10&amp;feature=emb_title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYrkhUf_e10&amp;feature=emb_title</a></p>
<p>at 7:30 he mentions he was a photographer taking pictures of parties, but there was another photographer taking picture of porn and snuff videos. Rusty claims he was offered $100,000 by Hunter S Thompson to do a snuff film, which he refused. He claims that when got to talk to one of the photographers who was doing these snuff films, and he noticed that this photographer had the exact same build and dark curly hair that he (Rusty) himself had. He believes that he was being set up as a fall guy for this photographer.</p>
<p>There would always be two parties. The first party would be a normal party, and then afterwards some people would stay or come back and then that is when the porn and snuff would be filmed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAceUWteSt4&amp;feature=emb_title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAceUWteSt4&amp;feature=emb_title</a></p>
<p>In this video he claims drugs were heavily involved in this. He was at a D.C. party on Embassy row and drugs were laid out on a table &quot;like a fine buffet&quot;. He says he was told secret service was at this party, and also claimed that he saw Presidents at these parties, including Reagan and the Bushes.</p>
<p>He claims he has been shot at 3 times and also was deliberately hit by a car who opened it\'s back door to hit him as it drove by when he was in Oregon, which gave him epilepsy.</p>
<p>He also claims that a lot of MK Ultra and mind control experiments went on at the airforce base in Omaha (strategic air command). He said Larry King (not the talk show host) could go to this base without ever getting checked or having to stop.</p>
<p>He also claims that the daycare that Larry King was getting kids from found out what was going on and boarded up the doors. Someone (King or Aquino, I can\'t tell) tried to get the daycare to open it\'s doors but nobody, not the sheriff, state patrol or anyone wanted to do anything about it, so he called Reagan directly and the doors were opened within 20 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksw1XJo9-Dc&amp;feature=emb_title">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksw1XJo9-Dc&amp;feature=emb_title</a></p>
<p>He says king was involved in kidnapping too. He said they had &quot;catalogue kids&quot; - they would drive around looking for kids, taking pictures of them, and then they would go to various elites and show them the pictures, asking which ones they wanted and then they would go snatch that kid. He says that\'s what happened to Johnny Gosch, who was made a sex slave. </p>
<p>He said when you have a captive person, that person is angry and frustrated at first so they are drugged and isolated in a place like a basement until the person is craving personal interaction, basically inducing Stockholm syndrome. </p>
<p>The subject then shifts to someone named Gary Caradori (not sure about the spelling) who was a retired Nebraska patrolman. He was hired to investigate this stuff and then died in a plane crash. His plane &quot;broke apart&quot; over aurora Illinois which just happens to be the town where Chief Wadman happened to be the police chief after he was run out of Omaha. The FBI showed up within minutes, everything is confiscated and the property owner and the deputy who arrived on scene is threatened. A few years later the deputy started to talk about this and his wife was murdered.</p>
<p>He claims that there were pictures (taken by Rusty???) of children being whipped by influential people. </p>
<p>He claims 23 children have been to the white house for an after hours tour, and they were never seen again. This is interesting because I know that Jeffery Dahmer (who is from Wisconsin) was able to secure an after hours tour of the Vice Presidents office (Mondale I think) for him and two class mates simply by calling from a pay phone.

<blockquote>
<p>Dahmer was shy with occasional bizarre outbursts, but he was also very charismatic. In fact, while on a class trip to Washington D.C. Dahmer called the White House, with confidence, and managed to get clearance for him and two classmates to visit the vice president’s office.</p>

<p>He claims most of the Satanist stuff centered around Michael Aquino. They would do satanic rituals at a farm house in Omaha. He claims Warren Buffet was involved in this. </p>
<p>Rusty then says says HE was then sold one night by Larry and some guy comes into his room to get &quot;friendly&quot; with him and he asked why and was told that Larry had &quot;sold him for the night&quot;. He escaped by saying he was going to go to the bathroom and freshen up, and then snuck out (through a window?) and went straight to the airport, leaving his camera equipment behind.</p>
<p>He says Larry had provided him with an apartment where someone committed suicide but he thinks the person was really murdered and it was covered up by Sheriff Wadman.</p>
<p>Jeff Gannon was in the White House Presidential press core. He was running a gay military escort service in the D.C. area, and Rusty says he would &quot;put his money&quot; on the rumor that Jeff Gannon was really Johnny Gosch. Shortly after this Hunter Thompson supposedly committed suicide. Rusty says he does not think it was suicide and that he was murdered for the snuff films that he was holding over people. </p>
<p>He says he landed in Area-51 in a plane full of drugged kids, where a bunch of arabs then sold off the kids.</p>
<p>He says Bohemian Grove is linked to this as well. He also claims this is a continuation of Nazi experiments.</p>

<p>He claimed that there are safe houses in Colorado where some of these kids were taken. </p>
<p>He claims the money generated from this funded Iran-Contra. </p>
<p>He also claims that people can be mind controlled and triggered into a totally different person by playing a tone or word or phrase.</p>',

            I grew up in West Des Moines Iowa, and Johnny Gosch is nearly one (1) year my senior.

            I didn't have a morning paper route, but I quit my gig delivering some shopper rag on Wednesdays after he got snatched.

            From the Original Post above: "He said Larry King (not the talk show host) could go to this base without ever getting checked or having to stop. He also claims that the daycare that Larry King was getting kids from found out what was going on and boarded up the doors. Someone (King or Aquino, I can't tell) tried to get the daycare to open it's doors but nobody, not the sheriff, state patrol or anyone wanted to do anything about it, so he called Reagan directly and the doors were opened within 20 minutes."

            Exact same MO as Sir Jimmy Savile in England, who had unlimited access to a (mental?) hospital and its patients. Sir Jimmy also had unlimited access to Buckingham Palace where he'd "pop in unannounced" for a quick visit with Prince Charlie or Her Majesty.

              Wish I could tell you. I have a feeling the only one that knows is one of the elites. WB might be a good guess. He has been scrubbing everything about himself for decades. WTH is he hiding?

              We’re not concerned about the money. It’s the Children. What are they hiding we all want to know. Oprah was outed big time the other day. She played innocent. But it’s not going away. I hope he gets his day before he dies.

                 Follow the White Rabbit is the biggest surprise of them all.  It just went from being a Q-puzzle connecting Alice in Wonderland, the C_A and the Looking Glass.  Like overnight it gained a whole other very Bloody meaning.
