<p>The writer talks about the book &quot;Thy Will Be Done: The Conquest of the Amazon : Nelson Rockefeller and Evangelism in the Age of Oil&quot; by Gerard Colby and Charlott Dennet.  The book talks about the direct collaboration between the CIA, Nelson Rockefeller (Standard Oil) and William Cameron Townsend, founder of the ultraconservative Wycliffe Bible Translators to promote missionary expenditions into the Amazon during the Cold War era for corporate exploitation and promotion of US foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p>An interesting quote from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As souls ascended to heaven in the flight against Satan, many clergy became direct collaborators with the CIA. One member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&amp;MA) was proud of this collaboration. William Carlsen, a missionary in northeastern Thailand, considered it &quot; a privilege to share information with responsible agencies of the government where they seek us out.&quot; Carlsen gave an eight-hour briefing to the CIA on Thailand\'s tribal areas when he returned home for a furlough. Most C&amp;MA missionaries did likewise, according to a CIA source. Most of the information gleaned was about people, their actions, opinions, and grievances.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The link between the CIA and missionary groups was quite often the <strong>US Agency for International Development (AID)</strong>!!!  Some additional quotes from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; William Cameron Townsend watched the controversy over the CIA\'s use of missionaries with curiosity and growing alarm. The CIA\'s penetration of religious missions, an issue previously overlooked by the media, was now, in 1975, making international headlines.</p>
<p>&quot; The story had been building since 1970, when Dr. Eric Wolfe, chair of the American Anthropological Association\'s ethics committee, explained how anthropologists had been manipulated through the Chiang Mai Tribal Research Center in northern Thailand, which was funded through the Agency for International Development (AID). He also revealed that American missionary organizations had been drawn into this counterinsurgency operation as well.</p>
<p>&quot;That June, President Nixon\'s director of AID, John Hannah, had admitted publicly that AID had funded CIA operations in Laos, and subsequent revelations pointed to CIA-AID collaboration in Ecuador, Uruguay, Thailand and the Philippines. These revelations could hurt all missionary efforts, but the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) was particularly vulnerable. Cam Townsend had been aggressively pursuing government funding for his Bible translators for decades, first from foreign governments and then from his own government. The amendment to the 1949 Federal Property and Administrative Services Act that allowed religious missions to take surplus U.S. government property abroad had even been called &quot;Townsend\'s bill&quot; in some congressional circles. By the 1960s, SIL was receiving a hefty income from AID indirectly through foreign governments that received U.S. foreign aid or directly through AID-funded programs in bilingual education and agricultural development cooperatives. This income was supplemented by surplus military equipment, including helicopters that were retired from Vietnam and donated to SIL. Evangelized pilots of these choppers became soldiers for Christ in the tradition of Dawson Trotman\'s Navigators. In Peru, after the nationalization of Standard Oil, the head of the U.S. Embassy\'s AID office even became a member of SIL.&quot;</p>

             There you have it! Another connection back to the churches where the demons actually live or abide or whatever you want to call what they do. They tried to kill me for years after I saw them, they've let up a bit now lately. It's a real trick to stay alive around them as you can see with all the people turning up dead around the Clinton's! Most people don't have near the protection to stay alive!!!

            Are Christian missionary expeditions another front and avenue for child trafficking?   Uhh duh yes!!!!!! That is where all this is coming from-the demon filled churches all around us!!! You people got cotton in your ears-been saying it on here for weeks. All you have to do is look at the Catholic priests in their fake Catholic Churches!!!!!

              It is definitely a master plan of Satan's. like the person said above Satanexposed it what it should really be called. Had someone not have been shown it, we would have been in really bad shape. Kind of like Noah was saved and chosen.
