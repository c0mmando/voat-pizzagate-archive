<p>Of note: in the sex trafficking show she speaks with one of the handlers of victims. Victims who are picked off of refugee migration groups. She asks the trafficker if he would ever consider letting any of their victims go. He responds &quot;Why would I let go of my ATM?&quot; </p>
<p>In the organ trafficking show she is told by a man who received a kidney that he received it from a man who bought a kidney for 3k through the Internet from a peasant farmer who said that he needed to money to &quot;pay off debts and to keep his children and wife from being kidnapped due to those debts&quot;. The man was from Pakistan. This is the microfinancing component. Give the farmer a small loan and when they can\'t pay, make these types of threats with the only out to sell an organ.

            The name provided by FBIANON that gave him the most fear and he gave such caution about was Mohammed Yunus. The anon indicted this would break open big parts of the story. He gave grave caution to anyone looking into Yunus. He has not been a major focal point here on Voat so far I don't believe. Will make a separate post to get a lot of people researching at one.

            Oh a 100%. He doesn't get enough credit! I'll give you a fun fact. Guess who wrote an expose on Yunus? Daniel Pearl...two months before his death. At the time of his death Daniel had Intel that KSM was working WITH the U.S. govt which is why he was setting up an interview. He was a very inconvenient journalist to those in the NWO.
In the show on organ trafficking the journalist covers Bangladesh quite a bit. She doesn't connect it to microcredit but I think the more of us who inform her, the better, bc she isn't afraid to go dig up the facts.
