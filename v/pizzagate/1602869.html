            The name provided by FBIANON that gave him the most fear and he gave such caution about was Mohammed Yunus. The anon indicted this would break open big parts of the story. He gave grave caution to anyone looking into Yunus. He has not been a major focal point here on Voat so far I don't believe. Will make a separate post to get a lot of people researching at one.

            Oh a 100%. He doesn't get enough credit! I'll give you a fun fact. Guess who wrote an expose on Yunus? Daniel Pearl...two months before his death. At the time of his death Daniel had Intel that KSM was working WITH the U.S. govt which is why he was setting up an interview. He was a very inconvenient journalist to those in the NWO.
In the show on organ trafficking the journalist covers Bangladesh quite a bit. She doesn't connect it to microcredit but I think the more of us who inform her, the better, bc she isn't afraid to go dig up the facts.
