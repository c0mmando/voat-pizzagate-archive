             Why anyone assumes Gates is an expert in bio-science and vaccines is a mystery. He wasn't even an "expert" in computers. Rather he was a robber barron and a very good one in business matters.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does no one remember the 15 or so versions of Windows that he manufactured, each with more flaws than the preceding one and needing endless patching? Or the number of good software companies that he put out of business or bought outright and buried their product?
            </p>
            <p>
             He is tightly tied to numerous Clinton Foundations, and was a frequent visitor to Jeffrey Epstein, which should tell everyone all they need to know.  Don't be a beta tester for Gates Chinese Flu Vaccine #1.0.0.0.

               Sorry, I didn't mean you in particular, just that almost everyone assumes Gates and others involved in techy stuff are techy geniuses when more often they are excellent robber barons. Zuckerberg comes to mind and even to some extent Edison and Westinghouse.

              yesterday, and kept adding to it.  If I were to distill it to a timeline, then one notices Priscilla Chan and her husband, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and WHO, World Bank Group, Global Preparedness Monitoring Board (GPMB) and others chart the course to Covid19 as effectively as a marketing strategy for releasing an up coming block buster movie.

              A key event that needed to happen (imho) to turn the grand arc of their Pandemic 'awareness' and research into an actual world wide outbreak was told to us in The Next Pandemic Smithsonian 2017 article regarding
              <a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pause-gain-function-research">

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Dec 2017 The National Institutes of Health has lifted a three-year moratorium on controversial experiments that carry the risk of triggering a viral pandemic, but may also prepare the United States for a deadly outbreak.

               As Nell Greenfieldboyce reports for NPR, the Department of Health and Human Services revealed a new framework on Tuesday for guiding federal funding of research that involves genetically altering dangerous viruses like influenza, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).
              </p>
              <p>
               “Gain-of-function” research, as this contentious field of study is called, sees virologists create mutations in the lab that can help them predict how a given virus will evolve—and whether it will become more powerful or transmissible in the future. But should an enhanced virus escape the lab, critics warn, the results could be disastrous. The NIH has spent the past three years weighing arguments about gain-of-function experiments—during which time they banned funding this work—and has ultimately decided that they are worth the risk.

              Moving on to list a few noteable milestones in the Zuckerberg/Gates common interests:
             </p>
             <p>
              IDSeq, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub
             </p>
             <p>
              An over reaching goal of this entire push for Pandemic Awareness funded by Zuckerberg and Gates (and others):
             </p>
             <p>
              Universal Health Coverage
             </p>
             <p>
              Recall that (Fauci was a big supporter of Hilllary and Obama's Global Health Initiative).  His email to Cheryl Mills was also sent to Lois Quam.  Background info I'll tag on otherwise I'll be sidetracked from my original intent to recap my comment that I linked.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given that GPMB told us about the timing of 'the' pandemic outbreak a couple-few months before it happened and was reported, it's even more notable that:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The GPMB Secretariat is funded by the Government of Germany, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and Resolve to Save Lives which is funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and housed in New York City.

            While hashtags such as #BillGatesBioTerrorist #BillGatesIsNotOurFriend #BillGatesIsEvil and #BillGatesPublicEnemyNumber1 are trending on Twitter, why in the fuck would he endorse this sick, evil, demonic, dangerous satanic "artist"? To confirm what we suspect or know? He's deep state, wants to kill 15 million and tag us all with ID2020? SMH

            People are giving Ambramnovic too much credit. She's an older version of Gaga, hangs around anywhere and with anyone, who can get her in the limelight without actually having any talent, other than being good at schmoozing with 'elites'. The fact these rich faggots buy into her absolute bullshit is testament to how absolutely useless they actually are. Take Spirit Cooking for example. It's a shitty OTO/Crowley nonsense ritual, that achieves nothing. If these idiots were to conduct any meaningful rituals they'd start with elemental magick.

             I said same thing about that dumb “Poppy” girl who emerged on YouTube same time as pgate started. Not occult or cool or even original. Just dull bs for the instahos to hashtag about.

              I saw the news about it and rushed here! We’ve been talking about this devil spawn for 4 years straight.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is MSM damage control/feeble attempt to ‘normalize’ and ‘integrate’, while everyone’s distracted. And of course, comments are ‘turned off’ underneath the YT commercial on the official Microsoft page BUT NOT under the ‘Ted Talk’ version! Reminds me, must go check out latest on Skippy’s twitter LOL.

              I had just sent my wife the MSFT commercial and she was like WTF?  Then we watched Out of Shadows while eating and you could see things click in her head.  She said to me - I knew about every single topic in the documentary.  She was once a sheep.  Still trying to bring her out of the slumber where IRL is more "interesting" and more important than the media programming.

             Long ago I came to voat, i dunno i followed a link to reddit then found reddit sucked and 'pizzagate' i would have mocked you guys but there is something to this conspiracy. Now I believe its possible they are using media to force people to watch to go through a ritual, like all that pentagram shit at the MTV awards, it doesnt matter if you are religious or not or if you believe the point is that some of these freaks that rub elbows with the elite believe it this nasty weird shit.

              Youre right, Its in all these vids, look all the masonry references. And i rmember the Olympic Opening Show, with Annie Lennox. Extremely weird to see, Slaves, Sacrifices, Devils and all that. Or remember Pink and her Mason Outfit. Bit too much for a coincidence.

              And to all the stuff on sites like vigilantcitizen, which claim to enlighten the people.. They have some point, but by watching these things over and over again, maybe you are initiated to the symbolism this way. So be aware, dont consume too much, they are twisting your mind too.

              Im grown and can watch my steps, but it hurts my heart, to see all the underaged "forced" to cosume these weird shit. Like Gagas new Fame. WTF

            I just saw that. As bad as twitter is at censoring people, it spreads too quick for them, especially with so many sitting around not working.
