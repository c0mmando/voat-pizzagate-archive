Only they weren\'t from Chicago, they were from St Louis. I\'ve looked back into this before but I discovered some new things that make me question the story and also noticed another PG reference. Well two actually. Here\'s a quick timeline, the article is at the bottom.</p>
<p>2007</p>
<p>Obama and his personal assistant, Reggie Love, attended a private fundraiser in St Louis where they met Chris Sommers. Reggie Love and Chris Sommers became friends. And we know how close Obama and Reggie were. So a friend of my friend is also my friend?</p>
<p>2008</p>
<p>Obama returns to St Louis as part of his election campaign. By this time Chris Sommers had opened up a pizza restaurant called Pizza Pi. Apparently Reggie Love tells Obama about it, so they order pizzas. According the article, it didn\'t end there. <strong>Sommers let Obama campaign staffers stay over at his house.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sommers says of Obama loving his pizza &quot;I didn\'t even think he was going to eat it.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Here\'s where things get murky. The news article says that later Reggie called up Chris and passed him over to Obama. Obama says to Sommers <strong>&quot;\'This is Sen. Obama. I just want to say that is the best pizza I have ever eaten.\'&quot;.</strong>  Now, I go back to the line about Sommers having Obama staffers stay over.  Tell me I\'m wrong in thinking <em>that</em> phone call must have been when an invitation was made by Sommers for people to come to his house. Did Staffers really go? Or was the invitation for Reggie and Obama only? And how would that even come about. He\'s on the phone to Reggie and Obama and ends up with a house of staffers but not those two?</p>
<p>2009</p>
<p>March the Stratfor email is sent. April, Obama invites Sommers and his business partner to fly to the White House, stay a couple of days and make pizzas for the family.</p>
<p>Obama and the pizza men. Does anyone see similarities between Obama and Sommers and Obama and Alefantis?  I found one more similarity between Sommers and Alefantis apart from their closeness to Obama. Pizza Pi has a <strong>roast chicken pizza</strong> and that pizza is of course called <strong>BUCKTOWN</strong>. And I know that there\'s a Bucktown in Chicago, but before all this began pizza meant pizza and chicken lover meant someone who loved KFC. </p>
