<p>California is ground zero for Clinton Cronies to dictate policy, </p>
<p>Jim Steyer, (founder of Common Sense Media),is forging his way into politisc, 
snd using the voice of children as a plstform, like hillary did,
starting with the  “child bill of rights” known as SB18. </p>
<p>Jim Steyer brother of Tom,(Thomas Fahr Steyer is an American billionaire hedge fund manager, philanthropist,, liberal activist, and fundraiser. he launched NextGen America, a non-profit organization that supports progressive positions on climate change, immigration, health care,
 and education. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Steyer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Steyer</a></p>
<p>partnered with Hillary Clinton for the “Too Small to Fail”  which, is 
the starting point for SB18: an overreaching 
law that will force parents to adhere to and comply with Steyer et al’s 
definition of “appropriate” and “evidence-based” practices when it comes to his 
agenda of how to raise children. Failure to comply will put parents at risk of 
losing their children to the state.  Rember low income families are easier to 
manipulate. </p>
<p>the amendments’ defining details of SB18 —  (being pushed by Big Pharma 
puppet Sen. Richard Pan) appear altruistic , using 
words that attempt to bind political overreach in  terms like “child bill of 
rights.” But, the amendments contain strangely redundant policy that seems to be 
seeking laws for rights that already exist, what is the real purpose for this 
legislation? </p>
<p>For example, 
<a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/2017/03/17/california-bill-sb18-wants-authority-to-ent">https://medicalkidnap.com/2017/03/17/california-bill-sb18-wants-authority-to-ent</a>
er-homes-to-ensure-parents-comply-with-state-mandates-for-child-care/ </p>
<p>it is easy to see what they are really saying: Parents must, because a child has 
rights, allow authorities to implement home visitations to assess living 
conditions in order to implement medical/educational/occupational/technological 
standards coordinated with multiple agencies in order to ensure that parents 
comply with standards as set forth by the state. Frightening on so many levels. </p>
<p>“To imply that parents may have to submit to an in-home visitation program 
because they may be seeking an alternative to ‘evidence-based theories,’ which 
could easily be bought science such as mandatory vaccinations, is an outrage, 
which is exactly what SB18 is saying. </p>
<p>“It definitely paves the way for  medical kidnapping and other 
abuses,” </p>
<p>It is a question of supply and demand .... Supply and demand for pedophiles.. 
Children generate money ...if there is a low supply of children then prices for 
sexual abuse of children will rise.. To keep prices low there needs to be a 
controlled supply of children.. Child protection service.. Look up legal 
defintion of protection under mercwntile law.. The sovereign subsidises the 
storage of commodities so as to control the internal domestic price of a 
commodity. 
So when the Fed provides funds to states to run child protectiin serivce ..what they 
r really doing for the deep state freemaosnic rings that are in every district 
demanding a suppply of children ...is to subsidise the price for these 
networks.. 
Its only fair to take care of freemasonic networks and their demands is it not 
...Are they not to be rewarded for their hard work in running the deep state 
debt networks all across the planet and in washington.. 
Its a service to provide protection for the value of the child.......
Child Protectiin Service.. 
Its all a debt game ...and we r their players wanted to fund this , their debt 
game .. <a href="https://youtu.be/9HTJh4lzAjkYouTube">https://youtu.be/9HTJh4lzAjkYouTube</a> </p>
<p>As we have continued to see increased cases of medical kidnapping and aggressive 
overreach of the medical system and the marriage of scientific opinion to laws, 
parents in California may be seeing a trend first hand that is going to be 
played out in the rest of the nation. Especially since 134 vaccine mandates have 
been introduced in this legislative session, indicating the trend for political 
mandates of your child’s standard of care is nowhere near slowing down. </p>
<p>Many have speculated that SB18 is a part of Agenda 21 and Healthy People 2020 — 
U.N. and U.S.-based initiatives, respectively, that are designed to corral 
populations into the inner cities and enforce a standard of care across the 
board that will implement controls that enable governments to manage portions of 
the population based on their standards and not the choices of the individual.</p>',

           As we have continued to see increased cases of medical kidnapping and aggressive 
overreach of the medical system and the marriage of scientific opinion to laws, 
parents in California may be seeing a trend first hand that is going to be 
played out in the rest of the nation. Especially since 134 vaccine mandates have 
been introduced in this legislative session, indicating the trend for political 
mandates of your child’s standard of care is nowhere near slowing down.

           Many have speculated that SB18 is a part of Agenda 21 and Healthy People 2020 — 
U.N. and U.S.-based initiatives, respectively, that are designed to corral 
populations into the inner cities and enforce a standard of care across the 
board that will implement controls that enable governments to manage portions of 
the population based on their standards and not the choices of the individual.

            Here are the Clintons again pretending to Save the Children at the expense of the Childten. They never seem to succeed as it always turns out the oppodite as you say about SB 18 and Haiti.  SB 18 is the bill that allows CPS to steal Our Children. The Clintons are sure looking out for Our  Families. Not.

             Look up legal defintion of protection under mercwntile law.. The sovereign subsidises the storage of commodities so as to control the internal domestic price of a commodity. So when the Fed provides funds to states to run child protectiin serivce ..what they r really doing for the deep state freemaosnic rings that are in every district demanding a suppply of children ...is to subsidise the price for these networks..

            Writing in complete sentences would be helpful. You should either describe the relevance of each link as required by Rule 3, or embed the link by turning the text it supports into a hotlink, so it's clear which links support which claims.
