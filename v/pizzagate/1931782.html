<p>In his testimony before The  Senate, Comey is asked the reasons for documenting his meetings with Trump.  
</p>
<p>his January 6th meeting in Trump Tower ;
COMEY: &quot; I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I thought it important to document.&quot;</p>
<p>January 27th dinner, where he said &quot;The president began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI director.” 
COMEY: &quot; he\'s (Trump\'s) looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. </p>
<p>Now for the February 14th meeting:  &quot;Something big is about to happen&quot;</p>
<p>SENATOR WARNER: February 14th, seems strange, you were in a meeting, and your direct superior the attorney general was in that meeting as well, yet the president asked everyone to leave, including the attorney general to leave, before he brought up the matter of general Flynn. What was your impression of that type of action? Have you ever seen anything like that before? </p>
<p>COMEY: No. My impression was something big is about to happen. I need to remember every single word that is spoken, and again, I could be wrong, I\'m 56 years old, I\'ve been, seen a few things, my sense was the attorney general knew he shouldn\'t be leaving which was why he was leaving and I don\'t know Kushner well but I think he picked up on the same thing so I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to.</p>',

            Jim Comey is a traitor who stonewalled racketeering investigations in Racine, Wisconsin along with McCabe, Lynch, Kadzik, and others after discovering links to Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, McCain Foundation, and a far-reaching network of foundations, corporations, PACs, NGOs and secret societies. Something big is about to happen, and it involves Racine, Wisconsin and unveiling the real truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              What would you like to know more about? Did you look into the RICO case in Racine, or the accusations of widespread corruption  in the area? Did you see the corrupt mayor is resigning along with the corrupt city administrator in the past 6 months? Did you see the last mayor was arrested on pedo crimes? Did you see the last city administrator tried to commit suicide? Did you learn about the dead judge? Did you see the DA resigned amid corruption allegations and a cover up scandal?

              Do you know about the Knights of Pythias and the Pilgrims Society? Do you know the mafia is still heavily involved in Racine, Kenosha and Milwaukee? Do you know how Racine is both a Sanctuary City and known as a hub for human trafficking? Did you look into the cover up organizations and how they are linked to corrupt foundations and churches?

                It is all true. There is not enough time to provide links for every comment, however we can verify anything you question. What do you need a link on to verify?

                We know Comey and Lynch stonewalled Racine RICO investigations linked to the Clintons because of first hand witness testimony. You can also research public records related to that case, and it is much bigger than anyone can imagine. It is very sincere and very scary. More evidence, testimony and actionable details were provided to authorities at all levels, and the cover up is extremely powerful. This is absolute tyranny. The entire system is too corrupt to fail or jail, and many have tried to do this the right way.
               </p>
               <p>
                Shine the light on Racine and you will see the truth. They are very afraid of Racine being exposed, as it connects to many other hubs linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
