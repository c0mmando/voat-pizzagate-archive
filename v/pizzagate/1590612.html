The Church is located on Google Maps as being at \'Gaithersburg, MD 20877. USA\' - and that\'s it. No street address is provided - but zooming in you\'ll find the address of the Church being \'222\' Cedar Ave, Gaithersburg Maryland. <a href="http://imgur.com/OkdIkhC">http://imgur.com/OkdIkhC</a>
This is a close up of the Church crest, which looks very much like a Freemason/occult type crest, taken from the church of the same name, in nearby Washington DC. <a href="http://imgur.com/Cbw0ida">http://imgur.com/Cbw0ida</a>
Rotate this image and you\'ll see a roped off car park area; blocked driveway; truck out the back, and a double-cab utility and white windowless van, that are positioned ready to drive off.

The police car would of had to have reversed into the spot. And it looks as though a vehicle is parked in that small area regularly. <a href="http://imgur.com/UcaD0dq">http://imgur.com/UcaD0dq</a>
Google Earth shows 3 Churches by this name in Africa. Two are in Lesotho and one in South Africa.
Here\'s the location of the \'Iglesias Ni Cristo Church\' in Mafeteng, Lesotho - obviously a mining site. <a href="http://imgur.com/fHwBR3b">http://imgur.com/fHwBR3b</a>
Looks like something is being transported in and out from the Church property in Gaithersburg, and it must be pretty damn important to have the local police on guard.
Photos are from the Google Maps website - that strangely does not supply an actual address. So what’s the photo communicating I wonder? 
Does anyone know if this US based Church is involved in the Clinton Foundation\'s trafficking of children from Lesotho and South Africa?</p>',

            Some google maps stuff from a single user I thought was weird back in the reddit pizzagate days but I never posted. I think Ill drop it off here. LDS church locations and weird reviews/photos.

            First check out lake delores water park in southern CA... its been closed since like the 90s.... But here is a recent "photo" of it looking brand new. Now that in it self isn't that weird, but if you zoom out and look at all the tags in south america and over seas... all the locations have a picture of the same LDS style church but some of them also have a second image of a little girl smiling. You can street view some of the locations and they look like weird compounds more than an LDS church. I just find it super creepy and it really doesn't make sense why would anyone do this?

            Supposedly any connections to freemasonry are denied by the church, but pretty much ALL of the symbols on their crest are taken directly from it. Scottish rite aprons have all of those symbols on them in various arrangements/combinations.
