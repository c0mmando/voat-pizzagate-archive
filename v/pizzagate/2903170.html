            the child molesting robot was so horrifying, I could not believe the audience laughed.  I think it was the same episode, out of nowhere, not in a skit, the Rock says "Hail Satan"

            Is that a pizza guitar being played? SNL is not funny.  The writers are lacking any comedic talent so they go for shock value. Those skits are sick and sordid.

            Who would down voat this?  A Pedo Shill.  This needs to be more visible.  So Sick.  We don't watch SNL for years now.  Even when not pedo humor, it is still filthy and sick.  When will people start calling this show out and protesting.  There are parents watching this stuff and surely they think the Eric being a pedo is funny because well, it's Eric.  But the joke is on them, the real pedo is DeNiro.  They don't see the forest through the trees.  Blindfolded by Lies.

             They enjoy showing us the perverts they really are. They think as long as it is in a comedy skit everyone will laugh along with them. Wrong. Many of us are watching, and are well aware of their games. That skit on Santa and the elves, and the young boy shows us just what sickos they are. Wonder who wrote that skit? Tells us a lot about that person.

              Whoever wrote it, well it had the seal of approval from Lorne Michaels.  Aside from SNL he is connected to a show from Canada  The Kids in the Hall   some of their shows were trimmed of certain bits that would cause uproars here at that time especially.  Here is one

             <pre><code>Bauer (Thompson) is a young stoner (presumably in his late teens or early twenties) who, as a result of his frequent pot use, is very well-spoken and insightful. In one popular sketch, he reveals to his friend Kyle (McDonald) that he's been having an affair with Kyle's married mother (Foley), which of course is very unsettling to Kyle. Bauer waxes poetic about the mother's beauty, then stands up, announcing he's "got a chub-on". Bauer first appeared on the show as the best friend of Bobby Terrance (see below), but later became a recurring character in his own right.

              The Chicken Lady
             </p>
             <pre><code>Mark McKinney played a half-human half-chicken who is completely oblivious to how freakish and terrifying people find her. In one episode, she flashes back to a moment from her adolescence when she is stuck in her room as the other kids have a party; one kid (who is expecting a sexual encounter) is thrown inside her room as a prank. In another sketch, she visits a strip club with her companion the Bearded Lady (Kevin McDonald), and loses her cool when a dancer known as Rooster Boy (Scott Thompson) takes the stage. Most Chicken Lady sketches revolve around her extremely strong sexual desires; her catchphrase is "Gotta get laid", and she is frequently seen having wild orgasms which are punctuated with an explosion of feathers.

              Darill
             </p>
             <pre><code>A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), who never quite understands what is going on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys everyone he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill as a child in Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.

              Some blocked out nudity.  Also free talk about gays and the name The Kids in the Hall came from Sid Ceasar Show and the comic writers.  On of those writers was Woody Allen.  Was this his homage to Woody?  Idk, but it seems to me that Lorne was cutting his teeth in Canada before he spread his filth here.  Yes, I think he was testing the pedo waters.

             I didn't say it was, but depends on how you look at it. If I were a fly on the wall of the writers' room, I'd probably be shocked. Imagine what they talked about that didn't get into the skit.
