            Guys, maybe voat isn't the safest place to be? At least, if the CIA is using voat to transition disinfo from Reddit/Wikileaks/Assange/Pizzagate etc?
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe we should consider using both Voat and another outlet in case this transition was schemed?

            I don't see a problem here. Persecution has been around since Man had ideas.
If this were a credible threat, all it means is we need to back up all info for an eventual migration.

            Jesus, any other links or articles to back up the claim that voat is compromised? Honestly a legit question, I want to dig deeper into this if there's something to go off... Cheers.
