            Let's see how long it takes to find the first fake fact.   UPDATE:  the first fact about a Clinton insider is fake.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FACT 2 (F2) OFFICIAL POLICE SKETCHES LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE THE PODESTA BROTHERS.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            These sketches were not done by the police, but by private investigators.   The police did release them, so this was questionable until I saw the image.  The text on the image says these MEN are wanted by the police.   Not True.  A definite fake fact.   The sketches are said by police to be the SAME MAN who is between 20 and 40 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            They try to finesse their lie here.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Some have responded that the sketches are only representations of one person. This is false. Initially reports indicated just one suspect, but it has grown to potentially as many as six. As confirmed by the BBC.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The BBC page they link to make clear these are sketches of the SAME MAN.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The two e-fit images released are of a man
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There's two sketches because two witness walking together saw the same man at the same time, they just described him differently to the sketch artists.  It's impossible for this man to the PODESTA BROTHERS.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sculpture the Arch of Hysteria is not the same pose as the Dahmer victim and the artists conceived of it before Dahmer was arrested and debuted it before the images of the Dahmer's victims became public.  There's zero connection here.
           </p>
           <p>
            This one is just a masterpiece is deception.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FACT 6 (F6): TONY PODESTA HAS BEEN FRIENDS WITH DOCUMENTED PEDOPHILE DENNIS HASTERT FOR MANY YEARS, HE STILL KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH HIM, AND THE TWO TRAVELED TOGETHER TO JAPAN TO MINGLE WITH STUDENTS.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Podesta was friends with Hastert for many years.  True.   Has he been in contact with Hastert AFTER it was revealed that Hastert was a pedophole.  NO EVIDENCE for this claim.
Does he still keep in touch with Hastert after it was revealed he was a PEDOPHILE?  NO EVIDENCE for this claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this part is just amazing. The last fact that is noted, after is this one.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             , AND THE TWO TRAVELED TOGETHER TO JAPAN TO MINGLE WITH STUDENTS.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The two traveled together?  Just the two of them?  No, the two traveled in a group of students and chaperones YEARS before Hastert abused his victims and FIVE DECADES before it came out.  They met because they were part of a Student Ambassador program for high school students and they went to Japan together, TO MINGLE with STUDENT'S THEIR OWN AGE.  This is just a masterwork of bullshit and manipulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the dude weaves a conspiracy theory out of some facts, some lies and some half truths and has the gall to say
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ALL CONSPIRACY THEORIES ASIDE, WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION TO STATE THE FOLLOWING AS FACTUALLY TRUE:
J and T. Podesta very much match the police descriptions of child abduction suspects.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            False.    If you ignore the age and the fact it's only one person, one suspect.   Not plural.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             T. Podesta collects imagery representing child abduction and abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             T. Podesta associates with a convicted child molester.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            False.  No evidence for present tense.   (Also, a nitpick if you are concerned for facts, Hastert committed a financial crime while paying off his victim, he was only convicted of this financial crime, confirmed child molester would be truthful here, but convicted child molester is not.)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             T. Podesta has stuffed animals near his bed despite not having children of his own.
            </p>
            <p>
             J. Podesta’s emails are missing during the time of the child abduction.
            </p>
            <p>
             J. Podesta’s assistant was covering his emails on May 4, 2007, the day after the child abduction.
            </p>
            <p>
             J. and T. Podesta have been unresponsive to widespread allegations that they are involved in child abduction.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            thelastamericanvagabond  can't even try to create factual post without lying all over the place.

             Your agenda here is so blatantly obvious. No one cares to refute your obviously slanted and opinionated "facts" because no one here is stupid enough to fall for your shilling. Run along shill. You are transparent. The facts are all there for those genuinely seeking truth to research for themselves. Clearly you hoped that people would be stunned by your long and angry ad-hominem riddled response, so much so that they would take it for truth and not dive into the material themselves, but like I said, those in this sub are smarter than you give them credit for. A simple look back at your comments and MSM references reveal either your ignorance, or your agenda, I say both. So run along. Cue the emotional response...
