            are you referring to the small room with the silver (actually metal) walls?  if so, that's a walk-in cooler - you can see the fan assembly on the right wall - i see nothing especially sinister with that

                hey, wait a min - i didn't process fully what you just said - "... so they said it was a killroom?"
               </p>
               <p>
                you mean that the friends of someone that was implicated in PG described the cooler as a kill-room?
               </p>
               <p>
                if so, that is interesting
               </p>
               <p>
                it is, in fact, a cooler, but obviously i do not know what purpose it was used for and it is certainly possible is was used to store bodies or body parts, fluids, etc.

                not necessarily because i don't know the history of the topic, or even where the image is actually from - i just saw it somewhere and it was linked to PG and described as a "kill room", or something similar
               </p>
               <p>
                i recognized what it actually was immediately because i've seen many walk-in coolers (matter of fact, i'm sitting within a few hundred feet of one) - the tell-tale signs are metal walls (often stainless steel) and the refrigeration unit on the wall or ceiling - half the unit is inside and half outside (compressor, etc) -

                  right - i can see that - but also, what is often stored in a cooler? meat - meat = kill-room - not a stretch at all if someone is being funny, but if in fact the pic is factually linked to someone implicated in PG, then, as i said, the whole thing

            0:52 - "this will not be a debunking of the entire theory" .. video title:
            <strong>
             PizzaGate Debunked
            </strong>
            ... we'll, aren't we off to a great start :)
           </p>
           <p>
            1:15 - 'handkerchief code' - no white color on the wikipedia page ... no, there isn't today, but there was on
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Handkerchief_code&amp;oldid=748564208">
             8 November 2016
            </a>
            and it is referencing "Virginity" - white is also referenced in several previous versions and missing in others - in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Handkerchief_code&amp;oldid=618962107">
             2014
            </a>
            it is listed as symbolizing "Masturbation"
           </p>
           <p>
            ~1:30 - thinks "
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">
             The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.
            </a>
            " sounds perfectly normal, except it doesn't when you consider the wider context of these emails and factor in "pizza" and all the other evidence - and what kind of map would be "pizza-related"? and what kind of pizza related map would be on a handkerchief? and why did she use the words "I think it has a map that seems pizza-related" instead of 'I think it has a map
            <strong>
             on it
            </strong>
            that seems pizza-related'? and why "
            <em>
             seems
            </em>
            pizza-related"? was it hard to tell? and why cc the email to
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="eb8e999285c5988e9b9bab8c868a8287c5888486" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
            if she knew it was John's handkerchief? there is nothing at all about this exchange that makes sense to me, especially given the broader picture
           </p>
           <p>
            you can't isolate a single piece of evidence when there are probably hundreds of supporting pieces and proclaim there's nothing unusual about it
           </p>
           <p>
            ~1:40 - says they talked allot, along with their colleagues, about going out for meals, "and in particular, going out for pizza", but concludes that the pizza references are perfectly benign - you can only ignore the multiple pizza references if you do not factor in the code words
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            disregard all of the other pieces of evidence - isolating the pizza references might be fine
            <em>
             if
            </em>
            we didn't already know that pedophilia is rampant in various large institutions, including government, long before PizzaGate,
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            we didn't see the 'fuck' reference on the bathroom wall at Comet,
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            we didn't see the creepy video of a party there, and... and,,, and,,, and,,,
           </p>
           <p>
            2:20 - back to the handkerchief code - "there is no white here on the bottom" (referencing the wikipedia page) and "clearly white was added on the bottom - it's been fabricated" - it was added, yes, but not completely fabricated as pointed out previously in the page edit history
           </p>
           <p>
            4:37 - "there's no proof anywhere of sources to support that white equals virginity or pedophilia" - well, if he's going to rely on wikipedia as a source, which he did, then the 'proof' he seeks is in the edit history that he didn't review throughly
           </p>
           <p>
            7:45 - the arched-back sculpture - in essence he admits that the sculpture represents sick shit (discourse of madness, emotional disturbance, hysteria, mental illness, etc.) and makes the analogy that the sculpture is not so similar to how Jeffrey Dahmer posed his victim (arms are not folded in the sculpture, etc.), except on the
            <a href="https://archive.is/GyM4Z">
             very same page
            </a>
            he is using for reference, he offers no explanation for the
            <a href="https://remedianetwork.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/arch-2.png">
             illustration by Charles Bell
            </a>
            which shows the arms folded, finally concluding it has "nothing to do remotely with Jeffrey Dahmer or murder or pedophilia - nothing of the sort"
           </p>
           <p>
            9:21 - i quit -  don't know about anyone else, but i've seen and heard enough at this point that i had no interest in viewing the rest of the video - the good news is, i'd say in another lifetime or 2 he may develop the necessary analytical skills to earn his junior G-man badge

            Ok, I'll concede that it makes more sense in that context. Not everything has to be related. I just think people should look into things as they arise. Thank you for the information.

            If they had nothing to hide they wouldn't have changed logos and taken down paintings. And if he missed all you said above, he isn't paying attention. This is an ongoing investigation and there are bound to be some strawmen and low hanging fruit for a normie to munch on.

            I think it's good to post things like this but the way the information is presented is not very effective imo.
            <br/>
            I tried to watch it but so much time is spent (in a 34 minute video) simply scrolling through pictures and slowly reading captions, I couldn't even make it all the way through. It seems like he doesn't debunk as much as playdown the possible significance of various things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe I just don't have the attention span to sit through this ...  sorry :\
           </p>
           <p>
            In the interest of making the information more easily accessible, do you think you could summarize what points he debunks?
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that might be an unreasonable request given the length of the video. If that's too much, can you maybe comment on some of the points that stuck out to you as most significant?

              Well, the first time I tried to watch it, I realized how long it was and the pace was so slow that I doubted I could get through it. I actually found it easier to get through the whole thing when I was taking notes. He's an amateur so I cut him a little slack with the quality of the video. Some of his points are better than others though. Most of what he tries to "debunk" is curious information taken in a particularly speculative direction. For example, on the "chicken lover" picture, he focuses on the fact that it's a necklace and not a bracelet in the video AND also that even if it was a sex bracelet, yellow is not always defined as analingus. I wasn't aware that the picture was being taken in this direction in the first place. But again, he ignores the most damning information and focuses on the tangential information.

              You make good arguments regarding the first 9 minutes.

              He also spoke like he was very familiar with Podesta and Abramovic...He called her Marina. He didn't seem objective. He isn't a random person trying to give his honest opinion. He seemed very knowledgeable about the people, like he knew them.

              Investigation doesn't mean finding things that match your theory but to objectively look at evidence to see if it is reasonable.

             <p>
              Not a full debunking of the entire theory.

              Counter point: Other emails reference these two often talk about going out for lunch, going to one anothers houses, going out for pizza. 
[Other emails not cited specifically to show this. I think most people are familiar with talking about going out for lunch and visiting each other. He doesn't even address the weird phrasing that seems so creepy. How does this context make the pizza related map thing make more sense?]

White = (not on original wikipedia image) virginity/pedophilia
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: The swatch for white has been added to the original wikipedia image. Goes through various sources of what color codes mean. Most suggest that white means safe sex or masturbation. Therefore he must only be into s&amp;m and safe sex or masturbation. 
[Odd that he still makes this conclusion after telling people not to jump to conclusions... I'm not convinced that the handkerchief necessarily means anything, however, considering the laws protecting children from pedophilia, why would people openly indicate that white means virginity? Virgins can be adults of course but it seems that there is also reason to avoid suspicions.]

               Tamera Luzzatto email: "We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you'll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure."
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: Luzzatto implying that her kids will be further entertainment because her kids are a handful and kids are crazy.
[I considered this interpretation too, but the way she says it is still really strange. It's possible she just meant that her kids love swimming so they will "for sure" be in the pool. It's just so strange in the context she presents it while noting all the ages of the kids.]

             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: Blog is a raw and uncut look into Evie's life. Just a blog where you can see these children. No pedophilia here. Simply taken out of context.
             </p>
             <p>
              [Maybe. Maybe not. This is another unverified conclusion. It is an interesting word choice at the very least. Raw and uncut are words used to describe pornography as well. Maybe it's an odd word choice. Maybe it's something more. This doesn't disprove anything.]

              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: Pose is not EXACTLY like Dahmer's victim. 
Common and note worthy art piece. "Literal and figurative suspension of a normative historical discourse of madness". Therefore nothing to do with murder or pedophilia or Dahmer. Just an edgy art piece.

             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: No bandage to be found. Just patch of skin that looks discolored in photo. Common for older men to have scars on hands. Could be from anything. Says Podesta intends to have surgery on hand.
             </p>
             <p>
              Evidence is easy to "disprove" with simple google search. 14 + Fish and the Osiris Myth can't be the case because the email talks about global initiative #14 about caring for oceans and life under water.
             </p>
             <p>
              [I wasn't a huge believer of that theory to begin with but his google search doesn't actually disprove anything. I agree that it is more likely the email is in reference to the global goals in the email.]

             <p>
              Counter point: Brings up Washington Post article "With La Boum Boum Room D C Just Got A Lot Weirder". 
Insists that cell phone use is prohibited because there are shows going on. [Doesn't mention that it is called a pansexual paradise... but ok]

             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter Point: Necklace is not a sex bracelet [well yeah]
Most sites suggest that yellow means hugging although one suggests analingus as alternative meaning. 
[This was not what I found disturbing about this post. For me it was the "chicken lover" part. He doesn't even mention this for some reason.]

               Picture of construction work at Comet pizza. Comet Pizza and neighbors have not filed a building permit in last three years. Creepy since it is known that there are underground tunnels in DC.
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: There is a door with sunlight so it's not underground. Therefore, just renovation work.
Looking at streetview it is clear that the front entrance is higher than the back entrance. So building might have underground walk-in basement Not sketchy. 
[Wouldn't they still need a building permit? I really have no idea but he didn't mention the building permits at all]

             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point 1: Ex boyfriend of Brock so makes sense that he has political connections and fans. Just because they've broken up doesn't mean he lost his influence.
             </p>
             <p>
              [Is Alefantis the only boyfriend of David Brock that is influential?]
             </p>
             <p>
              Counter point 2: It's not so strange that he's a restaurant owner on there. There is at least one other restaurant guy. #41 is Jose Andres who is a "restaurateur". Therefore it totally makes sense. 
[I didn't think this was a big theory but ok]

             </ol>
             <p>
              Counter point: [Seriously, the most condescending part of the video] Most of the pictures on her tumblr and instagram now are not of half-naked children. Except maybe one.
             </p>

             <p>
              Counter Point: Internationally recognized symbol of Islam. Probably just a coincidence. Maybe just the style they are going with.
             </p>
             <p>
              [I don't think the crescents and stars have much to do with anything. The way he explains it, it sounds like he thinks that Islam is the "style" they are going with. If he meant that the crescents and stars were a style they were going with then I can agree though.]

              Counter point: From a video of 5 things that are easier to do than voting. Or a video to show how easy it is to vote. Shows that kit happens to have pizza charms on box and not many to choose from. Biden is just goofy.

             </p>
             <p>
              [He has nothing to say about the fact that other artists involved with the place also do artwork of children tied up. He doesn't even address any of the art from other artists. I think the artwork of the children tied up on the wall is much more creepy. Maybe these artists just did a few of these kinds of things ... but that doesn't make it better in my opinion.]

              Counter point: Look at pictures without assuming it implies pedophilia. Take a deep breath and remember that while it may look creepy, it's probably not.
             </p>
             <p>
              Image of child tied up: The child is laughing/having a good time. Cute joke and must be taken out of context.
             </p>
             <p>
              [Not convincing for me at all. The fact that the child seems to smiling does not mean that it's ok ...]

             <p>
              Counter point: Clearly a hot spot for gay men. A popular place for families to come eat. Being weird and being gay isn't a crime.
             </p>
             <p>
              [Why is a family friendly place so overtly sexualized? I'm not saying that being gay or weird is a crime. But how do you have a place that is overtly sexual while being family and kid friendly?]
             </p>
             <p>
              Conclusion: Do equal research. Don't find things that confirm theory. Look into contradictory theories. Do quick google searches. 
[Reasonable advice overall. The condescension in "do quick google searches" is annoying because he acts like all of this stuff is so blatantly obvious ... but it's not. Even with his "quick google searches" he wasn't able to disprove any points, just express skepticism in the claims.]
