<p>According to the news released on March 31:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Police around the world have taken down a global child abuse ring with links to over 40 countries through a Belgian investigation supported by Europol. 4 suspects have been convicted today by a Belgian court.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This case was sparked by the Belgian East Flanders Federal Judicial Police (Federale Gerechtelijke Politie Oost-Vlaanderen) after more than 9 million pictures and videos of the abuse of thousands of children from around the world were found there during a house search.</strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of this footage had never been seen in circulation before by law enforcement. Suspecting they were producing their own, the Belgian investigators launched Operation GARGAMEL together with Europol across Europe and beyond .  The image and video data seized during this investigation has been used for Victim Identification Task Forces hosted by Europol through which  70 children and 30 suspects have been identified. The Belgian Federal Judicial Police succeeded in identifying 60 suspects (of which 24 in Belgium) and 40 victims, which brings the actual total to 90 suspects and 110 victims. </p>
<p>Some suspects have already appeared before court in a number of other countries. In Australia, a suspect was sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>More arrests and rescues are expected globally as police in over 40 countries examine the intelligence packages compiled by Europol and information from the Belgian Federal Judicial Police.&quot;</p>',

            For anyone who has seen the European video "opposing" human trafficking, perhaps it was Dutch (?), where the children were wearing masks and jokingly playing with female adult toys, there is a black &amp; white clip of an "investigator" going "undercover" in a child brothel in SE Asia. It's completely clear in the video that this "investigator" is actually a customer who is seen getting his genitalia touched by a child prostitute prospect. Pedophilia is inevitable, especially in a society that conditions females to dress in aboriginal-like attire specifically designed to attract male mates, be it women or children (skirt, dress, short shorts, etc), but these demons not only give in to this fallen way, they consign their names to market systems selling this, by keeping kids on tap 24/7, be it 1AM, 2AM, 3AM, etc. This is the line they cross worthy of execution.

            Operation GARGAMEL
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting to note Gargamel is a fictional character and the main protagonist from The Smurfs. He is an evil wizard, the sworn enemy of the Smurfs and a giant in size (compared to them)
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes, he wants to eat the Smurfs, while other times, he wants to use them to make gold, and still other times, he has even more bizarre uses for them (in one instance, he is so enraged by his loss that he yells "I don't want to eat them, I don't want to turn them into gold, all I want now is to DESTROY THEM!").

              When on mobile, you need to select "view desktop site" in your browser settings. You can then see the sidebar as well as all the formatting buttons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, if you click "view source" under someone else's comment or submission text, it will open the source code box so you can see the CSS coding used to create the formatting. For example, quotation boxes have a &gt; in front of each line. Once you know this formatting code, you can just type it as you write, without resorting to the buttons.
             </p>
             <p>
              To turn a text into a hyperlink, place brackets around the text you want to turn into a link, immediately followed (no space separating) by the url in parenthesis.
             </p>

              To make a headline with line under it, put a "#" in front of the text with no space after it. To create a bold headline without a line under it, put a "##". (Those are the first two options under the "H" button).
