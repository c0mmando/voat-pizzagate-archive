<blockquote>
<p>Germany’s paedophile past reared its head again <strong>in 2013</strong> when <strong>links emerged between founding members of the Green Party and West Germany’s Paedophile Movement,</strong> <em>which rode the coat-tails of gay-rights groups and</em> <strong>lobbied for the decriminalisation of consensual sex between adults and children.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In</strong> <strong><em>1975</em></strong> <strong>a Green Party leading light,</strong> <strong><em>Daniel Cohn-Bendit,</em></strong> <strong>who was</strong> <strong><em>a kindergarten teacher at the time, wrote a book praising “erotic games” between adults and young children.</em></strong> <strong>In 1981</strong> <strong><em>Jürgen Trittin, today a senior Green MP and then a young party official in Göttingen, signed off on a party pamphlet seeking the decriminalisation of paedophilia.</em></strong></p>

<p>Looking at the &quot;Berggruen Institute Councils and Committees&quot; and &quot;Berggruen Institute Programs and Work&quot; sections, particularly the latter, of the Berggruen Institute wiki gave me the sinking gut feeling of &quot;this sounds like stuff Epstein\'s fingers would be all over&quot;.</p>

<p>Keating later went on to date photographer Francesco Carrozzini, 36, the aristocratic son of the late Italian Vogue editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani.</p>
<p>He was a co-executive producer of her video series and is now now married to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour\'s daughter Bea Shaffer, 32.</p>
<p>Keating is now believed to be single but when the two collaborated, they worked together on the interview with Maxwell. </p>
<p>It saw her describe the accused procurer of underage girls for a the pedophile as \'a philanthropist\' and discuss her work on The TerraMar Project – an eco-initiative aimed at protecting the ocean, which was hastily shuttered after Epstein was hit with new charges in July.</p>
<p>In it, Maxwell urged readers to sign a pledge to become \'ocean citizens\' and railed about the sea becoming \'the world\'s dumping ground\'. </p>
<p><strong>The One On One series was part of WorldPost, which was set up by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington and another Epstein associate, Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire American-German businessman, whose name also appears in the financier\'s little black book.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Berggruen, 58, is the founder of the Berggruen Institute. Keating continues to be described as a \'New Leader\' on the 21st Century Council.</strong></p>
<p>According to its website, the Institute was \'established in 2010 to develop foundational ideas about how to reshape political and social institutions in the face of global change.\'</p>
<p>The interview was not Keating\'s first known encounter with Maxwell either; in September 2013, the pair were both photographed attending a party for the launch of New York based social media platform IdeaPod at Ghislaine\'s E65th street Manhattan home.</p>

In July, activists at Marcato Capital Management revealed a 6.6% stake, saying that the shares were undervalued. At that point, <strong>Marcato and Third Point were Sotheby\'s second and third-largest shareholders,</strong> <strong><em>following BlackRock Fund Advisors.</em></strong>[125] Third Point\'s August purchase brought its stake in Sotheby\'s to 3.9 million shares.[126]</p>

            After two "tense" hearings before the EP Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), her nomination was rejected on 10 October 2019, with 82 votes against, 32 in favour and 1 abstention.[10][11][12][13] The rejection was linked to her inability to explain her effective work for the Berggruen Institute, and the fact that she explained that she would not resign even if she was formally indicted[14]

            He was a co-executive producer of her video series and is now now married to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour's daughter Bea Shaffer, 32.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keating is now believed to be single but when the two collaborated, they worked together on the interview with Maxwell.
           </p>
           <p>
            It saw her describe the accused procurer of underage girls for a the pedophile as 'a philanthropist' and discuss her work on The TerraMar Project – an eco-initiative aimed at protecting the ocean, which was hastily shuttered after Epstein was hit with new charges in July.
           </p>
           <p>
            In it, Maxwell urged readers to sign a pledge to become 'ocean citizens' and railed about the sea becoming 'the world's dumping ground'.

             The One On One series was part of WorldPost, which was set up by Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington and another Epstein associate, Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire American-German businessman, whose name also appears in the financier's little black book.

            According to its website, the Institute was 'established in 2010 to develop foundational ideas about how to reshape political and social institutions in the face of global change.'
           </p>
           <p>
            The interview was not Keating's first known encounter with Maxwell either; in September 2013, the pair were both photographed attending a party for the launch of New York based social media platform IdeaPod at Ghislaine's E65th street Manhattan home.
