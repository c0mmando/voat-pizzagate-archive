<p>It\'s being reported that a Hollywood dentist was kicked off of a flight for making an anti-Trump comment, but to me it seems that there\'s more to this story than that. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/hollywood-dentist-booted-flight-anti-trump-comment-article-1.2983912">http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/hollywood-dentist-booted-flight-anti-trump-comment-article-1.2983912</a></p>
<p>First, it\'s been speculated that there\'s something about dentists and MK Ultra as Epstein had a fully functioning dental chair on his island.</p>
<p>Back to the article, celebrity dentist and Iranian immigrant Shawn Sadri was seated beside a boy about 6 or 7 years old. Sadri says the boy was crying and asked him what was wrong and if he was alone. According to Sadri, “Out of nowhere, he runs down the aisle and starts screaming!” When the flight attendant came to see what was going on, he made a joke about Trump trying to deport the boy because he couldn\'t speak English.</p>
<p>So, a few things aren\'t passing the smell test with me.</p>
<pre><code>How did he know the boy didn\'t speak English if the boy never said a word to him and just ran screaming down the aisle?
The boy is old enough to tell someone why he was screaming as he ran away, so why is that not in the article?
Wouldn\'t you ask a child crying on a plane, &quot;Where\'s your mom/dad?&quot; I find it odd to ask a child if they\'re alone.
I thought children traveling by themselves were always seated behind the cockpit, so the flight attendants could keep a close eye on them.
The fact that the dentist decided to make a joke out of the boy\'s behavior appears to be a way to deflect from whatever he did/said to the boy. I would think a normal, rational person would\'ve said something like &quot;Is he OK? Where\'s his mom? I didn\'t mean to frighten him. etc.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Here\'s an article about a man who says that Sadri attacked him in a bar <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/06/17/celebrity-dentist-sued-for-allegedly-beating-man-in-downtown-lounge/">http://nypost.com/2014/06/17/celebrity-dentist-sued-for-allegedly-beating-man-in-downtown-lounge/</a></p>
<p>I\'m thinking we need to look into Sadri some more. Who does he associate with? Any articles with more information about this event on the plane? How did he become the chosen dentist of celebrities?</p>

            No offense, but do you have any other reasons for suspecting this guy other than:
1)  He's a dentist.
2)  Some kid on a plane next to him cried.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have worked in the medical field for 20+ years, have MDs as family and "friends," and I can tell you without a doubt that our "medical professionals" -- including DDSs and DMDs -- are some of the most mentally unstable, dysfunctional, and addicted folks you will ever come across.  They're just really good at keeping them secret.  For that reason, it wouldn't surprise me one whit if this guy is some kind of perv.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, there are scores of dentists in the country.  Again, please don't be offended.  I just wasted several minutes on a wild goose chase on another thread and don't want to repeat it.
