<p>By  Sara Carter  August 12, 2019</p>
<p>Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne delivered to the Department of Justice a number of documents, including emails and text messages, in April, regarding both the origins of the Russian investigation, and an FBI operation into Hillary Clinton with which he was personally involved during the first months of 2016, according to a U.S. official who spoke SaraACarter.com. Byrne has also confirmed the account.</p>
<p>Byrne claims the documents, which have not been made public and are currently under investigation by the DOJ, are allegedly communications he had with the FBI concerning both the Clinton investigation and the origins of the Russian investigation. SaraACarter.com did not review the documents, which are now under review by law enforcement.</p>
<p>He approached the DOJ and met with lawyers on April 5th and 30th. The first meeting was without counsel in Washington D.C. A source directly familiar with the interviews confirmed Byrne’s account of the meetings.</p>
<p>OJ officials said they could not comment on Byrne’s allegations.</p>
<p>“I gave to the DOJ documents concerning both the origin of the Russian probe and the probe into Hillary Clinton, both of which I was involved in, and both of which turned out to be less about law enforcement than they were about political espionage,” Byrne told SaraACarter.com Monday. #He noted that the communications will prove that the FBI also had an operation into Clinton Foundation that he was directly involved in.</p>

            I'm not getting how or why the CEO of Overstock.com would have valuable dirt on the Clintons or the FBI investigation of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the previous submission on this, the main link was to Fox News interviewing him about the new cryptocurrency Overstock is launching (???Dafuq???). I'm skeptical.

             My understanding is that he has dirt on Brennan and Comey (deep state) and that they had Clinton et al. spied upon as well. He does not have dirt on Clinton specifically, as I understand it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the crypto thing weirds me out too. As it did with Ben Swann.

             Not sure why you're skeptical. If he was interviewed by the FBI, it sort of cements and validates his importance. Maybe this is the key you're missing. He was dating Maria Butina, the woman convicted of being a Russian spy. It's how he could have a decidedly different perspective, and be in the position of knowing things that others couldn't. Here:

              Quirky Angle – Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne: 2016 FBI Activity Was “Political Espionage”…
             </h1>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             In a rath&gt;er curious and quirky interview, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne describes a related aspect to the DOJ/FBI operations against candidate Donald Trump in 2016.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Byrne enters the story due to his romantic relationship with Maria Butina, a person charged by Robert Mueller as being a Russian intelligence operative.  In/around 2015 Byrne met and started a relationship with Butina, and later was enlisted by the FBI for assistance in their investigation of her.  [Sara Carter Backstory Here]
             </p>
             <p>
              Mr. Byrne now describes all of that FBI activity as somewhat of a political espionage operation to spy on several 2016 candidates, collect dirt, and seemingly gain operational leverage.
             </p>

             I hope that supplies the missing info you need. And the entire point of that initial interview is that the interview was supposed to be on crytocurrency and it spiraled into a rather nifty summary of what will take place. The fact he delivered on his promise should gain him some validity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Surprised you're not getting this ... I would have thought you would.

            There is so much evidence against Hillary Clinton. Please let there be justice. There are too many people who now believe that our government was/is covering for criminal behavior. Not a good situation.

             So happy that he did this. Overjoyed! There's something else going on also. I need to post about that, too.

             I really do hope there is a video. I think that idea came from Virginia Giuffre. I hope there's a Manchurian Candidate video also. Q promised.
