            Megan Markle is still hugely popular and influential with young people. For her and her PR team to allow stories like this to come out where she is popularising themes such as incest and paedophilia is a concern when we know shes now part of the Netflix degeneracy which has included Big Mouth and Cuties.  This is just a year after the Prince Andrew scandal as well. After all the criticism the royals went through we now have Prince Harry's wife making child sex abuse sound cool by framing it as "liberating" feminist literature.

            Anyone else noticed she has a weird body shape, kinda masculine hips.  She hides it but was obvious in some semi nude scenes in Suits. Her proportions are off.  Maybe a hermafridite thing going on.
