<blockquote>
<p>When she started dating the royal in 2016, she used an email which featured a term which was a nod to the French author’s autobiographical novel The Four-Chambered Heart.</p>
<p>The book includes a threesome which is described as an “explosive amorous rendezvous”.</p>
<p>Meghan’s address included a reference to a quote from the female lead Djuna, who says to her married male lover, Rango: “I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.”</p>
<p>“A lot of Anais’ books are quite explicit but Meghan likes the arty way they are written.</p>
<p>“Anais is a feminist icon and Meghan found what she wrote very interesting and liberating.</p>
<p>“She used that email address for ages but I don’t think she ever thought anyone would realise what it was in relation to.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaïs_Nin">Anais Nin wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the third volume of her unexpurgated journal, Incest, she wrote about her father candidly and graphically (207–15), detailing his sexual abuse of her at age nine.</p>
<p>While visiting her estranged father in France, the then-thirty-year-old Nin had a brief incestuous sexual relationship with him.</p>
<p>In New York, Anaïs rejoined Otto Rank, who had previously moved there, and moved into his apartment. She actually began to act as a psychoanalyst herself, seeing patients in the room next to Rank\'s, and having sex with her patients on the psychoanalytic couch.[14] She quit after several months, however, stating: &quot;I found that I wasn\'t good because I wasn\'t objective. I was haunted by my patients. I wanted to intercede.&quot;</p>
<p>Little Birds is Anaïs Nin\'s second published work of erotica. The sexual topics covered are quite varied, ranging from pedophilia to lesbianism</p>

<p>What a strange hero for Markle to have such an obsession with. She really does defy the prim and proper image of a lady she likes to put out to the world.</p>',

            Megan Markle is still hugely popular and influential with young people. For her and her PR team to allow stories like this to come out where she is popularising themes such as incest and paedophilia is a concern when we know shes now part of the Netflix degeneracy which has included Big Mouth and Cuties.  This is just a year after the Prince Andrew scandal as well. After all the criticism the royals went through we now have Prince Harry's wife making child sex abuse sound cool by framing it as "liberating" feminist literature.

            Anyone else noticed she has a weird body shape, kinda masculine hips.  She hides it but was obvious in some semi nude scenes in Suits. Her proportions are off.  Maybe a hermafridite thing going on.
