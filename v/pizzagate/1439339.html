<p>Some other anon posted this url:
<a href="http://phonograph.lhohq.info/">http://phonograph.lhohq.info/</a></p>
<p>and this list of emails:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/Qri9JpnM">http://pastebin.com/Qri9JpnM</a></p>
<p>So I crawled all the links and these were the urls I found, here is the list (I just went 3 levels deep):
<a href="http://pastebin.com/GRpU7qjf">http://pastebin.com/GRpU7qjf</a></p>
<p>Here is the meta title, meta descriptin the date that sends the header of the page and in what level I found that page,
this is in a CSV format you other anons can manipulate the data:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/r7wreyj3">http://pastebin.com/r7wreyj3</a></p>
<p>Here is a list of all the images that were found in the domain &quot;http://www.lhohq.info&quot; with their alt tag, the size
of the file, the type and the date the header send as the date of the image:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/9TmVKcqm">http://pastebin.com/9TmVKcqm</a></p>
<p>From there I scrapped all the &quot;Whois&quot; information from the domains that appeared in the 3 level crawling I did, here
is the csv data:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/kwL3YqBw">http://pastebin.com/kwL3YqBw</a></p>
<p>From there I extracted the social media accounts that are linked to each one of the domains that I crawled, here is the 
csv data:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/V5FGwXAp">http://pastebin.com/V5FGwXAp</a></p>
<p>Now lets go with the data from all the email list ok, so the first thing I did was to get all the domains from the 
emails with no duplication and here is the list. 
<a href="http://pastebin.com/d86307Gf">http://pastebin.com/d86307Gf</a></p>
<p>From that list of domains  I made a match with those who were in the open corporate to see any possible links, here is the
csv that has the domains that contains an open corporate profile, with the link to the profile:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/6dtHRy0s">http://pastebin.com/6dtHRy0s</a></p>
<p>After that I extracted all the social media accounts from the domains that were in the email list, here is the csv file:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/nhUwQCvt">http://pastebin.com/nhUwQCvt</a></p>
<p>Once I did that I extracted all the &quot;Whois&quot; information from those domains, here is the CSV file:
<a href="http://pastebin.com/UfR46tgB">http://pastebin.com/UfR46tgB</a></p>
<p>I think we need to structure more this information, and start asking more questions, following up with them gathering
information to answer them or refute them, imagine we are helping Trump to take these bastards to trial, we need proof!!
and we need to have a estructured approach even among the chaos that is 4chan, example here are some questions/analysis
that need to be done:</p>
<p>a) Are there any hiden messages on the images of the above site related to the podesta emails?, about CP? Prices?
b) Does the images have meta data? is this metadata related to Pizzagate? how does it relate?
c) Why is that list of emails important? what common ground have all those people? (we are assuming they are in the 
pizagate, but how? we need to tight their relationships with the tools and information we have)
d) Links, are the domains interlinked? what parts are linked? if they have reciprocal links is because maybe somebody
in both organization know each other/
e) Do they tweet/Like/Instagram about Pizzagate related stuff? Do they use the same words that we have seen in the podesta
emails?</p>
<p>Anons I may or may not be a lawyer, I may or may not be America, I may or may not be an olfag, I may or may not be a
Trump supporter, but one thing for damn sure I know: Bad things dont happend because of bad people, but because good
people allow them to act, the technology is out weapon, the chaos is where we live, lets redeem the time we spend here
and give some porpouse to it... keep the good fight anons!!!</p>

            Thank you jadasward - very thorough
What I wanted to contribute to this is to strip back much of the material to remove such elements that seem distinctly and credibly containable to the sphere of the consensual adult gay sex scene. While there is certainly enough evidence to make investigation of a sadistic paedophilia ring within Washington DC’s uppermost reaches an absolute imperative, many of the images (photos, instagram images etc) and their accompanying social media commentary of the ‘suspects’ shown in Pizzagate documentaries simply depict the activities of the gay community. The usage of cryptic food references (cheese, pasta) are not only and exclusively used in paedophile circles, and I find much conjecture in the Pizzagate investigations implicating gay people without sufficient evidence to tie it to minors. Don’t get me wrong, there IS CLEAR EVIDENCE of predatorial sexual interest in children in this scandal’s body of evidence (such as the purchased art of the principle suspects) – I’m just saying that child-specific evidence is not tied to all characters associated with Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, whose basement seems to host gay scene events, some with dark and perverse humour, sure. It is also possible some emails with cryptic references to pizza may conceivably pertain to drug use or adult prostitutes.
People on both sides of this ‘investigation’ are receiving death threats and having their lives destroyed. There are issues that absolutely demand explanation, but we must try to minimise the damage to innocent, peripheral parties – because the greater the number of wrongly accused, the easier it will be for evil to have the whole thing swept under the carpet – and leave them at liberty to continue destroying the lives of more innocent children.
We know from Wikileaks that the media- especially CNN – are so in cahoots with Clinton that they will collude with her about content and preferred context. When this becomes large enough to compel her to respond publicly, she may be able to have the media use the angle that it is all a far-right homophobia-induced conspiracy. Some current investigators are facilitating this get out of jail card for Clinton – we know the media will ignore the ugliest, scariest pedophilia related aspects if they have soft targets to enable their explanatory dismissal. So we need to excise that aspect from the investigation – and especially castigate any investigators who express views that indicate that they are unable to distinguish healthy homosexual (consenting adult) sexuality from non-consensual predatory sexualities.
Keep investigating. Refrain from conclusions derived from conjecture. Discriminate between the unequivocal and the ‘seemingly apparent’. Spread the word. Keep this in the spotlight. 
The very soul of Western Civilization may well be in the balance

            I do not know anything about steganography, hell I didn't even know that word until I began looking into this, but someone absolutely needs to check the images for hidden files.  I have noticed that many of them are quite a bit larger than most jpegs.

             It goes without saying that investigation of this site could yield useful info, but please not that whatever system comes into contact with that site and its files is subject to takeover regardless of Tor, VPN, and other security measures. It is compromised and you should keep that system away from others in your network.

             Likely your entire system is compromised and you will never know if it's being used or not.
