            I saw this movie several years ago and was taken aback by how many issues surrounding child trafficking were found in this child adventure film.
           </p>
           <p>
            Synopsis:  Basically twin 9 yr old boys who were separated at birth find each other.  One is being raised by a single father in a stable home, and the other is in an orphanage.  The conflict comes in when the boys at the orphanage are being drugged, tied up, and flown out in animal containers to other countries to be sold.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the things I found interesting was the choice to make these boys twins with names that are derivatives of one another.  Seems to me this symbolizes a psychotic break or  a personality split that often accompanies abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, how they use animal shipping containers for transport is a timely subject matter here.  And also the fact that this film was shot around 2001 indicates child trafficking and the accompanying methods were an open secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the target audience, I am unsure if the film is trying to warn parents or warn children or both.  I don't see it as a normalizing film.

             The writer/director is married to Dick Maas.  (These people are Dutch.)

             Dick Maas looks kinda like Phil Spector with a haircut:

             Dick Maas' foray into the horror genre:  SInt:
            </p>
            <p>
             Sint (released on DVD as Saint in Europe and Saint Nick in the United States[1]) is a 2010 Dutch dark comedy horror film about Sinterklaas, a character comparable to Santa Claus in English-speaking countries. The film was directed by Dick Maas and marked his return to the horror genre, in which he gained acclaim with his debut De Lift (1983) and Amsterdamned (1988). The story distorts the popular traditions of Sinterklaas and portrays him as a ghost who murders large numbers of people when his annual celebration night coincides with a full moon.

             Statistically, it is highly unlikely that Dutch Jews producing these kinds of movies are "warning" anyone.

              So the director/writer is Esmé Lammers who was born on June 9, 1958 in Amsterdam.  Amsterdam we already know through documentaries is a hot bed for pedophilia.  Maybe she was writing from a personal concern.
  Looking at her web page there is zero indications of a pedophilia nature.  Most all of her photography subjects for instance are full grown males that are fully clothed.
             </p>
             <p>
              She doesn't fit the profile and besides I've watched the movie and it is in no way normalizing and is only showing child trafficking in a way to warn a child without sexualizing him or her.  She was clearly careful on how she filmed this.
