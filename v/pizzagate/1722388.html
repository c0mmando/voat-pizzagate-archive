How to write FOIA requests.</p>
<p>How can we fight back against the machine that is pedophilia?</p>
<p>I see things this way: We have problems everywhere.</p>
<p>1) The justice system:</p>
<p>Pedos are released from prison, only to be free to kidnap again.</p>
<p>Rapists walk, having never been indicted due to a lack of DNA evidence.</p>
<p>2) CPS</p>
<p>All reports are confidential so the public can\'t really monitor whether anything is being done to pedos and child killers unless they are sent through the police for charges - most parents are not charged but children are removed from homes through CPS and the really bad parents can still have more kids... or the kids are taken from loving homes and sent to pedos.</p>
<p>You can get your own report but they make you wait a year and then it\'s redacted.</p>
<p>CPS protects pedos, protects abusers, and sends children to foster care with pedos.</p>
<p>3) Surveillance:</p>
<p>CIA + State govt. = spying</p>
<p>Red light cameras and cell phone signal busting listening devices in the hands of cops = spying</p>
<p>Yet HOW is it possible for a pedo to kidnap someone and never get caught? Or, for an attempted kidnapping to occur without the vehicle description being used to track down a local pedo and catch them?</p>
<p><strong>1) Proposed actions, step one - obtain info:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rolling MONTHLY FOIA requests to all agencies that interact with pedophiles.</strong></p>
<p>To include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every local municipal area with a police agency asking for a copy of every police report and 911 call that mentions a rape accusation, molestation allegation, or a kidnapping or attempted kidnapping.
(I don\'t know if we can get these, as it may be considered exempt if it is pertinent to an ongoing investigation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every local county DA asking for a copy of every new case filing with a rape accusation, molestation allegation, or a kidnapping or attempted kidnapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every local municipal area with a police agency asking for a copy of every police report and 911 call that mentions a murder of a child under age 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every local county DA asking for a copy of every new case filing with murder of a child under age 19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every local CPS agency asking for a list of all children being placed for adoption via CPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every local CPS agency asking for a list of all foster parents and the name of the person completing their background check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FOIA request in every state AG\'s office asking for a list of all sex offenders recently released.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One question:
Do sex offenders register the car that they drive with the state?</p>

            I think whatever we can do as a unified legal body , maybe it means lobbying, I'm not sure, but we need to be a certain and loud presence, one that will be the flu=y in the ointment of these pervs. We must become legion it is the only way

            This sounds like a great idea. The only thing I can add is it sounds like the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloward%E2%80%93Piven_strategy">
             Cloward-Piven
            </a>
            strategy. Originally designed to buckle the Welfare system (so a more governmentally dependant one can be installed), this particular strategy has run amok with all sorts of different groups using their own variation or hybrids of it: refugees -- destabilize a nation, DDOS attacks, cultural marxism, etc. Basically, inundate a system and it will fail so a newer one can be installed; a dialectic of sorts. Thesis --&gt; Antithesis --&gt; Synthesis. Ultimately the focus is on the Synthesis part of the equation because one knows what one wants to gain. Point being, this looks as if it could potentially cripple a bureaucratic system (inundate with requests, lawfully the system must process, bureaucratic overload, need more personnel, very slow response, departmental deliberating, etc.) leaving a solution to manifest. Lead the solution.

            This is the right attitude, but it would be better to focus lots of arrows on a few important targets, instead of spread your arrows out on small targets.

            We should just all be filing massive numbers of FOIA requests at the CIA, State Department, and FBI, every month, asking the same questions about the Hillary server, Huma server, Awan brothers server, and pizzagate. That would easier, and more effective.

            "Rapists walk, having never been indicted due to a lack of DNA evidence."  Can u clarify this?  It sounds dumb without context because hoes are accusing rape all the time just to get back at people or get attention.

              You realize how many false rape accusations happen and why rape isn't taken as seriously anymore?  If we locked up every person some bitch said raped her 100% of males would be in jail.

               With all due respect, I'm not trying to start a discussion about false rape accusations and although I lean towards defending criminals from false accusations 90% of the time, with Pizzagate we have the opposite problem which is NOT ENOUGH PROSECUTIONS. I am trying to organize an oversight campaign by citizens with the police to make sure they are actually doing something about accusations of CHILD RAPE. I'm not talking about some "dumb bitch hoe" that you refer to and the comment is offensive to actual victims, of which there are many. So let's just leave the adult hoe bitches out of this. And no, not 100% of males get falsely accused of rape, Mkay?

                I;m biased bc I spent 47 days in jail for a false accusation that didn't even turn out to be FUCKING ME.  It was some Mexican that stole my identify.  I lost well over 250k and was sued multiple times that did'nt matter bc I was in jail.  No compenbsation whatever, lost my house bc was out of work for 3 months, nobody to sue.

                 That sucks. I know because I worked in criminal defense that a lot of crazy stuff goes on with prosecutors. However in this instance I hope someone will get the pedos and hold them for trial without bail. I hope that the feds catch the Mexican and prosecute him for fraud. It's a federal crime with many years in prison to commit identity theft.

            A similar thing worked for the founder of Scientology as he forced the IRS to recognize Scientology as a religion for tax-exempt purposes. He had every member of his "church" start filing lawsuits against every agent in the IRS. The agents were so scared of being personally sued by the public, they immediately caved in and gave Hubbard the golden ticket.

            I have a feeling that a lot of them will be denied on a lot of different grounds. It would be good to talk with someone who is a real expert on FOIA and getting answers successfully.  Many of the ones I have made in the past were denied, or heavily redacted, and although I've written many, it seems to depend upon the subject matter and the agency what the response is going to be, as well as whether or not the cops or some other official agency have screwed up. If nothing else, we could still submit them around different places and observe what comes out of the different agencies, and figure out where the most resistance is coming from as that is possibly going to be a lead on which agencies have the most to hide. I was hoping to get this to be a coordinated effort with backing of multiple people so that the people submitting these don't start disappearing.

             Whenever I do one, I put in my letter, electronically if available, and I also add a paragraph about why they should waive the fee, that it is in the public interest and not in my own personal or business interest, etc. bla bla.

            Do you know of any lawyers that would be willing to represent a case against the mainstream media? My entire college career was absolutely ruined by pizzagate, and I think we all deserve to sue whether it ruined out lives or not. I think there will be a big case for lawsuits once we get disclosure on the wiener emails.

            There are some states that are going to demand sex offenders have special license plates  Wisconsin just voted in favor of a green plate.  Ohio wants a florescent one, others are in discussions.  This is great.  I cannot believe Wisc.  passed it.  I have read on here many times how Racine is complicit big time in this whole pedo mess.  Please upvoat this post.  It's a great idea.

             Just ignore the Racine shill.  He has YET to produce ONE IOTA of evidence that Racine is more corrupt than any other city.

              RACINE may  very well be a  hub  city.
              <br/>
              For those of you who think that       LA NYC &amp; Chicago are the big players,
you would be wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about it!   before coming off the cuff  and saying such a ridiculous thing.   You didn't even mention OMAHA...    really??
             </p>
             <p>
              Just found out that a city very close to mine is a huge hub  (another one not on your list  and you probably couldn't find it on a map).
              <br/>
              This information was given in a presentation that a friend of mine attended.  Had nothing to do with pizzagate
             </p>
             <p>
              For those of you born after 1999, when the internet became popular, you may not understand how true this statement is:
   For as much information exists online,  most information is not online.

              There may be some shady things going on there, but I believe the hub cities and LA, NYC and Chicago are the Big Players with others as the Connectors.  There are some people like those that passed this license plate bill, that will help our cause along.  Another great thing that happened today was Michael Flynn Jr's Twitter Message.  We are making progress.  I do think this thing will blow, but when is the question.

              Yea, they're a shill for sure.  If you ask them for sources they'll write a huge post that's devoid of any real content or external sources.

              What a shock when I read that.  I think Ohio has committed and  a couple of other states are considering.  This may spread like wild fire.  Now here is something we PizzaGaters might get behind.  When at the Big March in DC  People in same states should get together and contact their lawmakers to demand it for their state.  It has already been done, so won't have to worry about taking the lead.  Others call YOUR lawmakers and demand the same.  Tell them Wisconsin and  Ohio have already voted.

                 They can be used to gain access to buildings we could use them to keep them out of anywhere that is for children and we can track their every move.

                <p>
                 They already track the helpless victims. They now want to do it to us (because we have nothing to hide, right!) I say do it to them.

                  They are already doing this with our iphones and our children with theirs too.  Chips would make it even more invasive.  They must be stopped at all costs.  They will make us into their little robots and then maybe they will create something that will program us and completely control us.

                    Those that go goo goo gaga over movies like La La Land will believe that it is ok and follow like sheep.  They will put fear in their hearts that people are coming over the boarder to steal their children and strike fear in their hearts just like they have for decades.  I shudder to think what they will come up with to get it done.
