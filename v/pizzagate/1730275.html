The first version I heard was that an SS agent had left a laptop with sensitive information in plain sight on the seat of her car in Brooklyn.  Someone broke into the car and stole it.   (She said than someone <strong>broke into</strong> her car.)   I had a mental image of a SS agent parking a big black SS Cadillac Escalade on the street to go into a cafe, then bad luck, a common criminal commits an opportunistic crime.  Sorry, fake news, not what happened at all.  What did happen blew my mind.</p>
<p>The key is the NY Post article:</p>
<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2017/03/17/secret-service-hunts-for-stolen-laptop-with-trump-tower-floor-plans/">http://nypost.com/2017/03/17/secret-service-hunts-for-stolen-laptop-with-trump-tower-floor-plans/</a></p>
<p>&quot;The thief drove up to Argentieri’s home around 8:40 a.m., walked right up to her Bajaj motorcycle and took the items. He was then caught on video fleeing the scene on foot, sources said.&quot;  Ok, how does one &quot;break into&quot; a motorcycle?  How does one leave a laptop on the seat?  The vehicle in question in a Bajaj Qute.  This is a 4 wheeled tuk tuk with plastic sheeting for windows.  In the US it is licensed as a motorcycle, not a car.  There are no door locks, it is impossible to lock this vehicle, therefore, no &quot;break in&quot; is required:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bajajauto.com/bajajqute/">http://www.bajajauto.com/bajajqute/</a></p>
<p>I won\'t even try to wrap my head around why anyone living in the NE of the USA would want to own such a vehicle.  It has just 13.2 horsepower and is speed limited by a chip to 70 kph = 43.5 mph.  There is no form of climate control, probably is not even particularly watertight, has no air bags of course.  It would be a death trap in traffic with real cars and trucks.  But, never mind that. </p>
<p>The NY Post article correctly identified the Bajaj Qute as a motorcycle, but their article also has fake news!  The NY Post told us &quot;The thief <strong>drove up to</strong> Argentieri’s home around 8:40 a.m., walked ...&quot;  Nope, wrong!  While the Daily Mail failed to get the story on the vehicle, their description of the nature of the crime was better.  &quot;Surveillance footage reportedly shows the thief get out of a car, possibly an Uber, near the home. He is later seen walking away from the scene with a backpack.&quot;  Ah, the thief did NOT drive there, he was driven there by someone else!  He was not a random passerby, he had been given a time and a place to make the pickup.</p>

<p>For more breadcrumbs (mixed with fake news) we go to the CBS local website.  &quot;Surveillance video possibly from the street shows a white man wearing dark clothing <strong>exit the back passenger side of what may be a Chevrolet Malibu</strong> after pulling up to the secret service agent’s street.  The car then pulls up to victim’s house and stops with its hazard lights on. The man then exits from the back passenger side, sources said. Video does not show the actual break-in.  The same individual is later seen carrying the agent’s bag walking on Bay 10th Street and Cropsey Avenue, sources said.&quot;  Ok, the arrival of the &quot;thief&quot; is clearly shown by a street camera, he was dropped off at that exact address.   But the report is also full of fake news.  Argentieri’s 2015 Bajaj Qute quadcycle is falsely referred to as a car, and we are told there was a &quot;break-in&quot;.  But, we have already determined that one does not need to break into an unlockable four wheel tuk tuk.</p>

<p>Does anyone believe that one leaves a laptop with sensitive information in plain sight on the seat of their unlockable quadcycle by accident?  Does anyone believe the &quot;thief&quot; just happened to ask a driver to drop him off at the very driveway where the laptop was waiting for him?  If anyone believes this -  I also own the Brooklyn Bridge and it is for sale.  This is a classic dead drop.  Argentieri passed the laptop to the courier (not thief) by prior arrangement.</p>
<p>Now we can float theories.  Really they reduce to just two basic ideas:
1) Argentieri is a Trump loyalist acting under instructions to pass the laptop on to a wikileaks type operator to break through the FBI coverup of pedogate
or
2) Argentieri is a Clinton loyalist acting under instructions to pass the laptop on to a Clinton operative so Hillary\'s defense team can find out how much the investigators know
Personally, I think that theory 2 is considerably more likely.  In which case, I hope that Argentieri is enjoying enhanced interrogation as a reward for her treason.</p>',

            No I don't but I have seen it reported on here and I remember hearing about it on my local news, although cannot remember how many it said.  I believe they were not all killed at one time, two I remember  the end of last year and I believe it all added up.  Now that I am having trouble finding info I will stop writing it and just believing what I read on here. I know there has been an uptick in NY though.

            Anyone else think the mere mention of the Pope, especially alongside the Clinton investigation, is meant to catch the attention of "conspiracy theorists?" The story almost sounds like a GLP or BFIN article. They could have said "the Rothschild family" or "the Trilateral Commission" and it would have struck me the same way, except for the fact that both the Clintons and the Vatican make me think of pedophilia.

            Hazard lights? Yes this is MO for a bagman. You don't call attention to yourself if you are about to steal something, you do that to signal your designation as the recipient.

            Here's a /pol/ anon talking about the way SS computers handle data:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/polNewsNetwork1/status/842935822294966272">
             https://twitter.com/polNewsNetwork1/status/842935822294966272
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I'm a bit confused by this here:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Surveillance video possibly from the street shows a white man wearing dark clothing exit the back passenger side of what may be a Chevrolet Malibu after pulling up to the secret service agent’s street. The car then pulls up to victim’s house and stops with its hazard lights on. The man then exits from the back passenger side, sources said."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So, two men exited the car, one once the car got onto the street and another when it pulled up to the house? Or did he get off, walk up to the house, "break in" to the Qute, and exit the rear passenger door of the Qute?

            Random thoughts on this one:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) There is 1 Bajaj vehicle for sale on CycelTrader.com and it is a moped.  These things are rarer than hen's teeth in the US.  I wonder if that was the "vehicle picked for the story" as the writer of the story was Indian?
           </p>
           <p>
            2) This is another chance to document a "fake news" story like the EMW shooting.  What did we learn there?  The op was likely a cover to destroy the hard drive right under everyone's nose.  This may be the same op in reverse.  "Hacker stole SS laptop and give contents to Wikileaks"  Then no one is culpable.  Maybe it contains information related to the alleged "wiretapping".
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Nothing on Federal laptops may be stored which is above LE SENSITIVE and FOUO.  PII may not be stored (but it does happen).  SECRET and above is not allowed on laptops with few exceptions, except within the military. That laptop would have, at a minimum, 3 factor authorization via VPN to any classified database.  It would also require a remote keygen.  And they can be wiped remotely.  If protocol's were properly used, that laptop should have become a paperweight within 15 minutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) As mentioned, WaPo and NYT ignored it.  To recognize it, would mean if it becomes a leak, they already "legitimized" a story by previously reporting on it.  In other words, if the "storyline" didn't fit prior reporting, they have a problem.  Well, maybe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fingers crossed that JL/Wiki have something really important to say next week.  The "theft" of the laptop disconnects the story from Trump.

Now, who set this up? That is the million$ question!

            That's not really how data storage works today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most likely, there's an external HDD, USB, or other physical mobile storage device they were using to house such sensitive information. Believe me when I say this, this odd theory you have about a laptop may have worked in the 90s or something, but not today.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've grown fond of the theory that this was suppose to serve as a sort of message. Apparently Clinton's team is rather partial to cryptic references and metaphors. I think we're all quite familiar with that. Not to mention the "what goes around comets around" thing, which still seems
            <strong>
             very
            </strong>
            straightforward to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I'm suggesting they're maybe making a threat or something crazy. Maybe it was something like:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Proceed in the Clinton investigation and we'll use our knowledge of the floor plans at Trump tower to send in some SJW bomber and blow up the building.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            However, when you were talking about the dead drop thing, you made me think this may be some form of leak from the Trump admin saying something about the floor plans to make people talk about it a lot. I was thinking it would be cool if that "laptop" had something pretty incriminating that those participating in the investigation would find helpful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, I agree with others here saying that us knowing about it doesn't at all mean that it was accidental or in any way uncoordinated. Frankly, I'm pretty confident this had something to do with a warning message, another leak from some entity in peril, or maybe even some false flag.

            The way they decided to let the world know the laptop has info on Trump tower on it points to a false flag attack on Trump tower. Also there have now been a few stories pointing at SS as being less than professional and downright negligent to blame. There is NO REASON a SS agent would have sensitive information on Clinton's or the Pope on a laptop so I believe that info was planted simply for speculation purposes. That day around the same time it was trending with several bot type accounts that the Empire state Building was evacuated due to a small fire but there was no actual proof of a fire....I think this is a threat to Trump that they can hurt him by taking out his wife and son in Trump tower.

            I think you're on the right track.  The SS was involved in several big time scandals during the Obama Administration and they eventually chased out the affirmative-action appointment head of the Secret Service for incompetence.  There are definitely elements left by the Obama Admin in the SS that would be hostile to Trump - this is why he partly uses private security.  This story is not something that would normally be publicized - that is intentional.  I believe this is Trump admin trying to expose SS corruption and humiliate them. They included the information about what was ON the laptop (NEVER would they admit this!!) in order to first bait the media into reporting (the Trump Tower detail) and B: remind everyone about Weiner's emails.

            could this be a Trump set up?   This news is everywhere, All bought and paid for news outlets have printed the story. There are slight differences in some of the stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            CNN says..The officials said the laptop, which was highly encrypted and contained floor plans and evacuation protocol for Trump Tower, cannot be traced or erased by officials remotely, leaving the information at risk of being discovered.
           </p>
           <p>
            ABC says...."Secret Service-issued laptops contain multiple layers of security including full disk encryption and are not permitted to contain classified information," the statement continued. The computer is encrypted and authorities are able to wipe the hard drive remotely if needed.
           </p>
           <p>
            New York Post has agents name, what she drove, all kinds of info
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought the story stunk from the beginning, and why does the bought news outlets have different stories?
Does the laptop have secret stuff on it or not?   Why is the secret service agent's name is this story and not the story of taking a picture?  Do they ever give names out on secret service agents?  Was a laptop even stolen? Maybe my tin foil hat getting tighter with all the stuff I've been reading, but I just don't trust news story anymore, I always check around.

              I might guess that if it was an establishment/Deep State op, heads of WaPo and NYT would have already known about it. I could see them hearing about it and thinking, "We weren't briefed on this, so hands off," especially if Deep State intel thinks it's some kind of trap or other move.

            Not to wander too far off topic, but just for the weirdness - Argentieri loosely translates as Silversmith, not dissimilar to Silverstein, a famous name in NYC.

            "Marie Argentieri is 88 years old", either a name picked out of the phone book or the SS woman could have been named after her father's mother, not a rare event.  I do think something happened (was staged) at the house in Brooklyn whether it was the actual home of an actual SS agent or not.  I am a bit of a car buff and drive a 810 kg car not legal in the US.  So I was shocked that Americans can buy the Bajaj Qute.  The Qute is not even legal for personal use in India, only allowed as a commercial vehicle.  The inclusion of the Bajaj in the story added a surreal element which drew me in.

            PS:  New Zealand has allowed mail deliveries from Paxsters - what amounts to a skinny golf cart:

            But even here a Bajaj Qute would be beyond the pale

            You are welcome.  While the only link to pedogate is the mention of Clinton emails, the media circus is fascinating.  All major media is fake news.  As with (tinfoil warning) other notorious events (ahem, Oklahoma City), the early reports from local media are usually the best.  NY Post told us the vehicle in question was a Bajaj.  CBS local made it clear that the pick up courier was driven there taxi style - sitting in the back seat.

            None of the MSM reported story adds up. A SS agent would not have Clinton investigation info on it, that's not in their scope of work.

            I'm really hoping this was a way of publicly setting up a leak story by the good guys.

             Good question!  One can understand why NYC based SS agents would need to have the floor plans of Trump Tower on hand, that is not suspicious at all.  But as the SS is mainly a glorified bodyguard detail and not a general investigative agency, there is no good reason for the Clinton investigation information to be on an SS laptop.  Someone gave it to Argentieri to be leaked.

            Also, the video
            <em>
             just happens
            </em>
            to show all the events
            <em>
             except
            </em>
            for the actual moment of breaking into the car? Are you sure it doesn't need some kind of key or electronic remote to open the doors? Because somebody sure wouldn't want to show the part of the footage where the "thief" pulls out a key to the car. Or there may have been something else that happened during that time that they didn't want recorded. Many possibilities, but it's suspicious that there's a select part of the crime that wasn't on tape.

              Ok, semantics. But lots of vehicles now have electronic sensor keys, so a lack of a physical door lock doesn't mean there isn't a door lock. Where are you getting that info?

               Look at the Qute on the Bajaj website. This is a 450 kg product.  It doesn't have any windows, just flexible clear plastic sheets you can roll down - like the windows on tents.  You don't even need to open a door, just peel up the window sheeting and stick your arm in.

            I have commented on here that I hope it was passed to Wikileaks.  I am keeping my fingers crossed.  I am hoping that NYPD has arranged this because they are just plain sick of Comey not doing his job and giving them a bad name.  They are also angry that 5 cops were killed because they threatened to release the vile info themselves a few weeks before.  God I hope they did it.

             I hope that good guys did it, but the NYPD would have no reason to involve the SS as an intermediary.  I see no reason to believe that the NYPD were involved with the dead drop.  If Argentieri is a Trump loyalist acting under instructions (from Bannon?  Ivanka?  DJT himself?), the dead drop was driven by the Trump team, not the NYPD.

             If that's the case, then either the thief is smart enough to have disabled it (probable, if they were smart enough to plan the heist in the first place) OR the people who let it be taken don't want it to be found.

             In the case of a laptop with sensitive material on it, I would think the priority would be in keeping the device secure.  Not an expert, but I would imagine that disabling wireless connectivity would be an obvious security measure, so no GPS signal uploaded to cellular networks?  In any case all the thief/courier has to do is put the laptop in a metal case and all tracking would be shut off.
