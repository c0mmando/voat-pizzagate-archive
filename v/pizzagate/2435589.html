            I'm sure that they have something on HRC, but I'm cynical enough to think that the only reason they would release something like this would be to cover up something even worse.  This type of video (if it exists) is enough to spark a civil war in this country (at best) or completely demolish our current government at worst.  They would likely cover up shit like this at all costs.  Just think about the bank bailouts.  The "too big to fail" banks were threatening that they would collapse the economy and there would be chaos in the streets if they didn't get their billions in bailouts (which they didn't deserve because they were basically running a con with those mortgages).  They did this despite the fact that it was the first time I can remember (and I'm nearly 50) that I have ever seen Republicans and Democrats agree almost unanimously on an issue (I think it was 90% of Americans were against those bailouts).  Now, just imagine the embarrassment and scandal playing out in the foreign press if the Clintons are really involved in pedophilia.  You think that they wouldn't cover that up at any price?
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus, I know everyone loves Assange, but his family's connection with that weird Family cult and his dismissal of 9/11 conspiracy theories makes me think that he is most likely involved with the CIA.  What he releases is real -- but it is what he doesn't release that would really change the world.  If you were the CIA and you wanted to control the information that whistleblowers have, it would make sense to promote someone like Assange as THE go-to guy to leak info to.  That way, you know who is sending it and you can take out anyone who might complain that their info wasn't released.  I just don't trust the guy.  Of course, I don't really trust anyone ... so maybe I'm wrong about him.  I just get tired of people promising to release big secrets that turn out to be snooze fests of data dumps.

             Your analysis of Assange sounds a lot like what they did with Feldman. You can't even do a search for Pedowood or Corey Haim without that sack of shit's name coming up. It's the ultimate betrayal that the person who allegedly set Haim up to be raped was Feldman. That according to a director and two eyewitnesses to a fight between Haim and Feldman where Haim alleged just that before slamming his buddy-buddy up against a wall.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since I am unabashedly an Assangist, I'm don't know what I think. There's his strange alliance with Pamela Anderson who must be a CIA asset, don't you think? Her close, close, close, creepy-as-hell relationship with Hef would point to that. But she is a honey pot and does have that magnetic X factor that makes men jump off cliffs and go crazy in the brain soooooo it may just be he loves being in her company. but Assange ... Assange. Since he seems to be against everyone, and until he proves unworthy of my admiration, I'm going to continue to support him and back him with the whole of my being. He is the one responsible for leaking the emails that made us aware of The Clintons, and some other notables, weird predilection for pizza. Those emails were what leaked the rumors/debunked conspiracy theory about more going on than mozzarella cheese.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of civilization collapsing because of proof that the rumors are true about HRC and her alleged rapist husband, not going to happen. That's the excuse advanced for keeping things quiet. Yes, there would be an outcry for some, but there should be an outcry. After all, almost half the country would have voted for someone involved in the darkest, most heinous of secrets. If the press handled The Kenyan being American (ha!), and heterosexual (double ha!), and married to a wo-man (triple ha!) who had two children even though s-he has a penis???? (quadruple ha!), I think they could handle the sheeple. Might even dust of twenty-five-year-old David Hogg to do another video in the closet (man, what kind of metaphor is that?)
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of your mentioning Assange holding back intel, all people involved in the sinister world of politics do. Andrew Breitbart touched on this subject many times. You see, most people have consciences. Therefore, if you find out something sordid about a key figure ... or a nothing burger ... you hold this pervert's life in your hands. Most people do not take pleasure from doing this. They do not. Then there are the lives of those innocents surrounding this POS. Of course, there's an even greater reason for silence and that summed up in one word quote Arkancide unquote. Most people don't want to die. So to be put on a hit list is not something they'd welcome. This comes into play as it relates to who you give this information to. Take Harvey Weinstein for example. Until pizzagate opened the floodgates for all us nutsos to talk openly about pedophilia and rapists in PedoWood, actors and actresses kept their mouths shut. The ones that did open it were vilified or taken out. Hence, Randy Quaid's use of the term STARWHACKERS. Journalists like Breitbart ran the same risk. Who the hell could he safely pass that info to? Certainly not the police. It seems they were on these biggies' speed dial. So they'd more or less, let a small circle of friends know and keep them apprised. Then, somewhere down the line, when there was an opening, this info might be used to leverage this scumbag to drop out of politics or show biz and never be seen again. In other words, because of the corruption/infiltration of law enforcement and the justice system, it was done undercover. And remember, this is a global conspiracy, so there's no place to hide.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess this is a long-winded way of saying that I appreciate your comments and do understand EXACTLY what you're saying. I sorta agree and sorta don't, but really, I don't have enough info to make even an educated guess. So I'll go by faith and who has taken action. Yes, I know the bad guys sometimes put putzes in these roles, but take Feldman ... please ... He's really never said anything. That session with the LAPD where he was supposed to have given all the big names running the pedophile ring, he didn't. He's been using that fantasy as a crutch to limp around and garner praise. Probably even cemented the friendship with Haim and made Haim overlook all the shit he'd done, but it was a lie. I'm using this as an example to prove my point that someone whose heart delivers. Our POTUS (bless his heart) delivered. Breitbart delivered. Assange delivered. And that's how I'm discerning who my heroes are and who is worthy of my faith.
            </p>
            <p>
             Until something better comes along, that's what I'll use as a divining rod of who to trust and who not to. It goes back to the Bible and you can't do better than relying on scripture, and that's what I'll use until something better comes along.

            Why would Hillary-porn be found on Weiner’s laptop, of all places? She strikes me as being a bit out of the age range he prefers... it’s about as likely as it having been recorded in the tunnels below comet ping pong (you know, the pizza shop she’s doing human trafficking out of). Let’s get real.

             Well, some of HRC's emails were on his laptop (as they discovered while investigating the whole Clinton e-mail thing).  They also found pics of underage girls.  If HRC is into young girls, too, there could be photos of that which Weiner and Huma kept as an insurance policy of sorts.  It is alleged that the file folder name with these images was actually labeled "Insurance policy".
            </p>
            <p>
             How much of that is true is anyone's guess.  But, I do think that they found something incriminating regarding HRC and have been covering it up for some reason.  Of course, it could just be photos of his wife and HRC since there are plenty of rumors that the two of them were involved in an affair.

             Oh, yeah! Found out on a show with Andrew Breitbart. It was pretty funny the way they gave hints ... lost all respect for her at that point. Can't remember the name of the show ... but Pink was slutshamed.

            My favourite saying from Q went something like this
            <strong>
             'they asked for a deal'.......... 'We said NO'
            </strong>
            - This little sentence keeps me hoping, when my husband says she/they won't go to jail!

             This has been discussed and speculated about for months ... it's why I don't believe him/her. I do enjoy the posts and what he's accomplished, though. It ain't easy to have that many people hanging on your every word.

             They typically can do the AI when it's just a head shot and the person talking strait into the camera, right? I assume with this video there will be different angles and not much talking... just my thoughts on this.

             The bulk of the Draining of the Swamp will be the yoeman's work that we hope our POTUS and Sessions are involved in making happen. It's laborious and time-consuming to bring an indictment. But the video, IF there's a video, will tear away the cloak of righteousness that these cabalists wear like nothing else. That's why I'm hoping it's true.

             Hmmm .... since I don't know if that story is true, it doesn't help in ascertaining what this person knows. For me, it sort of casts doubt on the tape prediction, but then I'm not privy to TP's comings and goings.

              Yeah...the foiled Podesta escape claim is one of the unverified data points from /qresearch/. I thought it was interesting that this account was making it. Those are bold claims which will completely ruin the account's credibility if proven wrong...much like all the Q Leaks' claims.

              It is consistent, however, with what FBIAnon, Steve Piesczenik and True Pundit have said.

               Yes, but as you of all people know, just because someone says it doesn't make it true.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've been wary of that claim. Doubt the media would cover it and that could be one reason why I'm so leery of the story. I'm remembering back ... oh, right into the good old days of about two years ago when the press was still covering news. I suppose because it wasn't on MSN or CNN I'm suspicious, but then nothing is on those outlets except propaganda. It's one of the ways this cabal keeps you off your balance. You can't rely on what you used to to legitimize what you hear. If I heard a crazy rumor, all I'd do is look at what the media said, but I can't do that anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
               I guess that means I'm still keeping my fingers crossed and the champagne nearby.

                It's been more than two years since you could rely on the press to cover the news. I left journalism in the 90's because I couldn't stand the bullshit and the lies.

                 True. But there was reporting. Even in California, I've run into articles linking CPS and child trafficking.

            Will it be a pedo or satanist video. Or could it be a video of her rigging the primaries and screwing over Bernie Sanders?

            I want to see the global blackmail ring taken down. But what is there that points to this being a pedo/satanist thing, and not just a rigged primaries and your vote doesn't count thing?

            May as well make this announcement now. We are getting ready to enter the zone of "fake video proof of pedophelia." The proof will be real. It will be real pedos. But, it will be called "fake news."

            It will be used as an excuse to shut down the internet free speech. You heard it here first.

             Time stamp that shit. Run it through filters that show it’s not tampered with. Blot out the victim and show her face. Let the suicide weekend begin. And do the same with Bill. I’m sure they have him on film saying “I’m going to fuck up this kid” and run his ass the flagpole too. I’m sure they have something on the Bushes, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and everyone else. Black out the victims and ruin these animals. Better yet, have the living victims narrate the blackmail films and let them pull the lever to the electric chair or noose. We all know the movies exist, let the executions begin.

              Obama's phony BC was debunked by countless experts and a large chunk of the Adobe Photoshop forums on the internet but the media simply declared anyone that thought it was forged as a conspiracy theorist and it was swept under the rug.

               So true, and most normies who actually heard about it wrote it off because of the messenger i.e. Arpaio. I fear it'll be exactly the same with "Russian" Wikileaks and "Cheeto Hitler"

              I don't even want to see the video, hearing it is genuinely these sick people will be good enough for me.  Sadly I doubt there will be any victims to narrate, when you are that high up the chain of command you go the whole hog. (according to the Dutch bankers video). This is what would make the video the ultimate one, ending a life on video.

             That's a good question, but I don't know why it would be illegal to show. If she were in a compromising position with a minor, she'd be the one subject to arrest.

             It would only be illegal if someone hacked into the computer since in possession of the police, no? Other than that, it was a personal computer.

              It's illegal to possess and distribute. Even emailing links to the FBI is risky as the honeybee documented in one of her earlier pizzagate videos. Anyone that shares the video is at risk of being charged with possession of CP. I just can't imagine how that ball will start rolling?

               Like I said, they'd have to blot out that child ... only show parts where she's talking to the minor.
              </p>
              <p>
               There was a discussion about it this morning with a SRA survivor. She's an adult now so she fully gives her permission if it is her featured. Damn, what is her name! Don't remember, but my opinion is that the child would be blotted out.

                Yeah, that's true. I think people need to see this shit. Just a few videos of various idols the sheep worship to accelerate mass awakening. I saw that discussion on Twitter with the sra survivor. Not sure if it was the same chick.

                 It would have to be something like this. Someone discussed her being videotaped bribing someone ... or being bribed. If it lands the bitch in jail .... fine. But if it is a sex tape? It would destroy that facade she's carefully built over the years.

            This could be true. Assange is credited with never releasing fake dumps. The Clintons and Podesta NEVER DENIED the emails weren't theirs. If something this explosive is released, Wikileaks might be the only credible source the public would trust. There is a problem though. Wouldn't this video (if real) be CP? How could it be legally viewed by the public? Perhaps it will be released directly to Congress as evidence?

             Well, the child would have to be blotted out .. No doubt. Certain parts censored. It would be more dramatic like that. To have her talking to the child (THIS IS ALLEGEDLY -- THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THIS EXISTS EXCEPT IN A UNCONFIRMED TWEET) and then turning it into something sick ... yeah, it would seem way more genuine and authentic. I would cry if I saw something like that.

             If there were righteous men and women in Congress, it wouldn't have gotten this bad. They would have stopped it. Counting who the bigger sinners are is like arguing over how many angels fit on the head of pin. The answer to that theological morsel is: "All of them" (being incorporeal, LOL).

              There are degrees of sin and therefore punishment, so the contention is not in vain. Murder is more heinous than embezzlement. But ultimately yes, all sin is damning.

             were protesting.  Then some white shirt lieutenants showed up and the apparent protest was shut down.  Then I found out a day or two later about the Weiner laptop allegations.  My belief is NYPD did have information bad enough for uniformed officers to be ready to protest a Presidential candidate.  Next week I saw Huma walking into the building crying...  You seem like a shill, and I don't say that often.

                Actually, your believe is based on the hoax story that criminal video of Clinton existed on Weiner's laptop.  You then applied this belief to what you saw.
               </p>
               <p>
                The story was a hoax because it claimed NYPD had the laptop before the FBI took.it away.  That is false.

             Which is one reason I don't trust that man.  You can claim he's just hanging onto to it in order to keep himself alive, but if he has true, damning evidence of the Clintons being criminals, pedophilia in Washington DC, or any other major issue like that and he's not releasing it, that makes him an incredibly cynical, self serving individual.

              Can't speak to the issue of trust, but you need to relealize that you're part of the small percentage of people who realize that Clinton and Obama were garbage and their gov't the second-coming-of-Satan.

              But the other 98% of mouth-breathers think she's the second coming of Christ.  If Trump moved to arrest her, he'd be decried as a tyrant.  He needs a Pearl Harbor to do this - he needs an event that inflames the public and moves us to

              I'm guessing he has held it because he's been coordinating with Trump....Trump dictating releases in exchange for eventual pardon and continued protection.  (How cynical is it, really, to hold on to something that may be keeping you alive?)

              You want cynical?  Try the FBI, who've had this stuff from the start, and NEVER intended to investigate it.

               I agree Hortance. And I believe Trump and Alex Jones and many other have been planning this for years. Pre empted phone tapping and sent them on a wild goose chase. 5D chess more than we can imagine.

               But that strategy would inevitably come with the very real risk that Hillary could be president right now.

              <p>
               Just because Assange has released information in the past that helped Trump’a campaign does not mean he is ideologically or politically aligned with Trump.  He’s playing his own game, one that happened to overlap with MAGA interests.
              </p>
              <p>
               If he’s been sitting on potentially explosive information about American politicians for years, then yes, I wonder about his motives and what he’s out to accomplish.  That’s not to diminish what he’s done, or the fact that his life is in danger.
              </p>
              <p>
               And saying I don’t trust the guy is not saying that I trust the FBI instead.  The FBI has clearly shown itself to be compromised.

                I'm just saying what I think is happening now.  Assange needs physical protection and wants legal remedy to (the bogus sex-assault charges levied on him in Europe are long debunked) his "process crime" re: an appearance in a London court/warrant.
                <br/>
                Remember Assange got the Hillary emails from Seth Rich, but his source for the video was likely either NYPD or someone working with Trump.  I think Trump most likely got his hands on the tape as President and got it to Assange in some way and is directing the drop in conjunction with making Assange's problems go away.  The Feds/agencies have been using the Assanges and the Snowdens for this kind of stuff for years now.

               I think your answer is great.  Remember timing is everything, if it is released too soon, while MSM and all the others still have some control people will believe them, they are being discredited daily, their believably is almost totally diminished. The right courts, prisons etc, all have to be ready because they will scatter like rats when this is dropped.

                Yes. Hence letting us all mentally prepare people with #releasethememo then #releasethevideo. I think most here are “conspiracy nuts” anyways so although shocking not surprising. The sheep need some subliminal programming to help accept it.

               I have to agree with this.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, Assange has shown stubborn sagacity in how he releases material. He teases it with riddles for weeks. Remember Vault 7 and clues? Or what about the "phases" of the email leaks? He more than most knows how hard it is to get past the MSM blackout and spin machine. You don't drop Fat Man and Little Boy on some tiny atoll in the S. Pacific and hope people cower and give up just because the weapon was toxic. You bide your time and wait to take out the heart of your enemy's wartime heavy industry. ESPECIALLY when you've got the evidence and know just how foul the people are that you're up against. That one big bomb better be enough.

              I see your point, but he has to have some leverage to win his release, right?
             </p>
             <p>
              I think he was going to release a lot on November 9, 2016, but then Trump won.  I want to know how he found out.  He probably did not believe it, and thought it was a joke.

               I’d like to think that.  However, again, that just indicates that the guy is acting out of self-interest and not some greater sense of altruism or doing the right thing.  Of course you can’t fault a person for that, but at the same time, wouldn’t offering proof of some international politician pedophile ring be worth risking your life for?

                Yeah, I am not disagreeing with you or anything.  It is hard to say what is going through his mind.
               </p>
               <p>
                I know that he had several falling outs with people before he ended up at the embassy.  It seems like he was not easy to get along with and always wanted to be in the limelight.  Could be several reasons for that, including what you say.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you were Assange, wouldn't you use your position to get some?  I mean, you would be world famous with all that power.  No wonder Pamela Anderson made a visit or two...
