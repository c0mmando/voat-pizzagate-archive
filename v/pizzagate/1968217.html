<p>But amazingly, a <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2008/01/suicides200801">Vanity Fair narrative profile</a> detailing the spontaneous suicide of two artists who, in their own right, had a lengthy background with the occult, includes the strange accusation that Anna Gaskell is a member of the CIA and is closely tied to MK Ultra. This comes from her ex-boyfriend, who died in mysterious circumstances off the coast of Queens in 2011, but a closer look at the evidence reveals it is likely true. </p>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>A narrative piece called &quot;The Golden Suicides&quot; details the life of Jeremy Blake and Teresa Duncan, two rising stars of the art world who studied at Washington D.C.\'s Corcoran School of Art. The school, part of George Washington University, actually once employed Francis Luzzatto, who worked there before he joined AID programs for the State Dept (aka CIA-related activities).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1999/10/22/aid-official-francis-a-luzzatto-dies/617956d2-3cd2-4d4f-9172-640a257b9aa8/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1999/10/22/aid-official-francis-a-luzzatto-dies/617956d2-3cd2-4d4f-9172-640a257b9aa8/</a></p>
<p>Theresa Duncan and her lover Blake were stars of the art world who rose to stardom in the NY art world. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The lovely Theresa” was Theresa Duncan, a writer, filmmaker, computer-game creator, and Blake’s girlfriend of 12 years. He had found her lifeless body on July 10, in the rectory of St. Mark’s Church in Manhattan’s East Village, where the couple had been renting an apartment. There was a bowl full of Benadryl pills, a bottle of Tylenol PM, and a champagne glass on the nightstand. There was a note saying, “I love all of you.” Duncan was 40. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theresa Duncan was involved in the New York Art Scene with her boyfriend, who was somewhat of a minor celebrity, to the point where he mingled with the New York art elite. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There had been reports they had become “paranoid,” obsessed with conspiracy theories, believing they were being harassed by Scientologists. The Internet filled up with conjecture about government plots and murder. Something about their story seemed to capture the modern imagination, if only because no one knew exactly why two such accomplished and attractive people had chosen to make their exit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what\'s weirder, is that Anna Gaskell herself seems to be at the center of the accusations, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070616141907/http://theresalduncan.typepad.com:80/witostaircase/2007/05/the_trouble_wit.html">in a blog post on her website</a>, Duncan herself accused the Gaskell family of gangstalking them and of her guardian of being a CIA handler Jim Cownie. They were both also knee-deep in Pedogate, as evidenced by this post, and were well aware of the Johnny Gosch-Boystown saga that was part of the Franklin Scandal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add the final dessert topping to this apocalyptic art world sundae, Mr. Wit says that normally dour Cownie <strong>frequently made jokes about child molestation as a &quot;training&quot; tool</strong>. This wouldn\'t be so fucking spooky, friends of the Staircase, if Des Moines wasn\'t the land of the Project Monarch/U.S. Intelligence rumored disappearance of Johnny Gosch and the odd resemblance of poor little Johnny to Bush White House gay hooker-psychological operative Jeff Gannon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is also mentioned in the article as warming up to Jerry Saltz, art critic closely tied to NYC and who, unbelievably, has posted \'artistic\' depictions of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LsEJuwT.jpg">child abuse on his Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>But it goes so much deeper. Duncan and Blake were actually part of the punk scene in 90s-era DC and were friends with many musicianss that are now regulars at Comet Ping Pong, such as Ian Svevonius, author of such songs as &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yi9Zeg8TdU">Every Baby Cries The Same</a>&quot;. He is acquainted with James Alefantis and this suggests that they may have crossed paths in the insular D.C. art world. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremy Blake and Theresa Duncan first met in 1994. They were both part of the activist, “positive force” punk-rock scene in Washington (think Fugazi, Bikini Kill). He hung around with the band Nation of Ulysses (Svenonius\' band), believed in punk as a philosophy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The connections don\'t end there. Jeremy Blake also accused popular commentator Reza Aslan of talking to him about his FBI records and of having heretofore inaccessible info on him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also during this time, someone named Reza Aslan, a Muslim &quot;scholar&quot; and friend of a friend who attended school in Iowa came to my house in Venice, CA and freely chatted about an FBI file of mine he seemed vividly aware of, even though at that time I myself did not know such a file existed. A consequent FOIA filing revealed his &quot;magic&quot; knowledge of these documents to be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Duncan \'committed suicide\' after meeting with producers and George Pelecanos in a unidentified DC restaurant. She was found dead of a alcohol-tylenol overdose the following morning, and Jeremy Blake went ballistic. But before Blake committed suicide a week, a number of people, including some connected to Comet Ping Pong like Ian Svenonius, watched over him and monitored him.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His psychiatrist friend felt that Blake was at great risk for suicide. A group was instantly organized to keep watch over him round the clock: Mike Fellows, Ian Svenonius, Guy Picciotto—all old buddies from the punk scene in Washington—Morales, and a few others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what\'s weird is that he died on the South shore of Long Island in Queens, where, only a couple miles down the shore, many of the members of Comet Ping Pong were likely partying at the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1679118">Kaballah-influenced &quot;Fire Island Festival&quot;, including Alefantis himself</a> (<a href="https://www.dradance.org/fidf2011">The 2011 Festival happened on the same day as his death</a>). Given that Svenonius, Boutlier and other Comet regulars were there, there\'s a chance that Blake was actually invited out there and met with them shortly before his death. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This story, as well as the artist blog they wrote together, indicates that the NYC/DC Art World is closely tied to the CIA and amazingly, Comet Ping Pong too. They were tying Gaskell and others to the CIA and the NYPD should reopen this case to determine if the couple were actually threatened by cult members shortly before their death.</p>',

            This reporting adds weight to the Scientology connection and Duncan's reports of Scientology involvement.   Apparently, the Vanity Fair piece wasn't  written by the person it was credited to.  It was written by a known Scientology "media informant" who has a background as a NYPD detective - name of Connelly.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Almost everyone interviewed for this story brought up a minor mystery connected to the authorship of "The Golden Suicides," which the SoMA review first addressed in a post that was picked up by New York magazine's Vulture blog. In it, SoMA's editor Spalding wrote that he was contacted by someone who was familiar with the reporting on the story and who said that she "was stunned to read that Nancy Jo Sales had the byline."
            </p>
            <p>
             As it turns out, that person was LA Weekly's Kate Coe, who maintains that she always believed Vanity Fair contributing editor John Connolly to be the "author of record" and who shared some of her research with him when he first took on the assignment. Robin, who spoke to both Connolly and Sales, concurred that Connolly was the first to interview him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Connolly, too, insists that the assignment was initially his and said that he had asked to be taken off the story after Sales became involved, because he felt her relationship with Morales was "too complicated." After Sales completed the story, Connolly had the option of taking an "additional reporting" byline but declined to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Connolly, as Gawker's own John Cook reported in a 2011 New York Observer story called "Was a Vanity Fair Editor Secretly Working for the Church of Scientology?", has his own bizarre connections to the church. (A Vanity Fair spokeswoman named Beth Kseniak confirmed to Cook that Connolly contributed to "The Golden Suicides.")
            </p>
            <p>
             From the Observer:
            </p>
            <p>
             The accusation comes from Marty Rathbun, who ranked so high in the organization before he left that he served as Tom Cruise's "auditor," or confessor, and Mike Rinder, Scientology's former chief spokesman. Both men have defected from the church and accuse its current leader, David Miscavige, of ruling through violence and terror. On February 15, Rathbun posted to his blog a lengthy internal church memo, purportedly written by Linda Hamel, chief of the church's faux-CIA "Office of Special Affairs," revealing Connolly to have secretly supplied intelligence to the church on the preparation of Andrew Morton's 2008 biography of Tom Cruise. According to the memo, Connolly approached Morton in 2006 under the pretense of writing "an article for Vanity Fair about the books Morton has done on celebrities including the one he is writing on Tom Cruise." He proceeded, the memo says, to pump Morton for information about his book and report it back to the church.
            </p>
            <p>
             And while we have our tinfoil hats on, isn't it interesting that P.T. Anderson—who worked with Blake on Punch Drunk Love, remember, and introduced the artist to Beck—made a movie about Scientology in 2012?
            </p>
            <p>
             "Never heard of these people," a representative of the Church said when Sales asked about the alleged harassment for her Vanity Fair article. "This is completely untrue."
            </p>

            If the church is working this hard to run and spin the reporting on Duncan's suicide, her fears before her death are a lot more justified, and the suicide itself, possibly of both her and her boyfriend are called into question.   And what does this say about Vanity Fair?  Yet another media outlet infiltrated by forces that wish to publish controlled narratives to shape public opinion - another way to say "fake news".

            It isn't easy handling such complicated stuff and telling a story.    Thanks for your magazine quality investigative work and writing.  Drawing these connections is significant.  The fact that Scientology is now not a seperate cult but somehow connected into the Deep State's biggger picture is really scary as well.

            For what it's worth overdosing on Champagne, Benedryl and Tylenol sounds sketchy. I've mixed those many times to fight an impending morning hangover when I was drinking and lived to tell about it. Granted I have an Irish liver and it could probably process anything up to tier 5 radioactive waste (I'm kidding) but Champagne, Benedryl and Tylenol aren't that toxic. Yes the Tylenol could shut your liver down but only if you were doing that combo every day for months.
           </p>
           <p>
            When people die of overdoses it's usually due to opiates shutting down their breathing. Or with alcohol it's from drinking hard liquor and sending someone's body into shock or causing a pancreatic bleed. We're talking Vodka, Whiskey etc. hard liquor. Champagne doesn't kill. I've been to thousands of AA meetings and heard an equal number of tragic overdose stories. Duncan's suicide story doesn't pass the smell test.

Tony and Heather Podesta hosted an intimate gathering for New York-based artist Anna Gaskell, whose work is featured throughout the couple's D.C. home. Gaskell burst onto the art scene in the late 1990's and immediately caught the attention of critics internationally. Her work has been described as cinematic, profound and provocative and features the use of theatrical techniques to enhance and manipulate her photographs in a number of different ways. The subjects are often young girls and two of her well-known series of photographs, “Wonder” and “Override” are loosely based on Lewis Carroll's “ Alice in Wonderland”.
Gaskell was in town with her husband, artist Douglas Gordon, whose own exhibition is on view from February 12 through May 9 at The Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden . The exhibition includes large-scale projected video installations, text pieces, still photographs and filmed images on video monitors. Gordon is a Scottish artist known for his film and video installations based on classic Hollywood movies. The exhibit includes an all-day screening of Gordon's internationally acclaimed “24 Hour Psycho,” which slows Hitchcock's film from a 109-minute movie to 24 hour-long large screen show, compelling people to focus on every detail of the thriller."

            Definitely intimate with the DC pedo crowd.

             LMAO at the notion that the leftist punk musicians in DC are some kind of CIA deep state. Ian Svenonius is a Marxist Situationist type who has been sharply criticizing US foreign policy via music and books for 30 years and yet whatever dumbass wrote this stuff thinks he's CIA. Really underscores how little the alt-right types behind pizzagate understand the left. Remember that one guy on this subverse who thought antifa was made up of die-hard Hillary Clinton fans?

            Excellent research and post. Two names that jumped out besides the well known names are Reza Aslan &amp; Francis Luzzato.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reza Aslan is/was a CNN reporter until about one week ago when he was fired. He has long been suspected as CIA so to think he had someone's FBI file is not outside the realm. He was on film on a CNN recording engaged in cannibalism by eating human brain.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second name Francis Luzzato is possibly related to Tamera Luzzato as seen in the Podesta emails.

             Reza Aslans hate for Trump is akin to a pedophile fearing exposure or a deep-state satanic fck protecting his degenerate power....Trump is triggering these hang-em-high scum

            Another fabulous post, Swordfish!
           </p>
           <p>
            Anna Gaskell is, of course, yet another JEW.  JEWS, JEWS, and MORE JEWS everywhere in this story.  What a shock! (not!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Eustace Mullins cited in 1968 a statistic that the CIA was 86% Jewish.  No doubt it is higher now.

             You've obviously never been to HQ or the OHB in Langley.  Gaskell was raised by evangelical Christians.

             Relevant to the OP:
            </p>
            <p>
             The 80s/90s DC music scene revolved around the original 9:30 Club, Black Cat, Heaven and Hell and a bunch of other mostly non-existent clubs now.  These clubs were sprinkled about the city and had little geographic similarities with the CPP area.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said, much of the aforementioned musicians were tied in with a place called Food for Thought, I believe founded by Ian McAye (sp) from Fugazi.  F4T was located in Dupont Circle, aka The Fruit Loop, for obvious reasons.  This epicenter has been the LBGT and music intersection for DC for a while.
            </p>

             It would surprise me if some of these guys were caught up in early pedo stuff.  Here is what I can tell you:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               Most of the "edgy" punk rockers were actually wealthy kids from well-heeled families in McLean, Potomac, and Georgetown. (Example - Henry Rollins (Black Flag) went to Maret Prep (37k/yr now) -  And as you might expect, it would be likely that many of the parents of the punk rockers were in the employ of CIA, State, etc.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               I spent a lot of time in that scene and know a few of these players.  No one really struck me as a pedo, but then again, until you know what you are looking for....
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The tradition is probably carrying on with bands like Heavy Breathing etc.

              Thank you. I'm starting to find a lot of extremely bizarre connections between the CIA and punk record labels centered around Los Angeles/Seattle, among them Sub Pop Records and Epitaph. I think that there needs to be a distinction between the blackmail/control aspect of this as well as the people who simply do it for pleasure.
             </p>
             <p>
              As CIA, their ability to travel with unusual things without questioning what they're doing is very telling, and is one of the reasons I believe that punk record labels are a front for domestic trafficking/MK abuse, while the art world is part of a larger international operation led by the 'Rockefeller CIA', or the intersection of the wealthy elite and the intelligence community.

               The CIA is the creator of "modern art" and sponsored some of the most famous rock groups. The modern art movement was intentional as a psychological warfare operation to cause loss of critical thinking skills.

              <p>
               Going back to the 1990's research Michael Alig....he was a famous "club kid" who was convicted of a brutal dismemberment murder. He is friends with James Alefantis and was in a video prior to his conviction talking about "chickenhawks" young boys.
              </p>
              <p>
               He was released from prison last year and tweeted Alefantis. He started his own Art foundation of disturbing work. The movie "Party Monster" in which Macaulay Caulkin stars was allegedly about him.

               Somewhat related, the LA of the Germs and other early west coast punk bands was flooded with paedophiles.

              <p>
               The book Lexicon  Devil about Darby Crash has a brief chapter, Trouble At the Cup, about this.  It also mentions paedo teachers at the school Darby went to. The school was created by Scientologists, and Hollywood was full of the same in that area.
