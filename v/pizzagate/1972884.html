            It has become fashionable to pick and choose translations till you get one that says what you like.   I count about 22 bible versions at the link below that all substantially agree with the KJV.

             Note that Righteouswrath says the KJV is not OK for a particular verse he doesn't like but OK for other parts of the OT and for the NT.  Do not trust the advice of this person.  He is picking and choosing to match his beliefs.  What gives him the special dispensation to say this version for this verse and this for another.  Does he read Hebrew fluently so he can read it in the original.  What criteria other than his own preconceived beliefs does he have for making such judgments.  As I have shown he picks for these verses in Numbers a version that disagrees with 22 other versions.  That should give one pause.....

             Children as Concubines, Babies as Wives
            </p>
            <p>
             The ancient Hebrews were permitted to use children as concubines. Moses established the precedent. In the passage below, the Hebrews have just massacred the Midianite men. They return home with booty, and the Midianite women and children. Moses directs them to slaughter the captive women and children with this exception: virgin girl children are to be kept as concubines for the Hebrews.
            </p>
            <pre><code>    And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
    And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
    And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
    And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
    Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
    Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
    But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. 
</code></pre>
            <p>
             — Numbers 31:12-18 (KJV)
            </p>
            <p>
             In the following, the Talmud Sages reason that, since Phinehas was among the Hebrews who were permitted a child concubine and Phinehas was a priest, Numbers 31:17-18 is Divine sanction for the marriage of priests with girls under the age of three — babies. The rabbis describe the babies as proselytes. The American Heritage Dictionary defines proselyte as "a Gentile converted to Judaism." In the following passage, a bondman is a male slave, and a bondwoman a female slave.
            </p>
            <pre><code>GEMARA. … It was taught: R. Simeon b. Yohai stated: A proselyte who is under the age of three years and one day is permitted to marry a priest, (2) for it is said, But all the women children that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves, (3) and Phinehas (4) surely was with them. And the Rabbis? (5) — [These were kept alive] as bondmen and bondwomen. (6) If so, (7)  a proselyte whose age is three years and one day (8) should also be permitted! — [The prohibition is to be explained] in accordance with R. Huna. For R. Huna pointed out a contradiction: It is written, Kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him, (9) but if she hath not known, save her alive; from this it may be inferred that children are to be kept alive whether they have known or have not known [a man]; and, on the other hand, it is also written, But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves, (3) but do not spare them if they have known. Consequently (10) it must be said that Scripture speaks of one who is fit (11) for cohabitation. (12)

            </p>
            <p>
             This is a special definition of cohabitation. The translator, Rev. Dr. Israel W. Slotki, amplifies the text with footnotes:
            </p>
            <pre><code>    She is not regarded as a harlot.
    Num. XXXI, 18.
    Who was a priest.
    How could they, contrary to the opinion of R. Simeon b. Yohai, which has Scriptural support, forbid the marriage of the young proselyte?
    Not for matrimony.
    That, according to R. Simeon, Num. XXXI, 18 refers to matrimony.
    So long as she has 'not known man'.
    Num. XXXI, 17.
    To reconcile the contradiction.
    I.e., one who had attained the age of three years and one day.
    Not one who had actually experienced it.

            <p>
             — Rev. Dr. Slotki
            </p>
            <p>
             The doctrine that Jewish men may have sexual intercourse with non-Jewish children ("proselytes") under the age of three is expanded in the following passage; "Rabbi" is Judah the Prince.
            </p>
            <pre><code>GEMARA. … R. Jacob b. Idi stated in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi: The halachah is in agreement with R. Simeon b. Yohai. (13) Said R. Zera to R. Jacob b. Idi: Did you hear this (13) explicitly or did you learn it by a deduction? What [could be the] deduction? — As R. Joshua b. Levi related: There was a certain town in the Land of Israel the legitimacy of whose inhabitants was disputed, and Rabbi sent R. Romanos who conducted an enquiry and found in it the daughter of a proselyte who was under the age of three years and one day, (14) and Rabbi declared her eligible to live with a priest. (15)

            </p>
            <pre><code>    That a proselyte under the age of three years and one day may be married by a priest.
    And was married to a priest.
    I.e., permitted her to continue to live with her husband.

            <p>
             Not every Sage agreed with this practice. The Talmud records the words of one Sage who objected to one case, though it does not record the specifics of his objection.
            </p>
            <pre><code>GEMARA. … A certain priest married a proselyte who was under the age of three years and one day. Said R. Nahman b. Isaac to him: What [do you mean by] this? (12) — The other replied: Because R. Jacob b. Idi stated in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi that the halachah is in agreement with R. Simeon b. Yohai. (13) 'Go', the first said, 'and arrange for her release, or else I will pull R. Jacob b. Idi out of your ear'. (14)

            One of the FASTEST-GROWING religious sects is ORTHODOX JUDAISM!!   You know, the penis-sucking rabbi circumcision guys who give babies herpes which can -- and has -- caused brain damage and death!
           </p>
           <p>
            "There is a trend afoot, and in the next big population survey like this, we will see the beginning of a switch, whereby Orthodox Jews will eventually likely be the majority of American Jews,” said Sarah Bunin Benor, a professor of Jewish studies at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. She, like Cohen, was a member of the Pew study’s advisory committee."

             It's always amazed me that men have never organized together to stop the insanity of male circumcision ....
that would be one place to begin.

              The most powerful controlling mechanism is money, the second is probably sex or fear.
             </p>
             <p>
              A "good" Circumcision isn't bad and in fact can increase the size of the penis and make sex more enjoyable. A Circumcision that removes too much skin is horrible and stunts growth, causes hypersensitivity/premature ejaculate/erectile dysfunction, often destroys the frenulum, basically ruining the sex life of the recipient.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, the number one concern regarding their penis for most, is the size. Those with big ones are super proud and flaunt, those with small desperately hide and lie. It is probably the most stressful thing, having a small dick and wanting a mate. It will cause you to freeze in fear at great opportunities, the ridicule is incredible, the self-hatred and self-pity is a nightly, or more frequent thing. The answer to this stress and pain is either masturbation, violence or overcompensation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Big penis people have a lot of pride in their big dicks. 7.5"+ surely have the most, and rightfully so, sex is more fun that way, it's more free. I'm not saying all big dick people are pompous and self-obsessed and ignorant. I'm saying at the ages of 12-whenever men this about sex a lot, once you've amassed fortune it's probably the only thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meh, what I'm saying is there's no compassion. It's not about circumcision it's about penis size. The quality of the Circumcision matters too. I'm sure people would be more outraged if they knew those Circumcision foreskins are being used for fibroblasts too. Men are too busy competing for mates to be compassionate towards one another. A small dicker can't put his guard down for a second, he has to overcome the disadvantage somehow. You've got these Circumcision shills fighting tooth and nail too. Just like the ones fighting FOR meat consumption. Follow the fuckin' money.

               If your wife or girlfriend leaves you due to penis size or that you were uncircumsized she never loved you to begin with and is not worth your time. That being said, circumcision is a minority group. Most of the world is uncircumsized. The US has also seen a downward trend in circumcision. Still, the social ridicule of circumsized men in the US is maddening. I'm unaware if American women care that much and it is more about the insecurity of the male.

               There are two sides of control ... money = power.
But we also have to remember that power can be used for good or for evil.
              </p>
              <p>
               Think you hit it with FEAR because that's what male-supremacist religions have always used
with their boogey men -- Satan, Devil, Hell and it's what the CIA used for mind control.
Of course, they also regularly torture people.
              </p>
              <p>
               You're a male speaking I presume from the position of a male who has been circumcised?
So you have no actual way of knowing how much more enjoyable sex can be if you are not circumcised.
Imo, all circumcision is intended to increase sensitivity which results in premature ejaculation.
You need to speak with women who have had sex with both circumcised and uncircumcised males and 
they'll tell you that uncircumcised males have more pleasure and more staying power.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, true, it's a danger to young babies as there are times when things go wrong with circumcision.
There are a lot of "benefit" myths surrounding circumcision which are lies.
              </p>
              <p>
               And if you see what a male child goes through in circumcision you realize it is a form of sexual torture
which the child will have some kind of memory of, even if it's only fear of his parents hurting him because
the infant understands that it is the parents who are his protectors.
Parents need to research this for themselves, but I think many males really don't want to admit that they've been maimed
unnecessarily.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most of us recognize that males with a small penis are constantly trying to prove something.
That's the one that gets the most attention.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look at the military --  Penis and Gun same thing in the song.
               <br/>
               The suggestion being that both are to be used for violence.

              <p>
               So many armies have been told by governments to rape occupants of nations they invade that 
United Nations has acknowledged rape as "a tool of war."
              </p>
              <p>
               The other side of this for men to think about is that men can't be sent to war unless first their bonds
with women and children are broken.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our best hope is that men will join with women and children and stand against Elite patriarchy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, there is also competition among females based in looks.
While breast size really doesn't matter to women, they know that it matters to men.
And -- again -- this seems to have something to do with the fact that quite a few generations 
of babies have gone without being breast fed which seems to have created an obsession.
We are the only species which is told that we need nourishment from a pharmacy or another animal
in order to thrive!
               <br/>
               Another myth, of course, and hard to think that anyone believed it, but families actually did believe it -- !!
Meanwhile, breast milk is so valuable to our health and strength/human skeleton that it's unthinkable that
any baby could survive without it.  Breast milk provides immediate protection from disease and strengthens
our immune system.  Plus there are hormones and chemicals in breast milk that you use into your 80's.
              </p>
              <p>
               For me, it's clear that circumcision is violence done to a baby and I hope that soon 
it will be stopped.

              <p>
               I've kind of lost track of the anti-circumcision movement so don't really know what's going on with it.
But will try to check into it again and follow your website recommendation.
What could the message of this maiming be to the baby except that this is a violent world and your 
parents aren't protecting you from its violence?
              </p>
              <p>
               And, indeed, it is very sad that men don't protect their sons from it, but they've also been fed so many 
lies about the "benefits" of circumcision in propaganda that it is easy for many to avoid seeing the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think you make the best summing up of it here --
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>

              <p>
               And, sadly, most women up to now have left this decision to their husbands.

                Thanks for considering the baby's perspective. You're right, it's a terrible message to the child.

                I actually met the Bloodstained Men when they were touring near me, and they said that the responses they were getting were much more supportive than they used to be. Perhaps in 20 years MGM will only apply to a minority of boys. I hope so.

                 Thank you for the lead to the Bloodstained Men -- and I've just posted it on two different sites
where I hope they will get some attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will also mail a contribution to them.

                 Just would add that I do consider male circumcision "mutilation" however we should be clear that 
Female genital mutilation involves removal of everything within the outside labia.
                 <strong>
                  Everything.
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 AND ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 For anyone here -- male or female -- who is interested in stopping male circumcision ....

                 The foreskin is actually a sexual organ.
