<p>The Child Porn includes videos of young boys hurting themselves sexually by accident while adults laugh. It also includes young boys engaging in beastiality.

<p>I would like to offer political commentary but I don\'t know much about Nader. However, the fact that he was arrested for child porn in the \'90s and was still working in politics raises some eyebrows for sure.</p>',
