<p>Greetings Fellow Pizzagaters! </p>
<p>Don\'t know about you, but I\'m feeling proud about being a member of this illustrious community. </p>
<p>We are doing it. Collectively, we are chipping away and finding all those hidden pieces that flesh out this story and reveal the dark underbelly. This quote March Madness unquote clue is a big one. How big? We\'ll all see together, but it does tie some pretty big players together.  And the use of code words totally confirms what we already suspected: (1) the code words are used; and (2) they\'re used to be able to publicly post information without fear of anything be revealed. </p>
<p>It\'s so much easier that way. If they didn\'t hide what they were really saying, they\'d have to use separate accounts, or keep this on the dark web, or in emails that may get hacked into ... but this way? Easy-peasy! Just use a code word and you\'re golden. It\'s suddenly safe to post on Twitter and any other social media giant. </p>
<p>So here\'s the original post by Q: </p>

Q</p>

<p>MARCH MADNESS? What could that be? Well, I hop on Twitter today and find out: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bchapman151/status/974896957276770305">https://twitter.com/bchapman151/status/974896957276770305</a></p>
<p>an anon caught this....these peeps are talking in code - no doubt - Lynn and Chubble - Now Jimmy and Holder....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the two pics attached for easy reference: </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/JLN2c">https://imgur.com/a/JLN2c</a></p>
<p>and </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/NuAwi">https://imgur.com/a/NuAwi</a></p>
<p>In the first, we see Comey talking about THE SUBSTANCE: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>I don\'t have the personalized bracket stationary like <a href="https://voat.co/user/BarackObama">@BarackObama</a> but I got the substance. (and a smoother shot (tbh)</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>And then Holder: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Analyze McCabe firing on two levels: the substance and the timing. We don\'t know enough about the substance yet. The timing appears to be cruel and a cave that compromised DOJ independence to please an increasingly erratic President who should\'ve played no role here. This is dangerous.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Dangerous? In what respect, Holder? Care to elucidate? But Comey\'s tweet supplies the context of the March Madness remark: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/march-madness-expert-brackets-ncaa-tournament-2018-upset-predictions-title-picks/">https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/march-madness-expert-brackets-ncaa-tournament-2018-upset-predictions-title-picks/</a></p>
<p>March Madness expert brackets: NCAA Tournament 2018 upset predictions, title picks

</blockquote>
<p>So was Comey just talking about his basketball shot here? Or was it another type of shot? One that contained THE SUBSTANCE? </p>
<p>And what caves was Holder referring to? The ones that don\'t exist? And why is it dangerous for our POTUS to be involved in a decision based on ethics and upholding the integrity of the position held? But speaking of McCabe and quote BRACKETS unquote, here\'s another post from Q that ties into both: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bchapman151/status/974997646929690627">https://twitter.com/bchapman151/status/974997646929690627</a></p>
<p>Terminated #2 - In the brackets - also 19 others _yes An anon pieced this one together - makes sense no? Lots of things happen behind the scenes and cannot be released until the timing is right. Trust the plan. Future proves the past! #Qanon <a href="https://voat.co/user/potus">@potus</a></p>

<p>Another three pics. One: </p>

<p>Note the use of brackets. It means the posts are multi-layered. </p>
<p>So there you have it. A potent call to focus on MARCH MADNESS and a seemingly innocent image of basketball picks. Is that what\'s going on?</p>
<p>I suspect there\'s a lot more.</p>',

            Intriguing post. It is rather odd that Holder and Comey would use the not so common word "substance" on the same day. It seems highly speculative to connect this to Q's March Madness quote, though, so I am going to go ahead and give this our "Unverified" flair.

            How is the Q Leak you post proven accurate? Because Comey mentioned the basketball tournament? That's not really intellectually honest, and saying it invites ridicule of Q. Here is the only Q Leak using that word:

             You know, this post is more trouble than it's worth. I posted it because I thought people should see this and deliberately didn't select one of the other topics that deserve dumpster diving because I don't have that much time these days. And here I am, rambling on and on and on explaining what is clearly speculation.

             Okay, I had to reread my post twice and don't see where I used those words. Where did I say anything was PROVEN ACCURATE? Or did I merely state that MARCH MADNESS aligns perfectly with the tweet of James Comey TO our Kenyan president? Further, Comey states that The Kenyan has STATIONARY ... spelled with an 'A', but why would you expect anyone in The Kenyan years to know the difference between STATIONARY and STATIONERY since none of them knew how to speak English or spell.

Or the fact that Holder used a basketball player's name for his hidden AMAIL ECCOUNT (just a little spelling humor ... I've got to amuse myself somehow these days).  But you're right .... why would I assume someone with personalized stationery would be into this ... or that March Madness would connect in any way, shape, or form to someone who could have anything and yet chose to have personalized stationery. I must be crazy to think it was important to The Kenyan, Comey, or Holder ... and I shamed the entire community .... wow!

             Not sure what is going on and how anyone is discredited nor do I see where I mentioned Q saying THE SUBSTANCE was adrenochrome. Could you please supply the direct quote where I said this please?  Here is the only speculative quote I see:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              quote THE SUBSTANCE unquote can be referring to just about anything. But when used in the context it is, it strongly harkens to this elixir the elite are using to keep young. While it may be referring to stem cells, blood, or adenochrome, all are produced by the harvesting of the young.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This. This is what I said. Again, I don't see where I'm tying Q into him saying what I said, but then I'm not Aric Holder or James Comay (ha!)
            </p>
            <p>
             Because I merely included adenochrome into the mix is what's getting you upset? And you're using the argument that we're going to look foolish because quote THEY unquote are telling us it doesn't exist? This is the same THEY who are telling us there are more than two sexes?
            </p>
            <p>
             In the first place, adenochrome does exist. It's a molecular compound that is found in medical journals so let's dispense with that argument because it defies logic to deny what is fact.

             So what part of this don't you believe exists? Or are we on the same page? Maybe it's the fact that this substance is being used in the way it is purportedly being used that's bothering you although I don't know why. A chemical cannot be part of psyops. Cannot! What other chemical is singled out for such an honor? Please name one that is in the catalogued scientific database that THEY are saying doesn't exist and is part of a psyops operation?

It, too, was ridiculed, but how can you ridicule chemistry? But then again, how can you deny biology?

             Remember, these articles are written from the standpoint of a group of people who don't want to introduce these things into their body. They desire to stay peaceful and calm. But this will give the groundwork for understanding that if a group wanted the reverse which would be the hypothetical situation of meat charged with these unhealthy, barbarous side effects of chemical reactions to fear, torture, and captivity, then the would have to introduce those stress factors into the curation of such a food supply. So again, hypothethetically, if a group of say cannibals fed on a meat supply, again, hypothetically, that was oh .... children ... they would have to impose these conditions upon aforementioned to produce the required effect.

            Hi mpat, 
I can't really comment to much on what "substance" could be, maybe kids, drugs, weapons, missiles in shipping containers, you know these people deal in all sorts of shit.  I've just been mulling all this lately too and don't have any real solid ideas but your post is sort of related so here:  the mess I'm thinking, do with it what you can:
           </p>
           <p>
            Holder's email alias was Lew Alcindor (aka Kareem Abdul Jabbar's original name) which ties into basketball and March Madness to some extent. Ties to Muslim, muslim brotherhood, i bet, and don't forget also that Brennan is converted muslim and his tweet was equally thuggish.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as I am concerned, the use of code is undeniable, so its just a matter of deciphering, as you are. The crazy crazy "going to Mars" article that

            </a>
            in a comment the other day has me pondering more. Don't forget that Robert David Steele the ex-cia informant was sort of coherent until he started reporting on Alex Jones about children being shipped to Mars for Slaves a year ago or so. Just like the pizza, cheese, and hotdog meanings are so commonplace that we initially overlook it until it was just too weird,  now they can't use those words, it may be "substance" is replacing a pizzagate word.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of "going to Mars" and all the satire in that article, I think the absurdity of it is supposed to just make us dismiss it as nonsense but yet, its actually more code.  Combined with the word CAVE, Originally it brought to my mind the alleged vaults under the Getty,  now that its been id'ed in two separate sources: Kestral's article and RDS, sending slave children to Mars must mean something; now I am wondering maybe there are vaults under observatories like Griffith Park, or obviously it could be any of the previously  researched tunnels, DUMBS, underground bunkers.
           </p>
           <p>
            But back to the word "Substance" = sub+stance, SUB (underwater, underground) and whatever SUB Q has been on about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please keep posting. Your dedication keeps me inspired.

             Hey, thanks. Your insights are always appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
             You gave me a few, 'Hmmmm ....' moments there. It could well be the entire thing is code, but it is an astute observation about being involved in this brotherhood. I mean, I'm shocked. I've never heard someone in the high offices speak in such trash-talking language. The very bitter, very guttersnipe Susan Rice was the same way. What did she say? I had to look it up to be accurate:

             ‘People know not to mess with me
            </h1>
            <p>
             PEOPLE KNOW NOT TO MESS WITH ME? And she's a U.S. Ambassador? WTF?
            </p>
            <p>
             As to THE SUBSTANCE, I don't know. Is it a maligning of the word 'substantive'? But this being too far out there, that struck a bell. I was dumpster diving the other day and came across someone calling out David Icke. Now David Icke, I always thought was nuts. But this blogger called him out because he wrote an article on the sacrificing of children and blood drinking. I winced. I was like, yeah. If I had read that before last October, I would have thought it crazy town, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know, but I thank you for your thoughts. I'm going to add another absolutely nutso article I found. This is actually not a theory, it's a 'in the news story'. It was reported and everything and even in the Wikileaks batch of leaked emails.And it's about THE SUBSTANCE. Or about A SUBSTANCE. It'll give another angle on this whole thing that I admit I don't quite understand. But when I saw the teams, all I could think of is locations. And Virginia was circled a few times. I'll amend the original post if you'd like to read it.

              ok, looking forward to your updated or repost on this. Their thuggery could even be its own post really, for a bigger forum. These current tweets,  Susan Rice, DSW threatening the Capitol Police, Schumer saying on Maddow that the IC has six ways to Sunday to get back at anyone who crosses them, and the Clinton body count... they don't bother hiding it anymore.

            : Mod here, lol. Could you please link to an old Voat post (or another useful info), so that newbies will understand to what you are referring to in this sentence:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             to this elixir the elite are using to keep young. While it may be referring to stem cells, blood, or adenochrome, all are produced by the harvesting of the young.

            Also, could you please explain how 'This new clue may well reveal how this commodity is tracked, shipped, and sold'.

            <p>
             I'm not making a claim as to what they're referring to -- I'm speculating. Here's the quote: &gt;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              quote THE SUBSTANCE unquote can be referring to just about anything. But when used in the context it is, it strongly harkens to this elixir the elite are using to keep young. While it may be referring to stem cells, blood, or adenochrome, all are produced by the harvesting of the young. This new clue may well reveal how this commodity is tracked, shipped, and sold.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I clearly state that THE SUBSTANCE can be anything and speculate that the commodity might be tracked and shipped by the use of locations. For instance, in the handwritten bracket selections, Comey is picking VIRGINIA. Is he selecting it because the team will win or for another reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not the one that wrote these enigmatic, shady tweets. I only call them as I see them. Either Comey and Holder can't write a goddamn sentence, or there is something else going on in the messages. Because I did not make a claim, there's no way I can give do what you're asking.
            </p>

            I can relate to what you're saying when reading the Comey quote, but, unfortunately not so much when reading Holder's quote. Perhaps the latter is only referring to the reason McCabe was fired = still unclear?

              And how do we know 'the stubstance' in the first quote would be the elixir of youth and not some common stuff people take in order to enhance their performance?

             Did we KNOW what was going on amongst The Cannibal Elite when we started the investigative journey?
            </p>
            <p>
             KNOW is a loaded threshold. Presumptive evidence leads to an educated guess, but how many thing did we  believe we knew at the start of this have proven not to be true? And if they were dealing with known performance-enhancing SUBSTANCES or drugs, why the need to go into Haiti and Africa and open up the lines of human trafficking? They could merely connect with our friendly neighbors to the south and get all the cocaine needed. The same can be said of steroids, etc. Just ask any professional athlete how easy that is to obtain. So we can safely assume that THE SUBSTANCE they're talking about is not one that can be supplied by pretty much anyone. It would have to be one tightly-controlled to ensure maximum profitability. Hence the leap to this being one of THE SUBSTANCES that has been discussed on this forum since the discovery of blood-drinking, stem cell, and adenochrome were revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of Holder's comments, are you saying they're not enigmatic because, frankly, I can't make heads or tails out of them. Where he veers the subject to caves and it being dangerous .... no, he's lost me. And THE SUBSTANCE? I know substantive. Holder was the AG and I would assume he would know that word also, but that's also an assumption. Perhaps he doesn't even though he has an educational background up the wahoo, and used the wrong word. Even if we gave him that leeway, it wouldn't explain his using the word CAVE. He knows what that means; we don't. Not in this context. And DANGEROUS ... he knows what that word means also. So dangerous how? To who? Is it a veiled threat? A statement? A prediction?
            </p>
            <p>
             So if you're looking for knowns, those are on the shortlist. But common sense tells us you don't have to travel to Haiti, set up adoption agencies, kidnap/molest orphans to obtain steroids or cocaine.
