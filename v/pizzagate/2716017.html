<p>Jewish law does not share the belief common among abortion opponents that life begins at conception, nor does it legally consider the fetus to be a full person deserving of protections equal those accorded to human beings. In Jewish law, a fetus attains the status of a full person only at birth. Sources in the Talmud indicate that prior to 40 days of gestation, the fetus has an even more limited legal status, with one Talmudic authority (Yevamot 69b) asserting that prior to 40 days the fetus is “mere water.” Elsewhere, the Talmud indicates that the ancient rabbis regarded a fetus as part of its mother throughout the pregnancy, dependent fully on her for its life — a view that echoes the position that women should be free to make decisions concerning their own bodies.

<p>The idea that a fetus is &quot;mere water&quot; seems to flourish in Texas:</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge David Alan Ezra struck down a Texas law on Wednesday that would have required hospitals and clinics to bury cremated fetal remains, causing another courtroom setback for state leaders and anti-abortion groups.
Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and president of Whole Woman\'s Health and Whole Woman\'s Health Alliance, said in a news release that the ruling is &quot;a victory for all Texan women.&quot;

<p>Andrea Ferrigno is on the board of the Abortion Care Network. She is also involved with Whole Woman’s Health in San Antonio, TX. 
Abortion Care Network is funded by Open Society Foundation\'s Communities Against Hate initiative. 
Abortion Care Network was awarded a grant for $70,000 over six months to &quot;create a [national] network of social workers uniquely positioned to provide support to abortion providers.&quot;[1]

            Every time I see an article on how ‘young blood ‘ can rejuvenate older people, I think of how much ‘young blood’ is available through the abortion industry...
           </p>
           <p>
            It was 1.6 million in 2016 and about 1 million in 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            That seems to be a lot of ‘young blood’!
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m curious as to how much money is involved...

             When the government doesn't even demand stats on numbers of abortions performed, doubt we'll ever get any verified info on the money involved. When millionaires/billionaires invest in abortion it must not be a charitable investment but something with a good $ return.

            For damn sure premature babies under 40 days are not just water! I was born 6 weeks early and have vague memories of prebirth living, so I am utterly convinced life begins way the damn hell before birth and before 40 days.
            <br/>
            I find it surreal and an act of unconscionable murder to abort a child after 4 months in uterus. Isn[t that enough time for a woman to decide if she wants to raise it? What the hell is wrong with these women not caring about their own children?  Perhaps the solution is to mandate that sure all women can have abortions after 4 months pregnant, but they have to do it by killing themselves. Then at least the child will have a comfy death in the waters of life.

             Sometimes the women have a change of heart at the last minute:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Were women ever coerced into the procedure? Kelly says that sometimes, before the final surgery, on the third day "you could blatantly hear them in the halls saying they wanted to change their minds." But they were sedated, in what Kelly calls a "Nyquil nap," which made it difficult to protest. Sometimes the IV was turned up; in any case, the woman always had the abortion."

            this 2 posts were so hard to do I haven't followed up the other parts
           </p>
           <p>
            most of these scientists say that these children would just be placed in the garbage
           </p>
           <p>
            most abortions goes hand and hand with trafficking, many are children themselves
           </p>
           <p>
            the others, why don't they take a more proactive stance then relying on a quick fix for an unwanted pregnancy
           </p>
           <p>
            Doctors need to do their jobs too
           </p>
           <p>
            they don't tell women that birth control pills lose their effect when women are taking antibiotics
           </p>
           <p>
            with all this talk of PP, I just might have to finish the series and  what they use the baby parts for
           </p>
           <p>
            but with all the links I have, I cant help but think they are doing something they want no one to know about

             The massive amounts of organs being harvested I am just amazed it's a constant demand. We are made to believe they are super hard to come by but obviously with means and connections this isn't true.
            </p>
            <p>
             So like with the cherries when they have abundant crops they dump them by the tons to rot rather than cause lower pricing or feed the poor what is being done with these organs stolen?
            </p>
            <p>
             So many sources from Chinese concentration camps to human trafficking from 3rd world countries to socialized medicine (Alfie Evans denied care or leaving to free care in Italy so NHS could take his organs) and including medical kidnapping here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Are they making themselves youth sliders?

              I wonder if they are looking for specifics
             </p>
             <p>
              a certain blood type maybe, Negative blood is rare
             </p>
             <p>
              17%, at most, of the world population has it
             </p>
             <p>
              and in that 17%, are the people we are fighting against
             </p>
             <p>
              what kind of experiments are they doing?
             </p>
             <p>
              don't forget, a lot of the German Mad Scientists were given a warm welcome here

               I think they’re interested in the blood... several articles have recently come out about the rejuvenating effects of ‘young blood’
              </p>
              <p>
               Perhaps they are trying to get ahead of the story when it comes out?

                 I think it's tied also to red head genes. It runs in my family. Red heads are resistent to pain medication and anesthetic. I carry the red head genes though am not one myself. Cousins and aunts and uncles we have a bunch.

            I posted this because it made me recall a video I saw on Youtube about two years ago (and because it was local to me.). Unfortunately, I can not recall what video. Nevertheless, the researcher noted that in cases of trafficking in a particular geography, you will often find former Dyncorp employees in positions of power in the local law enforcement agencies (Sheriff, Local Police, State Police, etc.) Just an angle of possible interest.

            I am afraid I am in agreement with Judge Ezra's ruling inasmuch  as the State should not compel the manner by which the remains of the fetus is handled. Instead I think the State ought to protect a womans right to make that decision.  And further her right to.decide at or before the procedure should be spelled out in a consent form whereby she can opt for some kind of dignified disposal versus allowing the remains to be sold for medical.purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then an aggressive public awareness campaign should be launched by abortion opponents (and proponents like me)  to.educate the public  as to just what medical use actually takes place. Do you want fetal cells to help repair retinas or do you want them to add flavor to popsicles?  I dont know if this would result in less abortions but it might help to restrict the sale of baby parts.  I would hope that the disgusting sale of baby parts would help support a movement to restrict abortions to first trimester which may or may not withstand a constitutional challenge. Could public financial support for 1st trimester abortion clinics be upheld so as to encourage quick decisions and  dignified disposal? Would abortion opponents accept this in exchange for a ban on automatic assault weapons, for instance? Can the citizenry enter into a social contract that the judicial system would uphold?
           </p>

            Americans are divided on these issues pretty much 50/50 to a degree that  the minority views  deserve protection and accommodation. But first comes education and awareness.

             1st, in an open and free society, the decision to terminate the birth of another human should remain with the parents and the government should have no part in the decision then made by those parents. The tax paying public should never be forced by law to fund an issue contrary to their conscience. Body parts harvesting "is" happening and not just to fetuses. I personally became involved in the case of Barbara Steele a very young mother of an 18 month old little boy. The boy died after being admitted to Children's Hospital in San Diego where the mother agreed to allow his body parts to be harvested should he "expire." Even before the autopsy the surgeons had removed all body parts of value. The mother was charged with 1st degree murder when it was obvious to the medical doctors and the police that the boy died from an accidental fall and no evidence of "shaking syndrome"as a cause of death existed, which is what the mother was charged with and incarcerated. Mom was ultimately released after 5 months in jail and pleading to negligence. There are a lot of details that make this case an extraordinary miscarriage of justice and the dangers to everyone when body parts are made available for sale.

             You know the abortion providers are not going to provide disposal details before the procedure, it might sway the woman's decision to not have the abortion. I think they should provide the woman with the going rates for fetal eyeballs ($600 a pair) so she's totally aware of what she's about to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interestingly, the chairman of the board of Abortion Care Network, Dallas Schubert of Cleveland OH, tells the story of how she had a preemie at 6 months, chose to keep the baby at a cost of 1 million and 100 days in the hospital and the child is a healthy adult now. But Schubert goes on to say, but if someone didn't have the support she had then they should have the option to abort. So the poor get abortion and the rich get preemie coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
             This country doesn't even keep accurate figures of how many babies are aborted. What are we teaching our young women, if it's not convenient, flush it? What kind of empathetic mothers do they go on to be (if they do become mothers) if that's the respect we have for life, that it doesn't merit burial, that it's only value is after it's life as a research tool.

              I cant imagine any provider voluntarily telling a woman about the sale of baby parts. That is why I suggested a law mandating a certain kind of consent form  and a way for dignified disposal. BTW, how are our euthanized pets disposed of in the absence of  an individual cremation?  Yes, the rich will always have a way to a more preferrable outcome on any issue.  We are never going to outlaw abortion. Even a middle class woman can afford to fly to Italy for a Roman holiday and an abortion.  The best we can hope for are some restrictions.

             We know that but we still let them hold the reins in Washington and elsewhere. They even attacked a USS Liberty in 1967 killing 34 and injuring 170, yet we called it an "accident" and LBJ sent the planes back that would have punished the Israeli attackers.

             They ,the (blips), even control/manipulate the stats on abortions; not that there are accurate stats as some states like California don't even report in . Guttmacher Institute started by two "blips" Guttmacher and Jaffee calls the abortion providers to get stats, the CDC just waits for the info to come to them. No sanctions on states that don't report.

            This type of thinking is in line with the most evil book in the world, the talmud. They are ALL toxic to this nation as a COLLECTIVE, history has proven me right hundreds of times over. Expel and ban them, take back our money supply, and never allow them to have control of our country again.

            This is so wrong in so many ways.  We have to remember that Israel is a top organ harvester of the globe.  So this is why they are into stem cells as well.  They have no respect for other people really, since they use Palestinian children when they need organs.  I am not talking about ordinary variety Jews, I am talking Elites.  They are the ones that have the money to pay for the organs and the money to invest in these abortion companies.  They are making money on killing live babies for a profit.  Immoral Monsters is what they are.    Soros is raking in a Bundle. Imagine what kind of money that is, 80% of all abortions in this country.  I just threw an envelope from NARAL in the mail.  It felt so good.
