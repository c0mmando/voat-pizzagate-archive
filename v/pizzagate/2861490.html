            I would venture to say that the founder of the Church may also have been abused.  This revelation should be no surprise to the abuser's son.  I would venture to guess he knew all along what his father was doing.  That is one sick family.

             there was a cdan about a church being involved w/ trafficking, I always had a hunch it's related to the "nondenominational charismatic evangelicals"
 I know these charismatic christian churches like hillsong, bethel, and the vineyard and global awakenings have VERY far reach in terms of international "missionary trips." The charismatics I know have been to columbia, brazil, india, africa, puerto rico, costa rica, and other countries I can't even remember and not once or twice but dozens of times in the past few years to perform old style "come to the altar" healings that frankly seem to be hypnosis/mass hysteria. They ALWAYS visit schools and afterschool programs and orphanages to interact with children. They seem like good people with the best of intentions BUT I worry about the predators in their midst and that they could be facilitating a scheme they don't even realize they're participating in.
