            Eric Schmidt is an American software engineer, a businessman, and the Executive Chairman of Alphabet, Inc
           </p>
           <p>
            In March 2001, Schmidt joined Google's board of directors as chairman, and became the company's CEO in August 2001. At Google, Schmidt shared responsibility for Google's daily operations with founders Page and Brin. Prior to the Google initial public offering, Schmidt had responsibilities typically assigned to the CEO of a public company and focused on the management of the vice presidents and the sales organization
           </p>
           <p>
            Schmidt was on the list of ARTnews's 200 top art collectors in 2008
           </p>
           <p>
            He is a member of the Bilderberg Group and has attended the annual Bilderberg conferences every year since 2007
           </p>
           <p>
            He also has a listed membership with the Trilateral Commission.[105] He is a member of the International Advisory Board at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford
           </p>
           <p>
            Schmidt is an active member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council
           </p>
           <p>
            Google has become very much a willing part of this deep state, with Eric Schmidt being the primary driving force that has propelled the company into its contemporary role not just as a search engine monopoly, but also as a powerful and undemocratic tech arm of the shadow government
           </p>
           <p>
            Google is getting WH [White House] and State Dept support and air cover. In reality they are doing things the CIA cannot do . . . [Cohen] is going to get himself kidnapped or killed. Might be the best thing to happen to expose Google’s covert role in foaming up-risings, to be blunt. The US Gov’t can then disavow knowledge and Google is left holding the shit-bag
           </p>
           <p>
            The last forty years has seen a huge proliferation of think tanks and political NGOs whose purpose, beneath all the verbiage, is to execute political agendas by proxy.
           </p>
           <p>
            attendees: US officials, telecom magnates, security consultants, finance capitalists, and foreign-policy tech vultures like Alec Ross (Cohen’s twin at the State Department).33 At the hard core are the arms contractors and career military: active US Cyber Command chieftains, and even the admiral responsible for all US military operations in Latin America from 2006 to 2009. Tying up the package are Jared Cohen and the chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt
           </p>

            Caught red-handed last year making petabytes of personal data available to the US intelligence community through the PRISM program, Google nevertheless continues to coast on the goodwill generated by its “don’t be evil” doublespeak

           </p>
           <p>
            Long before company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin hired Schmidt in 2001, their initial research upon which Google was based had been partly funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA
           </p>
           <p>
            Google—whose publicly declared corporate mission is to collect and “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”52—was accepting NSA money to the tune of $2 million to provide the agency with search tools for its rapidly accreting hoard of stolen knowledge
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2004, after taking over Keyhole, a mapping tech startup cofunded by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the CIA, Google developed the technology into Google Maps, an enterprise version of which it has since shopped to the Pentagon and associated federal and state agencies on multimillion-dollar contracts
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2008, Google helped launch an NGA spy satellite, the GeoEye-1, into space. Google shares the photographs from the satellite with the US military and intelligence communities.55 In 2010, NGA awarded Google a $27 million contract for “geospatial visualization services

            Google’s Eric Schmidt admits political censorship of search results
           </p>
           <p>
            Schmidt’s remarks at the gathering of military and national security officials confirm the World Socialist Web Site’s charges that Google has been deliberately altering its search algorithms and taking other steps to prevent people from accessing certain information through its search engines. The WSWS has itself been a principal target of these efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google’s efforts are just one part of a much wider government-corporate drive to assert control over the flow of information over the Internet, involving Amazon, Twitter and Facebook, as well as Internet service providers such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Verizon and AT&amp;T.
           </p>
           <p>
            A campaign against “fake news” has now become a campaign against “weaponized news,” meaning true information that is critical of or damaging to the political establishment. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has claimed that when her emails and Wall Street speeches were leaked by WikiLeaks they had been “weaponized.” Under Google’s new censorship rubric, any article written about the true information in the Clinton leaks would be a candidate for censorship

            Cohen's ties to Twitter
           </p>
           <p>
            Jared Cohen, the youngest member of the State Department’s policy planning staff, and Alec Ross,
           </p>
           <p>
            Ross and Cohen have formed an unlikely and unprecedented team in the State Department. They are the public face of a cause with an important-sounding name: 21st-century statecraft
           </p>
           <p>
            And then Hillary Clinton arrived. “The secretary is the one who unleashed us,” Ross says. “She’s the godmother of 21st-century statecraft.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Early this year, Ross and Cohen helped prop open the State Department’s doors by bringing 10 leading figures of the tech and social-media worlds to Washington for a private dinner with Clinton and her senior staff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the guests were Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google;
           </p>
           <p>
            Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chairman of Twitter;
           </p>
           <p>
            James Eberhard of Mobile Accord; Shervin Pishevar of the mobile-phone-game-development company SGN;
           </p>
           <p>
            Jason Liebman of Howcast;
           </p>
           <p>
            Tiffany Shlain, founder of the Webby Awards; and Andrew Rasiej of Personal Democracy Forum, an annual conference on the intersection of politics and technology. Toward the end of the evening, Clinton delighted those assembled by inviting them to use her “as an app.”
           </p>
           <p>
            A few days later, they did. On Jan. 12, the Haiti earthquake struck, and within two hours, Eberhard, working with the State Department, set up the Text Haiti 90999 program, which raised more than $40 million for the Red Cross in $10 donations.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was also the day Google announced that Chinese hackers tried to break into the Gmail accounts of dissidents. In response, Google said that it would no longer comply with China’s censorship laws and for a few months redirected Chinese users to its Hong Kong search engine. The dispute rose to a high-level diplomatic conflict, but it also gave added resonance to the 45-minute “Internet freedom” speech Secretary Clinton delivered a little more than a week later, in which she placed “the freedom to connect” squarely within the U.S. human rights and foreign policy agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            At Google, and later at YouTube’s headquarters, Ross and Cohen stressed the political power of viral videos and the potential for mobile phones to become widespread public tools for education, banking and election monitoring
           </p>
           <p>
            As the recent Wikileaks scandal suggests, new technologies may usher in as many diplomatic catastrophes as breakthroughs. (In June, a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst claimed to have given 260,000 diplomatic cables to Wikileaks, a Web site dedicated to publishing confidential material.) When I asked Cohen whether sites like Wikileaks made the kind of diplomacy he advocates harder, he allowed that they posed a challenge: “All of these tools can be utilized by individuals for everything from Wikileaks to other negative purposes” — at least as the State Department sees it — “but that technology isn’t going anywhere. So we can fear we can’t control it and ignore the space, or we can recognize we can’t control it, but we can influence it.”
           </p>
           <p>
            real dangers when companies are conflated with states. “The risk,” Carlos Pascual, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, told me in February, “is if and when in a particular country — whether that’s China or Iran or Cuba or North Korea — there’s a perception that Twitter or Facebook is a tool of the U.S. government
           </p>
           <p>
            Cohen was appointed by Condoleezza Rice and still considers her a mentor; Ross was deeply embedded in the Obama campaign. And they pursued very different paths to the State Department.

            It was also in 1999 that Schmidt joined the board of a Washington, DC–based group: the New America Foundation, a merger of well-connected centrist forces (in DC terms). The foundation and its 100 staff serves as an influence mill, using its network of approved national security, foreign policy, and technology pundits to place hundreds of articles and op-eds per year. By 2008 Schmidt had become chairman of its board of directors. As of 2013 the New America Foundation’s principal funders (each contributing over $1 million) are listed as Eric and Wendy Schmidt, the US State Department, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Secondary funders include Google, USAID, and Radio Free Asia
           </p>
           <p>
            Schmidt’s involvement in the New America Foundation places him firmly in the Washington establishment nexus.
           </p>
           <p>
            The foundation’s other board members, seven of whom also list themselves as members of the Council on Foreign Relations, include Francis Fukuyama, one of the intellectual fathers of the neoconservative movement;

            Now Cohen is on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s team and helped with her speech on Internet freedom. I spoke with him while he was waiting at the airport to board a flight for Moscow. He’s part of an effort that Secretary Clinton calls “21st Century Statecraft.” In January, Clinton held a dinner in Washington to explore how to use technology to promote diplomacy
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s what Cohen will be doing for the next five days. He has teamed with  Howard Solomon of the National Security Council and White House Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra to lead an all-star U.S. delegation to Russia to see how technology can mutually benefit both countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the luminaries headed to Russia with Cohen are actor Ashton Kutcher;
           </p>
           <p>
            EBay CEO John Donahoe
           </p>
           <p>
            Shervin Pishevar, executive chairman and founder of Social Gaming Network;
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter co-founder and Square founder Jack Dorsey;
           </p>
           <p>
            Mozilla Foundation chair Mitchell Baker;
           </p>
           <p>
            and Cisco System CTO Padmasree Warrior.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will meet with Russian ministers of health and education, advisors to President Dimitry Medvedev, leaders of technology companies and more. They will tackle issues such as encouraging entrepreneurship and e-government initiatives and combating child trafficking and corruption

            The State Department has reached out to this large audience for decades, but today using social media is essential to be able to talk to the people of that country.”
           </p>
           <p>
            She explained how the State Department uses social media and the Internet to broaden the U.S. public diplomacy mission
           </p>
           <p>
            “This defines the transparency of the work we do, and helps us set a daily guidance for world issues,” she said. “Every piece of work we do touches a digital platform -- every meeting is transmitted digitally to enable a global conversation -- this is our challenge.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond the www.state.gov website, the State Department uses Twitter, Facebook, RSS feeds and iTunes for podcasts. The State Department has been on social media since its first Twitter feed in 2006. Now, the government office has more than 1 million Twitter followers, 800,000 Facebook likes

             Great find, N4N. This is really interesting. It makes me think of this Q drop about how the Cabal uses Twitter to coordinate the media narrative:

             These State Dept employee Twitter feeds deserve more digging.

            These whiny ass people just didn't get enough attention when they were kids. This all speaks of a greater social problem. People who don't get enough attention so they have to create hype to generate attention for themselves

             had a thing on today about politicians and religious leaders that all have black left eyes. Is there something in the creepy ass ritual life that calls for this? Aside from the panda eyes I mean...anyone?

              Either Titus Frost or matheasysolutions (or both...don't recall which) has been following the black eye thing for a while. I've noticed it, but not dug in to see if they had found a "ritual" connection to go along with it. It seemed pretty much a case of confirmation bias to me, but of course it might be more than that.
