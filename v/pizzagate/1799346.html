<h2>The Woolmark Brand</h2>
<p>This is the <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12199.jpeg">Woolmark Brand</a> designed by Francesco Saroglia. Thing is: There is no Francesco Saroglia. The logo was designed by Franco Grignani. There are many explanations for why he published this logo under a pseudonym. For example <a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/woolmark/?mm_58f4afe60b962=58f4afe60ba12">this one</a> that he was part of the jury who decided which logo would win and therefore couldn\'t take part with his real name. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>After years of what Grignani (the daughter) describes as “elegant silence”, it was only in the 1980s that her father officially declared that he was the designer of the logo. “I was too young to understand his worries,” she says, “but I know that he kept silent for so many years, swallowing bitterness any time that people attributed that superb logo to Saroglia.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyhow, it\'s a little messed up that even after he came out in the eighties the woolmark brand keeps claiming it would be by Saroglia, a guy who worked for the company as a graphic designer by this time. They even show <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12208.jpeg">a photo of him</a> under <a href="http://www.woolmark.com/history/">the story</a> of the alledged emergence.</p>
<h2>Why do they lie about their logo?</h2>
<p>Than I found <a href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/woolmark-logo">this</a> blog by a person who likes design and logos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that the Woolmark symbol can only be used on products made of 100 percent wool? According to a study commissioned by Woolmark owner AWI, less than half of those who recognise the symbol globally know its purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn\'t find this study. Maybe you know how to find it. Am I right to think nearly everybody in the western world knows this symbol stands for products made from 100 percent wool? But maybe it\'s about something else than wool??? Logo could be a paedo spiral. </p>
<p>The Woolmark Company Pty Ltd is a subsidiary of Australian Wool Innovation Limited, a not-for-profit company owned by more than 24,000 Australian woolgrowers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wool.com/">This is them</a>. This is their <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12209.jpeg">aries spiral logo</a>.</p>
<p>They have a category on their site &quot;Where we invest&quot;. AWI f.e. invests in <a href="https://www.wool.com/about-awi/where-we-invest/sheep-production/">Sheep Production</a>. Sheep Production is a perplexing term to a sensitive person like me. Please do me a favour, klick on the link and read this very special language (from my point of view) about sheep. Again I am very sensitive to language. What do you think about it?</p>',

            If you're interested in researching the people involved with the project,
            <a href="https://archive.is/0qhtL">
             here is a list
            </a>
            I think it's interesting to note that all of the places involved in this thing are in West Germany - Yeah, the wall is down, but there is still a cultural divide.
           </p>
           <p>
            And
            <a href="http://haensel-gretel.de/projekte/echte-schaetze">
             this
            </a>
            really stood out to me because they're involved right in the city run daycare/preschool. Then I read the title. "Echte Schatz" It translates "Real Treasure" o.0 Usually "schatz" is used in a cutsey way between couples or close personal friends. I would never say "schatz" towards a kid.

             I actually say this to my child. But this is another meaning. They are providing a set to learn with including a treasure. But I know that there is A LOT about them. I will post all my infos on them later. First I wanted to share my suspiscion about this wool logo.

            They also have a green leaf as a symbol for "production" which is a pedo symbol. The green leaf is not a natural symbol for production at all. Never seen that before.

            Wool is used as another term for money as that was what was used to trade all thru the Americas. Me like to say " Da me la lana mama " because that's what they say in Mexico. Give me the wool mama. So yes yes yes you are burning with truth as I see it. Wool can also mean black people because of the hair black person is commonly called woolly. I don't even need to see the boylover chat cause I see other stuff that's important to note the spiral in the wool ball and triangular center. The two tear drops in what you called a z I see something else that is a recurring theme. Two tear drop shapes similar to Monantos logo for Vinedesign. In handwriting it is UNCOMMON to cross over unessesarily twice on one line of any letter and the wool ball looks purposely rendered to look hand did. Looks like a great capital L with the flourish of a top loop and a bottom loop. So messaging is obvious there.

             I am more than convinced on the first foundation (Hansel and Gretel) because I found a lot of evidence against them. I just don't post it here because it is in Germany and I don't think it will help us here or anyone would get on board researching them.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the only reason why I believe that wool could be something. So, the first foundation is very clear to me. But I am really not sure about those others.

              Oh by the way post the Germany stuff. Please cause it's all related and you are on to some interesting things. What about BASF based in Germany? They are the world's biggest chemical company. Monsanto was going to do a deal with them last year. They are interested in growing organs I read something like that. Underlying commonality medical research with higher pedo rings..transplants organs

                There is a place to watch 6 videos about their products.  When each one is over, It says 2017 Pizzagate Footage of Boy Escaping Royal Family.  It is the one of the naked boy trying to get down the side of the Royal Residence!!!  It is at the end of each video.  This is extremely strange to me.  What do you make of this?

                 wchich products are you refering to? Talking about BASF, Hansel and Gretel Stiftung, ASI or AWI? ;) 
But my first idea would be: This is because of your useage behaviour. Youtube and google remember everything you watch (if you haven't real strict settings and using some adblocker and software like that). I surf as anonym as possible. moments like that with algorythms calculating what I might want are not happening to me anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's a superb trick I invented and use for years now:
                </p>
                <h1>
                 The solution ISN'T to not use google anymore, the solution is to use google as intensiv as it gets.
                </h1>
                <p>
                 I produced my googlemailaddress more than 10 years ago. Since that day I have used this address to registrate for hundreds of webpages I am NOT interested into. I have been logging in to that account and searched for stuff I really don't care about.
                 <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">
                  Use this page to find out what google thinks to know about you
                 </a>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 When I go there it tells me I am interested in nearly any subject around the world. They can't make anything out of your data if it is too much and seamingly manipulated. So go, manipulate your own profile. Reclaim your data, flood them with your fantasy interests! ;-)
HAVE FUN!

              Fundamental uncertainty is our common enemy. Follow your gut trust your dreams. Theres something to the two tear drops as well as two hearts. They sort of replace the two hearts where they can.  The thing about this Monsanto ad i noticed is the kid is in the cart as imprisoned because she's too big. Mom seems pleased, moms thumb is disfigured. We should all be picky eaters can be taken two ways. Ordering yarn and wool seems harmless but when keeping sheep information is up like that, it can be taken two ways.

               And I found all of this after I asked for enlightenment in a prayer. To be honest: The last days "silenced" me a little. Not actually silenced but I feel like tuned down a little. So many aggressions all around voat and people calling names. They did a good job it seems in preying on my mind. Thanks for your nice words. I am not used to this behaviour anymore. :)

            Sheep Production is a sector of Food Production. Lamb for the table with wool as a side product. All pretty innocent if you exclude the Welsh who are forever under suspicion for enjoying the favours of sheep in the field as well as the flavour of roast lamb.

             I know but it's a strange term anyhow. And did you follow the link and read that? 
I am really not too convinced on that one here but could anyone explain the chat to me? I don't understand what they are talking about. Can you?
