<p>The second article is relevant to pizzagate:</p>
<p>United Nuwabian Nation of Moors:</p>
<p>&quot;Malachi Z. York, founder of the Nuwaubian Nation where rapper Jay Z is a member, was a prolific bisexual pedophile...York\'s polygamist ideology allowed him to take dozens of women, some mere teenagers, as his wives.  
</p>
<p>As if that wasn\'t enough for him, he went after the children in the community as well, engaging in orgies with both adults and children and even allowing himself to be sodomized by one of his stepsons in front of a group of people.  There were women in the community who were shocked and outraged by this behavior, they escaped from the cult compound and alerted the authorities.  York is currently serving a 135-year prison sentence.&quot;</p>
<p>Moorish Orthodox Church</p>
<p>This is an affiliate for white Celts, founded by a Peter Lamborn Wilson, aka Hakim Bey, who writes for NAMBLA and advocates pedophilia.</p>
<p>Universal Zulu Nation (Moorish Science Temple affiliate):</p>
<p>&quot;Rapper Afrika Bambaataa, left, former head of the Universal Zulu Nation which is closely affiliated with the Moorish Science Temple, was recently outed as a homosexual pedophile after being stabbed by a young man who was drugged while with Bambaataa.  He awoke with Bambaataa performing oral sex on him.  After that incident, a number of similar allegation surfaced against Bambaataa, some dating back to the 1980s.&quot;</p>
<p>Black Hebrew Israelites</p>
<p>&quot;Aside from their theories of racial supremacy, the men in this group see nothing wrong with having sex with little girls as soon as they begin menstruating.  See black Hebrew Israelite men with big grey beards arguing for the right to have sex with little girls.&quot;</p>

             Here's a mainstream article on Afrika Bambaata, Billboard from 5/16, Bambaata denied the allegations, at first Zulu Nation supported him but then switched leadership, There were 4 men making allegations, but this was from the 80's, so no legal action::

             Here's Dr. Malachi aka Dwight York, the FBI claimed he molested 35 cult children from 4-18. Three female Nuwabians were indicted for child molestation also.

            AFAIK these are independent operators, engaged in a tradition since Iceberg Slim, and before:

           <p>
            "Robert Beck (born Robert Lee Maupin or Robert Moppins, Jr.; August 4, 1918 - April 30, 1992), better known as Iceberg Slim, was an American pimp who subsequently became an influential author among a primarily African-American readership."

            But who knows, are they tied to gangs, police corruption, these cults?

            Interesting connections and allegations, not distinctly pizzagate related:

            "Aside from the pseudo-Islamic nonsense, Farrakhan is also a member of the Church of Scientology and requires "ministers" of the NOI to attain the level of "clear" within Scientology.  The NOI and Scientology have become one and the same."

            Claims "At one point, videos were found of Jack Parsons having sex with his own mother." Assuming this means movies, back then, I've never heard this allegation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part II:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Moorish Orthodox Church is closely affiliated with Timothy Leary's League for Spiritual Discovery (LSD) and Wilson/Bey was known to visit them to obtain supplies of LSD."
