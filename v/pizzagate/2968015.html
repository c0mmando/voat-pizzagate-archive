<p>&quot;BREAKING: Sabine McNeill sentenced to 9 years
El Coyote / 3 days ago
Sabine McNeill has been sentenced to nine years in prison following a four-week trial at Southwark Crown Court.</p>
<p>Using words like “arrogant”, “manipulative”, and “evil” to describe Sabine’s crimes, HHJ Sally Cahill QC stated in her sentencing remarks that the actual sentence is for 12 years, but she had chosen to reduce this to nine in consideration of Sabine’s age.</p>
<p>On 14 December 2018, the jury found Sabine guilty on four charges of stalking parents whose children were named by Ella Draper as belonging to a “Satanic death cult” based in several schools and a church in Hampstead, North London.</p>
<p>In addition, Sabine was found guilty of six charges of breaching a restraining order. The order was put in place by HHJ Daniel Worsley following the collapse of Sabine McNeill and Neelu Berry’s 2016 trial for witness intimidation. </p>
<p>Today’s sentence breaks down to eight years for the stalking charges, and one for the restraining order violations.</p>
<p>Extended hearing
Today’s sentencing hearing was a continuation of a hearing which began on 19 December, during which the court heard victim impact statements from people who had been affected by Sabine’s online activities.</p>
<p>Much of today’s hearing took place in chambers, as HHJ Sally Cahill QC went over the terms of a Criminal Behaviour Order with the prosecution and defence legal teams, with an eye to making it as airtight as possible.</p>
<p>The public were admitted to the second half of the hearing, during which they heard mitigation arguments from Sabine’s barrister Tana Adkin QC. Adkin emphasised Sabine’s previous “good character”, referencing the fact that this is her first conviction as an element which ought to be taken into consideration when determining her sentence.</p>
<p>We will provide additional details of today’s hearing once they become available.&quot;</p>',

            Damn it. If your gonna stalk out people on a list learn to ninja. I remember the chan dox on the named people, addresses, locations, and whether or not the kids were compliant. The amount of intel was staggering. If you know the government is compliant then you play by different rules. Would have been easier to jack one of the teachers or the nurse and look for the tattoos. Just be careful where you point your spoon.

            Karen Irvine you say? Don'y you mean Karen Irving?  I know that she was NOT working alone. I KNOW that Ricky Dearman was one of the trolling accounts...

            I wrote about her blog here in this post. The blog that she shared with her sister Wendy:

             Don't have much to add, except that Greenburg's common alter is Green thal. Rosen burg, Rosenstien, Rothstien Roth burg and many more are all related to the Roth childs. This should be common knowledge by now. Do not eat at Bob Evans.

             I'm not quite sure it was the same woman involved in the Hampstead saga I do happen to remember a Karen Irving as well too but I'm sure Holliecriegjustice would have ferreted out that detail I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure that it was an adjunct (someone that injected themselves into the Hampstead case on the side of Dicky Rearman) satanist working on the harassment. You might however be on to something.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do remember seeing people saying that they thought Dearrman was part of the Hoaxtead crew and I might have seen something to support that but it's been such a while I can't quite remember.

              , I can only say I’ll try. The art related crime is my interest, so I’m glad you asked. Things have changed, and I’m lucky to get an hour per week here now, but I’ll do my best.

             you seem to have a pretty good grasp on this shit. see my stickied post 'Executive Summary of Pizzagate Evidence specific to Hillary Clinton' ? Do you think you have the knowledge to do an Exec summary specific to the British Royal family?  I'm happy to help but its not my intra-Pizzagate niche , if you reckon youve got a more encyclopedic grasp that wold be awesome

               It was a sham from the get go. Asking architects (most of which are exploited themselves) to provide pro bono work for poor regions in the world instead of paying local people to do the actual planning work. Another charity that was simply there to make a name for the founder.

             8 years? You mean 9 years? Great fact-checking.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it wasn't for stalking. There were 21 charges against the mad old bat and she'd been arrested 8 times, warned more times that you could count and breached her restraining order bail conditions multiple times. And if you could be arsed to read the victim impact statements, she caused serious damage to the children of the people she accused. So forgive me if I don't join you in feeling sympathetic  for this child-abusing bitch.

              Get less for stealing millions from investors through some kind of algorithm scam, or other. I really hope that everyone doing this has plans to split. Leaving is easy for me, because I am a cultural personality.

             , would you maybe consider doing a post about Alisha Owens?
            </p>
            <p>
             These old posts / thread discussions mention her case, but I feel she deserves a post of her own. Many people don't know about her.

              Great idea. I'm surprised there hasn't been a thread about Alisha Owens. She was wronged in so many ways.

            More about Hoaxtead Research on this David Icke Forum... it was the main go-to forum for the Hampstead case when it broke in the UK

           </p>
           <p>
            It has over 1000 pages... but most people who were very concerned about the children and were looking into it were eventually run off my the Hoaxtead crew as described in the post #20737 by the poster 'illuminumnuts' :
            <em>
             All of the above forumites have made at least 100 posts on this thread. The ones whose names are in boldened text have all been vehemently pushing the 'Total Hoax' angle, while usually attacking anyone who disagrees with them. There have been 20,736 posts made on this thread in total thus far. What is striking is that 6 out of the top 7 posters, who are all deniers, account for 8491 posts alone. This translates to about 40% of the total number of posts made on this thread, which were all made over a period of only 5 months.  What is even more striking is that they virtually all left the thread at roughly the same time, which happened to be not long after a 'certain blog' had become well established.

Look up where Cockneys come from while you're at it. The screenshots of you claiming they come from Liverpool are a hoot.

                Thank You. You are the voice of comfort right now with those  beautiful words. I lost the love 💕 of my life two weeks ago. A complete unexpected mortal shock. To any one that reads this, say those loving words that many times you have held back. Moments later it may be too late. God Bless You +

                I'd like to thank everyone else for supporting me and downvoating that piece of shit. That crew is def a nemesis and they are vitriolic, spiteful, and annoyingly persistent.

                Like I said Hoaxtead claims that it is this Karen Ivine. At some point I believe their proof was adequate enough for me to believe that it could have been her alone but obviously there are clowns who like to claim that this is untrue. It very well could be I never could nail down what was actually going on except for the fact that whoever it is had tons and tons of time and energy to counteract any claims and put a ton of resources into debunking the Hampstead Children abuse case. At one time those links did prove some very solid connections to satanism, this dudes comments on freedom of religion prove he's one of them.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have a hard time believing it is Dearman himself because I dont think he would leave any kind of electronic trail admitting that he was a satanist if that digital footprint could ever be traced back to him because if there is any operation going on at Christchurch and Dearman was involved and those children were right about any of it that is one hell of a big operation and has been for decades. this kind of gang stalking shows met hat geez, FOUR years later this dude or bitch or whatever it is can still find and follow me here.

May I see your proof of that please, LDT3? If you're not too busy shopping for tinfoil hats, that is.

             Karen Irvine is Hoaxtead Research, one satanic troll with many alters like el coyote and snake logan. I dealt with her 4 years ago and just this last year when I got her alters booted from Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
             But anywhichway, I communicated with Sabine quite a few times before she fled to Russia over this incident where she subsequently went back to Britain and turned herself in. It's really is a shame seeing Sabine treated this way considering her horrible health problems. I'm not quite sure she will make it out of there. Hopefully they will recognize her condition and recommend home or health care facility stay because she's just to old and frail for such trumped up charges. I know we don't know the full extent of it because some of those ladies in front of Christchurch went HARD like that spook bitch Christine Ann Sands but somehow the crown found a way to make some of the charges to look legit. It's just unbelievable.

             Praying for her.

              Snake logan. Possibly from Logan's run? Not that it matters, just saying this is the type of people we are dealing with.

              She didn't flee to Russia, lol. She fled to Germany. Your geography hasn't improved since the days when you were claiming that Cockneys came from Liverpool, has it, ArkhandanSolo?
