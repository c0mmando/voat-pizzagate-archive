            Not sure what convience is, but this needs a link relevant to the post (Rule 2) and discussion of moderation goes on /pizzagatemods (Rule 4).  The rules have been up for many months.  Vindicator seems to suspect shills (or one shill using many accounts) are posting stuff that is intended to trigger deletion, in order to create a pretext for rabblerousing against mods.  Not saying that's you, but it sure doesn't look good when you post something that obviously violates a rule, and complain about modding in the same post.

            Okay, well, first suggestion is not to use that 140,000 number. For every country, you'll find a truly alarming number of children who "go missing" each year. However, it's clickbait. It includes the kids who run away for a weekend and come home when they run out of money.
           </p>
           <p>
            That top-level number is relevant, because once a kid is on the street, she/he is vulnerable. I don't mean that you should ignore it altogether. But there aren't millions of kids being held in sex dungeons. We don't know the real number, but common sense tells us that it isn't that high. Thousands or tens of thousands, most likely.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a more concrete starting point, consider that when hackers got into the hidden Comet Pizza server, they found dozens of graphics files and more than a hundred Bitcoin transactions. They also found links to nine other servers around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I've said before, the number of kids isn't the truly horrific part. It's the number of times a kid is raped before finally being killed. Survivors have reported literally being raped thousands of times apiece.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you're going to need to link to something or the mods are likely to delete this. Best of luck!
