            been a while but I seem to recall articles exposing Moldova being a huge source of child porn somewhere back in the late 80's, early 90's. No way to dig up articles that may likely have been purged but as I recall, it was almost like it was on an institutional scale. If I can either recall or locate any of the info, I'll gladly post. My internet digging skills don't rise to that level yet.

            Two of the Arab sex slaves I saw on Twitter were white teen boys (very emaciated) probably 15-17. They only spoke once, but it was eastern european accented English. THe arab also had the boys doing role play, one of them was in English school boy-type uniforms. I could not tell where they were even though I could see a city outside the window in one shot. I don't know how long that Arab has had them, but for sure they won't last long once they get too "old" to please their master. Arabic was the language on the account and it was so foul, this is all I can write about it. I was torn the fuck up for a week.

              I kept two pages open in a 40 tab browser for two days to see if they would delete them. I know they were reported twice. On the 2nd day I couldn't stand knowing they were open so I closed them. But that is a good idea. I will always wonder about them now :( and certainly wasn't thinking right at the time. I was burning...that Twitter didn't delete them.

              Worse than I can possibly say.  He was raping one of them in one of the videos. I do not think I can ever get that kids screams out of my head. I know things are always crazy in Eastern Europe which makes it easy to steal these kids...but somewhere out there those boys have a family..that's hard to know I saw them...If I had not been so afraid of being accused of having KP and so horrifically shocked, I would have screen shotted their faces. But I didn't :( and so it goes.

            I don't think we should just assume that this is a pedo logo without some additional evidence pointing in that direction.

            We should still treat anyone connected to the Clintons who is also involved with kids in any way with suspicion, though.

             not trying to debunk any of this, but these big hand in small hand logo's werent on the fbi report

             having done some graphic design in the past, if a childcare organisation would ask me for a logo, a hand reaching out to a kid's hand is not a weird thing to draw up. I have not looked into these finds and not am arguing that they should not be looked into, just warning that we shouldn't carelessly assume that every organisation with a big hand small hand logo = pedo..

              I've seen a bigger list definitely with a heart within a heart.  These symbol are like the secret masonic handshakes - to let someone know that you're "in the club."  Like the rainbow flag.  But the theory that these are "secret" advertising logos of the pedo club cannot be discounted.  It is a RED FLAG.  Sometimes it will be the result of an innocent designer using a friendly looking image.

               Do you (we) have a section for logos and locations.  Secret advertising in plain sight?
