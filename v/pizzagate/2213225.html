The author says he only included the account of Mr. Creepy’s nocturnal assaults on children in order to illustrate Tinseltown’s hatred of conservatives—not to out Mr. Creepy.  <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tinseltown/">http://www.breitbart.com/tinseltown/</a></p>
<p>“Our first major run-in seemed like a no brainer – confronting a grown man who cuddled other people’s kids…in bed. It was slam-dunk material.</p>
<p>It all started the way all of these affairs usually do – with a few of the Hollywood wives, the true guardians of this star-studded galaxy, gabbing away on a moms-only weekend retreat. In the midst of their morning powwow, a big time Tinseltown player’s wife brought up a touchy subject – one of the fathers creeped her out. Her daughter had been at a sleepover and told her she saw this creepy dad crawl onto the top bunk in the late of night to cuddle with a second grader…not his own. Another mom described a similar incident when her child did a sleepover at the same dad’s house. My wife chimed in with her own account of Creepy Dad red-flag episodes, including yet another time he napped with a different child – not his own – during a play date.</p>
<p>Were the younglings distraught and in need of comforting? Maybe. But should a grown man spoon with them to calm their nerves? I think most parents, no matter their political persuasion, would answer absofuckinglutely not!</p>
<p>The impromptu story swap lit off a firestorm around the table – and moments later husbands’ cells started ringing because it dawned on the moms that at that very moment their baby daddies and children were at the same play date as Creepy Dad. To say that what came next was “mind altering” would be like saying Bruce Jenner had a makeover – technically true…but mildly understated.</p>
<p>A few of us dads unanimously agreed that the issue needed to be addressed. Where I come from, these types of matters aren’t handled so civilly. They more resemble the end of those ISIS propaganda videos where they capture an American journalist. But amongst the Hollywood elite, situations like these are dealt with very discretely – largely because money, real money, of which pretty much everyone has access to within this community, tends to change the dynamics of confrontation. This point cannot be overstated. Hollywood’s elite aren’t just rich…to quote my wife, they’re “frich” – or fucking rich. Tinseltown is largely the playground of aristocrats, with many coming from generations of moneyed families. Variety, Hollywood’s self-professed publication of record, boasts that its readers have the highest average household income of any magazine in America. The privilege this level of wealth bequeaths is something most people don’t even know exists. And in their defense, the frich are oblivious to it as well because they have been living it their entire lives.</p>
<p>Over a couple of days, Creepy Dad was confronted by each of us – offering no denial of the incidents, and in my case, coming off a tad coached. None of us was sure where it would go next, but a hint came when his wife, Mrs. Creepy, stepped in. Her message: showing “love” to children was not creepy, shame on anyone who thinks otherwise, and nothing was going to change in their household. According to her, we were the weird ones. A few days later, Mr. and Mrs. Creepy, in a seeming act of defiance, astonishingly hosted a “sleepover party” for six year-olds. It ignited a shit storm, the likes of which I’ve never experienced before – with word of our intervention spreading like wildfire. The only thing that travels faster than the speed of light is gossip through the Hollywood grapevine. Parents were frantic over Creepy Dad’s behavior. In the midst of the commotion, another Hollywood wife we didn’t really know came forward to tell us that Mr. and Mrs. Creepy were actually confronted several years earlier, by different parents, over disturbing behavior concerning children. Apparently, this wasn’t their first time at the rodeo.</p>
<p>At its peak, nearly everyone that approached us within this microcosm of Tinseltown expressed the opinion that the behavior was deeply inappropriate at best, and something far more nefarious at worst. Everyone involved, including my wife and I, wanted the controversy to end. But when it wouldn’t…we started to sense something was afoot.
In the real world, the outrage would have continued unabated until either The Creepies publicly repented and slithered quietly away, or were run out of Dodge by the angry villagers. But Mr. and Mrs. Creepy knew something my wife and I didn’t understand at the time – in Hollywood, there’s something more toxic than spooning in bed with other people’s kids.</p>
<p>A friend of The Creepies, another Hollywood wife, approached my better half as a sort of ambassador – attempting to explain away her friend’s conduct. When her flawed argument was rejected, Mrs. Ambassador let it slip.</p>
<p>“Well, [Mrs. Creepy] did say you guys were conservatives.”</p>
<p>Word was getting back to us that The Creepies, in a seeming attempt at deflection, were telling anyone that would listen that my wife and I were right wingers – unrelated intel anywhere but in La La Land. Within a matter of weeks, the spotlight had shifted from their creepy behavior to our politics. The turn was startling.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Mr. Courrielche goes on to describe what he did instead of naming Mr. Creepy:</p>
<p>“As disturbing as their behavior was, this story is not about the “outing” of The Creepies. Rest assured, we put them on notice and authorities were alerted. The inclusion of this anecdote was to illustrate one simple point: the venom toward the Deplorables is so toxic that some of Hollywood’s finest would rather (metaphorically) jump in the sack with a guy who spoons kids than with someone who is ideologically in bed with Trump.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Question:  Does anyone, <strong>including and especially Mr. Courrielche</strong>, actually believe that the only thing going on under the covers was “spooning” and “cuddling”?  
</p>
<p>Answer:  No—not anyone, and least of all Mr. Courrielche if he is honest with himself.</p>
<p>Question:  Does anyone, <strong>including and especially Mr. Courrielche</strong>, actually believe that putting the perp “on notice” and “alerting authorities” in Hollywood resulted in protection for children against this creep or that it caused him to stop crawling into bed with them?</p>

            Had to endure this whole shitstorm IRL.  Although it's tempting to assume that Creepy Dad is a pillar of the entertainment industry, Creepy Dad is actually not associated with Hollywood at all.  PC does a solid job at making the reader think that Creepy Dad is associated with the business, but if you read it carefully he never explicitly says so.  Creepy Dad is actually just another, boring, middle class professional.  But disclosing that fact clearly just doesn't have the same exciting punch I suppose.

            I wonder how many other "sleepovers" have happened since his secretive discovery? This is why I have a problem with those that dont name names. In his defense he may not have the money that Mr Creepy has and could be sued for libel.

            If you look into the Bakelite family scandal... mother having incest with son from child until he killed her, the Movie Savage Grace is the story of that. you can see that these kids in these families of elites are just victims who perpetuate it until either snapping or just continuing to status quo... because its what has always been done. hush hush you must never tell. they put status power and comfort over love and protection of their children

            How in anyone's world is it OK for a grown man to "spoon" with another's child?  Unless you are talking an uncle babysitting an inconsolable niece/nephew...or something in the normal realm.  Non relative?  Best case scenario they get out with a big hospital bill.

            Generational pedos is unfortunately the norm around many of the elite. Look at the Hilton sisters. New babies of either sex are seen as available to be passed around. Wonder how AJ ended up in bed with her brother?

            Who did anything to stop Biden's extremely blatant &amp; open in front of the paps despicable behavior? He's still seen as a viable Democratic candidate for POTUS.

             Agreed regarding the elite.  I don't know who "AJ" is.  What is the story about her in bed with her brother?

             As to Biden and his ilk, nothing will happen until victims and their parents press charges and go public so that social media can take up the cause and apply loud and persistent pressure on the authorities to act.

              What he is talking about I think is that AJ Angelina Jolie ended up in bed with her brother.  I know they had a very strange family life what with having Jon Voight for a father.  The way these people grow up certainly contributes to the problems they have now. Being sold of so their parents are paid off with money and movies and the feeling of power.  So sad.

               Thanks for enlightening me.  It is a sad family, and the video of her describing her participation in an illuminati ritual gives little hope that she's managed to break the cycle.

                AJ is beyond creepy for sure/but the vid of her illuminati ritual has been debunked/taken out of context to look like an illuminati ritual.  If you see the unedited version that is much clearer/ she's talking about BDSM.  Mind you, not sticking up for her/just this rumor needs clarification.

                  Can't find the unedited version off hand/kinda short on time.  Here is another vid where the fello gives original context of the vid (from The Sun).
If I run across the unedited version I'll post.

                  This guy happens to like AJ/I think she is into some very dark stuff.  However the illumaniti ritual vid that made the rounds is fake.  This from someone who sent it to friends and had to follow up with oops, sorry, my error for not being more through.
