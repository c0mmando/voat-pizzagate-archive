<p>This post serves as old news but based on a quick review, I could not find evidence of a prior and similar pizzagate post.</p>
<p>In 2012, a prominent member of Chicago\'s homosexual community claimed that Barack Obama\'s participation in the &quot;gay&quot; bar and bathhouse scene was so well known that many who were aware of his lifestyle were shocked when he ran for president and won.</p>
<p>Kevin DuJan founded the Hillary Clinton-suppported website, &quot;HillBuzz.org.&quot;  He stated, &quot;Nobody who knew Obama in the gay bar scene thought he could possibly be president...Obama was personally involved in the gay bar scene.  Obama, DuJan said, was &quot;not heterosexual, and he\'s not bisexual.  He\'s homosexual.&quot;</p>
<p>Investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen, who worked with the NSA from 1984-1988 as a Navy intelligence analyst, confirmed DuJan\'s claims, stating, &quot;It is common knowledge in the Chicago gay community that Obama actively visited the gay bars and bathhouses in Chicago while he was an Illinois state senator.&quot;

<p>In April 2012 a federal judge dismissed a libel case against Larry Sinclair, a homosexual who claimed Obama\'s 2008 campaign had paid to rig a polygraph test regarding Sinclair\'s sensational charge that he had sex and used cocaine twice with Obama while he was a senator.

<p>DuJan said that during Obama\'s first presidency campaign &quot;there was fear in the gay community about talking openly about Obama being homosexual, particularly after the 2007 murder of Donald Young.  Young was an openly gay choir director at Jeremiah Wright\'s Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.  He was known to be a close friend of Obama.

<p>Wayne Madsen published an article in his &quot;Wayne Madsen Report&quot; in May 2011 claiming Obama and Chicago Mayor, Rahm Emanuel, were members of the same bathhouses in Chicago.  DuJan said that rooms at &quot;Man\'s Country in Chicago (which recently closed its doors) catered to older men&quot; and that it was referred to as the &quot;presidential suite&quot; or the &quot;Oval Office.&quot;<br />

<p>In closing, our former President, Barack Obama, was a huge disappointment.  It wasn\'t until the end of his 2nd term that I became awakened to not only his lies and deceitfullness but to his many predecessors as well.  An evil pallor engulfs his entire political career.</p>',

            Hi,

             @13Buddha
            </a>
            , thanks for the post, but I'm afraid it needs some editing.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>

            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Please include a link for each of these claims in your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if Obama should be gay, and we'd assume that the proportion of gays who are pedophiles is higher than the proportion of heterosexual males who are pedophiles, you'd still need to show how this is relevant for pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might want to cite the incident where Obama ordered 'hot dogs' for the WH for $65,000, and point out that we found that 'hot dog' is also a pedophile code word for underage boys. Please provide a source.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you edit, please also edit the headline, so that a clear connection to Pizzagate is shown.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please explain in more detail why you think Obama could be a murderer.
           </p>

            How about that picture of him sniffing the life out of that little Asian girl on his lap? Maybe he's just a deviate in general.

            He is as camp as a row of tents.. Also worth noting is that two times Barry aka Obama accidentally said Michael instead of Michelle on TV, once during a speech in front of some army group and also when he appeared on Bear Grylls show..
And Bear prayed for him and that was interesting.

            "But on Monday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel spent some time sharing lessons from his days as a ballet dancer when he visited the reopened Dyett High School for the Arts in Washington Park."
"He’s quite familiar with the subject as a former ballet dancer who studied at the Evanston School of Ballet and Sarah Lawrence College and continued to take weekend ballet classes as a senior adviser in the Clinton White House. Emanuel often recalls how as a 17-year-old he turned down a scholarship offer from the Joffrey Ballet, much to the disappointment of his mother."

            absolutely homosexual men are a lot more likely to be a pedophile. Studies have shown this, however you're hard pressed to find any recent studies on this because there is such a push to never paint homosexuals in a negative light.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the reality: on average, 1 in 6 boys are molested. 25-35% of child sexual abuse victims are males. Who is molesting these boys? Overwhelming majority of perps are men (roughly 90%). What men have sex (whether consensual or rape) with other males? homosexuals. It doesn't matter if these men are married or say they are hetero, having sex with another male is by definition a homosexual act.
           </p>
           <p>
            per the statistics, about 25-40% of homosexual men are pedophiles. That's a significant number!
           </p>
           <p>
            So when people like votescam come on here and point out that the majority of pedophiles are straight males, just remember that yes that is true because they make up a much larger segment of the population. The LGBTQ community is only about 3% of the population (so what, maybe half or slightly over that are men, maybe 2% of the population are gay men?). so while on the surface the "more straight men are pedos" is correct, a much much higher proportion of gay men are pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to homosexuals having a rate of being pedophiles much higher than heterosexuals, homos molest on average 150 boys vs hetero men who molest on average 20 girls. Both are horrendous and disgusting, but that's a massive difference in the sheer numbers of victims.

             Heterosexuality, Homosexuality, Bisexuality Have Zero to do with pedophiles and the raping of children. The gender of the child does not matter, the gender of the sexual predator does not matter. What matters is the age difference. Every time people conflate these two issues it destroys the reality. Why, because these child predators want to legitimize this behavior by attaching it to adult sexuality. When a child is sexually  abused by a man or woman they are not engaging in heterosexual or homosexual sex they are  being raped.
