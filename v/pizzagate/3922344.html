<blockquote>
<p>The Texas Jewish Post was conceived in mid-1946 by Jimmy and Rene Wisch, who were both working for the Federal government at the time. They became active publishers and editors in 1947... Among the landmark achievements of the TJP are: the only Jewish newspaper allowed into the Soviet Union during the Cold War of (1965-66); representation at the Johnson-Eshkol Summit in Texas; the only Jewish newspaper invited to the historic Nixon-Breshnev Summit in the Soviet Union (May-June 1972); and personal interviews conducted with leading world figures. Stories and columns from the TJP, have been reprinted in the Houston Chronicle, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the former Dallas Times Herald, the Congressional Record, as well as many other weekly and monthly publications.</p>
<p>Besides being members of the Texas Press Association and other national professional organizations, the TJP, has been a member of the American Jewish Press Association (AJPA) for more than half a century. Founding editor and publisher, Jimmy Wisch (1947-2002), was Executive Secretary of the AJPA for 14 years and served as President for three years.</p>

<p>Big Game Air founders Arturo Gomez, former president and partner at Rockit Ranch Productions, and Todd Rubin, who owns Leader Bar Chicago, aim to make it easier for passionate sports fans to experience a luxury, same-day game day.</p>
<p>Big Game subcontracts with about 20 private jet companies such as Chicago-based Priester Aviation, that either own private planes and jets or manage aircraft for private owners. Many college towns don\'t have access to a large airport, which means commercial flights are usually out of the question. So if you want to fly, you need to go private.</p>

           <p>
            The Texas Jewish Post was conceived in mid-1946 by Jimmy and Rene Wisch, who were both working for the Federal government at the time. They became active publishers and editors in 1947... Among the landmark achievements of the TJP are: the only Jewish newspaper allowed into the Soviet Union during the Cold War of (1965-66); representation at the Johnson-Eshkol Summit in Texas; the only Jewish newspaper invited to the historic Nixon-Breshnev Summit in the Soviet Union (May-June 1972); and personal interviews conducted with leading world figures. Stories and columns from the TJP, have been reprinted in the Houston Chronicle, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the former Dallas Times Herald, the Congressional Record, as well as many other weekly and monthly publications.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides being members of the Texas Press Association and other national professional organizations, the TJP, has been a member of the American Jewish Press Association (AJPA) for more than half a century. Founding editor and publisher, Jimmy Wisch (1947-2002), was Executive Secretary of the AJPA for 14 years and served as President for three years.

            Big Game subcontracts with about 20 private jet companies such as Chicago-based Priester Aviation, that either own private planes and jets or manage aircraft for private owners. Many college towns don't have access to a large airport, which means commercial flights are usually out of the question. So if you want to fly, you need to go private.

            Local lawyer Nelson Genshaft can often be found throughout the Columbus area, sharing his skills and his passion with the community-at-large... In addition to focusing on his career at Strip Hoppers Leithart McGrath &amp; Terlecky and spending valuable time with his family, the 1973 graduate of Case Western Reserve University School of Law has served two terms on the board of trustees at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus, was a member of the Jewish Community Relations Committee of JewishColumbus, president of Ohio Jewish Communities, and chair of the Ohio region of ADL.

            "We were in the first Wexner (Heritage Program) group in 1983. It was a study program for community leaders, very experimental at the time. Les Wexner, Abigail Wexner and Rabbi Herbert Friedman organized this in the ’80s,” he said. “ ...

            Giving back for Cheryl Rose means finding ways to use unique personal strengths and experiences for the betterment of others. Among many service experiences and leadership roles, Rose has served on the boards of Human Rights Campaign and Case Western Reserve University and The Ohio State University Hillels, among others. Fighting for LGBTQ rights and representation has been a central and personal cause for Rose, and along with that she has worked to address related issues involving discrimination and prejudice.

            As one of my personal heroes, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, said: “When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up. You have to say something, you have to do something.” I have had so many role models in my life show me the importance of doing something. Working at Forest City in Cleveland for the Ratner family, I had mentors who showed me the best way to do something is to get involved. They encouraged my participation in (the Jewish Federation of Cleveland) and United Way...
           </p>
           <p>
            ..My Jewish background provided me with exposure to some incredible Jewish community leaders as mentors. The Ratner family in Cleveland and Les Wexner and other leaders at L Brands in Columbus encouraged my participation in nonprofit work.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..As mentioned above, I had mentors in the workplace, but also had great mentors in the community. Gregg Levine in Cleveland was instrumental in my involvement in HRC and LGBT Jewish outreach. In Columbus, my mentor is Rabbi Sharon Mars. Her involvement in so many different organizations that have missions that are important to me and her tireless devotion to working for the betterment of our community continues to motivate me to be a leader.

              SALTZMAN, MAURICE (25 May 1918-21 Jan. 1990), businessman, civic leader, and philanthropist in Cleveland and Israel, received the Human Relations Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews (1966) and the Charles Eisenman Award from the JEWISH COMMUNITY FEDERATION (1974). A "zillionaire" by age 48, Saltzman, born in Cleveland, was orphaned at age 4 and lived at the Jewish Orphan Home (BELLEFAIRE) until he graduated from CLEVELAND HEIGHTS High School at 16. He worked in the shipping room of Lampl Fashions, Inc. for 5 years, when he and Max Reiter founded Ritmore Sportswear, which later became BOBBIE BROOKS, INC.

              His philanthropy soon reflected his business success: between 1941 and 1966, he and his wife donated more than $2.5 million to institutions such as MT. SINAI MEDICAL CENTER and the University of Notre Dame. Saltzman led the dress company until 1987. He maintained a life-long relationship with Bellefaire, serving as benefactor and honorary trustee and hiring student employees. Among many community activities, he was founder trustee for life of the CLEVELAND JEWISH NEWS, vice-president of TEMPLE EMANU EL, president of both the Jewish Community Federation and Mt. Sinai Medical Center (1976-79), and a trustee of the University Circle Development Foundation, Inc. (predecessor of UNIVERSITY CIRCLE, INC.), Brandeis University and

              Saltzman married his secretary, Shirley Rosenberg, in 1944; they had three daughters, Lorrie Fromson, Judith Bea-Taylor, and Terry Saltzman. Saltzman died in Palm Beach, FL.

              Garan, Inc., is engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of men's, women's, and children's apparel under the Garanimals, Garan, Bobbie Brooks, and private label names. Most of Garan's output is sold to mass merchandisers, major national chain stores, department stores, and specialty stores. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. accounts for over 85 percent of company sales, while nearly 10 percent of sales stem from the company's relationship with JC Penney Company Inc. Garan was acquired by Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 2002.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..By 1992, burgeoning Wal-Mart was accounting for 45 percent of Garan's annual sales. A licensing agreement in 1990 gave Garan the right to carry the insignias of various colleges and universities on sweatshirts and knit shirts. In 1991, it became one of the few apparel companies allowed to use characters from Disney movies. After a strong first quarter in fiscal 1992, Garan, holding $30 million in cash with virtually no debt, declared a $1.20-per-share annual dividend on top of the quarterly payout. During 1988-92, the company earned an annual average of almost 18 percent on equity.
             </p>
             <p>
              .During fiscal 1995, children's apparel accounted for 72 percent of Garan's net sales, with women's apparel accounting for 18 percent and men's apparel accounting for 10 percent. Sales of sports and colleges licensed apparel accounted for about 12 percent of sales and Garan's own label accounted for about 6 percent. The Bobbie Brooks label accounted for another 7 percent, and

              Thirty years ago, as much of the world was being ravaged by horrific diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, three remarkable young people, barely out of their teens—Jim Yong Kim, Paul Farmer, Ophelia Dahl—came together in a squatter settlement in Haiti.
             </p>
             <p>
              They managed to bring together the resources to build real health clinics in areas that had been ignored by everyone else—where patients were as likely to arrive by donkey as by ambulance—and stocked them with the same medical supplies that could be found in places like Harvard Medical School. (Indeed, in some cases, supplies that were found at Harvard made their way to Haiti.)

            Found out about this the other night from seeing an actress post about it.  Think she might be one of the Woke celebs.  Evan Rachel Wood was the actress, and she posted it on her stories on Instagram (and since I don't know how to view past ones I can't get the info she shared, to share it here sorry).  I know she got hounded off Twitter because she was starting to speak out about child sex abuse and celebs that rape and get away with it.  (went to go get screengrabs to archive back at the time, and that's when I found her twitter had gone dark)

Among many service experiences and leadership roles, Rose has served on the boards of Human Rights Campaign and Case Western Reserve University and The Ohio State University Hillels, among others.

             As one of my personal heroes, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, said: “When you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up. You have to say something, you have to do something.” I have had so many role models in my life show me the importance of doing something. Working at Forest City in Cleveland for the Ratner family, I had mentors who showed me the best way to do something is to get involved. They encouraged my participation in (the Jewish Federation of Cleveland) and United Way...

             ..As mentioned above, I had mentors in the workplace, but also had great mentors in the community. Gregg Levine in Cleveland was instrumental in my involvement in HRC and LGBT Jewish outreach. In Columbus, my mentor is Rabbi Sharon Mars. Her involvement in so many different organizations that have missions that are important to me and her tireless devotion to working for the betterment of our community continues to motivate me to be a leader.
