<p>&quot;When the scene unfolds
<strong>Young girls thirteen years old expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank</strong>
Got mo\' stretch marks than these hoes hollin\' they got rank
See Sega ain\'t in this <strong>New World Order</strong>
Them <strong>experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia</strong>
United Nations, <strong>overseas they trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain\'t knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me and po\' white trash,
Like they did back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipes lines
Inferno\'s outdoors like they had back when Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now,
Believe me later on in the future</strong>...&quot;

            artists back then always seemed to drop legitimate info, I assume the men in suits just couldn't comprehend what was being said

            love The Score from The Fugees from front to back for this, the song you posted here gets preeetty specific w its references

             Yeah. No one should refer to any current known rappers as "artists." They don't talk about shit. Ever heard of Immortal Technique?

               I don't even like "Dance With the Devil" haha. You're totally missing out! Also check out "Rich Man's World," "The Point of No Return," "Eye in the Sky," "The Poverty of Philosophy," "Dominant Species," "Peruvian Cocaine," "Industrial Revolution," "The 4th Branch," "Homeland and Hip Hop," and "Toast to the Dead." I love his music, but if you don't, you can always read the lyrics. Dude is "woke as fuck!" Also, check out Prozak's "We All Fall Down" album. It's dope start to finish.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Atlanta is routinely renowned as the capital of the south and home to civil rights and black political icons. Now, much to its chagrin, Atlanta has achieved a new dastardly distinction. It is the nation’s major hub for human trafficking and child sex exploitation.
           </p>
           <p>
            More than 12 million human beings—and some 1 million children—are forcibly enslaved and trafficked worldwide in what has escalated into a $32 billion illegal industry. It is a shameful and sordid saga that tarnishes Atlanta’s otherwise impressive image.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I am so embarrassed that we go from number one as the most sex trafficking city in the United States,” laments childhood sexual abuse advocate Ann Platz, a board member of Well Spring Living. “That needs to grieve the citizens of Atlanta. While we are doing a lot of wonderful things, our children are being taken and other people’s children are being trafficked through our beautiful city. We need to be known as the city that stopped sex trafficking and that we ran it out of here.”
           </p>
           <p>
            That mission – a call and commitment to combat human trafficking – was the thrust of a high powered public forum and luncheon this weekend at the stately Piedmont Driving Club produced by The Buckhead Cascade City Chapter of The Links, Inc., a prestigious organization of polished, professional and high profiled Atlanta’s black female gentry that has pledged their collective talents and resources to raise public awareness and outrage about this hideous and scandalous epidemic.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Links have decided that we need to add our voice to the voices of business and federal officials and human rights activists that human trafficking cannot be ignored any longer; that literally thousands and thousands of children are trafficked in the United States,” said Mayor Franklin. “And, sometimes it happens right in front of our eyes and we don’t know it. Atlanta has been a center, to my knowledge, for the last ten years. [Federal officials] made it clear that Atlanta was one of the worst transportation hubs for human trafficking in the world. It ruins the lives of thousands of girls and young women.”
           </p>
           <p>
            This problem is not the street prostitution that has plagued the nation’s inner cities for decades, today most of the girls bought and sold as sex slaves are exploited virtually and visibly on Internet websites. It is appalling and outrageous, says Link National Trends Chairperson Gloria Patterson.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Links are a powerful and influential women’s group who have now vowed to use their collective clout to ratchet up the war on human trafficking and sexual slavery at the epicenter of the problem here in Atlanta.

                I'm afraid unless he is not trying to sell mobile phones or posts the same comment again and again, this doesn't qualify as 'spam', but is still free speech = we don't remove it.
