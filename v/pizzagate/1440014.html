<p>The tweets from Podesta directed at Assange are out of the ordinary for Podesta.</p>
<p>-He is shown cooking food in the pictures, in chef\'s whites. I can\'t find any other similar pictures.</p>
<p>-He splits the tweet into three tweets in a way that he never has before starting each of the tweets with a number. As if to make a statement in some kind of argument.</p>
<p>-The tweets were his official response to the leaked e-mails. Really? a three part tweet about how you are cooking risotto? You have never tweeted about cooking until today? the day your e-mails were released?</p>
<p>The point here is that he is showing behaviour he has never shown before, one aspect of the tweet is to attack Assange, the other aspect seems to be his natural reaction to his e-mails being leaked. He is also putting on display his accomplishment of cooking the meal in a very sociopathic way, he even has the humble-brag at the start with the still on his feet comment.</p>
<p>The humble brag at (1) and (2), the 1, 2, 3 statement format, the snide comment at (3) and the whole bit about this being his response to his e-mails being leaked screams that he is insecure at this moment.</p>
<p>In the podesta e-mails, there are 21 results for risotto. And every single one of them is super normal, no weird using of the English language that doesn\'t make sense. Reading these e-mails is like reading a completely different persons e-mails (in the way the food is talked about) when comparing them to the pizza/pasta e-mails.</p>
<p>I guess my \'crazy-conspiracy\' theory is that:</p>
<p>-He purposefully did the whole set of tweets toward Assange to show that he cooks and loves food a ton, which would work towards explaining away all the e-mails about pizza and pasta. It is a PR stunt but at the same time an emotional knee-jerk reaction to the prospect of him being ousted (assuming he is guilty).</p>
<p>And take a minute to think about it, this is his official response to his e-mails being leaked??!? If the pizza gate theory is correct, him posting these tweets fits perfectly into the whole story, if the pizza gate theory isn\'t correct, this guy makes no fucking sense to be posting this shit after having his e-mails leaked.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I\'m arguing that the other theory\'s you guys have come up with are wrong (the poisoning, threats to Assanges safety ect). Firstly, let\'s assume that he is guilty, this reaction from him over twitter plus his total silence since the end of the elections doesn\'t help him seem innocent. I\'m arguing that these three tweets are Podesta\'s natural reaction to the possibility of him being ousted as a paedophile after the release of his e-mails. In response he has a kind of &quot;sociopathic attack&quot; where he belittles Assange and gloats about himself. After years of e-mails about cooking pizza and pasta on this night he\'s cooking risotto and showcasing it on twitter, and it\'s dressed up to be normal as fuck, when he has never done anything like it before.</p>
<p>One thing I\'m certain about is that this Podesta guy was insecure posting these three tweets. But that doesn\'t mean he\'s guilty of paedophilia, just means that he was nervous. But honestly I would nervous be too if all my e-mails were leaked and there were thousands of neckbeards going through them to try and find proof of some crime I may or may not have committed, regardless of whether or not I had actually committed any crime.</p>',
