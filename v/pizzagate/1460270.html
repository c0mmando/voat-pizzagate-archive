<blockquote>
<p>Epstein\'s lawyers — who included at various times such heavyweights as former independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz — argued that the law did not require federal prosecutors to make any notifications because the women were not victims of any crime being charged in a federal court.
Epstein was ultimately sentenced to 18 months in jail on the state charges. He served 13 before being released.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at Mr. Epstein, shall we.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising things about Epstein is that he is a member of some of the most powerful and influential groups in the US.</p>
<p>He’s a member of: 
1)	<strong>The Council on Foreign Relations</strong>
2)	<strong>The Trilateral Commission</strong>
3)	<strong>Trilateral North American Group</strong></p>

<p>Aside from Clinton who are the people that Epstein is associated with</p>
<p>1)	Prince Andrew</p>
<p>2)	Alan Dershowitz</p>
<p>3)	<strong>Larry Summers</strong></p>
<p>4)	Donald Trump</p>
<p>5)	Ehud Barak</p>
<p>6)	Eliot Spitzer</p>
<p>7)	Kevin Spacey</p>

<p>Here are some of the people that have current (past) membership in elite organizations.</p>
<p>Members of all three: <strong>CFR, Trilateral, Trilateral N.A.</strong> include</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Rockefeller Sr., Harold Brown, John Deutch, Mortimer Zuckerman, Richard Holbrooke</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=vRdWRg">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=vRdWRg</a></p>
<p>Another important figure that Epstein is associated with is <strong>Larry Summers.</strong>
Summers maintains a directorship position in so many key organizations it is hard to keep track of.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/Hc284n.png">https://i.sli.mg/Hc284n.png</a></p>
<p><strong>Epstein</strong> and <strong>Summers</strong> are members of the <strong>Trilateral Commission</strong> and the <strong>CFR</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summers</strong> is also a member of the <strong>Clinton Global Initiative</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Summers</strong> is a member of the <strong>Crisis Group</strong> which Clinton mega-donor <strong>Frank Guistra</strong> and <strong>George Soros</strong> are also members.</p>
<p><strong>Mortimer Zuckerman</strong> has donated generously to the <strong>Clinton Foundation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Summers</strong> has been identified as a passenger on the Lolita express and a guest of Epstein’s.</p>
<p>From the same Daily Beast piece (above):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And just last week, yet another “Jane Doe” filed a suit in New York accusing <strong>Epstein and Donald Trump</strong> of raping her at a series of sex parties when she was only 13. </p>
<p>Trump has denied Jane Doe’s claims and his reps have said he barely knew Epstein—even though New York media in the ’90s regularly chronicled his comings-and-goings at Epstein’s Upper East Side palace, and even though Epstein had 14 private numbers for Trump and his family in his little black book. Meanwhile, Bill and Hillary Clinton have remained mum about their ties to the Palm Beach pedophile—despite evidence that shows Bill was one of the most famous and frequent passengers on Epstein’s “Lolita Express” and that Epstein donated money to the Clinton Foundation even after his conviction.</p>
<p>For months, talking heads have wondered whether Trump would use Epstein and his girls as a weapon against Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Now, with the latest federal lawsuit against Trump himself, it seems the notorious financier has become a serious liability for both campaigns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The connections between Epstein, Clinton and Summers are especially important as they show the relationships between the elite class of America’s oligarchs (CFR, Trilateral, Clinton Foundation, etc.) with known pedophiles and their possible (and probable) involvement in sex crimes.</strong></p>',

            Interesting that you mention Kenneth Starr as one of the lawyers involved with Epstein.  I ran across another reference to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2011, a woman who had been sexually assaulted by a teacher/administrator at the prestigious Potomac School in the DC area by the name of Christopher Kloman saw her abuser at her child's school and came forward, followed by other women.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kloman was convicted and prior to his sentencing several people wrote letters to the judge on his behalf, including Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ken Starr.  Despite a number of notable people submitting letters on his behalf, he was sentenced to 43 years.

            Don't mean to distract from the overall post, but do you believe the epstein / trump connection is substantiated. I've only seen the quote from Trump and the lawsuit.

              That's opinion, and could be argued the other way. The two men in this article are key picks, regardless of previous affiliations. After serving In the Trump administration, they cannot be lobbyists.

               Well i was asked if i believed in the Epstein / Trump connection so i gave my opinion.
              </p>
              <p>
               But it is a fact, not an opinion, that Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs.

               Now, I know a lot of people here are enthusiastic Trump supporters but he is not going to drain the swamp. Obama came to power promising the same, and we bought his act. This is the same situation repeating itself. The shadow government is CFR, Trilateral Commission, Goldman Sachs, Bilderburg, Citigroup, etc. that is the oligarchy.
