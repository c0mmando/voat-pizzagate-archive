<p>The wife of Mitt Romney had a blind trust invested in the Goldman Sachs’ sex trafficking fund, it emerged today.
According to an August 2011 financial disclosure report by the Romneys, Ann Romney’s blind trust had an investment valued between $15,001 and $50,000 in Goldman’s GS Capital Partners III.
Reuters reported that while there is no suggestion the Romneys knew about the investment, the disclosure highlights the difficulty for politicians and their families when they invest in blind trusts that are supposed to protect them from conflicts of interest and ethical questions.</p>
<p>Controverisal: The Goldman Sachs sex trafficking scandal has now been linked to the Ann Romney, the wife of presidential candidate Mitt
Goldman said on Sunday that GS Capital Partners III signed a deal last Friday to sell its 16 percent stake in Village Voice Media, which owns the website Backpage.com, back to management.</p>
<p>Backpage.com facilitates the trafficking of underage prostitutes and sex slaves, although others question that.
Andrea Saul, a spokesman for Romney, stressed that the funds were managed on a blind basis, ‘so the trustee, not the Romneys, make their investment decisions.</p>
<p>‘Furthermore, the trustee invests in funds, but, as a passive investor, has no control over the funds’ investments.’
Goldman’s divestiture is the latest development in a growing controversy over online adult advertising that has pitted celebrities, law enforcement officials, members of Congress and New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof against Village Voice Media.
The private media company has the largest share of revenue in the United States from online advertising of adult services.
It has responded aggressively, challenging critics’ data with editorial investigations and claiming that it goes to far greater lengths than competitors in cooperating with law enforcement and monitoring its ads for illegal activity</p>
<p>The original size and timing of the blind-trust investment were not disclosed, though in 2007 the Ann Romney trust reported during Mitt Romney’s previous failed attempt to get nominated as Republican presidential candidate that its investment in the Goldman fund was then worth between $100,001 and $250,000.</p>
<p>Headquarters: Goldman Sachs, which owns GS Capital Partners III, has signed a deal to sell its 16 per cent stake in Village Voice Media, which owns the website, called Backpage.com</p>
<p>In Ann Romney’s 2010 tax return, which was made publicly available in January, the trust’s investment in the Goldman fund was reported as showing a $28,226 loss.
Goldman could not be immediately reached for comment on questions about the Ann Romney trust investment.
GS Capital Partners III invested $30 million in the Village Voice in 2000. This was a fraction of fund’s capital, which totaled $2.78 billion.
Goldman Sachs said the fund lost the vast majority of its investment when it sold its Village Voice stake last week.
The company – whose boss once claimed it was ‘doing God’s work’ – faced huge embarassment after it was linked to prostitution and sex trafficking of underage girls.</p>
<p>The revelation plunged the U.S. investment bank into fresh embarrassment over its business ethics weeks after a former executive claimed bosses there called clients ‘muppets’.
It has emerged that a private equity fund run by the bank had taken a major stake in a secretive company called Village Voice Media.
It owns a classified advertising website – Backpage.com – that is accused of being the biggest forum for illegal sex trafficking of underage girls in America.</p>
<p>GS Capital Partners III said it had agreed to sell its 16 per cent stake in the media company, admitting it had lost much of its investment in the process. Goldman Sachs insisted it had grown ‘uncomfortable with the direction of the company’ and its inability to influence its direction.
However New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, who exposed the connection, said the bank had been ‘mortified’ when he first inquired about its stake last week and ‘began working frantically to unload its shares’.</p>
<p>Backpage.com is estimated to have a nearly 80 per cent share of online prostitution advertising in the U.S., worth some £2.5million a month.
Controversy: Nearly 80 per cent of the $3.1million revenue earned from online prostitution advertising has been attributed to Backpage.com by classified advertising consultant AIM Group</p>
<p>Protest: John Buffalo Mailer, right, whose late father, Norman Mailer, co-founded the Village Voice, demands it stop running sex ads of minors at a rally on Thursday
It also hosts advertising forums in at least a dozen other countries including the UK.
In Britain, it is used by hundreds of prostitutes across 19 cities and regions, ranging from Devon and Hampshire to Sheffield and Aberdeen. Pimps reportedly use the website to peddle underage girls, using euphemisms such as ‘petite’ to provide potential clients with a clue to their real age.
There have been growing calls in the U.S. for the owners of Backpage to drop the ‘adult’ classified section.
Critics including prosecutors, politicians and religious leaders say many of the adverts for so-called escorts are soliciting sex with children, who are sometimes substituted at the point of sale for the adults who have been pictured.
But anti-sex trafficking campaigners have been hampered in their efforts because Village Voice Media is privately owned and doesn’t have to reveal its owners.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs invested £19million in Village Voice, an alternative New York newspaper, in 2000 and the stake was converted into a 16 per cent minority stake when the publication merged with another media company, New Times Inc, in 2006.
Since then a Goldman managing director, Scott Lebovitz, has had a seat on the board of the new company.
Village Voice Media has rejected demands to close down its adult adverts section, insisting the advertising would simply move offshore and outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities.
The company said it was co-operating with investigators and had reported 2,695 cases of suspected child trafficking to officials in 2011.
Goldman Sachs – once memorably described as a ‘great vampire squid’ sucking up money from wherever it could – has an unenviable reputation as one of the banking world’s greediest players.
That image was reinforced last month when Greg Smith, a Goldman Sachs executive director, resigned with a stinging attack on its ‘toxic and destructive’ culture.
He said the bank regularly put its own financial interests before those of its clients, whom bank bosses frequently dismissed as ‘muppets’.
Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein claimed in 2009 that bankers were doing ‘God’s work’. He was speaking after the bank had provoked anger by revealing it planned to lavish a record £13.4billion in pay and bonuses on its staff.
Defending the move just 12 months after bankers brought the world’s economy to the brink of collapse, Mr Blankfein said modern banking performed a vital function and described himself as just a banker ‘doing God’s work’.
‘We’re very important,’ he said. ‘We help companies to grow by helping them to raise capital.
‘Companies that grow create wealth. This, in turn, allows people to have jobs that create more growth and more wealth. We have a social purpose.’

             Goldman Sachs CEO defends bank's culture amid 1MDB scandal

            <p>
             Goldman Sachs (GS) faces lawsuits and investigations tied to its role in raising money for Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad.
The Justice Department claims that conspirators misappropriated $4.5 billion from 1MDB, and has zeroed in on Goldman's role in the scheme.
Goldman orchestrated three large bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013. The bond sales, which raised a total of $6.5 billion, earned Goldman Sachs a whopping $600 million in fees.
In the end, almost half of the money that Goldman raised for the fund was allegedly siphoned off to pay for jewelry and fine art, and to fund bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials, according to US officials.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In  1966 Friedman joined Goldman Sachs and became a partner in 1973. From 1987 until November 1990 he was the co-chief operating officer and either co-chairman or chairman between 1990 and 1994.[8] Friedman re-joined the board of Goldman in April 2005, and stepped down from serving on the board on May 22, 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             From December 2002 to December 2004 Friedman was United States Assistant to President George W. Bush for Economic Policy as well as the director of the National Economic Council.[14] On October 27, 2005 Friedman was asked to replace Brent Scowcroft as the Chairman of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.... Friedman was criticized for seemingly benefiting from his role as Chair of the New York Fed branch due to the federal government's aid to Goldman Sachs in recent months. He had "remain[ed] on the board of Goldman even as he was supposedly regulating [Goldman]; in order to rectify the problem, he applied for, and got, a conflict of interest waiver from the government. Friedman was also supposed to divest himself of his Goldman stock after Goldman became a bankholding company, but thanks to the waiver, he was allowed to go out and buy 52,000 additional shares in his old bank, leaving him $3 million richer," as one report put it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Friedman is involved in several public service activities, including Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Columbia University,[21] Chairman Emeritus of the Executive Committee of the Brookings Institution,[22] and a member of the
             <strong>

              I was the source for the Venice info, so can not be backed up, unless you want to go for a creepy boat ride (mosquito repellent, and firearms... ect).  Romney's father was a mexican citizen who most likely never officially became a US citizen, so that makes Romney an anchor baby. His cousin still lived in or close to Colonia Dublan where his dad was born. It is stated that they only have consenting, adult, polygamous relationships now, so as to not break Mexican law. They got over 77,000 acres down there in the Sierra Madres. Where would the Romney's fit into the Clinton/Bush Crime Foundation?The Mexican Mormon War - VICE  Mitt sure was scared of Roy Moore getting elected, and was one the only republicans to speak out publicly about him stepping down. Now that we know Roy was framed, has Mitt apologized? Colonia Diaz, Juarez, and the Guatemala one should be on our radar.

                In the comments some Catholics are questioning the circumstances around his death, and there's this:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Or a witch's curse. Pray the Lorica prayer of Saint Patrick (Breastplate prayer) for that reason every day; soon as I wake. We are not dealing with flesh and blood but powers and principalities of dark places. Bishop Morlino was a True Prince of the Church. I met him in Missoula Montana as the newly installed bishop for the Helena Diocese and subsequently wrote him about
                 <strong>
                  a satanic cult housed in Saint Patrick Hospital called the Chalice of Repose Project
                 </strong>
                 (playing harp music for dying patients in the spirit of Cluny Monks), he shut it down by 2002. They were not just teaching harp but esoteric magic (one day the scales dropped from my eyes and I remembered who I was born to serve- The One True God) How do I know- I was in "the program" and supposed to graduate with a certificate in 2000 but I quit much to the dismay of the CEO, Therese Shroeder Sheker (more than likely a high priestess of some sort and former Catholic married, divorced and now a lesbian). She lives in Mount Angel Oregon and her program continues via on line course. But make no mistake, she and her cronies put curses on people. They kept the attendies/students very very tired and off balance and they charged for everything, even tests. It was a sick environment but what did I know having never been exposed to this crap growing up in Father McGiveny's small hometown in CT? I wrote Bishop Morlino and I was quite afraid to do so. They were also high ranking freemasons that taught us the twisted scripture but it was very seductive to be on Dateline and in Time Magazine. My bad, was the false idol thing which I repented. On Thanksgiving evening of that year, my pregnant self and my husband were hit by a drunk driver who ran a red light. Mary of Guadalupe pin hung in the ceiling of our red Toyota. I went into labor but the ambulance was around the corner and our daughter Michaela Joan was born on her due date the next month.

                 Been busy, so just reading this. I would be really surprised if there were no 'something' here. Great research. Not really related to anything yet, but they found that missing girl in Wisconsin, so that is at least some good news. Waiting to find out more details of abduction and murder of her parents.
