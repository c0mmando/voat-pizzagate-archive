            Even random twitter accounts with an unhealthy interest in boys in their underwear have references to pandas though. Makes me wonder if it means anything

              One thing I'm worried about is that we'll go stepping on the toes of innocent DC-area alternative lifestyle and modern art crowds.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, some of what they do and create is controversial and it's likely meant to get that response. I assume a lot of it is venting from frustrations at being discriminated against for being gay or tranny or trans or what have you, but I think a lot of it is also from being pigeonholed as "evil" by Christian zealots for much of their life, and lashing out at that by trying hard to come across as anti-christian as possible.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can relate to some of that, not from being gay but from being harangued and proselytized to by Christians. I can relate simply through being raised as a humanist freethinker and a fairly leftist-liberal, tolerant one at that. Many of my views now are embarrassingly far right and I won't espouse them here, but I will relate (and have, vehemently, in several comments) that for PG to become dominated by a solely, staunchly Christian rhetoric will serve it more harm than good.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said as background to my thoughts, I can relate that the last thing I want to do is squash or incriminate some (probably poverse) DC acolyte of modern art-pop frenzy just for flying with the crowd.
             </p>
             <p>
              And as concerns DC-area art-pop, I think it's sort of a new Enlightenment, more like a kind of hillbilly stab at one. You have these open-minded people who move to DC and they're surrounded with the architecture and the symbolism of the founding fathers and the maintainers of the FF's legacies, and much of it is Masonic which has been attacked for decades as "Satanist", even though it is not.
             </p>
             <p>
              In that environment, and given the right chemistry of harmful upbringing and wrongful treatment at the hands of overzealous Christians, I can see how a lot of this symbolism and reactionary "okay yeah I'm Satanist, here you go!" makes its way into their artworks and therefore why this is so prevalent in the DC art-pop scene.
             </p>
             <p>
              None of which is incriminatory in and of itself.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I do realize that if we follow these artists one to the next and pay attention to what they're doing in their life BESIDES making creepy reactionary art, then we CAN find some more evidence. I just don't want to burn the bridges along the way.

               Very nice post, I feel the same way. I'm not looking to lump people in with this stuff just because they're taking part in "risque" art or have an interest in the occult. I was a bisexual atheist in a Christian school so I know how they can overreact out of ignorance, and how it can drive you to try and stand out and rebel.
