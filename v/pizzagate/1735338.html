<p>Narges Kalbasi Ashtari is a British-Iranian aid worker, helping orphans in India. In 2014 a child with her party, who were having a picnic, vanished and thus far there has been no trace of him. It is assumed that he somehow entered the river and drowned. The woman is being held by the Indian authorities, originally on a murder charge but now manslaughter.</p>
<p>This is a video from December where she discusses it... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTmWCUEaGGM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTmWCUEaGGM</a></p>
<p>I don\'t know what to make of the woman. It is far safer to assume that she is entirely innocent and has zero knowledge of what actually happened, but one thing which catches my attention is that there seems to be far more focus on her situation than either the fate of the child or the consideration of his family. It\'s interesting she pointed out that &quot;there is no body&quot; - this seems to be a common theme and point of view, in that &quot;there is no body so there is no victim, so there is no crime&quot; kind of deal.</p>
<p>I wonder if anybody can find any information as to which celebrities have spoken out about this. When the entertainment industry rally around somebody, particularly somebody whom has never been in the industry, then there\'s obviously some importance in the matter, so this could do with being looked at.</p>
<p>I am not pointing fingers at this woman, but I will posture this question: <strong>was the child kidnapped and trafficked?</strong></p>',

            Thanks for the response. It does seem like she's being made a scapegoat. I haven't watched the video yet, but I will.
