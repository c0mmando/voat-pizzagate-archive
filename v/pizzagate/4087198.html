<p>There is growing circumstantial evidence that hunter biden is a predator. Dating his brother\'s widow to gain access not only to his niece, and her friends, is known predator behavior. 4chaners have pointed out that the women in the videos share moles and scars and bone structure similar to natile biden and malia obama.  Furthermore, if the girls were not underage, then the leaked videos would be all over porn hub by now. They are not. Then there are the tattoos of the finger lakes on his back. A very odd tattoo to get, especially that region has a human trafficking problem, and is a resort for the rich and famous. </p>
<p>So now we have to take a look at Burisma, and the Ukraine. The Ukraine has an infamous history with human trafficking, from sex slaves, child trade, and cheap labor. Combine that with a natural gas company, and Europeans demand for natural gas and pipe lines and you have  a very disturbing problem. Are they using black mail to bypass regulations? are they a cover for human trafficking? Are they are money laundering front? It\'s a topic that needs more scrutiny, and something to consider in our research.</p>',

            I recommend that you look up my old Pizzagatewiki article on Victor Pinchuk on archive.is. I looked into the energy side of the equation extensively there. I would link it but I am on a cell phone and can't do links on it.

            I think Burisma is mainly money laundering IMF cash but that the major players pre- nationalization were very likely involved in human trafficking. Igor Kolomoisky is the big figure involved in Burisma and the one that should be looked into the most. He is already accused of ordering murders so I would put nothing beyond him.

            This is all very loose evidence. If you got some actual verifiable emails, or something more concrete you have something potentially prosecutable. So far Hunter is very suspect.

            A little off topic but it’s about his bro. You know the one they said died of cancer. He was a lawyer. Actually I think a prosecutor. There was a very famous pedophile case and he just would not let go. Have to put my thinking cap on but I think he was a pediatric dentist. It’s a really sick case. I have not any proof just a strong feeling that he really made some people mad. Maybe a bunch of high ranking pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I think Hunter was into trafficking in Ukraine?  Look at the family. How do they make their money? It doesn’t matter as long as payoff is really big. Human Trafficking is bigger than drugs now. There was some Burisma talk on here few yrs ago. Must be some on search voat. . I remember posting about  it myself.

             Earl Bradley. He was a pediatrician in Delaware. I learned about him from this site and I’ve begged my Mother and Sister to move from Delaware ever since. I tell them there is evil in the shadows of their little town and I think they are finally coming around. My nephew is young and I’m just relieved he is homeschooled and always with my Mom.

              Yes! TY. That’s him. And it was very nasty. If I remember correctly one victim was very young. It’s a place my brain doesn’t want to go. You are right to get them out of there. The sooner the better.

              The Bradley case was especially disturbing because it involved very young, non-verbal aged children. The cache of videos he made was huge. While Beau tracked the customers of the smut do you think any of it traced back to people he knew locally? Important people? Maybe even family? It’s the most disturbing case I’ve ever read about. Delaware is a strange state and it’s main summer workers are from Russia/Ukraine. They flood the beach towns and work at the seasonal spots. So lots of young girls running around all summer.

               Papa Joe hangs out in Rehoboth  a gay Mecca. We posted about it here. A very famous ice cream shop he goes to there. Stay away.
