            Arch Erected After JFK Assassination, Arch of Baal Erected In Washington D.C. Before Trump Assassination?

            I do believe that ALL prior programming about Donald Trump for the past 20 to 30 years since Henry Kissinger and Roy Cohn groomed Trump for this position we are headed for a JFK2.0
           </p>
           <p>
            We get to witness is the Trailer Park Version of John F. Kennedy's Camelot, or a reversal of sorts and we are about to experience the shock and awe of seeing our very own president put in the same position JFK was in 1963.
We are very aware that Dealey Plaza was an Osiris/Isis Ritual ad this one will be more of the same with The King, Osiris, being slain and sacrificed and thusly resurrected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the details, Trump and JFK's coifed Irish red hair, Melania's demure Jackie-O impression starring Baron as JFKJr., it seems almost as if Melania was purchased for this very purpose (remember the waving video practicing her role as FLOTUS?) Stormy as Jackie-O...

            Oh my goodness Vindicator you have to remove that flair right this instant. What this author claims is 100% true and it's been in all the major publications for two years now and have been reconstructing this gate entrance around the world MASQUERADING IT as the Roman Arch of Triumph when it is actually the Arch of Baal. I've also seen articles CONFLATING the two meaning they are one in the same. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ROMANS HERE HOW NAIVE OF YOU TO TY AND MAKE US BELIEVE THE ROMANS WEREN'T CAPABLE OF SUCH THINGS, however, the ancient BABYLONIANS who did believe in BAAL DID sacrifice on the SAME SPOT which is WHY THE ROMANS BUILT THERE.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't believe this site, it's no wonder I don't thread here anymore with that kind of resistance.

             Hmm. Sorry I didn't see this comment, ASolo. You didn't ping me. It seems like an awfully strong reaction to a flair of
             <em>
              possible
             </em>
             disinfo. The reason we flair is two-fold: 1) So we don't simply have to take things down per Rule 2 that are possibly true but for which there is evidence they are untrue and 2) So they can't simply be quoted as evidence
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             is merely Fake News if they are part of a larger disinfo campaign. Since the locals claimed this structure had no religious significance, it falls under the flair. I could have deleted it as not PG related or empirical. Interpreting the flair as "censorship" is really an unjust assessment.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              What this author claims is 100% true and it's been in all the major publications for two years now
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             If that is the case, it should be easy to create a post on this subject that does not have to be either removed OR flaired. Please make one! Make sure you address the fact that locals have said it isn't a religious structure. Generally, we don't put a possible disinfo flair on submissions that discuss the fact that a given premise could be disinfo, since it's already included.

             That arch was put up  early 3rd century, on the colonnade going to the temple which was still operating late 3rd century. We don't know for sure the significance of the arch but it's proximity to a pagan temple is telling and the fact that it's being reproduced is telling also. Apparently the temple is going to be rebuilt! 
I second that emotion: when a censor on this site can get 500 points for reproducing someone else's reddit blog for "edification" tells me my efforts are wasted.

            Baal worship is the religion of the elites which is the root Religion of Satanist, Luciferian and Sarturnalian Cults. You and I may not believe in this stuff but these people certainly do and perform the most wicked, evil acts in the name of their Religion. With every passing year, especially since 2001, I believe, they are bringing their sickness out into the open. This is also known as the "Externalization of the Hierarchy". In the last 2 years since Pizzagate broke, I am turning to Christianity more and more, as this confirms to me the existence of an evil spiritual force. So this must also mean the existence of God since this force is seeking to supplant God with general wickedness. Wickedness in general seems to be on the rise: Open Occult Symbolism, Satanism , mainstreaming and making jokes about Pedophilia. Those who are observing this need to get their spiritual house in order for themselves and their loved ones. "For nothing is concealed that won't be revealed, and nothing hidden that won't be made known and brought to light." Luke 8:17

            Alright, HennyPenny, since you insist on pushing this as related to human sacrifice, I will flair it as Disinformation.

            There is no archaeological evidence that the Arch of Triumph at Palmyra, which was built hundreds of years after the temples were built there and is not an "entrance" to any of them, was anything but a typical victory arch like those erected by Roman conquerors all over the Mediterranean.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is Fake News you are pushing.
            <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-palmyra-idUKKCN0RY0YN20151004">
             Here is what was said
            </a>
            about the ISIS destruction of the arch at the time:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Maamoun Abdulkarim told Reuters that sources in Palmyra had confirmed that the Arch of Triumph, a jewel in the exquisite collection of ruins in the oasis city, had been blown up...“It’s as though there is a curse that has befallen this city and I expect only news that will shock us. If the city remains in their hands the city is doomed,” Abdulkarim told Reuters.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It is now wanton destruction ... their acts of vengeance are no longer ideologically driven because they are now blowing up buildings with no religious meaning,” he added.

             This Arch led to the Temple of Baal which was active during the Arch's construction and afterwards
The arch was built 202 AD.

             The temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire in a campaign against the temples of the East made by Maternus Cynegius, Praetorian Prefect of Oriens, between 25 May 385 to 19 March 388.[3]

             No one perhaps can definitely say as history is often written by the censors but if a significant number of stories have this take on it and it is viewed by many as a defiant symbol of paganism, then this is news.

             The Arch of Palmyra, or also known as the Arch of Triumph is essentially the entranceway to the temple of baal. “The Monumental Arch was built sometime during the reign of emperor Septimius Severus, which lasted from 193 to 211 AD; it linked the main street of the Colonnade and the Temple of Bel.” Bel and Baal are the same deities.

            London was 2015, and the unveiling in NYC did happen in 2016. Spiritually, it was meant as an invocation/curse to get the Jezebel Hillary elected to preserve and expand modern Baal worship (Planned Parenthood).

            The money they're spending to recreate destroyed "temples" could feed a lot of refugees in on site camps to avoid having the refugees flood England and elsewhere.
