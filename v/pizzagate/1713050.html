           This is yet another example of pedophilia being normalized by Hollywood, in the show "Family Guy." It couldn't be any more blatant. There's a child character who regularly engages in graphic sexual behavior and speech.

            How about dulling people - especially young people and children - to the spiritual gutter? And maybe providing entertainment that especially appeals to pedophiles and people with a sadistic side?

            "again, doubt that the creators are pro-pedo, but they certainly are hypocrites if they think the pedo character is creepy, and then act like pedos themselves with the way they write the baby character (I suppose their excuse would be something like 'Stewie is basically an adult in a baby's body')."
           </p>
           <p>
            'Stewie is basically an adult in a baby's body' is a pedophile's viewpoint. They project adult traits onto children, including the ability to meaningful consent to sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            And as I mentioned to someone else here, that is the rationalization - "Stewie is basically an adult, not a child." Yet Stewie IS a baby. And that's an instance of D-E-C-E-P-T-I-O-N. There isn't a word there, only letters - if someone chooses to ignore the word and rationalize it away. The show's makers are using double meanings (ambiguity) and allowing people who choose to, to repress one set of meanings and deny they're there, even though part of the "outrageousness" of the show is the very fact of having a baby doing all of those things. To say that "Stewie is basically an adult in a baby's body" is rationalizing on the part of the show's creators and defenders in exactly the same way as pedophiles rationalize their abuse of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            "While you're at it though, what about South Park? The kids in that show are what, 10? And do things much more sexual and disturbing than even Family Guy characters."
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not excluding South Park. I've heard different things about it and expect it to be about the same as Family Guy, but I really haven't seen even an episode of it. Now that you remind me of it, I might look into it and what's possibly been written about it sexualizing children.

            So do the straight pedos that like little girls mean that straight people are basically pedos? This thread is borderline silly to begin with, why completely destroy it? The evidence in this thread is light, but family guy and south park have always had crypto stuff in it, so anything is worth a look see.

            I've been passively watching a lot of Family Guy lately and I found myself getting the same vibe. FG has always been outlandish, but it wouldn't surprise me if the writers are occasionally guided to include certain things.

            I have to wonder if there are any charts anywhere that delineate quotas for that kind of stuff in Hollywood.

             You never know. They might very well do things like keep a count of how many explicit things are said and done per episode. But it also seems like they just push certain agendas. In Family Guy, that's attacking people's innocence, including the innocence of children. The point is literally to be a gutter.

            While I do get your points... come the fuck on with this already. It's cartoon satire designed to reflect the world around us.. yes it's fucked up.. that's the point. Comedy often draws on the most fucked up parts of life. Hijacking what was once a good investigation to attack a show you didn't even like in the first place is fucking retarded... and other retards are fucking upping this shit? No wonder so many of your group has splintered. Want to go after cartoons? How about the obvious.. Disney shit. The target audience is actual kids. Is this what PG is now?

             Family Guy is one of "the obvious." One example of it: portraying a teen girl having serious sexual contact with her teen brother. And it's not satire. The show might have satire in it, but you don't get what satire means if you think portraying teen incest is somehow an example of it. That's child pornography, put into cartoon form.

               A common trait of being satirical may be to sensationalise and desensitise, at the same time, a controversial theme. So with this in mind... once is a joke, twice it got old already but at the third it became an obsession.

               A flashy demonstration means nothing. I do know what satire means, and I'd already gone to Google to get authoritative statements before I posted that. But a definition has to be followed to the T. So tell me, what is satire about any of the specific "jokes" I listed here above, or in a teen girl having serious sexual contact with her teen brother, and having that be for entertainment?

                You are a typical self righteous bible thumper that believes in a magic babies.. so no wonder you can't understand a show involving a fucking talking baby and dog... that shit is reality to you. I think you have taken up this fight on the back of pizzagate's hunt for real life pedos... in real life.. to support attacking the creator of a show those like yourself have classically attacked for having no interest in in your magic book. FFS, you had to edit in your comment of : "(And EDIT: I nearly forgot, there is a sexually graphic "pizza" reference in an excerpt of dialogue from the show - it refers to an adult, but it shows that "pizza" is sexual slang to some, and may be a pedophilia "joke," since this show regularly involves children in sexual behavior)." JUST to make it even close to "relevant" to the PG "investigation", if you can even call it that anymore... and you did a piss poor job of that too. The term "Cheese Pizza" as been around for a fucking really long time.... and you clearly didn't even know that, calling into question your "qualifications" to even be posting in this sub in the first place imo. Did you even attempt to watch the scenes? You missed an fuckton of context.. not that you would "get it" anyways. Want some more shit? How about the grown ass mayor and Meg dating? I bet you could even find them walking past a pizza place! Oh the huge manatee! how about looking for actual pedos touching actual kids.. you know.. what PG was intended for in the first fucking place. People like you make me sick and I'm sure that feeling is mutual. 5 bucks says you "don't get" idiocracy as well. Now, if you will excuse me, a talking baby and I are going to go fuck a dog on top of a pile of passed out gay men.

                 I know what I'm talking about. You're misstating so many things here that I'm not even going to try to respond to them all. Most of the misstatements are obvious anyway. Like obviously people regularly consult dictionaries even when they know what a word means and use it properly. Consulting the dictionary is merely to have an authoritative articulation of the definition. I think you most likely know that, and use the dictionary that way as well, since most people do, and are merely creating a straw man argument to knock down.

                 What's more, you never attempted to identify what was satire about a teen girl having sexual contact with her teen brother, and all that clearly for the sake of some people's "entertainment." Satire has as its target people who have some power, but aren't using it morally and responsibly. The satire is to attempt to shame them, or expose them as hypocrites. So where is the satire in that?

            Is this how dry the investigation has become? Talking about the writers of a cartoon show? Sure, if you're looking for ways these guys are connected to it. But you aren't. A hunt for symbols and metaphor in art is not how we nailed Abramovic, and it's not how we could nail the writers of Family Guy. This is a waste of resources.

             It's a cartoon pornography show, featuring cartoon child pornography. Like I mentioned to someone else, in one episode I watched, the teen girl had serious sexual contact with her teen brother.

             Don't try to muddy the waters by reducing the content to the medium of "cartoon," and what's been traditionally thought of as "cartoons," as if we're talking about Bugs Bunny or Tom and Jerry. You very well know the point is the content, not the medium.

              You can't put a TV show in jail. If you have any leads regarding the writers, do that instead. You are the one muddying the waters, not me.

               Family Guy's content speaks for itself, and speaks for its creators. There are few people that could depict incest between teens as family entertainment. Yet this is being presented to young people and children.

                It does not speak for itself. Podesta's emails speak for themselves, but your argument falls on its face because you're attacking a medium. Are the writers pedophiles? Is there anything tying them to illegal behavior? If you've got nothing to show in regards to that, then you are nothing but a pathetic concern troll, and you're weakening this sub.

                 Just address presenting incest between two teens as family entertainment. What do you think of that? We know pizzagate has many connections to Hollywood, and this comes right out of Hollywood.

                      Productive? List the leads you've gotten since this thread. Do you even have any of the head writers' names besides MacFarlane? Are any of them mentioned in any wikileaks emails? Do any of them have ties to Abramovic? Anything at all? If not, then you can kindly shut the fuck up.

                        An investigation thrives on leads. The only thing I see in this whole thread is "Look how much pedophilic imagery there is in this show! How terrible." No connections to real pedophiles or real evidence, because this joke of a thread is not part of the real investigation. From the fact that you can't address any opportunities to follow up shows me just how de-railing you really want to be.

                         Again, your opinion is just that. Many other people don't share it. And this isn't my first post. I've provided many bits of information that in your narrow definition would qualify as leads. It seems to me from you throwing out such an accusation at me, when my posting history is available, that you maybe want to be derailing. If you think this thread is a waste of time, spend it elsewhere. Why are you here when this is an old thread getting hardly any attention anymore? (not that it even got all that much attention to begin with).

                          Why not start with "FG is pedophilic. Any leads on the writers?" To comment about the content of a show without any intention of following up on the whereabouts of anyone involved in its production is just such a waste.

                            You can't put a TV show in handcuffs. I don't know what your endgame is here regarding FG because you have made no attempt to investigate the private lives of these writers, who by extension of your logic MAY BE AFFILIATED WITH, OR MAY THEMSELVES BE, PEDOPHILES.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Unless your only reason for posting this thread is to say "Look how pedophilic this show is. Let's all stop watching it", which in regards to the larger goal of this subvoat is a COMPLETE waste of time and a clear case of not seeing the forest for the trees.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Like I said, instead of using the content of the show as a potential springboard to researching and exposing pedophiles, you stayed comfortable condemning the content of the show itself.

            I really don't like FG. That being said, I honestly think it's a "immaturity" thing with Seth MacFarlane. If you look at his previous work on Cartoon Network you can see the dude has always been LCD when it comes to comedy. Remember he is older man who still thinks dick and fart jokes are. Just. Fucking. Awesome. (Which some times they are) Its not awesome when it's literally every other punchline. 
His writing style is torn from the 90's when homosexuality was considered the funniest thing for straight man to do. Back in the 90's the easiest way to get a cheap laugh was for some Alpha to go full blown faggot, AND PEOPLE LOVED IT! Fast forward 20 years and the homo thing is played out because the media and pop culture has made it cool to be gay and uncool to laugh at it.
I went on a little longer and not as eloquent as i had hoped but my point is this: I really don't think Seth is pushing for pedophilia; if anything I'd say he's been leaving crumbs as clues so other people can do what he cant for fear of being blacklisted or worse.

             It's more like sex and children "jokes," really, and children are part of the target audience. In one of the episodes I saw, the teen girl character had serious sexual contact with her teen brother. That was the subject of "jokes." People have been severely hurt to the point of killing themselves over such sexual contact. There are claims that such material is "gallows humor" or "satire," but it's neither. While there certainly may be both "gallows humor" and satire at different points in the show, the incest between two teens is cartoon child pornography. The whole show is essentially cartoon pornography, and again, aimed in part at teens and even children. I'd be very surprised if it wasn't a favorite of pedophiles too.

              I'll answer your charge from the Bible. The apostle Paul wrote that today we know only in part, but one day God will reveal all. So then, when God does that, you'll know the truth about your accusation of me. Since our only way of knowing each other is through the internet and you're accusing me of something like that, that's all I can say. But I will also tell you that the Bible records Jesus saying that people will have to give an account for every word we say in our lives, even every idle word. To God, five minutes or five or five hundred years ago is as real as the present is to us, and what we say is eternal. And the Bible speaks of things being our masters, if God isn't our master. And they master us. I don't wish for the things of this world to be my master, and myself a slave to them.

                Again, you're trying to make depiction and endorsement/normalization mutually exclusive things. The Nazis in Indiana Jones and pedophilia in Family Guy are treated in wholly different ways.

                 Not really, they both are shown as wrong and those who sympathize always get their due.  Maybe provide an example of pedophilia being portrayed positively on family guy or go away?

                  Not true. "Jokes" that are straight up the alley of pedophiles are the very substance of the show. Several of them are posted above. Just to take two, those beginning with "Suzy scampers into the room and into Quagmire’s arms," and "You really think Meg is college material, Principal Sheppard?" They both embrace pedophilia.

                    We're getting close to just going in circles, and you really don't respond to evidence, so I don't think I'm going to continue this conversation much longer.

                   <p>
                    I told you I watched some scenes. And I didn't need to read PTC's reports, which are only biased in your view because you don't hold similar beliefs. I copied the dialogue they posted which also included some brief descriptions of the action. What I posted was essentially show transcripts.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And you are woefully misrepresenting the pedophilia-themed scenes and what happens in them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    First, you've said repeatedly that this is all just cartoon make-believe and not reality, but you also advance an argument that in Family Guy "the pedophile" gets "depicted as creepy." So these cartoons do have something to do with reality, and how they represent things does matter. Now you're saying the represent the pedophile appropriately. But yet again, the pedophile behavior is being played for laughs! And part of the laugh is the massive under-reaction to the pedophile. If a man were truly to pick up a little child and give her a "raspberry" that way, with her father right there, mild disapproval and a suggestion that he leave isn't likely to be the response, if the parent is in any way a responsible parent.

            Even in the scene you referenced stewie, after tricking Brian into molesting him, blackmails him with the threat of people finding out immediately after. You can't be blackmailed by something that is normal. So I don't think it's fair to consider this scene as normalizing pedophelia. The mayor and megs relationship would be a lot closer. Or mister Herbert the creepy neighborhood child molester.

             That's a matter of D-E-C-E-P-T-I-O-N! Is that a bunch of letters I just typed, or is there a word there?
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, I've studied such things formally, and a common deceptive tactic is to create multiple meanings so you can deny that some of the meanings are there when they clearly are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both Brian and Stewie are "actually" two adult human males. They talk that way. So that is their identities, and there's nothing sexual with children and dogs going on. The fact that Stewie is a baby and Brian is a dog can be literally repressed, and this can just be considered a "blackmail" situation between two adults, and the bestiality involving a baby, the other meaning, can be officially ignored - even though it is clearly part of the "outrageousness" of the scenario. It's like, "Wow, a talking adult-like baby having sexual contact with a talking adult-like dog! Isn't that hilarious, in a very sick sort of way!" It is no accident that it's a baby involved in all of this sexual conduct, and apparently if you want to know how cults work and can convince people of outrageous things, look no further than this show. The truth is right there, out in the open.

             However, how do you know the lead is dead? You say it as if it's something OP is obviously aware of too.

            I also remember reading an article where the creator of the show was at one point and time thinking of outing Stewie as gay but decided not to. I have nothing against gay people but making toddlers gay on a tv cartoon is a bit much for me.

             You have to remember tho he has an adult brittish man's voice and the character has existed (developed/evolved) over the course of almost 20 years.  Also the gay thing only came about after the writers ran out of ideas....

             Stewie is very gay. Openly. Frequently. I guess he has never officially said it. But he's definitely gay.

            So many episodes made me cringe, that old man down the road was a disgusting character. The fact that we have reached the point where child molesters are considered comical means we are in big trouble. There is no way they should be normalizing that unless they are pushing an obvious agenda. I seen some very questionable episodes of American Dad and Cleveland Show too. The increasing amount of pedo normalization is absolutely alarming.

             STOP GOING AFTER JOKES. Jesus fucking christ. You people are ridiculous. There's a million legit angles and you guys circulate jokes that you deem offensive all day. You make us look retarded, and illegitimate.  Do something productive or do nothing at all. You're being extremely counter productive at the moment.

              As was stated in the post the "lovable characters " brian , stewie , Peter , Lois are all utilised to normalise sexual relationships/ activity between adults and minors I used to watch a lot of family guy and pedophilia and violence , rape ect is normalised and made  humeroous on the other hand I think South Park uses sick humour in a much less sick way

               "As was stated in the post the "lovable characters " brian , stewie , Peter , Lois are all utilised to tell whatever lazy jokes the writers have come up with aimed squarely st the lowest common denominator"

               The "comedy" in family guy 99% of the time boils down to depicting a minority or someone who holds a fringe belief acting stereotypically then telling the audience to point and laugh.
              </p>
              <p>
               Have you ever spent time in a writers room?  I have, and I can tell you right now if that was our flimsy premise we'd have gone back to the gay/pedophile well just as much as family guy since those jokes are easy.

                I agree but I didn't used the word positively I said normalised when the main characters who are well liked by the audience partake or allude to sexual acts with minors or adults if they are children (any of the examples in the main post) regularly than that is normalising making something normal doesn't necessarily mean putting a positive spin on something ..you must really like family guy cause you keep defending it on this thread- for example if a teacher kept making pedophile/ sexual jokes in class it would be innapropriate and he would be normalising such innapropriatness due to his authority as an adult and a teacher -

                 I really don't like family guy.  It is very lazy.  What I HATE is when nutjobs try to hijack voat and make us look crazy....
                </p>
                <p>
                 You still can't find a single example of things going well for a pedophile in the shows almost 20 year history.  How is that any different than Indiana Jones depiction of the Nazis?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Have you watched an Indy movie lately- The Nazis are shown to be evil but shot in a way that makes them look as badass as possible.  Was Spielberg normalizing Nazis?

                  Yeh I agree think it's lazy too! I understand you don't want to look crazy but pizzagate is pretty far down the rabbit hole so your kinda too late for that! Not quite sure why you have appointed yourself as the paragon on sanity either - We don't have to agree but we can respect other people's views though there's not enough evidence on here sometimes ...There's nothing crazy about looking critically at tv shows though- again you have misunderstood what normalisation means if Indiana jones was portrayed as a nazi then yes they would be endorsing nazism perhaps normalising it especially if many of the "good" characters were also nazis but nazis are the villains aren't they? So I don't think your example is a good one... (it often comes down to who your rooting for obviously you think the nazis in that look badass so perhaps you are rooting for them over Indiana jones  )There are shows that have one or two pedophile jokes and then there's family guy a show fixated on child abuse as this article puts it

                  Peter having a child porn exhibit to get his wives back together quagmire pulling a condom from behind a little girls ear at her birthday party, an episode called barely legal,stewie a baby who constantly finds himself in adult sexual situations ect ect  - not sure how you think this isn't normalising sexual behaviour between adults and children it's like you've never watched the show- when we think about the amount of information processed subconsciously when watching tv if you watch a show which makes child abuse / incest/ rape ect funny and lighthearted over and over and over again it has an effect on how you view child abuse not sure how much of an effect but an effect none the less - another example would be Barney from how I met your mother normalising tricking women into having sex with him/ infidelity - usually he would be portrayed as a scumbag/player in tv shows but in that one he is portrayed as loveable and likeable as are the residents of quahog - that normalises his behaviour rather than simply having a pedophile/nazi/player in a show it depends who they are and how they are portrayed as well as their actions ... no moral weight or justification is added to anything they do in family guys cartoon universe it is gratuitous though as I mentioned before South Park always has some kind of moral lesson at the end of each episode - I'm not against jokes about uncomfortable things - it's just if a friend of mine kept making dead baby jokes or pedophilic jokes I would be questioning our friendship so why should I keep watching a tv show that does the same ?

                     Calling crap like this promoting pedophilia detracts from our actual evidence with podesta's emails and the money trail.  It just makes us all look crazy and does nothing to help the kids being abused.

                     What it does do is add momentum to the "pizzagate is a nutjob conspiracy" narrative.

                      Point taken on the paragraphs but was writing on my phone sorry...also yeh I get what you mean that discussions might distract from the purpose of exposing pizzagate but I also think that hollywood and the entertainment industry is heavily involved in Elite Pedophilia and promoting the sexualization of children. Check out the film An Open Secret if you haven't already and also Corey Feldman and others speaking out about the casting couch for kids. I think that the shows that children and young adults watch indoctrinates them into seeing child abuse as a punchline and whilst I don't think we should censor them I reckon people should be more critical of the information they allow to be broadcast into they're heads.

                     <p>
                      Before Pizzagate, Jimmy Saville, Jerry Sandusky ect. I pretty much never heard anyone in the media or in real life talk about pedophilia seriously all the while shows like Family guy made light of the subject as is the mainstream media doing with pizzagate now. There's something troubling about that that links to why people are so unwilling to acknowledge elite pedophilia or the possibility of pedogate. BUT yeh... it might be a little off topic... though I do think that elite circles abide by a different moral code, more accepting of pedophilia, and by analyzing how it is portrayed in the media we might gain some insight into how these people think and operate. Anyways glad your following the money and trying to expose this stuff! Keep up the good work

              Yup, that's pretty flipping weird given the current revelations. Could be a coincidence, of course...

              That said, FG has been notorious for its lack of "decency" in general and making jokes of everything (same could be said for much of Seth McFarlane's stuff). Thus, much of such shows should be taken with a grain of salt.

              That definitely looks like code, and really makes sense since the PG revelations. They brag about it relentlessly always in our face I am shocked most of us had no idea how bad it was. The symbology is everywhere. I would upvoat you but I am all out it seems. Thanks for posting, wasn't aware of that one, it's pretty clear what they are referencing.

                 You do want to ban criticism. You want to ban any criticism that might change anyone's mind about Family Guy, so they realize what evil it is, and the show loses popularity, and/or advertisers. It's a free country, and people can engage in criticism. Do you have a problem with people criticizing Christianity, and maybe causing people to leave it, so the Gospel isn't preached as much? If someone is trying to take away the economic support for God's Word being preached, then they are engaging in censorship that should be banned, too, by your logic. It isn't censorship in the least, except in controlling liberal minds, to criticize something. It's also only called "censorship" by liberals when something liberal is the target. Liberals want the arena of public debate shut down and their propaganda running 24/7. Well just win in the arena of public debate without trying to stifle free speech and be true censors yourselves. People are just as free to air their concerns about something like Family Guy as are supporters to air their arguments for why they think it's a good show. But since it's hard to defend a sexualized baby, trying to stifle criticism is the easier route.

                    Lazy Jokes are jokes that require no effort to write.  Basic family guy depict minority acting stereotypically have audience point and laugh.  Family guy uses them because they have to write 20+ episodes a year and can't attract talent.

            The characters on family guy don't have personalities they have traits they need to exhibit for 15-30 seconds so a joke lands...

             Apparently "Family Guy" is a sacred cow of yours, but it's an evil show that portrays evil things, and it's central to the show to involve children in those evil things.

             Please type out for me some of the sexual content involving the child characters on that show that you know of, right here, right now. If it's so innocent, you shouldn't have any trouble promoting it, being proud of it, and standing behind it.

              Network cartoon crap like family guy is made in assembly line fashion by dozens of stressed out people struggling to fill 23 minutes a week with the easiest laziest humor possible... Thus repetitive one note "ewwww pervert" jokes.

               No, I meant things like that aren't on TV for people's entertainment because of the people you call "censors." Family Guy is a version of the "Fatherhood" video, which even has the "humor" of the Caillou theme song being sung. Family Guy shows the baby being shot in the chest, just for one example of violence against children being portrayed in it.
              </p>
              <p>
               And linking to a video isn't typing the material out. The point is for you to personally own it. But not surprisingly, you even chose material that, while bad, is nowhere near the worst on the show either. Just offhand, from the three episodes I saw, I can think of two examples of actual sexual acts involving children. One involved the teen girl character having serious sexual conduct with her teen brother.

                 I've told you, someone who admits to liking and defending this show, enough about myself. I know I'm qualified to speak on it, and that's enough for me. I also know that this show's defenders try to wrap it in the flag of gallows humor, or satire, to excuse the child pornography. And those are only two of the many rationalizations for things in this show. It's not gallows humor, unless you count it as "gallows humor for pedophiles," or people who don't realize they're thinking like pedophiles do.

              Lol you are reading too much into it. It's an adult cartoon. It's adult humor. That means it is always going to border on the offensive and inappropriate. At times this will inevitably lead to 911 jokes, pedophile jokes, rape jokes, other dark humor. That does not mean it is normalizing pedophilia. In fact if pedophilia was normal they wouldn't be able to use it in their jokes because thats not how adult cartoons work. They are offensive and shocking. The fact that pedophilia is used as humor in adult cartoons is if anything an indication that it is not normal in our society or else it wouldn't be funny when used in dark humor.

               I don't know if I want to take the time to address all the untrue things in what you've written here. For now I'll just point to this sentence, in which you essentially say that pedophilia can be a matter for jokes.

                Anything can be a matter for jokes if you have a brain. I find that stupid people can't laugh at dark humor because they are too weak minded to separate from the emotion of the literal idea to enjoy the cleverness and shocking nature of the joke.

                 Many people just understand the concept of stopping oneself appropriately. Like stopping at two pieces of pizza. Spiritual obesity is a real problem in our land today. People who just want more and more, the equivalent of having multiple pizzas and burgers for dinner. It is a good thing to be able to get a grip on yourself, and not be mastered by things.

                 You shouldn't make false statements. Of course I know what gallows humor is. I came from an abusive family and when I was young engaged in quite a bit of it. But NOTHING like this. There might very well be REAL gallows humor in this show, but the instances of cartoon child pornography in this show aren't that. Calling it "gallows humor" or "satire" is just to make excuses for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And while true "gallows humor" can be a coping mechanism, it's like serious drug use. If it keeps you from death, it's better than that, but it's destructive in and of itself. After so many years of it, I saw what it was doing to my life. But again, in portraying sex acts by children, that's not gallows humor.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I was also a victim of child sex abuse, and I've met many other victims. As we all know, some victims go on to be perpetrators as well, and likely most perpetrators were victims at some point too. The victims who are also perpetrators tend to be the people who can find child sexual abuse to be funny entertainment, and to support this show and ones like it is to support them.

                  If you are looking for the line between dark comedy and actual darkness you would have better luck with something like The Neon Demon or Eraserhead than a lazy animated network comedy aimed squarely at the lowest common denominator....

                     That's a fake statistic and you know it. Cite your source if it isn't. First, do you really think anywhere near 99% of the country even knows it exists, meaning what its content is like? Then among those who do know of it, a great many people, even among those who don't identify as Christian, think it's terrible, but also for any number of reasons they think there's little to nothing that can be done about it.

                      It is a fringe belief.  Coca-Cola and Proctor and Gamble advertise on family guy; they wouldn't if 3 million people (under 1%) were raising a fuss about it.

                       No, I wouldn't. You said "fine with it," which means being aware of the content and not at all disapproving of it. Now you say they're "fine enough with it to mind their own business" which isn't the same thing at all. Being "fine with it" and "not being fine with it," but not knowing what you can really do about it are two different things. In terms of psychology, which I agree with to some extent, the show is built on blatant sociopathy. Sociopathy is the whole point and punch line, the theme of the show, and it's simply not in any way appealing to most people. Young people have been proven to be narcissistic, which is closely related to sociopathy, so that's one reason why Family Guy likely appeal to many of them. In spiritual terms, the show is blatantly Satanic in outlook, and you don't need to be a Christian to see that.

                        You know the 1980's comedy of bill murray and co was considered narcissistic too right?  Standards change, especially with the one upping comedy demands.  just look at the evolution of the gross out comedy starting with Animal house.

              I will watch a few minutes of South Park or Family Guy here and there, clinically, to have a more informed world view of what people are exposing themselves to. One scene on South Park had the teacher ask the sex ed. class which positions they were aware of. Five were named by different kids. Two I knew, and the other three I had to look up in the Urban Dictionary. They described unspeakable acts involving two people and excrement. I have seen things just as bad on Family Guy. I'm no prude, but the producers of these shows and those that run the government agencies that have deregulated TV/obscenity laws need serious prison time by my reckoning, for exposing impressionable minds to the worst things man can imagine.

                   The smear tactics aside, you're falsely separating depiction and endorsement. It all depends on the presentation. People get off on the fact that it's a baby saying and doing these things. That's a part of it, and that's what's the matter with it, whether someone is willing to admit that or not.

                     Like I said, what's the appeal of laughing about Michael Hutchence's death, and teaching young people especially to be callous like that? Just to be clear, since you're so intent on attacking me personally, I wasn't any sort of fan of Michael Hutchence. I liked a few INXS songs way back when, but I liked many popular songs at the time. The point is treating someone's death that way, that it's merely nothing more than a punchline.

                      The point is to produce 20+ episodes of a show as quickly and cheaply as possible.  Having been in a very similar writers room I can tell you right now what happened.

                      One writer either really likes or really hates INXS and came up with a joke about it.  Everyone else either thought it was passable or just really wanted to go home.

               These are adult television shows. For adults. If impressionable minds are watching these shows its because of poor parenting and it's really not the fault of the shows. Adult humor is fantastic and I would never want to see it taken off the air. You don't like your kids watching it then raise your fucking kids you loser. Don't try to take it away from everyone else just because you are a prude who doesn't take the time to know what their kids are watching.

                The definition of a loser is someone justifying shows that openly allude to defecating in someone's mouth being shown to kids during the day on MTV or Much Music while the parents are off doing their own thing. Further, if you find that kind of humor fantastic, you have really bad taste. It's everyone's fault, the producers for making it, the networks for showing it, you for consuming it, and the rest of us for not marching on Hollywood and D.C. with pitchforks.

                  On the contrary, real strength is knowing there are certain boundaries that should not be transgressed, in comedy, cartoons, books, movies, whatever, like the one I just described. Look man, I'm 51, and I've seen it all. My opinions have changed drastically over the years. Here's wisdom. It's far more difficult to write clean comedy, and those that can do it have great minds. Really dark humor is a cop out, a shortcut for the weak minded writer. Anyone can do it, just say or portray something so outrageous that the nervous shock response will be triggered in the listener/viewer. The mechanism that usually causes one to laugh at an outrageous joke is the subconscience telling you that you really should not be laughing, but rather heading for the door.

               I'll do that, too. That's how I ended up watching a few episodes of Family Guy. As I said, I wouldn't even want to describe the sexual things I saw on those three episodes that involved children. It was graphic content that would be too graphic for live action television even if the behavior just involved adults, much less children.
              </p>
              <p>
               Family Guy and South Park are like cartoon pornography.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I recall that some of the commercials I saw while Family Guy was on were child-focused, with children in them. One ad had children on skateboards. That shows they know what they're target audience is.

                   No, the problem is with you but you don't see it. You missed the point. You defined something as real if only if actual live people were involved. A book is mere print.

                     Was it real when Family Guy joked about the death of Michael Hutchence? That was in one episode I saw, the Stewie character saying to the dog, "you're going all Michael Hutchence on me" when the dog is being strangled.

                      No it was a lazy joke...Had they depicted the scene in live action and advertised specifically to get children to watch you would have an argument that they were going for realism...

                       No, they treated a person's real death as a joke, a horrible thing to do. As I said, blatant sociopathy and Satanism.

                        Now you are confusing "things that are in bad taste" with satanism....Do you think wearing white after labor day honors the lord of darkness?
