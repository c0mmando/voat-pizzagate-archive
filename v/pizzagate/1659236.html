            Australia is possibly more dark than the states. This country is sick and has been for decades, many of our politicians are notorious pedophiles, in order to make it here whatsoever you have to be part of the VIP pedo ring that rules our society

             I am fro Australia and I read that Australia happens to be world pedophile haven. In 2013 I took a trip
from Sydney to Perth by train, took me 3.5 days. Literally hundreds of square miles of nothingness. Can bury mountain of physical evidence.

            Its strange that none of the patrons when they hosted the clintons were allowed to leave? Also the owner died the same year as the clintons visit? Also as you say, no phones no nothing?
