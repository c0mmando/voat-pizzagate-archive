<p>It turns out that Jeff Koons is more to Alefantis than an artist he admires. To begin with, Koons is very involved with the DC/East Coast art scene.</p>
<p>Here on page 10 both Alefantis and Koons are mentioned as being involved in the DC art scene for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=9965&amp;p=12">http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=9965&amp;p=12</a></p>
<p>But none of these circumstantial bits of evidence are as important as the discovery that Correct the Record paid Jeff Koons $50,000 according to their SEC filing, seen here on page 9:</p>

<p>Correct the Record is run by David Brock, who is in a relationship with James Alefantis. Here is a link confirming this and showing them caught up with another individual in some kind of blackmail love triangle:</p>

<p>50 years ago, the museum of Modern Art decided to spread “cultural diplomacy” by establishing a program whereby artworks could be spread around the world through American embassies. This matches similar exchange programs by the UK (GAC) and France (Foundation Pompidou, French-American Foundation). Hillary Clinton wrote an article for Vanity Fair 1 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the program. Here are some of them posing for a photo. 2</p>

<p>The M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu 1, are in FAPE (Pictured: Diana NegroponteJ 2). Also, the M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu, linked him to a Cambodian location. This is another connection to the D.C. ring that few are seeing but is right out in the open. This is another connection to the D.C. ring that few are seeing but is right out in the open</p>

<p>Given that not enough attention is being paid to images of prepubescent girls exposing themselves in the unsealed Epstein evidence, Maxwell\'s  ability to provide travel documents for much younger girls from places like Thailand, and how NXIVM reporting completely left out the girls as young as 8 posing for naked pictures, I think it is important to stay on this suspicious group of people who have encircled the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>
<p>Also, the painter\'s claim that she didn\'t know where her painting ended up also seems suspicious, since she is connected to these people right at the time all of this illegal activity was at a fever pitch.</p>',

            "The M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu 1, are in FAPE (Pictured: Diana NegroponteJ 2). Also, the M.I.T. Negropontes, tied to allegations of pedophila/Epstein Island by Japanese journalist Yoichi Shimatsu, linked him to a Cambodian location. This is another connection to the D.C. ring that few are seeing but is right out in the open. This is another connection to the D.C. ring that few are seeing but is right out in the open." That picture deserves, at least, a bold character left to right, top to bottom name explanation. Pretty cozy. Pixels are to bad to recognize that symbolic jewelry piece around Nancy's neck. Got a better link?

            Anybody ever look into the guy who made hundreds of millions painting a mural for FB because he was so smart he took share.  Likely story.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 2005, David Choe was approached by the media startup Facebook. Facebook had just moved up the office space ladder and commissioned Choe to paint a large mural at their new headquarters. For his time and effort they wanted to pay him $60.000. Choe, however opted that he’d rather have 3.7 million in shares of the company instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Facebook enlisted at the stock exchange the shares were valued at $56 each. And so David Choe who had been homeless for several months of his life became the richest street artist there is thanks to his nose for business. There is no one else than him that deserves it more.
           </p>
           <p>
            One last remark, David Choes didn’t just sit on the money; instead he worked, moderated, painted, filmed and documented to earn even more money."
           </p>
           <p>
            3.6m shares would have gone well over 600m us anyway you look at it.  Another Money Laundering op?

                                         You asked me what you should have asked yourself.  You write like an overemotional woman; addressing that isn't some kind of faux pas, despite you thinking it is.

                                         Yes they are, and you don't like that I know that.  If they weren't hurt, you wouldn't have asked those dripping-in-emotion questions in the first place.  You (maybe if you weren't retarded) could have used your mind to suss out alternative possibilities than the one you assumed, which was that I have contempt for all PG researchers and everything they do.

                                         You presented many questions, so referencing one out of them where I'm supposed to either accept or reject this claim is dishonest.

                                           I don't believe this for a second; why was my motive important to you?

                                            I had thought of alternatives, I asked because as you pointed out, the answer is in your mind.

                                           "What do you mean by this?" would have been a question suggesting you had thought of other possibilities.  Yours was an emotional reaction to one.  You're basic.

                                            I did not accuse you of those things, not once. Yet you go to that level every time.

                                  You've never presented a single bit of evidence for your own claims against me.

                                 No need. You commit your crimes in broad daylight every day. Everytime you target somebody for intimidation it backfires on you. You are just not smart enough to see it, and thats a good thing :) You still have not provided that "anti pizzagate" evidence either. You can find plenty of anti Qshitanon stuff from me, but not anti pizzagate, which is your main claim.

                                 Practically allllll my posting history is pizzagate too. (ESO just did that to get in people's good graces) roflmao

                                 You don't even understand what an asshole that makes you look like to Voat, and that is also a good thing :) You also took two words from Putt, "wild west" and went blind stupid with those two words and showed everybody what you truly are. Why you think people hate you so much? Lost your friends and people that had an ounce of respect for you, except that tiny less than a hand full that follow you around.

                                           is a good person. Why would he want to intimidate a person like Carmencita? Because he can. Its that simple. I bet he kicks puppies too because he is that sort of person. Fuck him.

                                              Both women spent more than a year pushing, and/or falling for every single liberal khazarian lie. At least carm appears to be truly waking up, the thotfull-one just keeps pushing lie after lie, jew after jew ewetoob stars. Starting drama and causing fights, which of course she needs to be the center attraction of.

                                                 She posted this over at Poal. Very classy. (not) Is some mental illness up in here somewhere. Guaranteed. I never seen anybody get on the internet, dox themselves, and start so much fake victim shit. Its actually sort of scary. Can I imagine being married to that? NOPE!
