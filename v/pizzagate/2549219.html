The 57-year-old Johannesburg, South Africa, man was found guilty May 3, a conviction that came after nine years of delayed efforts and complications. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Pretoria, in a joint effort with the Department of Justice International Affairs and the South African National Prosecution Authority, was instrumental in the investigation that led to the initial arrest.</p>
<p>Not only was HSI key to the arrest and prosecution of De Vries, but the agents involved set precedence for the future testimony of U.S. agents in South African courts.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, De Vries had been involved in child pornography for nearly 20 years, operating his business out of his home under an Internet alias. In April 2009, however, De Vries sold material to an undercover agent with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The agent testified via desktop video conference (DVC) from the South African Embassy in Washington D.C., having to first prove to the court that he was present in the South African Embassy. The undercover agent was required to be alone with a South African Consular Officer without possession of any reference materials. The agent was sworn in by the Consular Officer and then again by the judge in South Africa.</p>
<p>The DVC was orchestrated by HSI Pretoria Foreign Service National Investigator Johan Claassen using five Google Hangout accounts allowing the judge, prosecutor, defense, the U.S. witness, as well as the public to monitor the proceedings.</p>
<p>“Though technology was used by the defendant to do harm, advanced technologies were instrumental in bringing him to justice,” said Regional Attaché Steve Martin.
Claassen was initially alerted by U.S. authorities to the online activity and subsequently passed the information on to the South African police. During a 2010 raid, law enforcement officials found nearly 300,000 pieces of child pornography ranging from films, photos cartoons and short sexual stories.</p>
<p>U.S. officials initially wanted De Vries extradited, however, the extradition was averted by the National Prosecuting Authority’s move to charge and prosecute him in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>After years of investigations, De Vries was indicted in 2017. He was found guilty of 23 counts of unlawful possession of child pornography, 42 counts of creating child pornography, 21 counts of unlawful importation and procurement of pornographic material, and 21 counts of distribution of child pornography. Images of approximately 130,000 individual children were identified.</p>
<p>HSI encourages the public to report suspected child predators and any suspicious activity through its toll-free Tip Line at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE or by completing its online tip form. Both are staffed around the clock by investigators. From outside the U.S. and Canada, callers should dial 802-872-6199. Hearing impaired users can call TTY 802-872-6196.</p>
<p>Suspected child sexual exploitation or missing children may be reported to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, an Operation Predator partner, via its toll-free 24-hour hotline, 1-800-THE-LOST.</p>
<p>For additional information about wanted suspected child predators, download HSI’s Operation Predator smartphone app or visit the online suspect alerts page. HSI is a founding member of the Virtual Global Taskforce, an international alliance of law enforcement agencies and private industry sector partners working together to prevent and deter online child sexual abuse.&quot;</p>

             Whts the suprise..?!!!
All countries under UN are legal pirate corporations and their sub agencies ..includi g ur registered name that u loan to them via the SSN Acount ..
Google : UN legal research doctrine of discovery
The papal bulls known as doctrine of discovery are the basis of international law ..especially the papal bull dum diversas .
Utube : dum diversas papal slip of enslavement
            </p>
            <p>
             When u loan ur labour and name to the banking system u are supporting the increase of debt ..ie u trade as enemy of ur estate and thereby the State has licence to treat u as a ward ..irresponsible ..and are obliged to have oversight over ur increase of debt..
Hence the symbol..of trinity and the all seeing eye ..
            </p>
            <p>
             When u reduce debt at the US war corporation via its treasury ..you show that u dont need oversigght and cease to be enemy of the state that funds the war declared under papal bull dum diversas ..

             Rome has right to administer .as a trustee .until u act
Different.a..and reduce the debt via ur trust name ..then they become subservient trustee to the heir of the name created for u at berth ..which is secular baptism..
            </p>
            <p>
             I dont think anyone here comprehends this..they think freemason of the royal bloodline of the theives of this covenant made out to u ...is gonna free them

               Its ur trust accou t ..u r the trustee...it is used by you to setoff the cost ..not the principal..of using fed notes...
U can always get out of using this trust for incrrasing the debt ...and use it to decrease debt at the US treasury.
Imagine its like a knife..its upto to u how u want to use the knife...we have been given free choice..the only thing is. They have programmed us from a child to remai. Thinking like a child..we r wards of the state ..ie child of the estate crrated for us..and US
We are not taught that we have a choice of reducing debt ..
The first lesson we learn and is repeated at school is that we associate our selves with the name ..
When it is a trust that bonds rome to us..
Google : what is namium
It is actually a bond ..created by Rome bonding itself to.take care of us ...sonit has value for us..mthey then trick us via school system and tv ptogramming ...to lend this value to the banking system which runs the war side of rome...
..we lend the collective programmed AI system so that it can run the war based on us lendi g credit via the SSN ..name 
The SSN ..social security ..means security ie ..surety of society..the society here means the law society..ie the templars in london..who run the crusades..they have legal title over the name ..untill ee declare peace..ie reduce debt ..and return back to KAnsas..
Till then we exist in this fictional war..of debt ..in a land of colour under colour of law..ie OZ
