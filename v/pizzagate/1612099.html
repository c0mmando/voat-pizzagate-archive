           <p>
            My personal opinion. Here are my answers to your questions:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Nothing. We continue to dig and hunt down the witches that remain.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) I agree, around 500. We stuck around for various reasons: motivation, experience or knowledge, connection and the obvious common denominator: we give a shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) I am not expecting any recognition from the WH or any governmental establishment. I am not in this for the fame or the rewards. I am here to help the children that are being abused, tortured and killed on a daily basis. I honestly believe that the majority of Voaters feel the same way and it's the main reason why we're sticking around and coping with the occasional shill.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) All of us are connected to this investigation in some way or another. We're not all victims, nor all law enforcement officers or journalists, but we all certainly are either truth seekers or justice lovers. Possibly both.
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Without a doubt.
           </p>
           <p>
            To all of us who are persevering, from simple lurkers to committed investigators; keep up the great work and please don't give up on the children. We most probably are their only chance at salvation. God Bless you all.

            So many times I do posts or comments on things and wonder if anything but maybe an upvote or 2 will ever come of it or if there are people on here with actual power to do something with our info. I have always questioned everything and wear my tin foil hat proudly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mostly when I see the number of lurkers, I imagine someplace where there are people who read every word to make sure nothing ever turns up and goes anyplace. Kinda like r/ politics...used to be anything that wasn't fitting the down with Bernie and now down with Trump narrative would get downvoted to oblivion and I would get reprimanded in comments for being stupid etc but now they just bot remove everything or claim it's already posted and hope you don't notice the one post they take you to to show it's posted was also removed. I also find poor saps who don't know they are shadowbanned that way.

            This is more of a discussion, but it's good.
We should not want nor expect any credit.
We have made a difference because people use our research to create more popular media, which hundreds of thousands view.
Also, we have made a difference because we are pissing off interested parties.  If we can disrupt them, we have won.
The posts and attention have decreased for two reasons:
1.  Most obvious connections have been drawn until we get further data
2.  We have what I call the third wave of people who are genuinely just waking up and think that what they post is original.  Please search first using Google and the precedent "Voat" before posting
3.  We have been boarded by CTR and Soros folks who are deliberately posting crap posts.  People who value their time cannot stand to wade through the crap repetitive posts which I guesstimate have increased 500%.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Purple Revolution can wear their little selves out and spend CTR and Soros money in the interim.  But when things get serious again, I will kick their asses hard and hope that the mods point out double, triple posts within 24 hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one I know, even some with genius IQs, are willing to grasp this material.  They do not have any intuitive sense or abstract pattern recognition and further, have been so thoroughly indoctrinated by RightThink that they cannot be red pilled.  Yet.

            removing per rule 4: no discussion posts without sources.  this is necessary to weed out low-effort posts, and we have to enforce it on all posts, or we get accused of selective enforcement.  the rules are simple.  if you don't want your post removed, please just make sure it follows the rules.  thanks.

            I firmly believe we have made a difference on a number of different levels. I also think the number of active members does not necessarily reflect the growing number of people who are researching and digging. How many times has someone been digging and researching and connecting dots and come to post on v/ and find one or two have already posted the information so another thread isn't needed? Likewise how many read what is posted and continue deeper and add to threads but they don't go back to the  top? More recently I also find I am using the "search" function more and have some info to add to threads that were current 2-4 weeks ago. I  just recently remembered some information about "hotdog stand in Hawaii" and haven't seen it mentioned. The leads i have may or may not (probably not?) connect to the investigation but I will probably go post on a different sub voat. Hint: Has to do with "Hotdog stand in Hawaii" ;-)

            I mostly lurk, but put in my 2 cents when I can, and I do have 2 connections in federal positions.  I have the utmost respect for everyone here who takes the time to dig into all these rabbit holes.  I do talk to friends and family about what you guys are finding, and although some think I am a crazy tin foil hat wearing conspiracy nut, I am always surprised to see quite a few know surface level what is going on.  I think the people that come here are on the next level though, so I really appreciate the hard work that is going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I would like to add that we (you guys) are absolutely making a difference.... look at how hard they are trying to discredit us!  "Fake news", CTR, false flags, etc.  TPTB have never tried this hard to make us "conspiracy nuts" look bad!  Think of all the other "conspiracies" out there... 9/11, fake birth certificate, JFK, etc.  If it wasn't true or getting close to making it to the mainstream, they would be fighting it so hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep up the hard work, I think we are really getting close.  This will absolutely change the course of history, and I know I want to be on the right side when the SHTF!!

            I know of at least 10 people in real life who are heavily researching. I post in here every day. A lot of my posts get deleted by the moderators. I have a group on Facebook with 500 plus members and there are several others I am in that have thousands of members. If this weren't a big story it wouldn't have made international news on Infowars, Twitter, or Megyn Kelly. The fact that they had to do a false flag is enough evidence for me that there are a ton of people who know about it. Over 60 million people voted against Hillary Clinton for reasons other than just the David Brock reasons (we're racist, we're anti PC and we're pro-life). We voted against her because she's a criminal child abusing witch.

            This shit changes who you are. It forces you to accept the possibility that anything is possible. Considering folks today love rage and blame, that's not too difficult. The difficult part is rising above the negativity to embrace who we really are before we destroy what we have left.
           </p>

            Fun fact: the Schuman resonance (Earth's heartbeat) is usually around 7.83 hz. This is referred to by some as "Om". Great frequency for meditation, cerebral blood flow, healthy circadian rythm, calm alertness. The good stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the last while we have been resonating as high as 16 hz. Apparently (and for perspective) this makes a 24 hour period feel more like 16 hours. Imagine the other effects it would have.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is, are we simply feeling the effects of this, or are we the cause?
           </p>
           <p>
            A difference is being made even by the fact that those contributing here are breaking their training to ignore thy neighbor and ask Google. We all have a piece of the puzzle, we just forgot we could compare notes. That alone puts us on a different path than the shit hole we were headed to.

            Ok, as I've been lurking from the beginning, I just need to ask... What are you all doing for support? None of my family or friends believe me and think I'm losing the plot. As does my bf. Is there a support board or something?

             I have no support.  SturdyGuy(whom I adore) and I have had weekend long fights because of this stuff.  I have to zen and be sure he will awaken when it is time for him.  I have to do what I have to do.

             /pizzagatewhatever is the sub for support and really anything off the main topic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Otherwise, just get your support here. :) Now that your not lurking anymore, join in the conversation sometimes! That's always encouraging to me.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am thankful to have some open minded family (my mom is about as crazy as I am..) I can talk to and two somewhat open minded friends (who, granted, still know little about my pizzagate and other "conspiracy" beliefs. We mostly just talk about the dangers of vaccines together...). My husband has a long way to go...  Being ex-military, he's got a lot of brainwashing to push through. At least he quietly listens when I talk, even if he doesn't agree. :)
            </p>
            <p>
             I also get a lot of encouragement from studying the Bible. It really completes the big picture for me and reminds me that Jesus will come back and destroy all the evil once and for all some day.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there anything remotely "non mainstream" your bf believes? Start with common ground and slowly add new things relevant to what they already believe is self evident. I get a lot more headway with people when I start with our common beliefs and then add just a tiny bit of "red pill."
