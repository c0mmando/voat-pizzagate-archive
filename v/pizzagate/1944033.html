            Organized patriarchal religion -- male-supremacist religion begins with the Old Testament which was written to cement patriarchy, but is then succeeded by the New Testament and Christianity which continues on with a violent god and which has a long history of demonizing others in our society -- whether Jews, Women, Africans, Native Americans, or Homosexuals.
           </p>
           <p>
            As much as they try to bury history, it is clear that these religions those who demonize and oppress others....
           </p>
           <p>
            Read the "Hammer of Witches" and you will see that this vile propaganda by the Catholic Church is not very
much different from its thousand years of vile propaganda against Jews and Africans and Homosexuals.
           </p>

            Elite male patriarchy -- male-supremacist religion -- are those who have demonized so many and persecuted and murdered them.
Whether we are talking about women they burned at the stake as "witches" or children they have sexually abused, or Africans and
native Americans they issued Edicts on for them to be "enslaved or killed" ... it is clear that the violent among us are Elite patriarchs
and their desire for control and power over the rest of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Preachings of the RCC brought down intolerance and hatred on Jews, Women, Africans, Native Americans, Homosexuals ....
and the oppressions of these people by the RCC is clear throughout history -- whether we are talking about Jewish Ghettoes run by the RCC, or whether we are talking about the Enslavement and Genocide vs the Africans here and Native Americans whose land they took.
Most of us are still of the age when we can remember these preachings from RCC altars -- and there was even a time when the RCC preached that men should beat their wives -- but we can also remember the demonizing of homosexuals by the RCC which led to assault on homosexuals and even murder of homosexuals which we have seen in our lifetimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stand up and fight back against this attempt to demonize women, demonize Jews which is definitely going on here !!
           </p>
           <p>
            Our sexual abusers of children are males and they are heterosexual males -- and the Catholic Church has been guilty of that sexual abuse of children since the church began as Italians have made clear to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            The violence of this church was seen in the Crusades which set new precedents of violence and torture --
and in the Witch Hunts which is all part of the official records and history.
           </p>
           <p>
            The violence of this church is also seen in the Edicts they issued to legalize and bless "Enslavement and/or murder" against Africans brought here for exploitation -- as well as the Native Peoples (112 MILLION of them) where the Catholic Church also blessed their "Enslavement or murder" by Columbus.

             Witch Hunts -- Holocaust Without Equal
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Especially in the mountainous regions, many people still adhered to their ancient Goddess religion, guided by their priestesses. The Inquisition and the Dominicans concentrated on the Alps of northern Italy. This was the Ligurian region from which the Benedictines for many centuries had obtained their Saharan-speaking (Basque/Ligurian) grammarians who had been instrumental in creating the new languages of Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             To destroy the adherents to the Goddess religion, the use of torture had been officially authorized by Pope Innocent IV in 1252. The monks were to extract admissions of heresy, sorcery and witchcraft from the people, many of whom were the families of the grammarians. The witch craze in the Alps and southern Germany killed more people than in any other region.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Order of the Dominican Mendicant friars took the initiative in collecting ancient lore connected with the peoples’ belief in magic. When the time was right for the witch hunt to begin, some of this gathered hearsay was assembled into the "Malleus Maleficarum", the witch hunter’s handbook. The Dominicans trained and guided the judges of the Inquisition and wrote justifications why people should be so very cruelly put to death, in spite of the commandment: "Thou shalt not kill".
            </p>
            <p>
             They laid the entire blame for the existence of witches on the pre-Christian Goddess religion although the witches and their aquelarres had been a total fabrication of the church of Rome. But it was a fabrication which served a very specific purpose: the elimination of the last pockets of the adherents to the Goddess religion, the Gnostic heretics and of the ancient language of the Goddess which many still spoke; it was to be the final cleanup of Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             They succeeded everywhere except in Euskadi, where the Basque language is still spoken to this day.

           <p>
            Think about it -- Nature put her absolute trust in women and gave everything to do with children as a responsibility of females -- not males.
Males took power and control by violence and have turned the world upside down.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Witch Hunts were against women who at that time controlled medicine, knowledge of our natural PLANTS which are our nutrition, medicines and drugs.
After the Crusades, with so many males dead, women began to inherit the household wealth which further angered patriarchy and the Witch Hunts began.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has never been a "devil" or "Satan" or "Hell"  in the Old World Religions which were based in Nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Devil" and "Satan" were created by male-supremacist religions many thousands of years later and reflect only the delusions and fears of males, their paranoia and need for boogey men.  It is with those fake boogey men and fake visions of Hell that males increased their power over society with organized patriarchy religion.  The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Women were our natural healers and protectors of children -- and prevented sexual abuse of children.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, MALES are our sexual abusers of children -- and they are HETEROSEXUAL males according to studies.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is males who are the violent among us.  Males who are our sexual abusers of children.
And males who are the violent among us.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone wants more info on the study, just let me know.  I've posted it previously but will do so again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall also that it is women who had the knowledge of our plants, our medicines, our nutrition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women were also the spiritual leaders which is why male priests still today wear dresses.

             They might have been - but this still sounds a bit silly. Women need semen. Minds are equal. Will needs to be strong, and by natural biological differences, men are "more capable" of fucked up things.

              Do you want more information on the study"
Heterosexual Males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are not actually thinking.  Males, when they began to domesticate animals, quickly begin to understand that you only need one live male to impregnate a whole flock of ewes.  This immediately made them more fearful than they even usually are.
Women do not need semen.  Our fertility clinics probably have enough semen on hand for the next trillion years if there were no longer any males around.  And that frightens the hell out of men.
             </p>
             <p>
              Minds are not equal.  Just look at the mess men have made of the world.
They have given us only wars, violence and suffering of humanity.
Global Warming is the result of capitalism which is suicidal and which has 
the potential to end all life on the planet -- even the cause the planet itself to fall.
             </p>
             <p>
              When men took control through violence they turned the world upside down -- 
Just reverse everything you've ever been told about men and women.
             </p>
             <h1>
              1 males are the weaker sex -- until the age of two they die more frequently than females.
             </h1>
             <p>
              They die earlier.
             </p>
             <p>
              Men are physically stronger when we consider that women are now only 20% of the size of males whereas in earlier times men and women were the same size.  They existed shoulder to shoulder.
              <br/>
              As we can see in all physical efforts, when restrictions on women and sports were lifted, women are coming close to challenging males in competition -- from racing to many other sports.

             <p>
              Mentally ... women are our scholars.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I'm sure you're aware, since women have been permitted entrance into our colleges and universities which happened not that long ago, they out perform males not only in qualifying for college entry, but in scholarship.

              Think it like this - how many percentages of animal - rapes or kills are done by male? When talking about animals, things like feelings or karma doesnt occur, but its still mad close how we as humans act, at least statisticly.

               First, the animal kingdom does not fight within species (as human males do) to the death.
You will recall that they will push one another around a bit -- charge one another -- but they do not kill one another.
              </p>
              <p>
               SECONDLY, one half of the animal kingdom of any species is NOT at war with the female half of the species as human males are.
              </p>
              <p>
               From my readings of Reincarnation -- which at one time was taught by all the worlds Major religions -- you may come back many more than 100 times into a new life -- perhaps a thousand times?
              </p>
              <p>
               And, if you are now male, you  will likely come back as a female.  (Lucky you!)  :)
              </p>
              <p>
               The teaching of Reincarnation was ended when it became "inconvenient for Elites/wealthy."

            All of our history books have been altered. We are not told the truth. Look back on events that happened in the past decade(s) and before and you will see you have a much different view of them now than in the past when they occurred. We are constantly being lied to. That is the only truth.

            Actually, the sympathizing with men and women accused of witchcraft is a more modern theme within schools and media which immediately makes it suspect of being inherently propaganda. Witchcraft was and is alive and well here as well as in Europe.  The puritans were not only fleeing religious persecution, but they didn't want those type of paganistic practices to follow them across the sea.  But, the puritans were not the only people who immigrated.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, Christians believe that Jesus sacrificed himself to end all sacrifices  Babylonians and those who didn't accept Jesus continued on with their sacrifices.  Those of the dark religions sacrificing to Moloch, Dogon, Baal, or Lucifer have been sacrificing children and innocents for eons.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            So the idea that witches burned at the stake in the 16th and 17th century were wholly innocent is quite naive.   Within schools we are insulated from the evil capabilities of the everyday man and instead are taught that specific groups at a particular time were evil.  Like Nazi Germany was just an anomaly of history.  However, Democide (death from your own country) and Genocide have occurred in nearly all nationalities and in nearly every region of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            All men and women are capable of enormous horror.  Why would those who call themselves witches be any different?  People are falsely accused all the time but it doesn't mean that every case was false.

            Many of the "witches" burned at the stake were actually Christians.

            The WITCHES WERE PASTORS AND RUNNING THE CHURCHES.  That should sound familiar.

             Lots of so called Christians in churches today are using it as a cover for their real religion.  Just ask Fiona Barnett.  In a Puritan society you were expected to belong to the church and to go to church.  So, if you were a pagan that didn't want to be exposed, you would go to church like a good Christian but then hold your rituals under a full moon in the woods the next day.  Just adding to what you wrote.

            It  did happen before.    I ran across it in   History of Germany.  It was for about 200 years that they would burn these people alive.    One account was of a woman boiling a child.  She was found and executed.      It was in the 1600 &amp; 1700's.   I believe it spilled into the Amer Colonies to include the Salem witch trials

            Am putting this in here without references b/c the mods will prob take your post down anyway. They are certainly helping in the cover up.   I had a pizzagate related question for the group and it was taken down.

             You dudes are really something with this trickass b.s. Always trying to link the Communists with every negative thing that comes up. Like jesusians always have to be propagandizing on every discussion. Tell me who has given more blood and treasure to end all the kinds of conditions that breed and succors these atrocities than the Commies?
By the way the CPUSSAY is not a Communist organisation.
It's just another arm of the abortion industry.
Mccarthisam links to the rape murder and torture of children.,.how?
            </p>
            <p>
             The rest of the world actually have CPs in their governments. The land of the free is still shooting them down the streets by the dozens every time they try to excersize their right to peaceful assembly
Why?
Because they know thatz the only threat to their power.
Everything else is just yap and praying
