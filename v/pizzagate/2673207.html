<p>When charity money comes in but doesn\'t go out as represented: </p>
<p>In 1985 &quot;The spending of money collected for Ethiopian famine victims has become the center of a dispute involving Catholic Relief Services, the largest private charity operating in Ethiopia.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/07/world/catholic-relief-services-involved-in-dispute-over-spending-of-ethiopia-aid.html">https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/07/world/catholic-relief-services-involved-in-dispute-over-spending-of-ethiopia-aid.html</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who have raised the complaints include three former employees, Mr. MacGuire, who is a former Peace Corps worker and Catholic Relief Services representative in Burundi, and who is now director of corporate development for Macmillan Inc.; Peter P. Strzok, a former Army Corps of Engineers officer who served with the Catholic agency in Africa and Haiti, and Jean Serge Picard, who served in Zaire and Burundi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... former employee, Mr. Strzok, recently wrote the agency that while he served in Upper Volta, now Burkina Faso, he was told to use money from aid recipients to meet overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also interviewed was Norbert Clement, who worked for the relief agency for 25 years in Rwanda, Ethiopia and Haiti. He is still an employee of the agency but is on leave.</p>
<p>Catholic Relief Services was founded in 1943 and, with an annual budget of $430 million, has operations in 70 countries.
Agency officials said last week that while little of the $50 million in donations had been spent so far, the service had still aided 1.8 million Ethiopian famine victims. $22 Million \'Allocated\'</p>
<p>William Schaufele, director of the relief services\' African operations, said $8,141,000 had been spent so far and $22,890,000 had been \'\'allocated\'\' to Ethiopian projects and would be spent by the end of next year. The remaining $20 million, the agency previously announced, will finance long-term development projects in the rest of Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. Pezzullo said the agency had decided that apart from Ethiopia \'\'there are 17 more problem countries\'\' in Africa. Asked whether the money had been deposited in a bank, he said it had and added: \'\'What the money is doing now is irrelevant. The important thing is it will be spent over the next 10 to 15 years.\'\'</p>
