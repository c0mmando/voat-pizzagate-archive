            Ha... well assuming Joel sees this, at least there is one good thing to come out of the thread. We all know he lives next door to an FBI agent so he should be relatively safe as should my children. 
So "thanks" for posting his address to Voat, whoever did that - maybe you can leave him alone and if anything happens to him or my kids, this will be the first place that we come to look and see who these fake profiles belong to. 
I don't believe suedfordefamation is a real profile... nobody gets sued for defamation for investigating Joel Philo. He's a virtual nobody and he only wants to harass me because I am his ex wife. Most likely he's been played by someone sending him information and he's too damn stupid to figure that out. 
But thank you for revealing to me that he makes between 200 and 250k per year. That explains how he got the assets he did since our divorce because that was making no sense before.

            Well, pardon me for playing Devil's Advocate here, but if the Pizzagater whom this guy (Joel Philo) allegedly is stalking is Joel's ex- or estranged wife, then there may just be more to this story.   I would be very hesitant to dox the guy or harass him, in any way, because if this originated with the ex then it could be part of a larger scheme, on the part of the ex, to gain the upper hand in a custody and/or spousal support action.  This could be retaliatory, in other words.  Seems to me that this guy's ex is on a rampage to bring him down, because she's tweeting things that could be defamatory if untrue.  See her Twitter account:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/937493714607407105">
             https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/937493714607407105
            </a>
            , on which she posted real nasty tweets about the guy today.
           </p>
           <p>
            While you're at it, Google her videos.  I seriously question her stability, in general, based on what I've seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally I'm all in for researching bad guys, but obviously there's a domestic situation unfolding which may be behind the claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore, in light of these unstated (i.e., omitted) complications, I'm sitting this out and I'd advise all y'all to do the same. . . .

             Joel is harassing and stalking me for sure, but I am not sure it's for Pizzagate. I don't know. I want whoever it is to stop. Most likely the pedos are trying to hack into his stuff and use him to frame him for their own stalking. Most of it is more likely to be Doyle Mills from Scientology or perhaps Greg Chism and his pedo ring. Yes Joel raped me in 2011 and during our marriage did other sexually deviant things to me, but there are other people harassing me besides just him. And as to your comment that I am unstable, hopefully you will retract that but I honestly do not care what you do since you're obviously either his wife or his attorney or someone working for the pedos to discredit my investigations. I am not the first investigative journalist to have been abused domestically by far.

             Oh I'm not going on any witch hunt myself, my take away from this is what I quoted in my other reply.

            <p>
             There are ways of doing this which don't require inappropriate behavior on our part. Indeed, one of the goals of threats of harm and etc, is to push us into doing something senseless such as go on a witch hunt.

             how about you guys focus on Greg Chism and let me handle Joel myself. As far as I know if he is doing any of this it's as a joke and to do what the person above tried to imply that I am somehow unstable for suffering from his abuses.
