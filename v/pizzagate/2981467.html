Pantomiming Intercourse </p>
<p>The educators\' notes indicate that they placed a very strong emphasis on sex education. Almost every day, the students played games that involved taking off their clothes, reading porno magazines together and pantomiming intercourse.</p>

<p>Besser paid a visit to the Psychology Institute in Berlin\'s Dahlem neighborhood, &quot;to take a look at the place,&quot; as she says. In the basement, Besser found two rooms that were separated by a large, one-way mirror. There was a mattress in one of the rooms, as well as a sink on the wall and a row of colorful washcloths hanging next to it. When asked, an institute employee told Besser that the basement was used as an &quot;observation station&quot; to study sexual behavior in children.</p>
<p>It has since faded into obscurity, but the members of the 1968 movement and their successors were caught up in a strange obsession about childhood sexuality. It is a chapter of the movement\'s history which is never mentioned in the more glowing accounts of the era. On this issue, the veterans of the late \'60s student movement seem to have succumbed to acute amnesia; an analysis of this aspect of the student revolution would certainly be worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article is 3 pages, a lot of very disturbing info which shows that there is political pedophilia as a means to a Marxist end game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The left has its own history of abuse, and it is more complicated than it would seem at first glance. When leaders of the student movement of the late 1960s are asked about it, they offer hesitant or evasive answers. &quot;At the core of the movement of 1968, there was in fact a lack of respect for the necessary boundaries between children and adults. The extent to which this endangerment led to abuse cases is unclear,&quot; Wolfgang Kraushaar, a political scientist and chronicler of the movement, writes in retrospect.</p>
<p>A lack of respect for boundaries is putting it mildly. One could also say that the boundaries were violently torn open.</p>
<p>Sexual liberation was at the top of the agenda of the young revolutionaries who, in 1967, began turning society upside down. The control of sexual desire was seen as an instrument of domination, which bourgeois society used to uphold its power. Everything that the innovators perceived as wrong and harmful has its origins in this concept: man\'s aggression, greed and desire to own things, as well as his willingness to submit to authority. The student radicals believed that only those who liberated themselves from sexual repression could be truly free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then came the idea of starting this process of this so called \'liberation\', from birth.  The belief that adults should be teaching babies to masturbate and the education system should be teaching children to masturbate (look up Jocelyn Elders).  
</p>
<p>We now can make sense of the mindset of leftists making jokes about raping babies, calling babies \'hoes\' and so on.  Or the comment of  then 22 year old pedophile Joel Davis <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?q=joel+davis&amp;sub=pizzagate&amp;s=pizzagate">(links)</a> being attracted to anyone from age 0 and up.  To the radical Left, this mentality <em>is</em> politically correct position to take! Which is probably why Joel Davis was so attractive an up and coming future leader for the UN.</p>',

             And our country isn't far behind by the looks of it.  There was something bugging me about the whole Desmond/Wendylou/Alig on one side with the odd man out dad in same group, the former skinhead, from lower eastside Brooklyn, I believe.  Among Michael Alig paintings he does a series of pink swastikas with a Disney character in front.  One has a really mean looking Mickey Mouse face.  Michael had a nick name 'Mickey' I'm pretty sure, don't have source offhand.  The reason I bring this up here is I just found this:
             <a href="http://lust-for-life.org/Lust-For-Life/PinkSwastika/PinkSwastika.htm">
              http://lust-for-life.org/Lust-For-Life/PinkSwastika/PinkSwastika.htm

            </p>
            <p>
             hmmmm….
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know if you heard of the Death Mask murder but it involved an well connected elite art Gallary owner, the son of a UN executive in a brutal sexual sm murder, and a gay modal from Norway. The Gallary owner had been molested when young, became a gay prostitute (even had Liberace as a customer so they say).  It's believed he may have thrown someone out a window once too.  Anyway, one of the reasons I think that Peter Gatien (owner of Limelight chain of clubs) hired the two Michaels, (Alig and Freeze), was to help with the fallout of bad PR  after that murder happened, by staging outrageous parties with the Club Kids (the murderers had tried to lure his own manager out to a private party and would likely have been the victim had he gone, instead the young model from Norway was killed).  The victim, had been picked up in the area of NY where S&amp;M prostitutes hung out.
            </p>
            <p>
             On one of the Geraldo show Club Kids episode (he did several) Alig's costume is fairly bland, the most remarkable part of it is bruises on his neck and body (makeup).  When Geraldo asks about the 'look' Alig said 'maybe I'm just bored'.  But one wonders about the gay S&amp;M underground in NY at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reading the link I gave you goes through homosexual Nazi history, and there are some brutal SM icons like homosexual and murderer Gerhard Rossbach.  Just wondering,  what exactly did we import from Germany post WWII?

               I haven't read all of the pink swastika book/article, but I got as far as the sheer hatred between groups of gays, one effeminate/drag queens, the other thinking they were the ideal male warriors.  I believe they just as soon kill the drag queens, they detested them that much.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The Pink Swastika documents a hidden aspect of German history. The authors contend that homosexualism, elevated to a popular ideology and combined with black occult forces, not only gave birth to Nazi imperialism but also led to the Holocaust itself. The militarists in Germany were happy with Hitler. His teachings on "total war" and of a secret Jewish conspiracy against Germany provided a good screen for their own veiled preparations. From its very inception, it was the goal of the Nazi Party, working as a front for the German military industrial complex, to overthrow the Weimar Republic by whatever means necessary. The Pink Swastika documents how, from their beginning, the National Socialist revolution and the Nazi Party were animated and dominated by militaristic homosexuals, pederasts, pornographers and sado-masochists.

                ...Roehm, as the head of 2,500,000 Storm Troops had surrounded himself with a staff of perverts. His chiefs, men of rank of Gruppenfuehrer or Obergruppenfuehrer, commanding units of several hundred thousand Storm Troopers, were almost without exception homosexuals. Indeed, unless a Storm Troop officer were homosexual he had no chance of advancement". [Knickerbocker:55]

             This
            </a>
            is an account written by the daughter of German left wing author (owner &amp; editor of Konkrete, far left publication, which promoted paedophilia) Klau Rohl,  Anja Rohl in which she talks about her paedophile father:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One of the most important men to openly defend paedophilia was a member of my family: his name was Klaus Rainer Röhl, and he was my father. He’s still alive, but the words “He is my father” will never cross my lips.
When I was still little, long before I reached puberty, he was always telling me what sensuous and erotic skin children have, “completely different from women who are older than thirteen.” He only found children younger than thirteen attractive, in any case. He laughed about this and tried to have his fun with me. He “slapped” me on my cheeks. He even seemingly accidentally “slapped” (that’s what he called these blows) my thighs – both of them, usually until I could no longer bear the pain – until I specifically told him, “Stop, daddy, that hurts.” His answer to this was that I shouldn’t make such a fuss: “a German girl” doesn’t cry.
            </p>
            <p>
             He told me early on that he had found me erotic on the diaper changing table, and frequently discussed with me his theory that it is better for young girls to be deflowered by older, experienced men, as younger men were, for the most part, too inexperienced.
            </p>
            <p>
             The idea of concepts such as erotic, deflowering, sensuous, etc. being discussed openly and in detail with children may seem peculiar, but that is really part of the game through which we children were ensnared, so that we didn’t see what was happening as being at all out of the ordinary.
            </p>
            <p>
             After I turned eleven, he often showed me large numbers of erotic photos, some of which he would select for the magazine konkret,[1] explaining to me that the most important thing was that the girls look innocent and coy. That’s what the readers liked best.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even then, the most important criteria for him was youthfulness. I got to have “my say” about which of them was the “most sensuous,” although it goes without saying that none of them could ever compete with girls younger than thirteen ...
            </p>
            <p>
             When I was fourteen years old, he openly began a relationship with a sixteen-year-old in my presence, although at the time he had a steady girlfriend in Cologne and two other casual relationships in Hamburg.
            </p>
            <p>
             My father often spoke of women as “sluts” or “whores.”
            </p>
            <p>
             When I was five, I went with my father on a fourteen-day winter vacation in Rottach-Egern. During the holiday, we shared a double bed in a hotel room. ...  he would call me “his only woman” and “his beloved and the only one he had left,” eliciting feelings of intense pity on my part. Under the pretext of taking an afternoon nap, he asked me to get into our large bed. When I was almost asleep, he pushed against me from behind and I felt something hard, while he embraced me and moaned … when I was older, I realized that he had masturbated on my body, while desperately trying to hide this fact by crying.
            </p>
            <p>
             My father, as he frequently stated in front of witnesses, acted on the assumption that girls wanted to seduce their fathers and were perfectly aware of the desires they were provoking. He called girls between the ages of five and twelve “little Lolitas” and described them as “coquettes” and “coy.” I heard him say that sort of thing about a twelve-year-old, and he would often call my half-sister Bettina the “most sensuous baby that he had ever known.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The entire time, I was dying of fear and laid there frozen. Suddenly, his hands were under the blankets and he was taking possession of my still childlike body. At this point, without speaking – he was very quiet about it – he began to caress my barely developed breasts. He caressed my belly, my hips…
            </p>
            <p>
             The whole time I was in the grip of the most immense fear and was unable to move. Weighed down with shame at the time, I felt like I was experiencing something no one should ever have to go through. In my mind, I repeated over and over again, “This shouldn’t happen to anyone.” What he did didn’t hurt, but I didn’t want it to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the pretext of showing me what it was like to be kissed on the mouth, he approached me for the last time on a moonlit night on a pier when I was fourteen years old. He explained to me that to make it more exciting it was very important to begin by gradually opening your mouth. As he demonstrated, gently pushing his tongue into my mouth, I felt like a cold piece of iron was being screwed into my mouth and shuddered with revulsion and shame.
Later on, if I saw my father casually sitting with a small child on his lap – he often sat his girlfriends’ children on his lap and played horsey with them – I would gag.

There is only one way out ...taking out the credit owed to us as deposits...and reducing debt at the US treasury...
This will liquidate their system...that we fund ..

             The "invaders" in their home countrys are open pedos. As someone who has been to the middle east I can say this as a witness to how sick their so called culture is.  It is of interest bc they preach moral supremacist crap as a  way to justify their treatment of women, saying it is to protect them, but ask them about their view on pedo crap and they will lie to your face. Go to their countries and live for a while and you will see it openly flaunted in the streets.

            based on your comment (another thread) about child brides in muslim culture, it's ironic that the Leftist Marxist radicals sell child sex liberation via sexualization with adults as anything remoting liberating.
