            On the same day, five individuals were arrested in Bucks County, Pennsylvania as part of what authorities described as a fetish-themed child predator sex ring.

            After a brief search I saw that "authorities did not release the names of those arrested." And also, there were 13 police organizations involved. So, if you were to conduct a search, you would have to go to each agency and look for names of those who were booked, or to the courts where they would have their preliminary court date. Lot of work. Then, once you had the names, you'd have to research the social connections to each, either by names of those not arrested but linked by family or social circle. It might be workable to get a list going of all names of adoption agencies etc to cross-check when arrests are made, and this would include children's organizations, youth groups, etc etc etc

            I can say I'd definitely appreciate seeing a list like OP just described above. No point in deleting a post like this too. Just a request for exposing more and less hiding this from the public. The more attention we raise and show to people the more they will start to understand the correlations. Death to pedophiles.
