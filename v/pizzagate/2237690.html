            As far as Q Anon is concerned, we are all human and nobody has all the pieces of the puzzle. I have stumbled over some interesting pieces just now about Who Alice and Wonderland may be and what NK may represent/may be run by that blew my mind. Have a look.

            This lady is amazing. at 16:10 she reminds us of some not so ancient history and how communism was a known "cannibal cult". And in this one she gives great details on what Alice &amp; Wonderland really could mean. It's pretty compelling

            CIA is nothing more than old catholic spooks who either roped in younger people, or are now left working independently in small groups. Black FBI agents love to spot them, for fun. Especially the old Florida agents from Hollywoord/Dade/BrowardCounty. (later taking the mantle of baptist in northern florida).

            Some are still practicing masons, lost with where to go, and with whom to connect with. Any opsec they're running, is running solo, or they're hoping to connect via older signals. (rooftops, lighting, drops and props). some have been cut and are as lost as the rest. remember, their ranks are designed to hide truths, too.

            CIA has a hard time penetrating truly ethnic areas because the majority of agents were white catholics. a big reason jews used boroughs and ghettos for cover, and keep them as ghettos. who do you think sold the italians out? they had no choice but to become legit, corporate law is the only thing keeping things tidy among the catholics and jews. the christians are still stuck within the middle, often making it worse by forms of sublimation learned from previous incarnations of the religion itself. their being tricked too, if they actually consider themselves to be "jews". historians know we're much older, with

            no one on the civilian side knows what russia is up to or what their involvement is, other than continuing to protect itself from the same specter that haunts the world. the nationalist movements are real, but without factual news from the other side, or reliable sources that aren't juxtaposing information points, we still don't know who or what keeps moving the spotlight away from each shadow, and onto the nationalist movements.

            These pictures show a giant entrance going into the mountain directly under Epstein's Temple.
There is even a road leading to it.
I wonder how many levels could exist below that temple?

            One of the interesting things about this, is that the programs that are used to monitor Internet communications, do not look for questions. Allegedly whenever a large series of questions are asked, they have to pull analysts away from their work and have them do incident response and analyze this stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, this could be a lot of things: this could be black cube trying to distract the autists from digging into pedowood, this could be a series of leaks in the questions, this could be a larp, or this could be an counter intelligence operation to see what the autists know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another theory is that this is "crowdsourcing" by an intelligence outfit to utilize the autist collective to do research for them. More importantly if a channer steals or hacks and provides that evidence to the thread, it becomes state evidence without the need for a warrant.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not think q is legit, but i do not think it is a larp either. It is definitely some glow in the dark niggery.

             It could also be propaganda. Target the people you know will dig into the questions (all of which are loaded), and let them 'discover' the 'truth' for themselves. Let them spread the propaganda once they believe it. A repeat of what happened in Germany, somewhat.
            </p>

             Trump is alleged to like Nazi's and be a racist; some of the comments we've heard from him suggest he's xenophobic and prejudiced (he is better than poor people, men are better than women and have a right to do as they please if they're rich and famous, white nationalists aren't bad, immigrants are bad, Mexicans are rapists and whatnot).
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, we know only what we read online, and we never know the people posting, nor their motives for writing what they have us reading. Then there's that video showing politicians being manipulated via CGI. Do we know what we saw was real? Did we see him say this in person or via a TV/Computer. Is the media real? Trump says not; Trump supporters say not. That contradicts what we've always felt about the people giving us world news. Now we have to ask, do we believe everyone in media would stay quiet about fake news because they're blackmailed or intimidated by their bosses?
            </p>
            <p>
             To answer all of this we have to cut back to what we know of people, and how we behave as people. We have to project what we know of ourselves into those situations. If we were them, would we accept this? If we found out about this, would we stay silent? We are good, right? So surely not. You would then assume that more REGULAR people would be talking about how they've been roadblocked as journalists, or as FBI agents, CIA agents, police officers, judges, etc. We are all regular until we take those jobs, after all. Why do we take those jobs? Not for the money, but because we're good and believe we're helping others. If we then assume the majority of these people are good, would they do nothing? How would the few evil people in these organisations rise to the top (in order to control things) if the good people were in the majority? The odds seem stacked against all of this being true.

             I believe there are people in government who are corrupt. I believe they will collaborate, to some degree. I cannot believe the whole government is filled with paedophiles and homosexuals who are being blackmailed into corruption. Not every politician has a foundation; the corrupt ones seem to have them for money-laundering purposes.

             Logically, it makes sense that we have some bad eggs undermining everything, rather us all being slaves to a powerful cabal that influences who we are and how we think. They could control us from day one, as babies, to enter this world as slaves; teach us that slavery is good, and we'd never know the difference because we'd never have had freedom. If they were all corrupt and wanted to control everything, minimise the population and take all of the money, the whole world would be a totally different place.
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              We'd not be talking about any of this now. No freedom of speech. No way to communicate and share ideas en masse.
             </li>
             <li>
              We'd witness murder as an acceptable way to kill the populous (far easier than poisoning everyone secretly). Governments killing people for small crimes, with no courts of justice or an appeal process, just decision-makers handing down punishment.
             </li>
             <li>
              We'd see people being sterilised rather than being encouraged to use condoms and have abortions.
             </li>
             <li>
              We'd not have people acting in the shadows. They wouldn't need to, they'd be in total control and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Why would they bother going to such lengths to give us the illusion of freedom if from day one we are ignorant to what any of this is? We learn from other people, this elite cabal would be far better off just getting people to teach us to worship them and follow their rules; killing anyone who shows signs of questioning their authority or the status quo (which helps with the population control).
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Worth thinking about.

               I believe there are people in government who are corrupt. I believe they will collaborate, to some degree. I cannot believe the whole government is filled with paedophiles and homosexuals who are being blackmailed into corruption. Not every politician has a foundation; the corrupt ones seem to have them for money-laundering purposes.

              Unfortunately, there is historical precedence for this. The first head of homeland security, was a former kgb agent. Let that sink in. After the fall of the soviet union, he defected to the US.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why?
             </p>
             <p>
              He was a wanted man in Europe, He was known as the wolf, we did not know what he looked like, he was infamous for putting politicians in compromising positions, with whores, homosexuals, and children, and he would blackmail them into being pro soviet/ pro communist. This is partly why French politics is ok with mistresses. Too many people saw through the communist set up and said "fuck it, we are degenerate frogs, might as well enjoy consenting sex".
             </p>
             <p>
              Understand this: The first homeland security head positioned pedophiles into government positions in Europe because he could control them. They had no idea at 2001 that the Internet would be as invasive as it is, and knowledge of this could be found.
             </p>
             <p>
              As we dig deeper, and look at the communist influence in hollywood, suddenly the pedo allegations of the 80s start to click. I doubt he was the first person to think to do this. US media was used against the communists, so they needed a way to neutralize it, a good sex scandal would do it, only the soviet union collapsed before they could implement that strategy.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of our problems we experience today, are because we never bothered to clean up our messes left over from the cold war.

               I've seen arguments made that the CIA control all of this, and the Queen of England controls them, etc., etc. – we can make a case for anything based on facts none of us can prove, or more accurately, none of us can debunk because we don't have first-hand information. What I'd say is this:
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Even if the majority of the people in government – let's imagine 75% – were corrupt, there'd surely be enough who wouldn't accept any of this and would inform the public one way or another. If there's silence it means either the whole government (100%) is corrupt, or things happen in the shadows and certain parties in positions of power have the ability to make things disappear before anyone notices. It seems highly unlikely that paedo after paedo would be recruited into these agencies (which are designed to serve an important purpose). It's not a good recruitment method to find people with specialist skillsets (computer programming, preventing terrorism, etc.) if you're only hiring people you can blackmail for sex crimes; much like the casting couch is not the best way to find the best actor/actress for a show/movie.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 If the majority of society accepted this kind of abuse it'd not be illegal (officials would make it legal to do these things). If they can control what we do, in some way, they could pass whatever bills they wanted to make these things a reality. We see that now with the NRA and guns. They don't pass these bills because they can't (like the healthcare bill Trump is trying to get through).
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               These paedos operate in the shadows because there's not enough people who would find them acceptable – which is also why this material useful for blackmail. The elites have power and influence. Some are good, some are bad. Some will use their power/influence for nefarious purposes. It's kind of like guns; if you give someone the power over life and death, you can't be surprised when someone chooses death; but not everyone chooses death – in fact, most do not, even though they could. The fact these paedos seem to be running now would suggest that there's not enough of them to fight and win (famous directors throwing around money to make things disappear on social media, in the news, etc.), and they know they can't afford to get caught because they know there will be consequences. I think that speaks volumes. There's more good than bad, even if the bad has more power than the majority of the good people; and it's worth noting, the good people with power have the majority of people on their side. Let's see how it all plays out.

            Falcon deleted my first post for rule 2 and 3. Reposted and deleted for rule 4. That makes sense right? They've already divided and conquered here, splitting this forum into pizza whatever and whatever else. Now we are left with a forum without much activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Millenial falcon reminds me of Peter newsham. The DC police chief who charged an 11 year old girl of lying about getting raped when there was medical evidence of multiple seen samples in her underwear.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will continue to make posts like this, with other accounts if necessary, until he is removed. Feel free to join in. The same way we should demand Peter newsham be removed.

Its an anonymous person on 4chan and that is all it is right now. The money crowd is moving in the same direction it has always moved in with the finishings of the the middle east domination.

              I am the author of the “khazar bullshit” as you call it. Try studying history moron. I have an eyewitness and documentation from WW11 that will blow your mind and destroy every post you have ever made. In fact I have never been scene before videos as well. George Webb is not my source do your homework idiot. George Webb is filming the leads he is getting from insiders, whitehats, US Intel officers, law enforcement, FBI, justice department, military and others. You are making a fool of yourself and others have taken notice trust me....

              That is correct. They form a narrative controlling clique here on voat. It's a group of 4. They prop up George Webb, VictoryOfTheLight etc. This clique are inversion agents. Indeed you can see the inversion applied (multiple times) in his user-handle.
             </p>
             <p>
              Their purpose is to act like being with the good guys; while in essence, they are controlling and guiding the satanic hardcore's (deepstate's) Culling of the Outskirts. Meaning, Hillary, Podesta bros and a number of high-grade politicians and corporate moguls they want to be getting rid of before finalizing their New Satanic Order.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is all controlled. They (this clique) Jem777, Bopper, Jangles &amp; Dressage all fail to answer to the Question of Morality (see my posting history on VOAT). They simply refuse and beat their arses around the bush. Secondly, bopper peddles the Flat-Eerth delegitimizer psyop to polute with any real truthful leads into the Satanic cabal. Pushing flat-earth is a dead give-away. Alignment-synchronity between this clique affirms collective alignment of the group. On top op that, they have a number of minion followers that go "propup" mode when you agree with their main handlers listed atop; they go "drop" mode when you disagree with their main handlers.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a powerful psychological warfare technique to coerce victims into alignment with their narratives: "Prop &amp; Drop" through an army of minions.

               I have given you credit repeatedly for your research while others have dismissed you as ludicrous. When you postedcabout being attacked through directed energy weapons, bleeding profusely, who actively supported you? The shills discounted you. The so called “evil cabal” were the ones responding...to help.

                Then tell my why you are, through your post, setting the narrative for setting up Jews (Ashkenazis) versus Muslims? Why are Saoudi Arabia and Israel banding together on Iran through the Yemen proxy war? It wasn't until I friendly reminded you to the fact that Muslims are a tool of the Neo Roman empire (Vatican) that you affirment that as a "yeah that too you're right". You and your friend's narrative are geared towards setting up the clash of religions, just that what NWO wants.
               </p>
               <p>
                You can clear everyone's doubt by publicly stating your process marker: Serve self or serve whole. Which world would you choose to live in? A world of exclusive good, or the one of exclusive evil? Can you without scrupulous affirm positively? While the QoM poses a hypothesis, it will force one to state one's absolute goal along the evil/good axis.
               </p>
               <p>
                What you have been doing is what I call "Alignment Riding". Lifting on my absolute choice between good/evil to cover yourself in a shroud of good-alignment is a much preferred tactic by inversionists. It's entirely out of politeness that I have removed the names listed in my biography.
               </p>
               <p>
                Unless you can fully answer to the QoM you have no credibility. I am not the only one here on VOAT that has noted this controlled behavior. Other people do too, and those other people have a decent track record of positive good-alignment by nature of their presentation and content.
               </p>
               <p>
                Take away anyone's doubt. The means to do so is here.

                Your question of morality is as badly contructed as your reasoning behind it. Reconsider how you ask and what your motivations  for this question really are!

                By the way are you God I am just wondering since it appears you believe you have cornered the market on morality.

                 The QoM is perfectly constructed. It is completely devoid of any influence of any concrete religion. And as such, can be presented regardless of any religion (or not) a person may persue. The QoM forces one to expose one's alignment along the Absolute Duality rather than over artificial dualities like Religion A versus Religion B. Absolute Duality is a provable FACT.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Any Omni-dual religion speaks of this absolute duality. Because of this abstract, the absolute duality can be overlaid over any religion and is not a new religion on its own.

                  ,are not going to be able to construct a moral basis for any narrative you present. your claim that your qouestion of morality is , "devoid of any religion".  Keep believing you transcend space and time you feckless fool, your argument is weak and lack logical resolutions.   You sound like a kid with a superiority complex without much for emotional development.

                   No. There's no argument. The (moral) values of good and evil are pretty much universally defined by virtue of the sentient creatures we are, having the concept 'emotion'.

                   The QoM paints a choice. They are ideals. In daily live people follow either one choice, or they don't and are unguided (no goal as to moral alignment). Resolution is not needed. Your daily life fills out the analog resolution. The QoM just just forces someone to expose the DIRECTION on this analog scale. Easy stuff a 1st grader can understand. You're more than that right?

               Wow, I am impressed you think we are all of that shit you wrote.  I think what you have missed about the "evil four Cabal" is the level of intelligence that we use to sort the wheat from the chaff. You see, you are the chaff we like to see culled from this group.  You waste our time on your nonsense. Go sign up at CTR, I hear Brock is hiring these days, loser.

               Bopper isn't even into George Webb 🙄 If you want to go off on others then at least don't be a pussy. Ping them instead of talking about them behind their backs.

                  He peddles Flat-Earth consciously and willingly. That's enough of a differentiator. Especially when he has been given the means to conduct a simple experiment to prove the earth is not flat.

                    9/11 was an inside job yes. Engaged and executed by Zionism together with Wahabism (USA / Israel &amp; Saudi-Arabia).

                    Flat-earth can be debunked very easily. That has nothing to do with 'believing'. It's just oldschool science. Willful peddling and trying to convince people is not conducting science.

                      Yes. Plenty of CIA and Hollywood LARPing to create bull-shit videos. Alleging that the ISS is fake is a slap in the face of our own Dutch astronaut André Kuipers. Go

                     That's a matter of opinion. Not everyone trusts all science. Anyway, my point is who cares? It isn't making people not believe in pedogate. I read all kinds of whacked out views people have here. You shouldn't be so quick to make such judgments.

               What crawled up your ass and died? You are the one with issues. You're throwing a tantrum like a little bitch. I'm friends with Bopper. He's a sweet older Christian man. Yes he believes the earth is flat. Who gives a fuck? Many people believe in conspiracies here. You think it's a psyop? You must have bumped your head. You are the one that sounds nuts. He just went thru a horrible hurricane and had a major event happen in his life. He doesn't need little whiny ass bitches like you to bring him down. What's wrong with people around here today?! Go take your meds!

               Sin is any want of conformity to or transgression of the law of God. As summarized in the ten commandments. There you go. There's some good Dutch Reformed churches over your way now go visit one of them.

                  Na. I don't 'err'. It is a choice of modus of operandi as I just told you. Serve whole or serve self. Existence of evil is a given from our frames of reference. And between them (good / evil), you have a choice. What value set would be your choice as outlined in my previous post?

                   My allegiance to Lucifer? Are you nuts? I'm a reformed Christian. We are all fallen sinful creatures and we all follow self, ego, greed, by nature. Spiritual intervention is the only deliverance. You speak in riddles.

                    You have a choice. To sin or not to sin. We are not sinners by default. That is a fallacy that undermines good people. Together with moral, proper doctrine we can create a harmonious world for ourselves by virtue of choice, where within, you can give your own implementation to spiritual belief.

                    You can say you're Christian, but its your actions that speak louder than your words. I knew a former collegue that was all talk and has shown contrary action. Evil people hide under many religions. Rightful Christians will not peddle known falsehoods and try to dilute and deceive others. Actions &gt; words.

              I do my own research on the "jews." 90% of the "jews" we see around today came from the area of the Black and Caspian sea area from the Khazarian Kingdom and that is not in dispute among people that have done their research. They are not "God's chosen oy veys that got kicked out of the holy land."
             </p>
             <p>
              They are a peoples with a long history of mixing with the Talmud and Hebrew philosophy but they lie about their history so that people would not understand that even Ceasar wrote about their sorry asses that long ago as a bunch of perverted psychopathic thieves from the Black and Caspian sea area.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't give a damn if some of them did migrate from Canaan to the Black and Caspian seas and some of their families have some of the same bloodline their Canaanite ancestors had. That certainy does not speak well for them either. The Will Of Canaan is only found in one piece of literature that I know about and that is the Babylonian Talmud.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Never tell the truth, love lewdness, love robbery, hate your your masters."
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the origin of the Kil Nidre which is a prayer of forgiveness for all the lies and crimes they intend to commit against the goyim in the coming year. And this is why they say "even when a jew lies he is not lying." Because see, they already promised to lie, so when they lie they kept their promise to lie to the goyim, so in their mind they did not lie.
             </p>

              This is the sort of filth we are dealing with. They need to go.

             Red flags encircled by neon flashing signs... What also concerns me greatly is that at least twice he spoke about how martial law will happen, and it'll be necessary, and it'll be a good thing. No mention of when it would be lifted, however. Martial law will not be a good thing. Yes, there may be chaos and blood in the streets, but there will be that anyway, even without soldiers holding guns to our heads.

              There was martial law back in the late 60's in many cities
             </p>
             <p>
              Depending what side of town you lived in made the experience different
             </p>
             <p>
              No work, no shopping, I tell ya, the whole city shut down
             </p>
             <p>
              National Guard suited up and ready to shoot
             </p>
             <p>
              The only vehicle I saw on my side was a tank going down the major Street
             </p>
             <p>
              There was an Army Reserve about 2 miles up the road
             </p>
             <p>
              I was just a kid, but now as an adult, the consequences would affect everyone in ways you wouldn't think of

               Thank you for sharing that. Didn't know that happened. I had family members in another country who lived under martial law for a time. It got so bad that they'd have to sneak out in the dark to try to find fruit on trees for food. They had no electricity during that time either, and that meant no water. If they were spotted by the military (the US military, by the way-- I'll say that much) then they would be shot on sight.

               Kent State...let's not forget how wonderfully the national guard preformed there.  I was in college at the time and we were all in shock...they are killing the students???  Yes, it was not a 'good thing' by any stretch of the imagination/even tho my city was not under martial law.

                 Yes I know...but this Q thing has started a cult like mentality here.  On other alternate forums not so much/more skepticism or just plain ignoring.

                  My theory is that Voat has more recently red pilled normies than other places, with several "old souls" here who help guide the rest of us with reason and experience. Unfortunately, they're way outnumbered.

                   That makes a lot of sense and would explain the hype and cult like mentality.

              Could be taken both ways - she may turn out to have been less on the NWO side than we imagine. Looks like she had her hand all over BREXIT for example.

                 Indeed; this is pure fake. Shapeshifting queens. That they (elites) represent mental demons is a whole other story.

                 Reptillians are a cover-up for malevolent astral entities that physical beings like humans can offer themselves to be a vessel / medium. Moderate forms of interaction is telepathy with these beings. Severe forms of interaction are offering up for possession by these beings.

                Wow that's some incredible stuff. A couple years ago I would have laughed or at least not taken it as seriously. Now post-pizzagate revelations, along with the whole 2016 election, I see the world in a different light. I now believe that we are lied to more often than we are told the truth.

                   Shutting down Redditt because of talking about Racine is probably nothing more than an inflated sense of impact by the crew trying to tell the Racine story because I seriously doubt they are responsible for getting Redditt shut down. They seem like they may be pretty religious or something because they do have a religious savior flavor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   However after looking at some of the history of Racine, the staggering amount of business investment for a town that size, a commerce port which always attracts flies, and the history of the secret societies and "religions" that moved into that area from the very beginning I don't doubt the WIC story that Racine is a festering mess of secret society crime. And the Johnson family are big players. I would be very surprised if it were NOT full of luciferic assholes.

                    I was given insider info in a PM and subsequently downloaded PDF’s of all involved parties in Racine. Stunning. Actual Agenda 21 info and one world Government Luceferian Reign revealed in Agenda 21,and Agenda 30 plans.  The PDF’s have been sent to a safe location for the present time.

                     Flies meaning a criminal element. The old money families in control have long family histories that go back to the days of travel by sea. The sea lanes were the arteries of commerce for the world. Ancient writings refer to them as "The Sea People" because they would show up in ships at various places in the world. This breed of seafarer pioneered commerce by ship and was a nasty cut throat band of savages and invaders.

                     Spices were never about making food taste good but were medicines and still are the best medicines a person can get if the proper ones are used for the proper purpose. I'm living proof of that and I used to be a pharma rep.

                     They controlled the ports with a ruthlessness that is legendary. The ports are the jumping off and loading place of vast fortunes to be made in commerce. Controlling the ports is a guaranteed middleman position in the distribution of goods.

                     They are also famous for controlling all major "crosses" because crossings are where commerce travels and meets. "i'll meet you at the Y." Forks in the rivers where rivers run together allowed places for trading posts to thrive because they could control commerce on the rivers. Creek "crosses" and any crossing places.

                     They understood the value of "crosses" and applied it every way they could think of and this is how the Khazar Kingdom developed between the Black and Caspian seas. The natural barriers of the Caucus Mountan Range, Volga River, and the seas made it a natural route for commerce between Russia in the north and the the middle east in the south. Commerce flowed between the Black and Caspian sea so they set up their Khazarian Kingdom right there and ruled the area with unmatched savagery.

                      I have no doubts racine is knee deep in corruption/but so are many other places with just as much rich history.  I'm at the point the ppl that keep saying inside info/life in danger/special secret investigations blah blah are a lot of hype by ppl that maybe need to elevate themselves bc they have some lack in personal life.

                      That gave me a chuckle...was scratching my head going well sure, flies would be normal at a port.  Then images of shipping so many body parts, humans with feces etc thought maybe the port was covered in flies lol.

                       Have you read what Sue Arrigo wrote about shipping children by sea? "Secrets of The CIA's Global Slave Trade Industry." Pretty interesting.

                        No, haven't read Sue but have read enough about shipping children.  I'll ck her out.

                        Yes, SA is quite an issue isn't it?  Some think a big coup for the US/others like the article you reference think the opposite.

                       <p>
                        No telling what dirty deeds are going on/lots of speculation/just watching.  Things will become clearer as more develops.

                        Corbett had a very good report you might be interested in if you haven't seen it already.  I ck her twitter now that I know about her.
