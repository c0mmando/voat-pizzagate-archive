<p>Spielberg\'s big break came with the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin%27"><em>Amblin</em></a>. It\'s the story of a boy and girl who meet and become lovers. He travels with closely guarded guitar case.  She leaves him when she opens the guitar case and discovers the contents, which on their face mean nothing unless.  One of the contents is Milk of Magnesia, which is used by men when they want to have anal sex. </p>
<p>Mr Gunk\'s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mrgunk">facebook page</a> has been shut down.  Spielberg no doubt went after him.</p>
<p>I hope Shane Fry is alright.</p>

            : By nature, age and occupation, I am a cautious  person so I feel  that I must ask this question. In spite of being convinced  that SS is a pedophile,  are we running a great risk that  voat/ pizzagate  will be shut down by the Internet Masters if it embarks on this campaign?
           </p>
           <p>
            I was completely engrossed in the Ford/Kavanaugh battle and marvelled at how thoroughly the Internet was scrubbed in favor of Ford.  I dont feel that this was done by her and her lawyers alone.  The scrubbing in all liklihood had the assistance of  the Internet Masters. Perhaps  this SS campaign  should wait for the exposure of high ranking pedophiles by the Trump Administration, then jump on board.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before attacking me, I would like to see some discussion  by members on this issue.

             I can see your point.  I did not believe Spielberg was a pedo for a long time.  It was only CDAN blind after CDAN blind which convinced me he is, if not an abuser, a procurer and a groomer. imho, those who aid and abet are just as guilty as those who commit the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that if you act in fear of pushback, nothing will ever get done and no information can come to the fore.

            Where are you getting the info about milk of magnesia Being associated with anal sex? I have never heard of it being used for that and I can't find any info on it. Not saying it's not true I just am curious and would like to read about it if you have an article or something.

             You need to prepare for anal sex the day before, otherwise the poop comes out while you're being penetrated.   All you have to do is google it. Milk of magnesia is used to clean you out first so that you don't get shit everywhere.

              Here is some information for you
             </a>
             about anal sex from gays:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Spontaneous anal is risky business and the results hard to predict.
Exactly this. When you chose to go down the dirt road, you might get a little messy. If that happens, be a grownup about it and just jump in the shower. Soap and water will fix the biggest mess. If you are squeamish about that possible outcome (which is fine, different stokes for different folks), then don't have anal.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             There's nothing natural about anal sex. The anus is designed to hold in feces. It's a one-way door. Try to push it the other way and you'll end up with anal fissures, anal cancer, anal warts.  The anus is full of bacteria, so it's a great way of spreading diseases.  If you keep up the anal sex, your sphincter muscle is likely to lose its elasticity and strength, so that you end up not being able to hold in your poop.  You then have to wear a nappy because the poo keeps oozing out.

              I did google it but nothing relevant came up! 
Thanks for the info that sounds like one of the least appealing things I've heard of haha, it's sad to think someone would be forcing that on kids.

            This movie, only 26 minutes long, led to Spielberg becoming the youngest director ever to be signed to a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal) after Sid Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universal Television saw the film. Spielberg was signed to a 7-year contract with Universal Television.

            Snicker. Snicker.  Those at Universal probably had Philipp's Magnesia in their suitcases as well.

            Mr Gunk pulled material from our research threads when it came to Spielberg.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that Spielberg sent thugs means that he is SCARED of being outed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Refering to our material being used a lot, that means Spielberg is scared of US and our investigative worm.

             I thank you for all your research and hard work regarding SS.  I believe his days are numbered.  Yes, I too believe he is getting worried and scared of being Fully Outed.  So many are aware now as well.  Getting people to not show up at his movies is the trick now.  Like what happened to Spacey's last movie.  Truth will out eventually because people will keep spreading the word.  When one is shut down two will pop up.  He will have to shut down the entire internet.  I have so much respect for those that are courageously going after him.

            Keep it up Spielberg. All you’re doing is vindicating my assertations that you ordered Judith Barsi’s death.

            Your youtube links aren't showing up. At least I think that is what is supposed to be here:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...are shut down. and are still up.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I've had that happen to me too for some reason I don't understand. Try replacing youtube with hooktube and see if they will display.

              Ah, that might be it. It's strange because it doesn't do it to every youtube link. I'll have to tinker with it and see if I can figure it out. Thanks for the heads up!
