            This is the one you are looking for. They cooked two kids and served them to some unsuspecting dinner guests. After they ate it the cooks told them what it was and showed them what was left that was not eaten to freak the people out.

            He has a couple of books that he wrote that I need to get. I bet they are good. Here is some of his other stuff. One of his books that is probably a shocker is "Cannibalism, Blood Drinking, and High Adept Satanism"

            I understand why you need proof, but I don't think I will be reading that.  It might even make me vomit and I would never be able to erase it from my mind.  Only certain people can read these gory details.  Be careful how you word your stories.
