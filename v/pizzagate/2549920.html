<p>I began browsing through the websites and facebook pages of the artists listed on Push/Pull\'s website. Here is a <a href="https://imgur.com/kXXqpM3">profile photo of Cora Lee</a>, a comic book writer who has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pushpullseattle/posts/882896681888730">sold art</a> at Push/Pull.</p>
<p>I checked out some of the owners and operators such as Seth Goodkind, who runs Push/Pull with his partner Maxx. Seth Goodkind also goes by the name <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sethbeastmeat/">SethBeastMeat on Instagram</a> Here is his <a href="https://sethgoodkind.com/">personal website.</a> Here is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhZxa6NF3Tz/?taken-by=sethbeastmeat">more of his pizza art</a>, which reminds me of the style I saw from Comet Ping Pong.</p>
<p>On Push/Pull’s facebook shared videos pages, I found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pushpullseattle/videos/978695532308844/">this video of art in the shape of pizza slices.</a></p>
<p>And a bizarre, awkward, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pushpullseattle/videos/876146375897094/">video labelled as a “demon summoning.”</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pushpullseattle/videos/881884581989940/">And more &quot;art&quot; of mutilated young women.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Og0elFJ">Here is my album of all the images I\'ve collected related to Push/Pull.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I also noticed that one of Push/Pull’s <a href="https://imgur.com/UntxLU1">main sponsors</a> is Sizzle Pie. Their <a href="https://www.sizzlepie.com/">website</a> is replete with Satanic imagery. They operate in several cities in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiSMNULhQVI/?taken-by=sizzlepie">What is it about pizza that inspires this Satanic worship?</a></p>
<p>Sizzle Pie also owns <a href="https://www.sizzlepie.com/quality-bar-portland-dark-bar-seattle-best-eugene-portland-bars/">a couple bars.</a> One in Portland, OR the other in Seattle, WA. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZQl4kX4">Here is my album</a> of the Satanic/Occult images and instagram photos I’ve collected from Sizzle Pie.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these two businesses and their personnel struck me as having a similar vibe to what I saw in Alefantis’ crowd. Grotesque pizza art, Satanic and occult symbols, sexualized gore, etc. Push/Pull also does art workshops for teenagers, often sponsored by Sizzle Pie. This appears to be, among other things, a way to introduce Satanism and the occult to young people. Combined with the obvious pizza related aspect and its symbolism, I thought this was worth checking out.</p>

            Great work I'm convinced so how would a pedo order a child in these places? Are there code words to use what if they have some teenager working after school and he does not know what the pedo is talking about? The owner would know but probably not all the part time employees unless they don't have any teens working after school or on weekends. How do they advertise to pedos in the area do they look for the satanic symbols I guess they have to.

            I'm telling you goats it goes far deeper. What about the vacation rentals and homes that are only occupied 2 weeks out of the entire year? It would make perfect sense that the elites vacation on the otegon/Washington coast in multi million dollar homes. Who would even think of any pedophilia going on or even bother checking what sort if children they are able to smuggle in? Look into who owns mortgage companies, and real estate around these states and I bet there are ties to be found.

            Nice work! I shared my hypothesis about the meaning of  "Pizza" in the original Reddit pizzagate. But they were really pushing the one decode that claimed that pizza is code for pedophilia. They also stated that "walnut sauce" meant a black person; when we've since learned that it's more likely adrenochrome.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I believe that "Pizza" is code for Satanic sex magic and that "Cheese Pizza" is the same, specifically regarding the torture of children.
           </p>

            I also believe that part of these rituals is to force cannibalism upon their victims and the general public (see the photos of children eating, almost as though it's pornography). That's some serious magick!

            I think that the event, alluded to by Qanon, which will put 90% in the hospital is when it's revealed that all of us have consumed human flesh, and probably on a regular basis, (including vegans, in the form of vegetarian sausage which has been found to contain human DNA).

              Maybe. It seems as though we are becoming more and more desensitized to adulterated food. Very much of what we eat is not what we believe it to be. And, especially in the US, there is a lot of secrecy to hide the unethical and corrupt practices of commercial agriculture.
             </p>
             <p>
              The various examples of using human cells for flavorants, and human DNA found in many products, serves to further muddy the waters.

              Nope.  None of that stuff is rational.  You have to be somewhat demented to put out that kind of "art".  There is way too much to question imo.

               "In your opinion" is exactly my point. If you are only looking for satanic and pedo images that is all you are going to see. To me it looks like artists trying to be edgy by having satanic undertones. You see it a lot in "hipster" art scenes. Idk if you would make the connection since it isn't a pizza place. "Better start digging!"

                I have been digging.  I have been digging since this stuff started on reddit.  You think hipster art is eyes all over the place and hands making triangle signs.  They also mimic the Free Mason signs as well.  Nothing to see here folks.  There are a lot of hipsters also falling for the Satanic crap now, thinking it is cool.  Before they know they are doing the really sick stuff those people are into as well, because they get roped into it.  That is exactly why we are seeing so much of this.

                 So basically all death metal bands are pedophiles too? Satanic shit has always been 'edgy' this isn't new, and I don't think that instantly justifies someone as a pedo.

                  I was not looking for anything.  I evaluate upon evidence.  If these morons don't want to be categorized as Satanic, then they should quit copying their symbols and gory art.  It's that simple.  If they are copy cats then they deserve the label.

                   There is no proof of them as of right now being pedos. Once again you cant prove anything but 'opinion' If you want something to be done that doesn't go far in court.
