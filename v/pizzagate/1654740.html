            Easy.  You need actually write down in clear concise English something that makes sense, without too many steps or logical leaps and come up with a paragraph or two some actual proof of something.  If you want an infographic afterwards, you can create one, but lines between screenshots and circles are useless.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have some real proof of something, you can easily express it in words.
           </p>
           <p>
            You also may want to look into the implications of calling the people who don't share your rabbitholes as normies.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are doing a mindmap/infographic, using a key to show what is real and what is speculative would help.  For example, established facts are solid lines, speculation or what you are trying to prove are dotted lines.  Take something as simple as the Epstein case.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Jeffrey Epstein connected to Bill Clinton                  solid line
           </p>
           <p>
            Was Jeffrey Epstein convicted as sex offender           solid line
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Bill Clinton know that Epstein was a sex offender........???

            It's not shutting down.  One of their projects is closing The Clinton Global Initiative is closing. That was the one with the big meeting every year.  Other parts are changing, but the Foundation is continuing.  Some of the works that is continuing are
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Health Matters Initiative - working on opioid epidemic and obesity in US.
           </p>
           <p>
            Too Small to Fail - Focus on early brain and language development in infants/toddlers
           </p>
           <p>
            Presidential Leadership Scholars and CGI University - focusing on Public Service
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Development Initiative - supporting small farmers in Africa
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Climate Initiative
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Health Access Initiative - providing access to AIDS medication
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the problems with this whole story is most press reports didn't even know how the Clinton Foundation operated and what the different parts were and how  big different parts were in relation to each other.  Somebody on this board claimed they spent $2 billion on anti-trafficking.

             "It's not shutting down."............Simple question AreWeSure: do you think the Clinton Foundation should do a full FINANCIAL audit?
            </p>
            <p>
             A financial audit would "go to ground" on the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership. That means they would follow the audit trail until they actually came to real live human beings and/or real live companies. Right now the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership is as far as the Clinton Foundation's charity audit went. In other words it's potentially hiding some bad stuff. Think Bernie Madoff
            </p>
            <p>
             It's ok if you don't want to respond because it could make whoever's writing your checks look bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             I only ask in the outside chance you rediscover your soul and once again believe poor, black, destitute, Haitian throw-away children deserve all the same human rights as the rest of us.
