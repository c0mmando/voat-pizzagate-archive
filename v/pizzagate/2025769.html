            Good find, just note that the conviction was in 2014.

            Conviction of Timothy DeFoggi is discussed, Sept 1, 2014
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It is an evil that permeates our government and law enforcement at every level, from the very first contact all the way up to the White House, and it has infested every agency, rooting itself deep inside the power structure, networked into the hierarchies, and political realms, possessing and controlling levers that go into other networks and other realms.  And it has been decades in the making, so don’t think it is one party or one Administration that is responsible. This is not NEW. This is the core of Evil rotting to the point that it is visible on the rez, and in Florida, and in Colorado.  Turn over any rock in any State and it is there as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             By now it should be obvious that something very, very dark is upset that there is opposition standing up to them, dragging them out into the light.  You cannot get all those highly placed, appointed and elected types, to join together to harass people who are reporting crimes against children, unless it goes to the very top of each agency and to the very people who appointed them, or who recommended them for appointment.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not an accident. This is not an oversight. This is repeated, concerted efforts to silence those who are making the reports and demanding investigations.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the people who was at the top echelon of Cyber Security for HHS, is a man named Timothy DeFoggi who was the Acting Director, no less, of Cyber Security for HHS, was busted back in March for kiddie porn and worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Timothy DeFoggi, 56, was convicted of "engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography."
            </p>
            <p>
             It gets worse, much worse:
            </p>
            <p>
             "DeFoggi even suggested meeting one member in person to fulfill their mutual fantasies to violently rape and murder children," according to the press release.
His main responsibility at HHS? Operating Systems Internet Technology Security Officer (OS ITSO) at Indian Health Services. (IHS).
Let that fantasy of his, “violently raping and murdering children” sink in a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, ask yourself this: With the opposition that Thomas Sullivan and others have faced through HHS, IHS in particular, do you think DeFoggi is the ONLY one in that agency at a high level that indulges in this sort of thing?
