<p>Walt Disney was a 33rd degree freemason and high level occultist (wizard). Disney was the Child Porn king and was working directly with the occult/vatican/cia to control the minds of the children, force sexual images and thoughts upon them and other demonic symbols, rituals and spells. Many Disney movies are full of sexual and occult content and spells that is what they are promoted so hard by mainstream media. They say a child learns the most the first 5 years of their lives and Walt Disney and others cartoons are the main ones teaching children today and they are try to corrupt the children with these symbols, signs, sounds and spells. Please watch the videos below and follow the links to other websites that go much more in depth with this issue...
Walt Disney, was a 33rd Degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite and his whole life he spun threads from the Mystery Schools into the children\'s minds with the purpose of getting them used to the occult for days to come. Tolkien Walt used the Le Sacre du Printemps (the Rite of Spring) music for Fantasia. This piece of music was written AS a pagan ritual where a virgin sacrifices herself by dancing to death. According to CIA informants opposed to the NWO, CIA contractors were brought in to build the underground tunnels under Disneyworld in 1977.
Walt grew up fascinated with the occult and in an abusive home situation. He was fascinated with cartoons, nature and children. He had an intuitive sense for quality cartoons that would appeal to children. At some point, the syndicate got him indebted to them. At that point he was their man. He owed them a debt that they held over him. In secret, Walt became a porn king. A victim remembers that he was sadistic and enjoyed snuff porn films. His interest in children was far from altruistic.

            The Gay Terrorist bomber who hit the Australian christian lobby was in gay dance parties where they tagged disney princesses and all sorts of other tags so kids using hashtag search on facebook would see gay cocks and gay parties.

            Remember reading a long time ago that Disney was as right wing as General Electric ... which is pretty far to the right.

            Haven't finished reading "The Devil's Disciple" by David Talbot as yet, but it also looks like Allen Dulles was guiding Walt Disney and his film projects.

            <p>
             666 is the nuclear code. It's the atomic number of man. who has been trapped in an atomic reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Illuminati have always known there is nothing(chaos) betwixt the real and under.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Seal Of Solomon, is the atomic code. 666.

            Can't remember who to credit for posting this link on PG in the last day or so, and I have no idea if it's true or not, but it's a fascinating read that seems as believable as it is horrific:

              Illuminati Game Is a mutually assured destruction game. MAD It involves Nuclear Codes
             </p>
             <p>
              666 is the nuclear code. It's the atomic number of man. who has been trapped in an atomic reality.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Illuminati have always known there is nothing(chaos) betwixt the real and under.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Seal Of Solomon, is the atomic code. 666.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pegasus Museum (616 Kids) Is reference to The Number of The Beast In The Dead Sea Scrolls It reduces to 4 the base of time (flat land joke)

no but if /x/ is to believed (they aren't), then aliums are gonna delet the nukes before they detonate or even launch. Cause they can tell your intentions or something.

            I am reading a book right now that links Disney to porn and snuff films, however, such material has never been recovered and linked to Disney or his organization. I am not saying I do not believe but I work in the field of security and KNOW for a fact that most of the world (physical and electronic) is highly insecure. The caveat is that I don't LOOK for it so maybe I am underinformed. My book(1) makes this claim also (it's even in the subtitle of the book) without much documentation to substantiate it. We are investigating people who seem to be winking at each other over fetishization of the MKUltra/Monarch program while joking about baby cannibalism and supporting artists that display knowledge or experience of SRA but, beyond that, no photos or videos. Also, there was no follow-up by the DCPD over the complaint about illegal videos being found in the protected area of the CPP website. How do police departments / CPS / NCMEC segregate information so that "good cops" don't find their org protects elite pedos?
