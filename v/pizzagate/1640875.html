<p>The logo for Guide Star caught my eye, as I\'ve noticed that a number of monitoring trafficking organisations use the northern star as a theme within their logo or name.  Polaris being another one.  I am vaguely aware that this <a href="http://www.makara.us/04mtempler/POLARIS.htm">northern star theme also has an esoteric meaning</a>, as well as being important to the Navy because of obvious navigation themed connections.</p>
<p>Guide Star was started by Arther &quot;Buzz&quot; Schmidt.  Here is <a href="http://www.guidestarinternational.org/NewsItem.aspx?aid=4016b4b7-0313-491d-848e-e8445c914603">an article</a> with his attendance at Guide Star Korea.  In the article photos, please notice the logo behind him.. It is very reminiscent of the FBI advisings on pedophile symbols.  I couldn\'t find anything more about it.   <a href="http://www.guidestarinternational.org/foundingboard.aspx">Guide Star founders</a> include connections to the Rockefellers.</p>
<p>On 2nd February 2015, Schmidt and other board members <a href="http://www.guidestarinternational.org/Board.aspx">stepped down</a>, to be replaced by a younger more tech savvy team.

<p><a href="http://www.bizdb.co.uk/company/guidestar-international-05594889/">Guidestar International</a> is based in Surrey in the UK.</p>
<p>According to a financial report <a href="http://guidestarinternational.org/SiteImages/files/Guidestar_International-Financial_Statements2015.pdf">[pdf]</a>, the parent company is <a href="http://www.techsoupglobal.org/">TechSoup</a></p>

<p>Another organization of interest is <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> which gave <a href="http://beyondborders.net/who-we-are/">Beyond Borders</a> (just opposite Comet Ping Pong) a four star rating.  Again the navigation theme in their logo.  Their history is quite interesting but I won\'t go into that here. Charity Navigator has been criticized in this <a href="https://archive.is/QLspu">Stanford report</a>.  The founder John Pat Dugan stepped down in June 2016 (like previous charity) for tech savvy types.</p>

<p>To be replaced by advertizing man  Matt Giegerich  of <a href="http://wpp.com/wpp/companies/ogilvy-commonhealth-worldwide/">Ogilvy</a>.

<p>And finally Polaris, which has been awarded 4 stars by Charity Navigator was started by Ashoka fellow David Ellerman  and Katherine Chon.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/how-technology-is-taking-down-human-trafficking-87658">article</a>, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The executive director of Polaris, which operates a national hotline for human trafficking, met representatives from <strong>Palantir Technologies</strong>, a data analysis firm, at a summit Google Ideas organized in 2012 with activists against the trafficking of drugs, weapons, organs and humans.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, hundreds of protocols and thousands of resources were streamlined on a single dashboard for call center specialists to support victims in need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Palantir has CIA connections: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/#60a7a9753da8">How A \'Deviant\' Philosopher Built Palantir, A CIA-Funded Data-Mining Juggernaut</a></p>
<p>So, really interesting to see these big data companies taking over the monitoring of trafficking systems, having close connections to the CIA and others, yet we still read that the trafficking issue is mushrooming...getting worse rather than better.</p>',

            I can't go through this post yet but I will mention the parallel of UK PG figure Esther Rantzen, who started a hotline called Childline most likely to be used to silence victims as it employed many pedo characters.
