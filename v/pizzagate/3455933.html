<p>However this article points out issues with the Vera report: <a href="http://archive.is/3lRyc">http://archive.is/3lRyc</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subsequent independent investigations — by the Associated Press, by the federal Office of Human Research Protections; and by the Vera Institute of Justice — confirmed that ethical standards and federal regulations had been violated. The investigations confirmed that most children did not have an the protection of an independent advocate to give or refuse consent to experimental interventions. ….The Associated Press reported that <strong>the scope of these experiments was much wider; extending beyond New York to “at least seven states.” Among them: Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Colorado and Texas</strong>. AP reported that  more than four dozen different studies were involved. The foster children ranged from infants to late teens, according to interviews and government records. </p>
<p>..In 2006, OHRP confirmed the allegations by the Alliance for Human Research Protection; concluding that <strong>Columbia University Presbyterian Medical Center in New York</strong>, failed to obtain proper consent from an independent advocate, failed to ensure “equitable” selection and and failed to ensure safeguards for the foster children who “are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence.”  ..“<strong>OHRP issued determination letters to 19 institutions</strong> across the country for violations related to the enrollment of foster children in the HIV/AIDS clinical trials originally cited in the AHRP letter. <strong>The 19 institutions included the New York City medical centers Bronx-Lebanon and Bellevue Hospital Centers. The SUNY Health Science Center at Stony Brook</strong> had also received a determination letter in February 2006 regarding two of the clinical trials cited.  … <a href="https://archive.is/rt8J1">Links to the 19 letters</a></p>
<p>...The authors of the report “concluded” — on the basis of (admittedly) incomplete, therefore unreliable records that the deaths were “not a direct result of the medications.” However the validity of that conclusion is highly questionable. The Vera Institute did not even have access to minutes from medical center research review boards (IRBs) where the trials were conducted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in April, we wrote about the visit of Stephen and his colleague Dean Christian Stohler to Nyumbani’s programs in Kenya. The pair was in Kenya for the East Africa Oral Health Summit, which brought together over 100 leaders in oral health. We covered their visit and the summit in our previous post, but during our research we also learned that Dean Nicholas had been a follower of Nyumbani for many years and even knew <strong>our founder, Father D’Agostino</strong>.  </p>
<p>..In its early days, Father D’Agostino visited Incarnation with a mutual friend of Nicholas, David Pincus. Nicholas remembers Father D’Ag showing up on the ICC’s doorstep one day, eager to learn more about New York’s first home for pediatric AIDS patients. Not long after his visit to ICC and introduction to Nicholas, Father D’Ag was in Kenya founding Nyumbani, a home reminiscent of the children’s home in Harlem. </p>

He was allowed to keep his job at BA and, in an indictment of the vetting system, continued his charity work with children. </p>
<p>..Politician Jeremy Hunt founded the company Hotcourses in the 1990’s, which currently shares a Board of Trustees with the Nyumbani orphanage in Nairobi, which he is a member of. Nyumbani appointed previously arrested for a child sexual offense BA pilot Simon Wood to its UK board of directors in 2003.</p>
<p>.The founder of Nyumbani, an Air Force urology surgeon, Georgetown University psychiatrist, and Jesuit priest named Angelo D\'Agostino, is <strong>pictured here in the <a href="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1857/43412137654_aaf19b5e25_o.png">Clinton Oval Office</a></strong>. It should be noted that D\'Agostino was close to the late Senators Jesse Helms and Patrick Leahy, with Leahy calling D\'Agostino &quot;a living saint,&quot; because Cathy O\'Brien alleges Patrick Leahy raped her daughter many times, and otherwise tortured her, Cathy, in numerous incidents. </p>

            <p>
             excerpts:
            </p>
            <p>
             Elie Wiesel has traveled all over the world with David N. Pincus, a retired Philadelphia clothing manufacturer. They've traveled to Auschwitz, to Moscow, to Kosovo, and to the White House...But a 1987 trip to Brazil stands out in the Nobel Peace Prize winner's memory.  "We were going to meet the president of Brazil," said Wiesel, who was being presented with an award. "And David just disappeared."
            </p>
            <p>
             Pincus had discovered a colony of destitute children in São Paulo. Given the choice between attending a formal state banquet and a chance to spread joy among the poor, Pincus chose to visit the kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pincus is a largely unsung humanitarian, more comfortable working behind the scenes. He is well-known in Philadelphia art circles for his impressive modern collection and for donating his works to the region's biggest museums. But most of his charity has escaped notice because it was overseas, or anonymous.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Now, at 82, Pincus has turned his attention to charities closer to home that target disadvantaged children and youths - hospitals, playgrounds, Community College of Philadelphia.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..His walls display works by some of the most celebrated modern artists: Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still. He juxtaposes the art with photos of poor children he has met during his journeys. There is a photo of the Pincuses with Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick. There's another of Pincus with golfer Arnold Palmer, whose clothing line he manufactured.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Rabbi Neil S. Cooper, the head of Temple Beth Hillel Beth-El in Wynnewood, meets Pincus once a week to swap stories and to savor a shot of Jameson.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..I met Pincus 10 years ago when I was The Inquirer's Africa correspondent.
             <strong>
              He was a board member of the International Rescue Committee
             </strong>
             , one of America's oldest relief organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...A Pincus encounter with children is a spectacle. At a camp of Sierra Leonean refugees, Pincus wandered off to seek out camp residents. A few children drew close to examine the curious foreigner with the grin and the goodies. Pincus insisted on placing the candies into the children's mouths -
             <em>
              feel, touch.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             ..I next heard from Pincus in 2001, when The Inquirer published my article about a conflict between South African AIDS activists and big pharmaceutical companies. Pincus phoned and wanted to know whom he could help...First Pincus sent her some money. A few months later, he made the first of four visits to South Africa.
             <strong>
              He was accompanied by an AIDS expert, Stephen W. Nicholas, the director of pediatrics at Harlem Hospital Center,
             </strong>
             who went along to help Pincus assess the hospice's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Pincus set up a
             <strong>
              U.S. charity, Friends of Sparrows
             </strong>
             , to channel tax-deductible contributions to the hospice. It has sent about $250,000 to South Africa. The hospice has expanded into a village housing 330 clients, mostly children, with a budget of $1 million...
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Pincus also introduced her to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where he recently committed $1.3 million over five years to create a global health fellowship that will send two pediatricians overseas to assist AIDS programs. The gift will help the hospital take a lead in international health, said Rodney Finalle, the fellowship director.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In 1999, Pincus encouraged Nicholas to extend his outreach to the Dominican Republic. When Nicholas organized the International Family AIDS Program on the island, Pincus lined up support from Harold A. Honickman, the beverage mogul, and Sy Syms, the clothing retailer.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Pincus' father, Nathan, and uncles founded the clothing firm in 1911 after emigrating from what is now Belarus. The firm thrived. PBM became one of the largest manufacturers in an industry that employed 25,000 people in Philadelphia before the jobs went overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Pincus' connections in the art world multiplied. He became involved in the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania when it opened in 1963. Through the ICA, he met Warhol and acquired a few of his works, some of them promised to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where Pincus headed the 20th Century Committee and was a trustee for more than 35 years.

             Many of their biological parents are or were mentally ill, drug-addicted, and HIV-infected. Familial predisposition, together with intrauterine drug exposure and life’s emotionally traumatic experiences, may account for the high rates of mental illness in HIV-infected children

            Scientists from Oxford University 'stole the blood' of African orphans and brought it back to Britain to carry out 'unlawful' research into Aids.
           </p>
           <p>
            This sensational claim is made by a leading Kenyan scientist whose lawyers will begin legal action this week against Oxford and one of its top researchers, Dr Sarah Rowland-Jones. He alleges her team stole blood he collected from HIV-infected orphans and used his data to publish their own research.
           </p>
           <p>
            The row centres on an orphanage on the outskirts of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which some scientists hope holds the key to a future cure for Aids.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the Nyumbani children's home, HIV-infected children rescued from the city's slums have survived for more than 10 years without medication. Their natural immunity has intrigued scientists around the world. Researchers believe the orphans' blood offers vital genetic clues that could lead to the holy grail of Aids research: an effective vaccine.
           </p>
           <p>
            One case of particular interest to the scientists involves twin brothers. While one brother died after his HIV infection turned into Aids, the other is still alive and is now a healthy 21-year-old. Genetic data taken from the brothers is a crucial part of the race for a vaccine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Moses Otsyula, head of virology at Kenya's Institute of Primate Research, set up a diagnostic laboratory at the orphanage in 1997 to monitor the infected children. Over four years he collected 70 blood samples he believed could provide vital data. More than 70 per cent of children with HIV in Africa die before they are three, but several of the orphans at the Nyumbani were already in their teens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otsyula claims that while he was on a trip to Harvard University in 2001 to discuss possible US collaboration with his work, the Oxford researchers stole his blood samples from a freezer, removed crucial data from his computer and illegally brought it back to Oxford without permission. The Oxford team later published two research papers using information taken from these blood samples.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otsyula told The Observer: 'It was my project, my time, my samples and my ideas. They came and just stole it all. That is completely unethical. I have been trying to reach an amicable solution with Oxford for the last three years but they have ignored my protests. That is why I have instructed my lawyers to sue Oxford University and Dr Rowland-Jones.'
           </p>
           <p>
            He claims the Oxford team had not received permission from the orphanage board to take further blood samples which he alleges amounts to them using the children as 'guinea pigs'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otsyula has won the backing of government officials who have launched an investigation into the research carried out at the orphanage, run by a Jesuit priest, Father Angelo D'Agostino.
           </p>
           <p>
            'They came to Africa and thought it was the jungle, but we have rules and ethics as well,' said Dr Mohammed Abdullah, chairman of Kenya's National Council for Science and Technology, a government body which has to approve research.
           </p>
           <p>
            'It appears these scientists saw what they wanted and took it. I have great respect for Oxford but in this case they have acted very wrongly and need to take action.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Rowland-Jones, who works at Oxford's Institute of Molecular Medicine, has defended her team's actions while admitting they made an 'inadvertent' error. She claimed they had received D'Agostino's permission for the research.
           </p>
           <p>
            'We were invited to Nairobi by Otsyula to collaborate with the research and were led to believe by him we had full ethical approval to conduct the research,' she said. 'That was a big mistake as it clearly wasn't the case. At all times we acted in good faith but the mechanism for getting ethical approval wasn't entirely clear cut at the time. When we realised we made an error we applied for ethical approval for our work which was given in 2002.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Rowland-Jones admitted this written approval did not cover the past research, but said she had been given a 'verbal' assurance that it did. She admits her team brought blood back to the UK but claims its members believed they had permission to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rowland-Jones's research is funded by the British government's Medical Research Council. It said in a statement: 'As qualified doctors and dedicated medical researchers, [the Oxford team] are committed to carrying out high quality research to save lives, to the highest ethical standards. We would not be associated in any way with work that exploits people, particularly vulnerable children living with HIV infection.
           </p>
           <p>
            'We are entirely committed to the practice of medical research to international ethical standards and to the welfare of the children in Nyum bani orphanage. We also remain committed to carrying out approved research that will benefit these children and many others like them around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            'We remain in admiration of the home and Father D'Agostino and his dedicated staff. Nyumbani is a beacon of quality care for HIV-infected children and has been established entirely for compassionate reasons.'
           </p>
           <p>
            It emerged last week that Cambridge University was also caught up in a row over Aids research at the Nyumbani children's home after Kenya's Sunday Nation newspaper reported that one of its scientists was visiting the orphanage. Dr Eric Miller, of the university's department of clinical veterinary medicine, has confirmed he was at the children's home doing preliminary work on a nutritional project.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I can categorically state that no unauthorised research has been carried out. Our proposed research has not yet started. I have been working with a number of partners in the planning phase of a research programme investigating the benefit of certain food supplements on HIV progression,' Miller said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The row over Aids research at the Nyumbani orphanage is the latest controversy over the way HIV-infected children are used in research. Last month The Observer revealed that the drugs giant GlaxoSmithkline used orphans at a New York children's home in experiments.

             Under Moor’s sole proprietorship Southern Air Transport (SAT) was established early in 1947, joining the ranks of the Large Irregulars. Operations began in July with a Douglas DC-3 leased from George Batchelor’s Arrow Airways. The new outfit’s first significant customer was Paramount Aquariums of New York, and SAT’s aircraft was soon regularly trundling south to Belém in Brazil to bring back consignments of exotic fish in 5USg (20l) drums.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Southern Air Transport, formally incorporated on October 31, 1949, had been looking for its own aircraft. Coincidentally, the US Air Force was selling off large quantities of surplus Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando twin-engine transports through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. SAT snapped up four examples from storage at Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, reportedly for a total price of less than $30,000 ($300,000 today).
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Being willing to tackle almost anything, through the 1950s SAT found sufficient work to keep going, mainly in South America. Until late in 1952 it operated US government Commercial Air Movement (CAM) flights transporting military personnel. One of these missions carried scientists to Las Vegas to observe atom bomb tests at the Nevada Proving Grounds. Another contract involved the transfer of overhauled engines from Robins AFB, Georgia, to air bases around the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Southern Air Transport also carried immigrants from San Juan to New York, Brahma cattle to South America, racehorses, and exotic tropical animals. On one occasion a crate containing live snakes broke open and it took a couple of days to catch all the reptiles hiding in the darker reaches of the C-46. All manner of general cargo was hauled, not least seven tons (6,350kg) of gold bullion from Medellín, Colombia, to New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1959, the CAB granted SAT a Supplemental certificate for cargo operations and authority for flights around the Caribbean.

            </h1>
            <p>
             While the Central Intelligence Agency already had its own air arm, Air America, created in 1950 (as Civil Air Transport Inc) to support US foreign policy objectives in the Indo-China region, there was a desire to create a contingency ‘air force’ with an eye toward future ventures in Latin America. In summer 1960 a search began for a suitable established ‘front’ carrier, especially one in possession of a Supplemental certificate, which Air America lacked. This was now a mandatory requirement to enable bidding for lucrative military airlift contracts to offset running costs, while still remaining available to fulfill CIA operational needs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Southern Air Transport, by now unprofitable and with assets of around only $100,000 (approximately $775,000 today), proved an attractive candidate and the airline changed hands on August 5 for $307,506.10 ($2.42m), ostensibly to Actus Technology, a front corporation. The transaction was handled through two government nominees, Percival F Brundage, director of the Bureau of the Budget and Perkins McGuire, Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Eisenhower administration. Although under the overall supervision of the CIA, Doc Moor and his number two, Stanley G Williamson, were retained as chairman and president, respectively, to handle the commercial side of the business and, no doubt, to maintain a veneer of ‘respectability’.
            </p>
            <p>
             .....Meanwhile, in 1977 the CAB gave Southern Air Transport the authority to contract with the Department of Defense. The following year it received domestic all-cargo authority, and in 1980 was approved for worldwide all-cargo charters.

            </h1>
            <p>
             ....Starting in February 1986, SAT transported shipments of anti-tank weapons and Hawk missiles to Israel for onward movement to Iran, while its aircraft had been frequently seen at San Salvador’s Ilopango International Airport, a known transfer point for the CIA’s Central American operations.
            </p>
            <p>
             A joint-venture was established in January 1993 with the formation of
             <strong>
              Polar Air Cargo in conjunction with aircraft leasing company Polaris, a subsidiary of General Electric Capital Services, and California-based NedMark Transportation Services
             </strong>
             . Polar lifted off in May 1993 using a couple of 747s, initially on charter work. Within a few months, several more aircraft allowed the initiation of east and westbound scheduled routes linking New York with Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
             SAT pulled out of the partnership in March 1994 to develop its own cargo business with 747s, the first appearing in summer 1994. Customers included Atlas Air, China Airlines, Emirates, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, and Varig. Although the overall cargo market had grown by more than 50% in the preceding decade, the number of new companies offering tailor-made contract and leasing packages had also increased.
            </p>
            <p>
             After moving in 1995 from
             <strong>
              Miami to Columbus, Ohio
             </strong>
             (although SAT became a Nevada corporation), toward the end of the decade the burden of new equipment costs and increased competition led to financial problems. Proposed acquisitions by Fine Air and Kitty Hawk failed to materialize after a buyer for the L-100 fleet could not be found, and Southern Air Transport ceased operations on September 25, 1998. On October 1, with liabilities of $101 million ($150m), SAT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

             At Columbia’s Zuckerman Institute, we believe that understanding how the brain works — and gives rise to mind and behavior — is the most urgent and exciting challenge of our time. Led by Rui Costa, DVM, PhD, and Nobel laureates Richard Axel, MD and Eric Kandel, MD, we study critical aspects of the mind and brain, gaining insights that promise to benefit people and societies everywhere.
