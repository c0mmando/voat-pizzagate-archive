             So lets have our talk tomorrow. Vice.com has little boy rapist writing stories for them and they are writing stories about the Jewish child rape assembly line I put on John's blog. Also the lawsuit against bolt for the Palestinian BBQ photo was a bit rich.  When the OTO sued truthnews.com.au Brendan O'Connel's first interview was removed along with all of mine. Funny David Bottrill ask for that too?

             If these get censored in the next week I'll know who to blame for a child sex coverup. I hope you should find my anti-pedophilia activism an admirable enedevour when the mainstream media covers up cases again and again like these:

             And that's the half of it. They were edited out of the gayby baby film NSW Police attended HomeBush Girl's high school. Police forcing kids to watch movies about gay men who treat asian women like $1 a hour ($6000 for 9 months ) hookers to breed babies for gay men - that's what gay marriage is about. I got tammy lynne charles jailed in Cambodia with my tip-off they acted on - and i'm sending her to jail in Thailand next through interpol. She was saying gay men can put their AIDS semen in a 3rd world HomoNazi Baby Factory breeder for a little extra on their website, like this SOB says too who is threatening my father.

            <p>
             This is what you are in the aleph.org.au news for supporting.  I don't like people who support women like my wife only with poorer financial situations being treated like the lowest cost demonstrator to breed for the gay elite of Australia, risking their health and lives in some cases. Countries and races are judged how they treat their women and children. If you support gay marriage you should support Jewish Surrogates for Gayby Babies breeding because you can't say gay families and gay marriage isn't linked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Barnett (aleph.org.au) is bragging about censoring Australian Jewish News through Garry Burns threats.  It's time you come to realize this is your last chance for an off the books allaince to take down the pedophilia normalization of the ADB &amp; CO. Tim Wilson of Humanrights.gov.au bought a baby from New Life IVF who didn't even tell the surrogates gay men were buying the babies. He broke 10C NSW Crimes Act / Surrogacy Act - 2 years jail to procure his Thai babies.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you don't talk to me tomorrow to talk about a terms for a truce / writing your affdavit - I WILL RELEASE THE JEWISH CUSTOMERS OF NEW LIFE IVF and their re-branded operations in Cambera first on victimsofgaybullying.com (coming soon) who are guilty of human trafficking charges in Thailand / Nepal Cambodia FIRST. Remember the Jewish IDF is complicit in this human trafficking of gayby baby flesh. The harm I can do to your position in measurable. This is your last chance to make the wise move.

            With all this talk of having to backup sources with links... (which I did completely - or for at least for the items Vindicator had a crack at saying I didn't at his rush job censorship).... The mods here have put Q stuff on sticky. Since when has he backed up claimjs or musing with links in any Q posts. You are lucky to get a picture. So I thought to myself. Let's make it interesting...

            Now I'm out for a nap after being awake nearly 24 hours. See you in 24 hours if the thread is still here after I've had a nap, gone to work, had another nap, you know that thing humans need to do if they aren't being bullied to do the impossible and hang around here trying to fix something that isn't broken. So consider this a request for an extension - not for me - but for the mods to debunk this - or at least make a better showing of it:

            The first attempt was to tell me they would delete the post in 24 hours and not put the tag will be deleted in 24 hours in the top right corner until I reminded them later to lul me into false sense of security. That didn't work. If you can't find that in the discussion here or that's been accused of being a baseless claim, I've got a pdf of this thread taken when I said I took it.

            Can't have mods demanding me to do what's already done  and then give a deadline for compliance when people need to sleep. They have failed to articulate why it should be censored siting claims arn't proven. The questions Vindicator asked can all be answered by reading the post slowly and clicking on all links. I'm sure normal users who don't have an agenda are all capable of reading the post and answering

I got banned for posting this link on Q-Live chat yesterday, and boy are they trying to shut it down on PIZZAGATE as the up-vote gets close to 80% positive.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the OP will not come back here only give you the links now as I have been accused of "dominating" discussion. So it's all yours here. Enjoy!

            Guys this is massive. Googling the MSM there seems to be more stories of homosexual pedophiles in the USA at big brothers big sisters than the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America combined, and I have the illegal to resubmit leaked boy scouts of America perversion file database export. Let me know if you want it.  And all that was even before they had a non-discrimination policy for homosexuals that split boy scouts of America in half. Jewishcare.com.au / USA Big Brothers Big Sisters did it back in 2002, and Christians/Doctors warned what would happen and boy it did.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Alternative to the JewishCare Big Brothers Big Sisters gay men and little boys dating site (for friendship OR…. ) Bikers Against Child Abuse were blocked in Australia due to the legal mafia making thought crime laws against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask yourself WHY?
           </p>
           <p>
            Google "Big Brothers Big Sisters" pedophile or other terms and be shocked how we missed this all these years. There is a massive problem. Mostly homosexual pedophiles in search results (first page 100%) yet homosexual pedophiles only 10% of the pedophile base, 1% of the population and account for 35% of all child abuse. Even by the facts from US CDC, "pubmed homosexuality pedophilia", and bravehearts child abuse fact sheet I got banned for sharing on Q Lies CNN this is massively over-represented.

             was that you? You are quick with those down-voat-es man. Any where I go straight to the bottom. Stalking on other forums saying it's wrong to do activism that might force the deep state to kill a pedophile. Ouch.

            GTFO until you can respond to that properly. If it ain't broken don't fix it. All "claims" you refer to are false.  Now you have resorted to strawman arguments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell me one claim from Vindicator that doesn't already have the source to back it up in the OP? Please do. We are all waiting.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not rocket science. You can't answer the question. You just troll and use strawman now. We are going to censor your post because of debunked claims a moderator made in a rage attack for criticizing him bullying a new user

           </p>
           <p>
            I mean if Vindicator didn't do a rush job he could have found some claims without sources. It's pathetic really. You guys shot yourself in the foot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which single claim he said doesn't have the proof in the op OR in the comments (i.e. the copy and paste of articles in comments from google of literally 100s of homosexual pedophiles using big brothers big sisters to get access to the most vulnerable children nixes his first point and even then how to find them was referenced in the OP as a source - but you want a hyperlink to google search results not the exact query to type in which gives exactly the same result.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's called being a pedantic XXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX-shill censor. And that was your best attempt so far at trying to support something Vindicator said. You are failing hard. Let it go let it go...

              is right, and I'll explain to you how you are wrong. If you can't do that you just want to censor because if a jew fucks a baby NOTHING IS WRONG. I A JEW FUCKS A BABY AT JEWISH CARE ITS SO AWESOME. Because that's the message the mods are sending. It's making me sick.

            You know this is a lot to digest and it jumps all over the place. Are you saying that the foster agency that is sponsored by Disney has links to pedophile cases that have been wrongfully dismissed by gay judges?
           </p>
           <p>
            How many children get placed with gay parents through this agency? Geez it’s a mess of a situation, I am sorry your friends are in trouble for exposing all of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess if you take it slow break it down with pictures sketches linking all the ties it will be much easier to understand, maybe then forward the information to as many people as you can that cover child abuse, hoping it will get traction. A simple overview will really go a long way.

             The gays only foster care agency is another story. That's exposed in the Jim Fetzer interview. Fostercare.lwb.org.au giving awards to gay men who get done for raping kids who just happened to be mentioned in the OP.
            </p>
            <p>
             See this video:

            <p>
             Jewishcare.com.au isn't a foster care agency. It's another level all together. Foster kids need more opportunities to be abused - so jewishcare.com.au set's up a dating play date site for gay men and children and were the first to say we love gays with little boys by making a "no discrimination policy" even in the USA back in 2002 triggering Christians that predicted a torrents of abuse that did happen if you JUST USE GOOOGLE DAMN IT. "big brothers big sisters" pedophile. Pretty much only homosexual pedophiles come up. Are we not surprised?

               They are famous for sponsoring hospitals and killing fag child rapists / murderers when the cops didn't do their job (that's what the wood royal commission was about directed away from gay pedophiles by 4 submissions from Chrstopher Puplick AM queer hero and the gay boy raping judge Woods saying "we can't scandalize the judiciary" when it was getting too close to home for him.)

                Geez there you go again, clearly you are not speaking to me but just hashing oodles and oodles of information. When you speak to people like this it really doesn’t make them want to invest hours of their time into your research, just saying.

             NO - Jewishcare.com.au had a crown prosecutor child rapist Dr Patrick Power exposed int he now redacted ABC Australian Story episode embedded in the OP working for them Patrick Power who used JewishCare.com.au troubled boy councelling as an excuse to get a lesser sentence when really it just shows how committed he was to grooming little boys. He helped do law reform that makes it a crime for a child to violently resist (i.e. murder) the older homosexual trying to rape them because gays were angry some children preserved their anal virginity and got off too lightly defending it.

             That corrupt DPP head Nicholas Cowdery not only screwed me over in the beginning of the 60C saga he let Christopher Pupick Australia's newest gay jew judge off the hook for faking fake gay hate crimes so his boyfriend "bunny" could pay back the spending money he "borrowed" from his sugar daddy. I'll expose that in my next thread here, I already exposed half of it but

              It’s hard to break down masses amounts of information and I can appreciate what your saying but it is essential for those around you to understand it better in hope of supporting you and fueling the truth to get out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your writing style is hard to follow, I visualize you as someone who possibly speaks too fast and gets really excited about what they are saying. This in some ways makes my head spin with all the information you are providing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I really don’t think people are trying to sensor you, they are just finding it hard to follow and understand. This is just my humble opinion and I pray you find a way to communicate and expose this darkness well, for the sake of the children.
             </p>

                No worries, I have family there so it interests me but it’s hard to follow when the format is presented awkwardly and that is why I said something.

                It is certainly tough in here and there is a lot of information to sift through. It would be so much easier if people took the time to break it down into more manageable
                <em>
                 easy to understand
                </em>
                submissions. There are only so many hours in the day and this
                <em>
                 heavy hitting subject
                </em>
                is best explained in a simple way.

                I just hope he gets it and sees it as an opportunity to improve his writting style and communication skills, after all this is a serious topic and information shared should be presented accordingly.

This thread is abandoned by the OP. It's like flogging a dead horse trying to make them listen to reason. For the new intel go to 8chan. Really I tried - hard at first. But I managed to unmask

Not about him at Jewishcare like so many other gay pedophiles arrested in the USA using this man boy love Jewish operated dating site.

            Even Wikipedia says that is a lie. Sodomy laws are normally only used against pedophiles - and not enforced. Your country even has transgender rights.

            Australian government has ruled you don't have bad a character if you download child porn - because the pedophile above whilst in jail in the USA is still sponsoring his boyfriends visa in Australia right now. Under Australian law you must be of good character to sponsor a migrant into Australia - and visa's are cancelled if immigration is informed otherwise. Immigration blocked my email because the manager was gay - and decided that child porn isn't bad character - as exposed above.

            A public statement that you don't kill gays to restore the honor of your country on the international human rights stage contrary to the public statement's by Australian political leaders - and that this homosexual put in Australia near Australian children by the Greens party lobbying and a pedophile singing the sponsorship forms is removed as per the law without any risk to his person as sodomy laws aren't enforced and has no right to stay in Australia as a refugee or on a child pornographer of "good character" sponsored gay partner visa. He never had a right to stay in Australia even before the visa was granted as he was an illegal immigrant over-stayer. Greens used gay rights as a platform to help him queue jump, avoid deportation and a 5 year ban that even non-homosexuals get for breaking the immigration laws before they can marry.

            What you choose to say about Lee Rhiannon former spokesperson for gay rights of the Australian Greens party is not my decision but I know what I would do. She's already lost the ability to rejoin the next government, and has under investigation for parliamentary expenses fraud. There will be little detriment to international relations condemning her actions in league with pedophiles to attack Pakistan with baseless lies, and to be honest the majority of the Australian voting population will THANK YOU!

            I am tired of repeating myself. You have failed to find a single one of vindicator's justification for censorship points that don't have sources and links in the OP backing up my claim everything he in his rushed censorship attempt made after I mentioned maybe he shouldn't' be giving at 24 hour warning to a brand new user saying never link to a blog about the OTO - you got to copypaste the whole blog into a goat formatted discuss post. Great way to recruit new users here like

           <p>
            SPOKANE, Wash. - Child rape suspect and Veterans Affairs Hospital physician Craig Morgenstern volunteers for the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program, the organization confirmed to KHQ's Gabe Cohen on Friday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Brothers, Big Sisters CEO Darin Christensen said Morgenstern stopped volunteering in March 2013, and only mentored 1 child during his time with the company. Christensen said they have talked with authorities since Morgenstern's arrest on Child Rape and Possession of Child Pornography charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Christensen also confirmed the child Morgenstern mentored is not the child the suspected rape a week ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Brothers, Big Sisters Darin Christensen CEO released the following statement on Friday:
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to confirm that Dr. Craig Morgenstern was a mentor in the Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Inland Northwest program. Dr. Morgenstern was only ever matched to one child during his connection with Big Brothers Big Sisters. His mentoring match ended in March of 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            We contacted Stevens County law enforcement, per their community wide request, Wednesday evening in immediate response to the allegations regarding Dr. Morgenstern. We are actively working with law enforcement and providing information as it is specifically required. Because of the ongoing investigation we defer to law enforcement for specifics related to these allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are deeply saddened by the allegations and want to express our wishes of support to the young man, his family and any others who may have been effected [sic] by this.

           <p>
            Morgenstern was taken into custody by Federal agents Thursday night as he was attempting to post bond at the Stevens County Jail. On Thursday, Morgenstern was in court after being arrested Wednesday night when detectives found child pornography in his home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Morgenstern was initially arrested by the Stevens County Sheriff's Office on Monday after detectives spent the weekend investigating the claim that he sexually assaulted a 13-year-old boy at his home Friday night. After compiling evidence, Morgenstern was arrested Monday and charged with Second Degree Rape of a Child. He posted his $100,000 bond set by the judge and returned home. Following an additional search of his home by detectives, he was arrested on the charge of Possession of Child Pornography on Wednesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Thursday, Morgenstern faced a Stevens County judge again, who set his bail at $250,000 for the Possession of Child Pornography charge. Later that day, as Morgenstern was attempting to post bail at the Stevens County Jail, Federal Agents came and took him into custody on a US Marshals hold. He was then taken to the Spokane County Jail.

            Already answered that. You just keep repeating BS. Here's a quote from the OP instead of a reference to it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Committees such as the Council of the Big Sister, Big Brother Scheme.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Saw that in the OP? Patrick Power was on the board of big brothers big sisters or "council". Management Council. Go read their annual reports linked to in here on the word DISNEY.

            No I was trolled because you don't want me to do my next tri-fecta post on who Australia has the gatekeeper against FOI's and journalists and all of his pedophilia / mass rape history. I'm not feeding the trolls anymore. I'm pdfing this whole page and moving on the the next topic. Like I said I just want the intellectual honesty on why you want to censor this rather than down-voting comments and up-voting debunked lies that things weren't proven when they were.
           </p>

            I've go the the moral high ground here and you know it. Sorry.

            I cant fit 20 pages of google search results on gay men infiltrating big brothers big sisters like the catholic church that is not blasphemy to be against as I told you its already over the 20,000 or whatever it is character limit.  It was never going to fit int he OP and you know it. This is a rigged game. Did I not prove it in the comments going through the first 7 results from google and pasting their results in here for faaks sake.

            what edits? No don't change the subject. What is vindicator saying is wrong with this post that you agree with / disagree with in his comment that got upvoted by 6 mods shills or whatever.

            Good stuff you support the censorship of. I'm getting confused. Please answer the question. Which points did vindicator use as an excuse to delete this post as not being sourced can you PERSONALLY not find a link in the OP that does prove they are sourced. In other words mods - do your job and put your own opinion on the line if vindicator is correct or not. Correct on all counts, or which counts or no counts as I say.

            Will you censor a fully SOURCED x3 Trifecta of rapist support post on Australia's newest &amp; greatest jewish gay judge of all time.
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy based on his history in Australia deserves to be more hated than the Mayor of London and that's only on the case of supporting the MSK Mass Muslim rapists of white women that kicked of the CRONULLA FUCKEN RIOTS....
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is the pedo mass rapists he supported Robert Dolly Dunn,
and all the money he gave to the first transgender to legally use a women's toilet who mass aids raped 4 women Noel Crompton Hall.
           </p>
           <p>
            If that who a government puts in charge of covering up FOI cases now that's all I need to tie it to PIZZAGATE - how far the system will go to put absoulute scum in charge of running obstruction against people trying to expose corruption, filth and pedophilia. I bet you will say "it's not related to pizzagate" or something. what's your plan to censor the next one based on the claims I will prove I just said above. Do say?

Because if we get the OTO outlawed because of their practice of forcing children in orgies - you know who is next? No wonder the Jews are going into bat for the OTO - it's just as bad as all the Oral [baby dick] suction talked about in JPOST.COM Jewish News.

            I questioned Vindicator's censorship of another post for the crime of linking to a good blog not re-typing it all up into a discuss post to a brand new user scared away now.
           </p>
           <p>
            His reaction was YOU QUESTIONED ME - IM GOING TO QUESTION YOU  IN A RUSH JOB OF CENSORSHIP. It was revenge. I questioned him politely and he went on a censorship bing. No I wont ping you in a post. This site isn't a moderator puff piece zone. It's a place where we go after pedophiles and I told you what it's going to be about not you, and only a small bit on vindicator explaining what a VD link means.

            Yeah I already have proven he has praised convicted pedophile fugitives and said they are a victim of a anti-gay- wichhunt and are innocent until proven guilty.

            rapidly deleted before flagging this one. I said that's fine. I'll bring it all back with an index of deleted comments in a new discuss post. Better for everyone - more effective acctivim against said pedo judge that way.

            That's assuming I"m not banned before I can take the "pedo judge" down. No you are moderating the OP not every single god damn comment I make to defend the OP that backed up it's claims now... Stay focused. What claim in the OP that I made you claim is not proven now the first list from vindicator are all false and there are links to prove most big claims?

            as much as we bitch here the OP still has all the claims vindicator said I didn't prove actually proven. It's so simple... ok smoke... it's a trap! away from the keyboard.

            did i say that? look it's there somewhere I think i listed the rebuttals to vindicator 1-5... anyway i need my nicotine fix.

            I can't fix it if it aint broken. Old Australian proverb.  Actually it should be the mod proverb. Don't fix it if it ain't broken.

            I used a ":" instead of a bbcode hyperlink to indicate here is the case where the judge ruled the boy had an anal sex gay dads son sex crush so his daddies charged with "treating their foster son like a personal prostitute" according to MSM are innocent and the boy made it all up in his gay dads son anal fantasy.

            before the police since 2013 and there are court documents that prove that. The video my dad was sued for linking to referred to them by their old twitter handle

            and garry sued my dad and photocopied it (a homo pedo) saying don't link to a video that has hate speech against these gay men. And whilst the court case was going on for 3 years THOSE 2 GAY MEN GOT CHARGED WITH SON RAPE. You can't make this shit up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go look up the video i talked about my dad was accused of the crime of linking to about 20 times here. And look for the rip_n_roll guys mention in the youtube description (the puff piece video on youtube.com/hojuruku).
           </p>
           <p>
            That for example I couldn't fix at all with a cut and paste moving the links closer to their associated claim.

            What is the profile of a pedophile? An average pedophile will offend 200–400 times before being caught, if ever. The vast majority of offenders do not get caught, and they have no criminal records. According to the FBI, only one out of ten cases of child sexual abuse is reported to law enforcement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of the statistics on these types of crimes are gleaned from incarcerated perpetrators, who have provided civil authorities with an inside view into the lives of pedophiles. This information has helped law enforcement authorities ascertain that only the tip of the iceberg is being disclosed and reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophiles usually begin their pattern of behavior while still teens. If they are apprehended at a young age, intense rehabilitation has been found to have success. The vast majority of child molesters are male, and most sexual abusers were sexually abused as children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rather than appearing to be “monsters,” perpetrators usually try to be very charming and friendly. After gaining widespread trust, over time, some eventually even head nonprofit organizations of various kinds dealing with youth, giving the molesters not only easy access but also free rein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophiles tend to rationalize their sexual interests and validate their behavior. They tend to show an excessive interest in children, and often seduce children with attention, affection and gifts. They lie and manipulate, typically very skillfully.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is normal for children to learn early on that their survival depends on adults. Besides fulfilling the emotional and physical needs of children, adults are bigger and stronger. Children are instructed to respect and obey adults, but the exceptions to this need to be clearly taught as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Teen/adult child molesters exploit their size and status to influence and control a child's behavior, enticing the child into sexual activity. Clever and experienced child molesters lower a child's inhibitions by gradually seducing them, easily exploiting a child's natural curiosity and the lack of prevention education that a particular child may have.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even children who are getting attention and affection at home still appreciate it from others in their lives. It is important to realize that all children, even those from “normal” homes, are at risk from a molester's seduction techniques, if they have not been trained how to deal with them. Although all children are at risk, pedophiles particularly seek out shy and naive children; children with disabilities; and children who are experiencing loneliness, emotional neglect or strong feelings of alienation. Children who are not educated about child molesters are the most vulnerable of all.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, since large numbers of children are now being raised in single-parent families, this is seen as advantageous by child molesters. Many working parents are overly desperate for readily available babysitters and those offering extra free attention to their children. Pedophiles master manipulative skills and use them most effectively on troubled children by first building up the child's self-esteem, appealing to their need to be heard, understood and valued.
           </p>
           <p>
            Showering their prospective victims with attention, offenders may also offer treats, trips to desirable places that children enjoy, or special privileges. Once a child has accepted many “kind” offers from the molester, it becomes increasingly more difficult for the child to assert him- or herself and refuse the molester's advances, which tend to get more confusing very gradually.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once pedophiles have chosen their potential victims, they work hard at patiently developing relationships with them. Since this grooming process can sometimes go on for years, it is common for pedophiles to cultivate many prospective victims at a time. A large number of predators believe that what they are doing is not wrong, and that being intimate with a child is actually “healthy” for the child. After extended molestation, children and preteens can actually grow attached to their offender and become jealous when the offender's attention goes to others who are younger, once they have reached a certain age. Their entire lives have been colored by the abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much information about how molesters operate has been gained by interviewing incarcerated offenders. The perpetrators invariably explain how they identify their potential victims by assessing their vulnerability as well as the opportunity to offend. The gullibility and naivete of the children are main factors considered by offenders when selecting their victims. They choose those whom they ascertain can be manipulated into a vulnerable situation, and then the children's vulnerability is further exploited.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is extremely hard to stand up to a molester if a child has not been proactively prepared beforehand to do so. Offenders often progressively test their victims to see their reactions, by getting physically too close for comfort with them, by making somewhat suggestive comments or “off-color” jokes, or by roughhousing with them. They make deliberately confusing statements like, “Sometimes friends/family will help each other and touch each other.” Predators commonly first begin to touch private parts of the victim's body by brushing up against them “accidentally on purpose.” If confronted, the perpetrators have a ready excuse like “I was just kidding” or “it was an accident.” When the victim does not stop the predator's incremental advances, this is viewed by the offender as a signal to progress further.
           </p>
           <p>
            An offender may put added pressure on the victim if he senses that there is still potential to molest, by saying something like “You're hurting my feelings by saying no.” When children are molested, they are left enormously guilt-ridden. Even though what happened to them was not their fault, they still feel like it was.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children are also left deeply confused, as they may often feel like they cooperated if they enjoyed both the attention as well as the physical sensations that come with the molestation. This is one major reason why it is difficult for children to disclose that they were preyed upon, as they may not even understand what they experienced until many years later. They are usually left feeling “dirty” and intensely ashamed, largely blaming themselves for the most intimate type of predation that they were lured, tricked, and sometimes threatened into enduring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once a child has become a victim of a particular predator, the re-victimization can often take on a repetitive and ritualistic nature. When the molestation continues over long periods of time, the child may often cope by essentially separating the offender into two different people when dealing with his or her “uncle &amp; monster,” “older brother &amp; rapist” or “youth group leader &amp; predator,” for example, while watching his or her perpetrator parade around, respected and above reproach.
           </p>
           <p>
            If predators are ever caught by adults unfamiliar with how offenders operate, the molesters typically and quickly claim either that the child was the seducer, or that it was the first time that they ever did anything like that, and provide some “plausible” excuse for why it happened just that one time. It is standard practice for offenders to express great remorse, insisting in a very convincing way that they feel terrible about what they did, and of course, they promise that they “will never do it again.”
           </p>
           <p>
            As people who genuinely want to make this world a better place, we try very hard to give people the benefit of the doubt. We strive to not speak badly about people. And we believe that people can repent for their wrong deeds. Pedophiles know this, and they take advantage of our sincere efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why it is important for us to learn and to teach others about the things you never wanted to know about pedophiles.
           </p>

            Pointers for Parents:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Calmly and clearly, teach your children about personal safety, in age-appropriate ways, from age three and up, each year adding on more age-appropriate details. Role-playing different scenarios is a very effective proactive tool. Try to prevent your children from learning about this in a much harder way.

Be wary, and openly communicate through calm and concerned questions, with a child if he or she appears to be uncharacteristically uncomfortable or expresses negativity around a particular adult male or teen—even if the person is a neighbor, close friend of the family, relative, or respected community member.

             Educating the children is of utmost importance.  Parents need to arm them about grooming tactics and to even Say No to any one in authority.  Pedophiles in authority know they have the upper hand and use their positions of power to seduce children.  Thank you for especially for the grooming information.  We must have trust and faith in our children and believe them if they come to us with a story of abuse.  WE MUST BELIEVE OUR CHILDREN.

            <pre><code>Be wary, and openly communicate through calm and concerned questions, with a child who is receiving special favors or gifts from an adult male or teen.

Be wary, and openly communicate through calm and concerned questions with a child, if anybody—including teachers, coaches, counselors, youth group leaders, doctors or babysitters, as well as relatives, ever meets privately in a room with a closed door with a child for any reason, or goes off with them to any place where they are alone.

If a child discloses that he or she has been sexually abused, never blame the child for any of their actions or for not telling you sooner. Victims of abuse require support.

If a child discloses that he or she has been sexually abused, don't rely on anyone else to fulfill your obligation. Call 911.

Remember that perpetrators can look you right in the eye and lie easily. They are masters of deception. Leave investigations for forensic experts.

            Big Brothers Big Sisters open to homosexual mentors
by Lawrence Morahan, posted Friday, July 19, 2002 (15 years ago)
Email To Friend
           </p>
           <p>
            WASHINGTON (BP)--The national youth mentoring organization Big Brothers Big Sisters of America has implemented a policy that bans discrimination against open homosexuals as volunteers and mentors of children at its 500 affiliates around the United States, CNSNews.com reported July 18.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the policy essentially puts the children at risk of being molested, a family group has warned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Brothers Big Sisters on July 1 put into effect a resolution approved by the organization's leadership not to exclude any mentor on the basis of "race, age, color, religion, national origin, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran status, or disability."
           </p>
           <p>
            Noreen Shanfelter, a BBBSA spokeswoman, said the non-discrimination policy essentially is not new.
           </p>
           <p>
            At its annual meeting in February, the national membership, which includes donors, passed a resolution calling for the policy that's already in effect at the national level to be the practice at all of its affiliates around the country, she said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We believe there can be qualified mentors in any of the categories, and that's the reason for the non-exclusion," Shanfelter said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Family groups, however, have condemned the move. William Maier, a child and family psychologist with Focus on the Family, is urging parents to contact BBBSA's corporate sponsors to protest the policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family, who endorses BBBSA in his book "Bringing Up Boys," rescinded his endorsement and said he will remove the group as a referral organization in future editions, Maier said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Family groups have many concerns with the policy, Maier said. "Given the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, it seems just reckless and irresponsible for Big Brothers Big Sisters to be initiating this new policy," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research indicates a large number of homosexual men seek adolescent males or boys as sexual partners, Maier said. Some researchers found that 73 percent of the homosexual men they surveyed had engaged in sex with boys ages 16 to 19 or younger, he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many pedophiles consider themselves to be homosexual, he added. A study of 229 convicted child molesters found that 86 percent of offenders who molested boys described themselves as homosexual or bisexual, Maier said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Even putting aside the pedophilia issue, the question is, How can a gay man teach a fatherless boy what it means to be a husband and a father? And how can a lesbian woman teach a girl without a mom what it means to be a wife and a mother? They're unable to provide that.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The decision just seems completely irresponsible on the part of Big Brothers Big Sisters," Maier said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maier accused the organization of caving to the kind of pressure militant homosexuals and their allies put on the Boy Scouts of America.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I do believe that it's politically motivated," he said. "I can't see how this could be in the best interest of children."
           </p>
           <p>
            When he worked as a child and family psychologist at the Long Beach Child Guidance Center in California, Maier said he referred hundreds of single mothers to Big Brothers Big Sisters.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I believed so strongly in what that organization does and what they stand for and I have supported them for years and I would continue to support them if they would rescind this new policy," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maier also expressed concern about the organization's school-based program in which school officials match up the child with the mentor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although the parent or guardian gives permission for the child to be in the program, the child could be matched up with a homosexual without the parent's knowledge or consent, Maier said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In other words, that decision is made by the school, and the parent may have no knowledge of that," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shanfelter said it's standard Big Brothers Big Sisters policy to thoroughly screen volunteer applicants and reject anyone it believes would not be safe and effective. The organization also seeks to honor individual preferences of the parents or guardians when selecting which volunteer will be matched with their child, she said.

            Boy describes sexual assault by mentor (Big Brother-Big sister pedophile)
Las Vegas Review-Journal ^ | 4-29-05 | Glen Puit
           </p>
           <p>
            Posted on 4/29/2005, 10:26:22 PM by Nevadan
           </p>
           <p>
            Comments detailed in grand jury transcripts in former Las Vegas medical resident's case
           </p>
           <p>
            Newly released court documents detail the case against a Las Vegas pediatric resident accused of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old boy he met through Big Brothers Big Sisters.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Glenn Evans, 32, was indicted by a grand jury earlier this month on 50 felonies.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the grand jury proceedings that led to the indictment, the victim testified that a counselor referred him to Big Brothers Big Sisters because he was having trouble with his parents' divorce.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I was seeing a counselor and they said it would be a good thing to get me in a program called Big Brothers Big Sisters," the child testified. "So then I did. So my mom got me into Big Brothers Big Sisters. So then, one day we went there and met Mr. David Evans, and so then he got me my birthday present, which is (a trip to) Shark Reef (at Mandalay Bay) and this remote-control car."
           </p>
           <p>
            The child said Evans eventually took him camping in California. While getting ready to go swimming, he noticed Evans was taking photos of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I was getting undressed to go swimming and he picked his camera up and I saw a flash," the child said. "I said,
            <code>
             Did you just take a picture of me?' And he's like,
            </code>
            Yeah.' "
           </p>
           <p>
            Subsequently, the child spent several nights at Evans' house, and during those encounters, he said he was photographed during acts that included oral sex and anal intercourse.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Now, when you would go and spend the night at Mr. Evans' house, where would you sleep?" Clark County prosecutor Thomas Moreo asked the boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            "On the bed next to him," the child replied.
           </p>
           <p>
            "What did you think of that?" Moreo asked.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I really didn't like it," the child said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The boy confirmed that he was photographed in numerous sexually explicit photos found on Evans' computer.
           </p>
           <p>
            "He told me one time not to tell my mom," the child said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I didn't like it," the child said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Why did you allow him to do it?" the prosecutor asked.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Because I was scared," he replied.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities announced the arrest of Evans late last year on sexual assault and child pornography charges after Evans' roommate found child pornography on Evans' computer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Las Vegas police Detective Michael Castaneda told the grand jury that an inspection of Evans' computer revealed a large cache of photos of Evans with the 10-year-old and also with another boy. The second boy is pictured naked and masturbating during a camping trip Evans took with the child in California, as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            California authorities have filed similar charges against Evans there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evans' attorney, Gabriel Grasso, declined comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evans was a resident in the pediatric medicine program at the University of Nevada School of Medicine and had been performing his residency for six months at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center and at University Medical Center.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no evidence that he committed crimes against children in his capacity as a doctor at those hospitals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Brothers Big Sisters of Nevada is an award-winning charity that pairs adults with children in need of guidance. The agency has about 500 different mentorships in the Las Vegas Valley.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a statement issued shortly after Evans' arrest, the organization expressed disappointment and sadness about the allegations against Evans.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We are shocked and deeply saddened by the news that he has been identified in connection with allegations of child pornography and sexual assault," the organization said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Big Brothers Big Sisters has zero tolerance for abuse and we will continue to refine our practices to ensure the safety of all the children we serve."

            Bond set for Big Brothers/Big Sisters mentor
Wednesday, October 1st
News Image
Balko also works as a clerk in an auto parts store.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that a former volunteer for the Pinellas County Big Brothers Big Sisters program will remain in jail on charges he molested a 10-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's because a Pinellas County judge set bond for 26-year-old Kevin Balko at $1.5 million on Wednesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detectives with the St. Petersburg Police Department brought Balko in for questioning on Tuesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            At some point during that interrogation, Balko allegedly confessed to taking part in some criminal activity. When it was over, he was led off to jail in handcuffs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Balko is facing five counts of capital sexual battery for molesting a 7-year-old boy and one count of committing a lewd and lascivious act on the boy’s 10-year-old sister.
           </p>

Police say Balko worked as a volunteer mentor with the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program of Pinellas County. He had been working with the boy as part of the program when the alleged crimes took place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detectives say the boy’s older sister was the first to bring Balko’s alleged behavior to their attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            News Image
A judge set a $1.5 million bond for Balko.
"From interviewing the female child, she [said] she had a sibling and [then] I interviewed the sibling, the 7-year-old, and he gave me some information about the behavior of the defendant," said Detective Lorry Dunn, who works with the department's Crimes Against Children unit. "That also led me to believe that I needed to interview him [Balko]."
           </p>
           <p>
            Soon after talking to Dunn, Balko was arrested. Susan Ralston, the CEO of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Pinellas County released a statement in reaction to Balko’s arrest.
           </p>
           <p>
            News Image
A background check on Balko turned up nothing.
"We are shocked and deeply saddened by the news that one of our former volunteers has been identified in connection with an allegation of sexual abuse," said the statement. "We express our sincerest sympathy to all of those affected."
           </p>
           <p>
            The statement also gave details of the screening process a mentoring volunteer must go through prior to being accepted into the program. The St. Petersburg Police also did a thorough background check on Balko and found nothing.

            For the 1st time, Big Brothers- Big Sisters require gay mentors
           </p>
           <p>
            By WILLIAM J MAIER
           </p>
           <p>
            t's a brave new world at your local Big Brothers-Big Sisters office. As of this month, the Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America (BBBSA) will require that all 500 of its local affiliates include active homosexuals as volunteers and mentors to children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many parents who support Big Brothers-Big Sisters may be surprised to learn that their child could soon be paired with a gay or lesbian mentor. In fact, parents whose children are enrolled in the organization's school-based programs will not even be told when their son or daughter is matched with a gay man or a lesbian woman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children who are involved in BBBSA programs are primarily from single-parent homes. Many of these kids are emotionally fragile and desperate for attention and affirmation from an adult of their own gender. Yet the national board of directors of BBBSA (at the urging of local agencies in New York and New Jersey) has determined that these boys and girls should be paired with homosexual mentors.
           </p>
           <p>
            In light of the ongoing sex scandal involving Catholic priests, the new policy of "inclusion" by Big Brothers-Big Sisters appears reckless and irresponsible. Many of the priests charged with sexually abusing children and adolescents have admitted they are homosexuals. They used their position of authority to sexually violate those who trusted them the most. BBBSA's decision to match fatherless boys, starving for male attention, with gay men is a recipe for disaster.
           </p>
           <p>
            While gay activists insist that there is no connection between homosexuality and the sexual abuse of children, the evidence indicates that a substantial number of gay men seek adolescent males or boys as sexual partners.
           </p>
           <p>
            A study in "Archives of Sexual Behavior" found that homosexual men are attracted to young males, including those as young as age 15. Gay researchers Karla Jay and Allen Young once reported that 73 percent of the gay men they surveyed had engaged in sex with boys 16 to 19 years of age or younger. It is also important to note that many pedophiles consider themselves to be homosexual. A study of 229 convicted child molesters found that 86 percent of offenders who molested boys described themselves as homosexual or bisexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Themes of adult-child sex are common in gay publications. The nation's largest gay publisher, Alyson Publications, which distributes "Daddy's Roommate" and other books that promote homosexuality to children, publishes books advocating man-boy sex, including: "Paedophilia: The Radical Case," which contains detailed information on how to engage in sexual relations with young boys, and "The Age Taboo," which claims "Boy-lovers are not child molesters. The child abusers are parents who force their staid morality onto the young people in their custody."
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly not all homosexuals are pedophiles. However, perhaps Big Brothers-Big Sisters should pay heed to the words of gay activist Michael Swift. Writing in the Gay Community News, Swift states:
           </p>
           <p>
            "We shall sodomize your sons, emblems of your feeble masculinity, of your shallow dreams and vulgar lies. We shall seduce them in your schools, in your dormitories, in your gymnasiums, in your locker rooms, in your sports arenas, in your seminaries, in your youth groups, in your movie theatre bathrooms, in your army bunkhouses, in your truck stops, in your all-male clubs, in your houses of Congress, wherever men are men together. Your sons will become our minions and do our bidding. They will be recast in our image. They will come to crave and adore us."
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully, those who share Swift's philosophy haven't applied to become Big Brothers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apart from concerns about pedophilia, is a child from a single-parent home best served by a gay or lesbian mentor?
           </p>
           <p>
            During early adolescence, many children experience a period of sexual-identity confusion when they can easily be influenced in either direction. A study in the journal "Pediatrics" surveyed 34,707 Minnesota teenagers and found that fully 25.9 percent of 12-year-olds were uncertain if they were gay or straight. Will young teens in the midst of forming their personal and sexual identities receive appropriate guidance and direction from homosexual mentors?
           </p>
           <p>
            Fatherless boys and motherless girls served by Big Brothers-Big Sisters are in desperate need of same-sex role models. Can a girl without a mom learn what it means to be a wife and a mother from a lesbian? Can a gay man teach a boy without a dad the skills he needs to be an effective husband and father?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why has Big Brothers-Big Sisters of America chosen to implement such an ill-advised new policy? Can it truly be in the best interests of children? It seems more likely that the organization is bowing to pressure from the same homosexual activists who have attacked the Boy Scouts. Perhaps BBBSA is fearful that if it refuses to embrace homosexual volunteers it will suffer the same criticism and cuts in funding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever the reason, BBBSA has obviously decided that the "rights" of homosexuals are more important than the safety and well being of the children it serves.

            Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a long-standing reputable organization which places children with same-sex adult mentors, has just enforced its 25-year nondiscrimination policy toward homosexual mentors as “law of the land” – now a binding policy on its over 500 local affiliates. Many within their ranks, as well as Americans around the country, are outraged.
           </p>
           <p>
            This 98-year-old youth organization has been instrumental in giving children hope, encouragement and the loving support they’ve needed to overcome their rocky start early on in life. The BBBSA has served as the much-needed bridge by assisting these children to successfully move on physically, mentally and emotionally – into adulthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly though, this past week, the near-century-old institution has become yet another trophy – the latest prize of the homosexual agenda’s grand scam to convert America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knocking down anyone and everyone in their path, homosexual activists continue their relentless media marketing of their “alternative lifestyle” as normal, inborn and unchangeable. They gloat over their ever growing tallies and lists of corporations, businesses and organizations which are “gay” friendly. They will do anything and everything to continue assimilating all of America into their web of deception. They want your tolerance and acceptance of their homosexual lifestyle – and they will not stop until they get it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Focus on the Family’s Bill Maier said that the BBBSA should realize that “matching fatherless boys, starving for attention, with homosexual men is reckless and irresponsible, not to mention a recipe for disaster.”
           </p>
           <p>
            As a former homosexual, I couldn’t agree more. Many of these children are already highly predisposed to going down the homosexual path. Unlike the “gay” spin we are constantly fed, no one is born homosexual. You don’t need to be a psychologist to figure out it has everything to do with the childhood.
           </p>
           <p>
            In most cases, this homosexual predisposition begins with the lack of relationship with the same-sex parent – whether physical or emotional. This is one of the key red flags of the beginning of homosexuality in a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the same-sex parent missing from the picture, the child gravitates toward the parent and peers of the opposite sex. In many cases, the child then tragically ‘detaches’ from members of their own sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            From early on in life, these children feel different from the rest of the boys or girls and feel they don’t measure up. It’s at this stage many boys begin taking on feminine qualities, and the girls develop masculine ones. An unnatural role reversal and questioning of gender begins to take place – as well as the homosexual thoughts, feelings and attractions toward their peers of the same-sex. Thus, the birthing of a homosexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Placing a child who is experiencing this “gender confusion” with a homosexual Big Brother or Big Sister can be the conduit into the homosexual lifestyle. Even more so, a child who has no sexual feelings towards those of the same sex can be easily influenced or swayed by a homosexual authority figure or role model who abuses their mentorship. Worst-case scenario: They can be sexually abused – and it has been going on for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big Brothers Big Sisters nondiscriminatory policy toward homosexuals is clearly an open door for tragedy and, unfortunately, the Big Brothers Big Sisters sex-abuse scandal is breaking even as we speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            On April 28, 2001, the Fox television show “America’s Most Wanted” featured a homosexual offender on-the-run who infiltrated the BBBSA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tim Brown, a “Big Brother” and 34-year-old homosexual pedophile, sexually molested his “Little Brother” – a 10-year-old boy the organization should have never placed with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1999, Brown became a volunteer mentor in the Salt Lake City Chapter of the Big Brothers Big Sisters program in Utah. Even though Big Brothers Big Sisters was well aware of Brown’s prior criminal record, the organization still allowed him and gave him full, unsupervised access to work with a boy in need of a positive, male role model.
           </p>
           <p>
            Salt Lake County Sheriff’s detectives say Brown betrayed the trust placed in him and used his status as a Big Brother to sexually abuse the little boy he was matched with. Charges: Aggravated sex abuse of a child, sodomy on a child, sexual exploitation of a minor, and dealing in harmful material to a minor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tim Brown was successfully apprehended by police four days later in Vancouver, Wash. – a direct result of the “America’s Most Wanted” broadcast – their 665th capture overall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, Brown’s case is not out of the ordinary. Go on the Internet yourself and a do a search. In the short time I did, I was shocked at the numerous counts I found of homosexual molestation cases of Big Brothers and Big Sisters nationwide.

            : Once again, I have to insist that you honor our submission rules. Every major claim must be sourced. Another way of putting that is research posts must not make any claims that aren't supported by linked evidence. You write:
           </p>

            That's five unsourced claims in just paragraph three. There are many more in this post as well. If you don't want to present carefully sourced research, that's fine -- but it has to go in

            , not here. I'm going to give this the edit flair to see if you can clean this up today. Maybe others can help you identify and find links for the other unsourced claims peppered throughout this post.

             Google "big brothers big sisters" pedophile - you will get only homosexual pedophiles coming up. A stupid number of cases. This is big! See all the comments I only pasted the google research results 1-7.. There are pages of the filth. They do match making and use websites for men to have friendship with boys. Dating sites have an option for only "friendship". In the case of big brothers big sisters it's also sexual more often than we would like.

             Dr Patrick power got jailed. I linked to his sentencing document on a website with all of his court papers on it in one place. It's also in the ABC documentary video embedded in the OP Australian story Take No Prisioners on the downfall of Nicholas Cowdery the DPP (DA in American Lingo). I quoted the fact in the only quote in the OP that proves he was on the board of big brothers big sisters and used all his free time trying to do phone counseling for troubled young boys. Just what every emotionally distressed young child with problems with their parents need - a gay crown prosecutor who likes child porn! Wow that makes him a really good person and that's why he deserves less jail. Based on what he is - I WOULD CALL THAT STATE / JEWISHCARE.COM.AU taxpayer subsidized GROOMING but away. HE WAS IN THAILAND WHEN THE COPS FOUND HIS PC FULL OF CHILD PORN (why Deh!) according to documentary you didn't watch before instaflagging this

             The Cowdery told him to rush home and clean up his house before the cops could get a warrant. That's what brought him down.

             I'm just saying - you guys get help if you think Vindicator's points are valid and you can't find the answer's to his questions he claims I didn't answer in the links in the post above then you are just proving you are all incompetent.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not for me to judge it's for 3rd parties looking at the OP and comparing it to Vindicator's censorship justifications rushed out minutes after I question his conduct bullying a brand new user posting an anti-OTO thread, and taking out anther 2 threads of mine just before that. If Vindicator took his time he could have found some things that didn't have source links in the OP to complain about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now I'm done on this thread. I was going to post 100s of other MSM news stories about GAYS abusing children at big brothers big sisters and maybe go through 100 pages of google queries get all that was out there and do a spreadsheet proving something is up with this jewish dating site for gay men and little boys but what's the point - the whole thread will be censored so I stopped doing that by the time I only got to #7 in the first page of the google search result. And by the fucken way that was the first thing he took offense to me saying when clearly it is SO TRUE.

             as his first critic how can you say US prosecutor's documents about masonic pedophiles not being arrested after confessing to rape little girls 3 years ago and having a "Satanic [OTO Crowley] Child abuse Manifesto" in addition to wallpaper of childporn through the house (the Emery brothers) - that has "NO RELATION TO PIZZAGATE" - Government admitting on letterhead VIP satanic pedophiles get special treatment as pedophiles and ooh SRA IS REAL according to prosecutors contary to all the papers saying it never existed on this planet by the likes of OTO pedo cult lawyer ianfreckleton.com.au
            </p>
            <p>
             You see I could do what the other guy did put it up on a blog pots and LINK TO THE COMPLETE BLOG POST - but then you will say go come back here and make a discuss post in 10,000 characters or less. The AFP (australian police) says to report crime  online to you on the phone you have like a SMS service on their website - like 200 words or something it's the same farce and no attachments and if you email them they say we'll jail you for the crime of emailing us proof.

             They want to be the perfect hospital with no patients or make it hard as possible to report crime.

              Any claims that isn't cited in the OP anyone can quickly google. This is clearly interference.

            </p>
            <p>
             The claim that all claims have to be linked to in the OP is BS too especially when there is not enough space to do so. I mean your first attempt at guessing things in the OP that are not proven actually all had links. For the things that don't you can challenge me in the comments and I can post links to back them up.
            </p>

             I guess the only solution to expose Jewishcare properly is put it all up on a blog post with more characters and formatting options to appease you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then I can have it banned just like you did here for the crime of not making a discuss post when you can't make a fully sourced in the OP discuss post. I'm surprised you picked 5 things that were proven in the OP when I can see other things that aren't proven in the OP you didn't point out above. That's because you rushed your attack as payback for questioning your judgement on another thread. All can see it.

             Just delete it. Do it. I'll just put it all on a blog and link to it from here. Is that what is best? If that is so remove the 24h flag from the OTO post with the other guy copping censorship that I went into bat for before you came after me.

               You inspired me to do my best work and I'm so greatful. It will be used to try and take down Australia's newest gay jew judge Christopher Puplick AM, prounced Poop-lick (I shit you not - and they give us shit about Bernard GAYnor's name - so all's fair in love and war I can do the same here).
              </p>
              <p>
               The post will be entitled (or something similar)
"Australia's newest gay jew judge Christopher Pooplick AM, who literally wrote the book on Gay Marriage in OZ MSM proven support of 3x convicted mass rapists"
Hint: MSK Mass RAPE case - tried to give them 40k - Premier had to make new law &amp; he tried to turn Australia into England where it's a crime to be against racist muslim gang rapes of white women - see the MSM saying that in the VD deleted posts, Noel Crompton Hall mass tranny AIDS Rapist, actually gave over 50k - accounted for but due to support from gendercentre.org.au he funds with taxpayer moneys going to Noel Cromton Hall and one other not accounted court case maybe it might be 250k. And finally a mass child anal rapist Robert "Dolly" Dunn connected to Australian government immigration boy rapists - where David Bottrill of the OTO works and his support of him where he said to investigate a number of gay pedophiles in a royal commission should never happen (even though it was headed by a gay judge who raped boys according to leaked documents from the royal commision to institutionalized child abuse that I'll rehost after they were censored from scribd) because to investigate them will upset other gays so for the sake of the feelings of all gays - gay pedophiles need to be given a free pass.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will take my time and totally destroy the king of Australian gay lobby because I"ve totally got the goods. He is personally quarterbacking the prosecution against sunol. A week after the OTO censored our blog he was confirmed as a judge. He shouldn't have known about my relationship to John Sunol as it was mostly kept out of case law when I called him but he did. He's totally in on it.

              <p>
               How many mass rapists of children and women do you have to support pubically before becomes a problem for you being a

               or in his case a new AAT judge? What's the number 4 or 5? I mean how many mass rapists are there? To actually go out there and support 3 in your life is a great achievement. And he supported them AFTER they were known to be mass rapists.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most claims made wont have links. The will have a pizzagate hyperlinked *VD next to it noting a MSM plagiarized source or something in a comment that was censored. VD means "Vindicator Deleted".

              <p>
               Because NONE OF YOU HAVE STILL TOLD ME AS IT STANDS WHAT IS NOT PROVEN that I HAVE'T REFUTED WITHIN THE 1st 10 mins of Vindicator's request telling him to read the OP again and click on all links like everyone else here should. 
Please don't ban me before I do this it will be awesome.

             This is the same kind of tactics we are  getting legally in Australia and Alex Jones is getting. False Allegations in a lawsuit - bad press based on the false claims - the damage is done. I bet half the people that were going to read this aren't going to read this because you flagged it as disputed when all you say isn't proven is right there in the OP with sources.

             After reading what's on the link above to tell you to go back to the drawing board - what claim on your list do you still isn't proven - then I will quote links and text from the OP again next to your claims to say you are wrong.

             This thread has been hijacked with unnecessary mod interference saying not proven when it is. I haven't seen shit this bad since Alefantis Boyfriend Brock was triggered by CHILD ANAL FISTING GATE aka FISTGATE by Andrew Breitbart and Mass Resistance, hence why Breitbart went after Brock and his boyfriend LONG BEFORE ALL OF US.

             YOU NEED TO CONFIRM THE 24 HOUR HOLD IS OFF OR MAKE YOU CASE AGAIN. NOT IGNORE MY ANSWER TO YOU SAYING ALL POINTS YOU CLAIMED WERE NOT PROVEN IN THE OP  - WERE IN FACT PROVEN. OR Confirm to me you have clicked on all inks in the OP you still stand stand by your "once again... " post.

             I just got an account frozen /  forbidden error from voat.. Oh I'm so edgy. It's giving me the chills. Thank god it's back now. Someone is sending me a message. Did I hit a real nerve? Just archived the page. I'm not joking. I don't exaggerate.
            </p>
            <p>
             It looked like a TOMCAT error message access denied so lets hope everyone got it. Voat is powered by JSP right? I never checked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was it credentials from the web app (voat) to the database or was it my credentials to voat itself that was blocked? Or the AAA server down?

             you got an upvote. i want everyone to see my reply and give you a second opinion on it for 24 hours. 
Don't insta-delete this thread or I'll loose faith in this forum when I try hard do it right and still I get bogus complains when all your questions were substantiated in the OP.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are trying very hard flagging 3 of my posts in the space of 5 mins. You are a real keyboard warrior i thought I typed fast. I wont screenshot my notifications others can see the dates.

            <p>
             Without anger I refute everything you said above. Everyone can clearly see all things you doubt have been proven have been proven by links in the OP.

              hojuruku, I am not trying to censor you. The exact opposite, in fact. Your approach to writing has the effect of burying your essential message and valuable research under layers of non-essential name calling. I get that you are pissed at the corrupt system. Shit, dude, WE ALL ARE! That's why we are here trying to eviscerate them with the
              <em>
               facts.
              </em>
              If you would rather rant without supporting links, we've got a subverse for that. But here in the research sub, we want to stick with what can be sourced.

              unbanned you, and explaining what you needed to do to post here, then seeing this thread today where you ignored everything we have asked, I looked at your submissions and saw this was a pattern. Several of your posts were downvoted to the point where I did not see them on the board during my shift. So I left a comment, flaired, etc. as needed this morning. Users expect mods here to be consistent. That is what I am doing.

              I flaired it, and hope you will take advantage of the 24 hour opportunity to either provide linked sourced for all of the unsourced claims or edit the post to remove them and just write what you have evidence for.

               only cases of boys being raped under Jewish care comes up for the first few pages of google search results. If heterosexual pedophiles as 98% of the population who do 66% of the abuse are 90% of the pedophile population you would why is there such a cluster of gay pedophiles in Big Brothers Big Sisters eh? You think more stories of big brothers big sisters raping girls too would come up not just gay men in the news?

                There's nothing secret about it, Hojuruku. I never leave a flair without a comment. Not one time in the entire year+ I've been modding. I not only comment, I usually comment with a ping to the OP so the notification shows up in both his Submission Replies and Comment Mentions.

               That means you want to delete this right? Did you read my reply proving all the things you claim were unsubstantiated in the OP were in fact substantiated in the OP.
              </p>
              <p>
               I ask another moderator take over and remove the hold or you tell me again what facts haven't been substantiated, now that I told you to look again.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is highly unlikely that you clicked on any links in the OP before messaging me saying things were substantiated. Also the time between your previous report was very low.
              </p>
              <p>
               Will you admit that you flagged 3 of my posts in &lt;15 mins immediately after I questioned your judgment on another thread about Alister Crowley and the OTO as PAYBACK or at the very least some kind of knee jerk reaction that got you thinking of me at the very least the subconcious level. This thread is NOT about you. It's about Jewish Care, Gay men and little boys.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remove the hold and I'll keep sharing more relevant materials.

                 The only thing not proven is the dating site for gay men and boys. Google shows most "big brothers big sister" pedophilia google results are gay - same for pedophile etc so I stand by that claim. I refute all things

                Here's how it went down, H. I read this thread, got to paragraph three, realized you were taking advantage of our leniency writing sloppily sourced posts, and then went to look at how many other posts you'd ignored the rules in, or had been warned about and corrected to see how much you were doing this. I did not look at your comments in anyone else's posts at all. I commented in the posts I found of yours that failed to honor the community ruleset so that you would know what you were doing wrong, in hopes that you will change your approach.

                 If you want formatting then I need to remove characters from the post and detract from it to re-arrange it. Tell me when you upped the character limit and I will tidy up this post. Until then there is nothing I can do except move the location of the http links around for better feng sui. Is that what this whole cluster#$234 censorship request is about? The distance from the http links to prove the claim from the text that says it's true?

            </p>
            <p>
             Point 4) See point 2 patrick power - see link to him on committee that first asked to make the gay panic defence a "gay rights issue" then see the case of the law being succesfully used in legal studies if you google "gay panic defence australia'. There are cases of children getting of murder because they were resisting a gay child rape attempt
            </p>
            <p>
             Point 5) the link in the OP to the judge ruling the child had the crush on the gay dad. Courier mail link
            </p>
            <p>
             All claims substantiated in the OP. Try again mate. No hard feelings. You'll keep me honest. You know if you were sincerely not understanding I'd be really greatful because my goal is to be more effective communicator.

              Evidence link has to be in the post, either right next to the claim, or as an embedded url made by highlighting the words of the claim itself so it's clear what link supports what claim. Especially in complex multi-claim threads like this.

                It is a battle to get it all in to 10,000 words. Trust me the links to prove all the things are doubting are there if you click on them. Please remove the 24 hour hold or say what claim you say isn't proven.
               </p>
               <p>
                Next time I'll try and use more control codes but literally I had to move things out of the post like the WND link into comments because it was too big. There is no space for formatting codes so click on the links to see all the claims in the text are backed up by a link that is near them. Now instead of people reading news stories about Big Brothers big sisters in America and their wave of same sex child abuse almost worse than boy scouts of America etc in the comments and sharing that we have this pointless re-hasing of the OP. Please there is no free characters to fix formatting. Get VOAT to increase OP post size if you want nicer formatting.

               2 IT WOULDN'T FIT IN THE OP. 10,000 Characters. Before you said I didn't prove it - I HAD ALREADY PUT THE SOURCE IN A COMMENT TO ANOTHER USER THAT WAS BEING BLOCKED FROM UPLOADING DUE TO BAD DOMANIS. Can you tell me what bad domains is in the pastebin link? What keyword is blocked.  I can't figure it out - and I think it's a keyword I used not a domain.

                one of their biggest tactics is demanding sources for either common knowledge or unnecessary background facts u might choose to include about a person/place.  e.g. "vindicators mom, who sucked my dick behind a burger king in 1994, was a trustee at..." "POST THE RECEIPT FROM YOUR 1994 MEAL AT BURGER KING PLEASE"

              , you quoted these elements of the post:
             </p>
             <p>
              “bigbrothersbigsisters.com.au dating site for gay men and little boys
gave a character reference for one of their own homosexual board members done for sodomizing little Thai boys and child porn
who was a gay crown prosecutor
who helped remove the gay panic defense that allows children who kill gay men trying to rape them avoid jail for lawful self-defense.
This law is needed when we have gay judges saying it's all the child's fault”
             </p>
             <p>
              So, are you saying, that a LINK to something needs to be with each point?
             </p>
             <p>
              This is done so that reader’s can see we are talking about something real, right?
             </p>
             <p>
              So it could be better if it looked like this:
bigbrothersbigsisters.com.au dating site for gay men and little boys

              Your work, hojoruku, ALWAYS gets my attention, but I often get stuck in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph, because I don’t understand the context of what you are writing about. It’s frustrating, because you write SO MUCH. Too much for us to read in large quantities like that. It appears like an angry rant and you lose your audience.
             </p>
             <p>
              These small efforts to post links helps your readers so you don’t lose us. You are writing for a reason. Don’t waste your efforts.

               not good work. Censored work. I can't make it better. so it has to be buried. Mods know best. They say I didn't prove the things I did prove in the OP with source links when if he didn't rush it he could have actually found some things I didn't link to in the OP that I alleged but didn't provide sources to.
              </p>
              <p>
               But when you are doing a rush job to censor it for reasons of political bigotry that's what happens. He could have made a more convincing argument to censor if he didn't rush it. Instead out come questions to credibility now.

                It won’t get buried. It’s just flared. I’m gonna keep looking at what you posted, and try to digest it. Help me check and see that what I understand from your post is correct.

                  Gay rights have extended to the point of gay fascism in some places. If this is real, I am interested in more context. Like, what companies and organizations are discriminating against non-gays? Who are the people that are leading this? From here we can start a meme war that leaves are Australian friends innocent and protected from retribution.

                  Satanism has become an accepted religion and speaking against it is treated as bigotry. If this is real, the same applies. What names are defending satanism? What judges and journalists and celebs and politicians are speaking out or ruling or legislating for satanism? We need to meme this back under the rock it crawled out from. Blast their twitter and social media, especially around election season. If the population of an area has swung to far towards a satanist majority, then make it obvious. Let the humans that want to escape be warned and begin their exodus, right?

                  Your post deals specifically with the Australian big brothers/sisters that has been corrupted by gay-only policies. This has lead to abuses and sexual assaults against kids. The kids have reported their crimes, but instead of recieving Justice, they were imprisoned themselves. This imprisonment has lead to more and more sexual torture for them. If this is all correct, then we need more info to help. We want to let the world know about these victims. We want to get their story on every famous persons twitter feed, especially those foolish enough to say pg is fake. We wNt the name of the judges that perverted this injustice. meme him our of office.

                  Your investigation and reporting has gotten attention. You and your dad have been targeted by trolls and shills because you exposed the cabal. I have seen you mention this. We want to help. Many of us pray. Some of the voaters  are in Australia. Maybe they can help with an escape plan or something. Maybe some are in a position to contribute to a patreon account if you need some emergency funds. Idunno. You are very far away, so it is a challenge to imagine ways voaters  can help you with this.

                Do I have these points correct? As you can see, there are many confusing points that we get answered, but only if we follow ALL of your links. That’s a lot of reading. If you notice, voat is a constant river of posts. Almost all are important. They are all filled with commenters and truth seekers and potential allies waiting to be red pilled. If we are spending a lot of time on your colossal posts, then we may miss something elsewhere.

                It helps you and it helps us help when you put things in order and line it our for us. We can get back to you faster with our assistance,and you can walk us through the details as we ask questions in the comments.

                Voat mods aren’t here to censor. Voat does that naturally with downvoats. The flair is your lifeline. The mods throw it out to you. If you take it and make an adjustment, readers may be more likely to upvote you, and your work will stay.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will continue to upvoat your work when I see it. Also I will continue to ask questions from your posts, like I did above. Please, keep posting your work here. You may be happier in the pizzagate/whatever thing. I guess the rules are lighter there. I mostly read here, but I go there too.

                 As usual all your points are correct. We will be working together soon. I'm trying to wrangle another gpu for mining to get our Russian server happening. I need to get $20 of ETH a month and I"m only mining about 8-12 now to do what I want. I've never asked anyone for a cent like Laura Southern does but if we want to start our own hosting co-op where we pay by leaving our PCs on with like minded people I am so up for that.

                I am more worried about the evil he seems to be uncovering and the victims he is speaking about. I have this gut feeling that he’s exposed something nasty AND that maybe we can do something about it.

               When there are many claims like this, absolutely. Otherwise, it's open season in here -- unfriendlies are free to post long, complicated baffle-with-bullshit posts with dozens of links to waste mod time and energy and slide legit content right off the board.

                Vin I think you are my most liked mod friendly mod here, so if you nix this thread. i'm gone.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have to find somewhere better at fighting these real pedophile judicial pedophilia normalization gang I'm going after in Australia.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't want all this mod vs original shitposter stuff here. When I get back from my trip to the all night banh me shops and some nicotine...
               </p>
               <p>
                I am NOT GOING TO CHANGE A FRIGGEN WORD OR LINK IN THE OP. But i will try and RE-ARRANGE SOME OF THE LINKS CLOSER to SOME OF THE CLAIMS MADE THEY BACK UP.
               </p>

                That's all I can do with the limited 10,000 character limit and no room for formatting changes.
               </p>
               <p>
                As for the first post of yours that may have been rushed (mod pressure). I don't want my lesser of all evils mod her to have his credibility in doubt.
               </p>
               <p>
                Really this will be good for us if we all stand down after that EXTREMELY MINOR COSMETIC FIX I do to my post. We all save face then the comment space has just got related news stories - a collection of 1000s of gay child sex in jewish care big brothers big sister news story and user generated content where everyone digs up similar MSM stories. Let's get back to fighting pedophiles rather than with each-other.
               </p>
               <p>
                Seriously.... I'm not being an arse but I' am being assertive. Sorry Vin you are wrong this time. It happens people rush and pull the trigger too quickly with too many posts to process. No hard feelings. Really mate I want you to delete (and me to delete) this whole comment thread and references to it because I don't want my favorite mod turning into another MF clusterfuck. NOOOO not again. Please - I need to use this site as a platform to get my research out. If I can't do it and it has to be shut down because some pedophiles must have any criticism of them shut down because it's "anti-. semetic" This is my first post on the Jewish pedophile links to the gay lobby i'm fighting. The first one to Garry Burns was aleph.org.au Michael Barnett. Now there is literally about 40 Jewish tie-ins to the pedophile group I"m after now.
               </p>
               <p>
                I only followed the evidence. I didn't start out this way. I was a PC leftist in Australia before my persecution waked me up to the fact of what the left was. Like you go to vegas one day I got drunk and found the next morning I jouned Socialist Alliance - the same group that was Standing with Lee Rhiannon with their sign praising the FBI infant sex fugitive Dr Matthew Hynd's right as a pedophile to bring his mate into the country on a gay partner visa - because what we need is to help pedophiles +1 their mates into the country or you area  homophone. Chasing the truth turned me into what I am. No white nationalist - typical one - would want to be seen dead admitting they once joined SA... Also Marrying Asians is a big no no.

                I'm finding this not because I hate jews. But because the evidence is taking me there.

                 Source your claims, retard.  It's not really that difficult, and it helps literally everyone else that reads your shit to be able to confirm your words instead of each one having to do the work, if they even believe you in the first place.  If you can't be bothered to put in the time and effort on your own posts to support your arguments, then your words probably aren't really that important anyway.

                  I remember you getting very frustrated over there a year or so ago. Got very triggered by exposing my father's case of pedophilia normalization case law by a certian confirmed homosexual gay judge alexander john wakefield - another suspect person that just can't use their real name in a court room like Garry and other pedophiles I keep coming across.

                    I had jews on dailystormer doing stories on Garry Burns - Remember Michael Slay aka Josha Rye Goldberg. I backed up the posts on dailystormer and put them on scribd but a faggot who blogs about watching children fuck took it down as exposed at the end of this thread.

            that's what makes this Q psyop so brilliant: suppose trump puts Hillary and podesta and 30% of congress or whatever in prison and exposes the entire "swamp" or whatever wildest dreams you people have:
            <strong>
             the vast JEWISH PEDOPHILIA network will still exist, only then you fools wont be looking for it anymore
            </strong>
            .  well, WE WILL.  notice the Horizon (another longtime code word we have seen here) pedo swirl logo

             The camp manager is linked to central banking and I have more research but of course I can't say all the details here because what's the point the post will be censored. Don't get me started. This post is being killed based on lies. I tried man. I don't know what to say.. It's depressing.

             i spent last 10 mins trying to find the banned domain in here. I give up - I think a senior OTO members name or something is stopping me from posting I removed every single url link except youtube and it keeps giving banned domain. here's my reply to you- can you try and get it posted in a way the system will accept?

            too big to jail gay marriage activists child sex cover-up for gay pride. Here the enemy on tape. He admited in an interview hew were almost included in the final cut GAY BY BABY FILM but had to be edited out of the film because they fucked their own son and got arrested by the police - or as he said - he had to stop working on the film for "personal reasons". Australian NSW facebook.com/policeglbti gay police went around promoting said film that had pedophiles edited out of it and forced it on kids at Homebush Girls school. IF someone accuses me of lying instead of downvoting like a pedo I can post the evidence of the cops photo. Ah bugger it here it is:

             We wanted to send a special thank you to all the schools who bravely screened GAYBY BABY last Friday for Wear It Purple Day. After the film was banned from being screened in NSW public schools during school hours, there were many students, teachers and parents who got in touch to find out how they could still show the film to their school.

            This is much clearer than your other posts. I think the bigotry angle is a distraction. Keep being courageous and call out the crimes. Ignore the trolls. Thanks for posting.

             If you get it right they will still take it down for "not proving" what they claimed you didn't but did 100% prove - but proved in the totally full 10,000 word OP. The only claim he said I didn't prove that was really proven in the OP all along if you click on the links (but he didn't because it was only 5 mins before the other post he deleted) was the claim it's a gay dating site for gay men and kids. Well i proved that in the comments with them making an 2002 landmark before boy scouts policy we need more gay "big brothers" and the only cases of pedophilia google is finding in the MSM is gay men - yet gay men are only 10% of all pedophiles (US CDC google pubmed homosexuality pedophile) 1% of the population (US CDC) and rape 33% of all children luckly enough to get a bad "big brother" - source bravehearts.org.au child abuse fact sheet. Why are gay men so over-represented in "big brothers big sisters" child abuses cases? You would think there would be 2x more heterosexual pedophiles in the google search results i've seen by page 3. I think I've hit onto a global pedophile ring here - and they are trying to gatekeeper it out / censor this thread. Think of the protection they have. You seen the new comments? Big Brother big sister training material say YAY MOST PEDOPHILES DON'T GET CAUGHT. That's nice for governments law enforcement to know but you don't put that in training materials for big brothers big sisters. You should lie and say - WE ARE WATCHING YOU - WE HAVE SAVE GUARDS, WE INTERVIEW THE KIDS AND IF YOU FUCK KIDS WE WILL DO THE BEST TO CATCH YOU AND JAIL YOU. Something is up here.

             Have you seen the full boy scouts of America perversion file? I have it. The names of 1000s of pedophiles over the last 30 years. Google all their cases etc. They are all gay. If i post that here there will be legal action.

             With shills constantly spewing their racism, it is hard to do a post involving any Jewish Org.  Great to see someone bringing it out and I hope we can refrain from the usual vitriol.  Yes, the presentation is great.  Thanks for helping out.

               There are shills here pouring on blatant bigotry to weaken our credibility. Conversely There are suspicious enemies from all persuasions. We should definitely not be afraid to report bad guys, regardless of what group they are hiding in, be it Jews or Catholics or Krishnas.
              </p>
              <p>
               But we shouldn’t play into the trolls that deflect and call our exposure bigotry. Neither should we go overboard and take a stand as bigots ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have friends and family of all persuasions. I also oppose pedos of all persuasions.

               We risk blackpilling. We risk losing our platform. We risk losing the opportunity we have to end this monstrous system and defend our kids.

                Im not a shill. I just know what kikes are up to. Its obvious. Millions know. The jew brainwashing is fading fast. If I could get paid to post facts about jews I would. Where can I get that shill job? Im also pro Russia, but I hear there are a million Russian bots getting paid to shill for that great country, and Im doing it for free? Im missing out on some serious anti jew/ Pro Russia cash man! Lol THE GOYIM KNOW. Thats all man. We just finally figured out what the fuck is going on. Its that simple. Truth catches on quick.

            Some old links now broken. They took down their old website recently:
Talks about Shannon McCoole (womans mag) and and half way through the article promoting that 12 year old girls love the rough hardcore sex - showing how far Australia has gone.

            case alw I believe their director is a former doctor who got deregistered for doing unnecessary child anus inspections, but I haven't been able to confirm which children's society he works for yet. I'll try and dig up the case law for that where gay judges say "we believe he wont offend again" and overrule the children's guardian office to give him more child play dates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Man I need to dig up this case law of Australian gay judges saying a director of a child mentoring group (like big brothers big sisters - not many of them) was a ex-doctor-child-anus-inspector and was granted his working with children certificate. I know this exists and you can find it on www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au. I'll go through my archives.
