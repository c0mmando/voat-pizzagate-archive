<p>Comet Ping Pong (CPP) Pizza restaurant owner; one of the &quot;50 Most Powerful People in DC;&quot; connections to high places including powerful politicians, artists, and lobbyists. Has hosted fundraisers for politicians such as Hillary Clinton. Restaurant doubles as a nighttime party place for all ages and features music by bands such as Sex Stains and Heavy Breathing. Has Instagram account with several images of children associated with money and coded sexual language, such as #chickenlovers. Never officially investigated, never asked pointed questions about his Instagram when interviewed by mainstream media, and so the citizen investigation is huge!</p>

<p>One of the most elite men in Washington and one of the most powerful lobbyists in the world. Podesta was in charge of Secretary Hillary Clinton\'s 2016 election campaign and held fundraisers for her at Comet Ping Pong. His odd correspondence with James Alefantis can be found in the leaked Podesta emails. He is also friends with Marina Abramovic and enthusiastically engages in &quot;Spirit Cooking.&quot; Coded FBI pedophile keywords are found throughout his leaked emails. His art collection reflects themes of dismembered people and cannibalism. He received a party invite that kids &quot;...age 7, 9 and 11&quot; would be &quot;in the pool for further entertainment.&quot; Brother Tony collects creepy child-abuse art and emailed him saying, &quot;Last night was fun. Still in torture chamber.&quot; Tony sent another email saying he was &quot;seated with the kids&quot; on a flight and so was &quot;a little wired.&quot; In a leaked email was asked, &quot;Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?&quot;</p>

<p>Leader of occult practices. Inspired by infamous Satanic worshipper Aleister Crowley, she is the creator of &quot;Spirit Cooking.&quot; These cannibalistic-themed parties were instrumental in raising people\'s awareness of Pizzagate through their mention in the Podesta leaked emails. She attended fundraisers for Hillary Clinton at the behest of Clinton herself and sometimes John Podesta. Received donations from the Annenberg Foundation which is funded in part by the Clinton Foundation. John and Tony Podesta appear to have a close relationship with Abramovic. She was invited to attend a private &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; session at John Podesta\'s home. She herself has stated that Spirit Cooking sessions are not considered art.</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong\'s house band. Amanda Kleinman, or \'Majestic Ape,\' is lead singer and keyboardist. Kleinman wears sunglasses, a blonde wig, and a red ski mask when in character. She uses a voice distortion microphone during performances and speaks code words to private audiences. Kleinman considers pedophila as simply a &quot;preference&quot; and not a sickness. In one video, she says, &quot;We can experience the joys of Satan right here in this room without meeting him.&quot; Connected to James Achilles Alefantis through Comet Ping Pong. Kleinman said that Sasha Lord carried her baby and that after the baby was born, she killed it because she didn\'t like the baby. Kleinman deleted her Twitter account when she discovered she was under citizen investigation.</p>

            Once these are completed, I will most definitely print out a few sets and leave them in random places all over my city. I will put them in bathrooms, in Apple stores, wherever people are the most likely to see them and pick them up.

            This is what I got for Besta,  it seems like there should be more of a connection to pizzagate, but my mind is blank on it.

            "Besta Pizza, a Washington, D.C. pizzeria, located just two doors down from Comet Ping Pong,  and which  until very recently used a logo nearly identical  to an FBI documented pedophile symbol, and whose name ‘besta’ means ‘beast’ in Portuguese,  the language of Portugal and Brazil , where  the legal age of consent is fourteen, although consent at age 12 is socially acceptable;  registered under Andrew Kline, an attorney who while employed as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, was found guilty of misconduct for knowingly and intentionally failing  to disclose information that would  negate the guilt of the accused, and whose clients include Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping,  both owned by  James Alenfatis."

              PGIsDumb went ballistic and went on an hours long shilling rampage when I made a thread about Robert Robinson. You don't go on such a ranpage if said thread was bogus (it hit a MASSIVE nerve on him). Vindicator even PMd me congratulating me for causing the shilltard to get more frustrated than he's ever been since he started his crusade to torment us.

            onto Scribd as that seemed to be a site other people used on here. I made a fake email account if you would like me to PM the details .. other lovely helpful people on here then uploaded it onto different things and I reposted links into the main description.

             At this point the focus is on the creeps and locations and enablers. and probably we can fill more than halve the deck with it, maybe one full deck (idk yet)    (unsure about it but definitely keep it in mind)

              I will leave the American talk show to you if that's ok as I am in the UK? Or I can always make a thread asking people for ideas.

            Possible text for Epstein
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeffrey  Epstein is an American financier and registered sex offender known for paying a parade of underage girls at least $200 to disrobe and rub his feet, back, and legs.  Touting his charitable foundation which “supports a wide range of youth initiatives” across the Virgin Islands. Epstein’s prior “youth initiatives” involved sex toys like the “Twin Torpedo” or “Jelly Anal Wand,” as well as “Joy Jelly,” a peach-flavored lubricant.  At his 78-acre property in the Virgin Island, known as ‘Orgy Island” and “Island of Sin” Epstien’s foundation  entertained pals such as Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, and Stephien Hawkings.  Although his conviction has made him toxic for political donations, his recent  contributions included the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Mount Sinai Hospital; the MIT Media Lab; Ballet Palm Beach; the National Multiple Sclerosis Society; and Arizona State University.

                  And for clarity, maybe the first sentence needs rearranged so the porn star is not the one with pizza shop.
"Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States, pals with Comet Ping Pong owner, James (jimmycomet) Alefantis whose pizza shop held a fundraiser for Obama and who visited the white house four times, of which one visit was an overnighter attended by a male porn star. "

                Joseph Biden, Vice President to Barack Obama, tagged by the media as “Creepy Uncle Joe” for his open display of close-ear whispers, kissing, grabbing, groping and fondling  females of all ages, including pre-teen girls, at Congressional swearing-in ceremonies. Showed his affection for President Obama with a custom-made friendship bracelet birthday gift, which featured the names “JOE” and “BARACK”  spelled out in beads along with flower, happy face and pizza charms. Once proclaimed about unaccompanied illegal minors who streamed across the southern border into the United States“These are not somebody else’s kids, these are our kids”.

                  Comet Ping Pong (CPP), Washington D.C pizzeria identified for its ping pong tables play area, at the heart of pizzagate citizen investigation, owned by one of DC’s most  influential man, James ‘jimmycomet’ Alefantis, developed a menu logo nearly identical to one identified by FBI as a pedophile symbol; located in close proximity to two other businesses which have logos remarkably similar to other documented FBI pedophile symbols: ‘Besta Pizza’ and Clinton Foundation subsidiary ‘Beyond Borders’;  boasts a family-friendly atmosphere while promoting bands such as ‘ Sex Stains’ and ‘Heavy Breathing’ which present with  pedophilia  undertones; referenced numerous times in Alefantis’s ‘jimmycomet’ Instagram account with pictures such as a toddler girl with arms taped to a restaurant table, as well as a picture showing stacked cages along the wall; hosted birthday celebrations for Tony Podesta, parties for democrat staffers, and fundraisers for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton; walls were until recently painted with disturbing cannibalistic murals.

                  Pegasus Museum,   a non-descript two-story building with a watchtower overlooking playground, located in an alley at 5031 Connecticut AVE NW, in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in Washington D.C.; bought in 2014 by James Achilles Alefantis after registering as Castellum Achilles LLC,  immediately  after which Alefanits added a listing on Google Maps identifying it as Pegasus Museum; although it has no webpage or internet presence and does not yet appear to be operational, it was discovered by  citizens investigating Alefantis’s pizzagate connection, one  of whom claimed to have received threats from Alefantis himself; believed to be location of the “kill room” identified in Alefantis’s ‘jimmycomet’ Instagram account; possibly connected to DC abandoned tunnel system.

            <em>
             Sex Stains.
A band name we decided on after 100 suggestions by random people on Facebook because every name we could think up was already taken.
We are just a punk rock band from L.A.
We are NOT pedophiles. Just the thought of that is sickening!
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             What the hell happened here?
A few months ago, we passed through DC on a week long mini tour. We booked a show at Comet. We were told it's an ok place for bands to play, so we did. That's about the extent of our involvement with or knowledge of this venue.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Before going on that tour,
             <strong>
              we made a video with Cassandra Hamilton, a L.A. artist
             </strong>
             that has made videos for a few bands in the local rock scene. We had no budget but she was willing
to help us make a video for our song Land Of La La (a common term used to refer to Los Angeles because of the sometimes flakey &amp; aloof people that live here). There was no real concept for the video other than making it very colorful &amp; exciting to watch.
The director invited (the band &amp; a few friends) to create some props, suggesting boxes &amp; paintings, anything we could put together cheaply &amp; quickly to fill some space up in the shots of the band playing/dancing/goofing off. We bought party supplies, gags, glitter. Any cheap crap we could. This was an endeavor in fun. There was absolutely NO PLOT to purposefully use offensive symbols or to mess with peoples heads. There was/is ZERO interest in anything having to do with children. No one in the band had any knowledge of the triangle/spirals horrid symbolism.
             <strong>
              We're shocked &amp; disgusted by the theory that we are somehow linked to Pedophelia rings or Satanic cults,
             </strong>
             and also by the hateful comments &amp; accusations we've been receiving. WE ARE NOT pedophiles and do NOT support or promote it. Period. Again, we are just a punk rock band.

            per my previous comments on another post... some of these feel heavily slanted towards a biased opinion ( esp the kleinman and abramovich ones.... i suppose it depends on the intended audience.
 if you only desire to preach to the choir it doesn't really matter, but if this is going to convince someone who knows little to nothing about PG.... i strongly suggest factual evidence only. 
PG is not about political parties folks. It is about crimes of the powerful and elite against children, and the cover-up of these crimes. 
when we pander to political interests and biases it lessens the cause. if the players are political that's fine- discuss, but BOTH parties have good guys and bad guys. 
just trying to help, i dig the work done a lot! 
i don't mind editing if needed, but i have a full schedule and usually only on here late at night...

               Comet Ping Pong's house band. Amanda Kleinman, or 'Majestic Ape,' is lead singer and keyboardist. Kleinman wears sunglasses, a blonde wig, and a red ski mask when in character. She uses a voice distortion microphone during performances and speaks code words to private audiences. Kleinman considers pedophila as simply a "preference" and not a sickness. In one video, she says, "We can experience the joys of Satan right here in this room without meeting him." Connected to James Achilles Alefantis through Comet Ping Pong. Kleinman said that Sasha Lord carried her baby and that after the baby was born, she killed it because she didn't like the baby. Kleinman deleted her Twitter account when she discovered she was under citizen investigation.

               Leader of occult practices. Inspired by infamous Satanic worshipper Aleister Crowley, she is the creator of "Spirit Cooking." These cannibalistic-themed parties were instrumental in raising people's awareness of Pizzagate through their mention in the Podesta leaked emails. She attended fundraisers for Hillary Clinton at the behest of Clinton herself and sometimes John Podesta. Received donations from the Annenberg Foundation which is funded in part by the Clinton Foundation. John and Tony Podesta appear to have a close relationship with Abramovic. She was invited to attend a private "Spirit Cooking" session at John Podesta's home. She herself has stated that Spirit Cooking sessions are not considered art.

              Dont know if selling these are a good idea as that would open you up to "copyright" lawsuits with some of the images.  If there is a backside to the cards there should be at least 5-10 links to info on the suspects so people can investigate themselves.  Or even on the front face of the card there should be at least one link to "archive.is" info or waybackmachine info.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would be nice to see some location cards in the deck like Jeffery Epsteins island or "pegasus" musem, bucks fishing and camping, besta pizza and comet ping pong showing images inside the restaurant and previous bands playing such as
              <a href="http://i.imgur.com/USGRAT3.jpg">

              etc.
