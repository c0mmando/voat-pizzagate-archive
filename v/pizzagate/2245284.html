<h1>Sexual Molesting Charges Reach U.S. Senate: Al Franken Accused of Violating Model Leann Tweeden</h1>
<p>Well known sportscaster and model Leann Tweeden has accused Sen. Al Franken of molesting her, the first sexual abuse allegation to pierce the sacred veil of the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.</p>
<p>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn’t be so nice about it the next time.</p>
<p>But he didn’t stop there.</p>

            He's a jackass.  I can't wait to see him squirm.  I think some of these accusations are a bit much, but like any battle - keep your powder dry - you never now when you'll need it.

            <p>
             No, not at all! he harassed her, she called him on it, he badgered her like the predator he is, and when she was asleep he molested her! He had no business touching her breasts. Especially when she was asleep because she had zero chance to stop anything or give consent or deck him!

             Good for her for speaking out.

              She;s actually a known newscaster in LA and has a voice.  This is going to grow legs.  It's hard to tell from the photo if he is touching her or not.  Regardless it is in poor taste at best.  I've seen close male/females joke around like this in a non threatening manner.  I'm only saying it may be more innocent BUT he also tried to jam his tongue down her throat.  I think the bunny humper is gonna burn for this one.

               I don't know why you're giving this guy a pass. These were not close friends. She didn't even know him. And she was married and threatened to punch him in the face after inappropriate behavior.

                The last thing I would EVER do is give that asshat a pass.  I hope they convict and string him up.  Given the photos of him with Clinton, Spacey, etc., I'm sure he's part of the "boys club".
               </p>
               <p>
                All I am saying is that there is going to be an avalanche of real, fictitious, and lesser claims.  It's probably going to blow up into a sexual assault with hunt, with innocent people being accused (like possibly Roy Moore).  I am only advocating letting things play out with Franken as with Moore and not jump to any conclusions.
               </p>
               <p>
                We all know he is guilty AF and probably of a lot worse than the allegations.  Not would I bet a dime on his innocence.  My only point is that the photo alone does not discern whether he is touching her or not - a pretty important differentiation. The accuser, however seems highly credible, backed up with a photo and witnesses.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't condone a single thing he has done. Give it another day or three - there will be more with probably even more damning accusations.

                 It DOESN'T MATTER IF HE'S TOUCHING HER! You're hung up on that. If you went up to a stranger at a party and did that, you'd get slapped right in the face!!! And probably pounded by her husband.

                 This is not Roy Moore. This is indisputable evidence that the scumbag hasn't even denied! The apologists were out asking if it were Photoshopped, but he admitted doing it and thought it would be funny.

                 She was a UNITED STATES SOLDER, doing a USO TOUR, for God's sake.

                 Look, I'm not arguing with you! If you don't think it's anything, then you don't have to keep writing and telling me that. Me? He should resign.

                  She was NOT a US soldier and therefore is not covered under any element of UCMJ.  She was a former Playboy Playmate on a USO tour.  I hear your outrage, but you are directing it at the wrong person.  I'd flip the switch personally on the bunny humper.

                  Also, they weren't at a party, they were on a C-17 Globemaster returning from a war zone.  The rules of decorum are a little different under those circumstances.  I'll say again - IMO, the photo in and of itself isn't damaging - poor taste yes - damning, no.  The accusations of what he did, regarding forcible (trying) to kiss her - that's another story.  And I'm sure there is worse waiting to emerge.
