<p>“An electronic identification (&quot;eID&quot;) is an electronic identification solution of citizens or organizations, for example in view to access benefits or services provided by government authorities, banks or other companies. Apart from online authentication many eICs also give users the option to sign electronic documents with a digital signature.</p>
<p>One form of eID is an electronic identification card, which is a physical identity card that can be used for online and offline personal identification or authentication. The eIC is a smartcard in ID-1 format of a regular bank card, with identity information printed on the surface (such as personal details and a photograph) and in an embedded RFID microchip, similar to that in biometric passports. The chip stores the information printed on the card (such as the holder\'s name and date of birth) and the holder\'s biometric photo. It may also store the holder\'s fingerprints. The card may be used for online authentication, such as for age verification or for e-government applications. An electronic signature, provided by a private company, may also be stored on the chip.” </p>

            This is excellent work and answers the question of the CARDS which was first mentioned by FBI anon in July 2016. These RFID chips are implanted under the skin in the refugees already at processing centers. Included on the chips are medical information which can identify blood types, &amp; genectic coding for easy access in organ trafficking. This chip is part of the healthcare push we have seen in the past 8 years. The statue calls for a mandatory DNA sample or mapping to be given &amp; stored to the government in exchange for healthcare.
           </p>
           <p>
            The RFID chip is the next requirement in the US if we do not stop it. There are already chips being located and removed now unbeknownst to patients.
           </p>
           <p>
            This should get huge Upvoat s. These children at refugee centers are chipped and sold.

            Big upvote.... this sort of excellent digging has sadly been missing of voat recently. Miliband snr has a jewish refugee to UK marxist and had a dislike of his host nation.  David was expected to be leader of the c labour party but was knifed in the back by his younger brother Ed and that's why he quit politics.
