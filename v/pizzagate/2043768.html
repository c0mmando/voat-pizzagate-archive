            I'd literally love nothing more than to see Trump scorch the earth and bring it all down. That's a big ask of one man though. I always think this, imagine if how they control someone like Trump is threaten them that if they don't play ball then their death will be imminent, it will be covered up as natural causes, but really we're gonna take you back to a lair and skin you alive. That juvenile idea has some holes in it but something like that..

            Maybe. Maybe he's one of them and knows he and others in his administration will be exposed if he brings the whole house of cards down so instead he's tiptoeing around while indefinitely stringing people along with supposed "massive pedo busts" in which no one anywhere near the upper levels of power ever gets so much as a slap on the wrist, and which no one but people in the PGate community who are specifically looking for these stories even hears about. You may be right OP. I don't know. But how long will you keep the faith? The evidence has been there for decades before Trump even took office. If they actually want to do something the time is ripe whenever they choose. If it's this time next year and Clinton, Podesta, Alefantis, and the at-least-1/3rd of congress who are pedos are still roaming free, will you still believe Trump is just waiting and planning?

            Trump is a chump. He's not going to do shit. The gig is up. He's been compromised. If he had any balls the take down would have happened by now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think that's why Rex Tillerson is taking some "time off". He got shut down and is pissed off about it. I wouldn't be surprised if he resigns. The Trump admin is now officially done.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look in the history of mother fuckers like Wilbur Ross and Gary Cohn. Ross is a snake in the grass and Cohn is Goldman Sachs. They ain't gonna do shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the record Don Keyhote, Wilbur Ross is a Catholic. Just sayin.. The Jews don't have a lock on corruption.

            And I believe that the Deep State has appointed Muller in an effort to Remove Trump / Sessions from the Office for the fear of exposing biggest scandal in history. 
Read Trump's tweet Oct.8, 2012 - any doubts? Not me.

             Yeah" the redaction of the talking point´s on the tarmac meeting.... put´s a big question mark on Session.

             Trump could just declassify the documents right? so why don´t he do that? I guess we will see..

            Trump and a collection of others have already done massive damage to these people - trashing their reputations, arresting contacts, developing intelligence for further arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice how juicy tidbits keep getting leaked out - like Alefantis?  Is it proven?  Hard to say - but it looks pretty convincing, and it is a massive revelation if true.   Who is doing all of the leaking?  Intelligence agents?  Police?  Insiders in the know?  Autistic savants?
           </p>
           <p>
            It matters not.  Word is spreading.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never before have these people been under such scrutiny.

            I basically agree with this.

            He only just got in office. You can't take speculation and conjecture into a courtroom .. not with these high-profile elites. What they need is a solid case that implicates The Cannibal Elites. I think between Aswan and Weiner, there might be something there. There also could a very nice foothold if the Loretta Lynch investigation and newly-discovered fake email account is valid.

             I am with you quantokitty, 6 months is very short to gather all the solid evidence you need to ensure these elite weasels do not wriggle out of the noose!  My husband keeps saying that killary will not go to prison, but I am sure of the opposite, I just dont want her or her evil husband to die before because, I want to see those demons pay a little on earth for those innocent lives and the destruction they have caused to millions in all the years they were 'in control'.  Then they can go to hell where they belongs and suffer the eternity for what they willingly chose to do!  - I am generally not this vindictive but I think that hell was designed for such a couple as this, you can only love God or Money and they chose to 'LOVE' Money and evil follows that decision:-  1 Timothy 6:10 Amplified Bible (AMP)
            </p>
            <p>
             10 For the love of money [that is, the greedy desire for it and the willingness to gain it unethically] is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves [through and through] with many sorrows.

              Beautifully said. Just because they haven't been arrested, doesn't mean they won't be. It's truly harrowing what they've done. They have no conscience and no souls. It will be gratifying to see them behind bars.

            I think the DOJ's recently released emails on Abedin and Clinton etc., being redacted was not because Sessions is covering-up, but rather sending a message to those who are behind the redacted pages saying, you know what is on those pages and we are coming for you...HILLARY&gt; my prediction is the bitch is going down hard...high priestess, my ass!~

              Go back and read the FBI Anon transcripts...I do it when I feel down, he said Trump would 100% go after Killary...Personally, I don't see how Trump will NOT be able to pursue Clinton/Obama for their criminality.  There is too much there that the general public is aware of.  My fear is that Clinton/Obama go away for their normie crimes and pizzagate doesn't ever get fully exposed.  But I would be willing to bet a nice steak dinner we will see HRC in prison orange if she doesn't die first.

               FBIAnon was most likely a limited hang out. The Deep State chose Trump and released Podesta's emails to sink Killary's campaign.
              </p>
              <p>
               A lot changed in the past week. Trump redacting Loretta's Lynch's conversation on the tarmac and his allowing Andrew McCabe to stay at the FBI means Trump is protecting the Deep State. There's no question about it anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
               At this point I could give a shit if Trump is impeached. I'd actually enjoy it very much because the guy lied to us about draining the swamp. Trump ain't gonna drain shit. He's a coward and a piece of shit. Historians will look back at Donald Trump as a coward on par with Neville Chamberlain and his infamous "Peace in our time" airport speech after getting Hitler to assure him he wouldn't attempt to take over Europe.

                I think you are making too much of the Loretta Lynch redaction as far as Trump having a whole lot to with it, executives like Trump don't micro-manage...and yes, I do agree with you that FBI Anon's leaking was an authorized leak.  My gut feeling, for what it's worth, is that things are moving in the right direction...if nothing significant has happened by years end, I will be in the same place you are now...

                 Then just keeping Andrew McCabe at the FBI is enough to prove Trump has no interest in draining the swamp. Then there's the new FBI director Christopher Wray. He's another Deep State swamp creature. Went to Yale, Skull &amp; Bones the whole 9 yards. Trump ain't gonna drain shit.

              Don Keyhote is a CTR shill. I'm going to tell it like it is.... like it or not, Trump is the ONLY hope to end this global crime syndicate. This is it. Now or never. I know Trump well and believe me, this is a man of extreme ambition and newfound faith. He will be the one to collapse this pedophile cult, because he is the only one capable of doing so. The President is well aware of this fact.

               I agree with you. About Donkeyhote and what you said about Trump. Trump wouldn't be so hated if he were like the others. How the elite react when it comes to certain people, shows who they are afraid of. Stories that they always push as fake news says a whole lot as well. They wouldn't be bothered by, and defending, something that wasn't a threat.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump is screwing all their plans up. Every time he gets knocked down, he gets right back up. I love it! Nothing and nobody has made him break. He's fearless!

               This is why I believe President D. Trump is the plan God has for America and the world, before I came across this on the internet in April 2016 I had NEVER thought of anything political in my life, but after listening it grabbed my heart and I began to pray for Donald Trump and the plan I believe God has for him. Since then have not stopped praying for him and America - btw I am from the UK so never even really thought about outside my home country or politics to be honest :- Trump Chosen by God To Stop America's Destruction - Astounding 2011 Prophecy

                If one takes the scriptures literally then you accept the fact that God does raise men up for certain purposes. They need not be righteous. (The state of Trump's soul at this time I do not know.)  But, God raised up Cyrus (whom He called His 'servant'), and it is still debated whether Cyrus truly turned to the one true God. Of Pharaoh it is said "For this reason have I raised thee up," that is, to glorify God's name in letting His people go. However, Pharaoh's end was destruction, and that too was decreed by God. Saul was raised up by God to be a king to the people, albeit his end was apostasy. And then David was raised up. This is the Sovereignty of God, a hated but true doctrine, that God can raise up a man to fulfill God's will, whether the "end" of that person raised up is destruction or bliss/glory. Do not feel obligated to answer. As far out as it may seem (just ask AreWeSure), I have hopes of redemption for Donald Trump. "The line of the elect usually runs through the loins of the godly." (Calvin's doctrine of Election, another hated but true scriptural teaching.) And I know who his family ("loins") was/is. I know this is too 'theological' for this forum.

               That's what I keep trying to tell everyone. Don't let em get you down. This is what I mean when I say I know Trump's people and his background, spiritually speaking, can't explain right now. But I believe he was raised up by Providence for a reason. Trump is the Gray Champion.

               “Who was this Gray Champion?” Nathaniel Hawthorne asked near the end of this story in his Twice-Told Tales. No one knew, except that he had once been among the fire-hearted young Puritans who had first settled New England more than a half century earlier. Later that evening, just before the old priest-warrior disappeared, the townspeople saw him embracing the 85-year-old Simon Bradstreet, a kindred spirit and one of the few original Puritans still alive.
               <strong>
                Would the Gray Champion ever return? “I have heard,” added Hawthorne, “that whenever the descendants of the Puritans are to show the spirit of their sires, the old man appears again.”

               Here is their prediction of the rise of the Gray Champion.
              </p>
              <p>
               “Soon after the catalyst, a national election will produce a sweeping political realignment, as one faction or coalition capitalizes on a new public demand for decisive action. Republicans, Democrats, or perhaps a new party will decisively win the long partisan tug of war. This new regime will enthrone itself for the duration of the Crisis. Regardless of its ideology, that new leadership will assert public authority and demand private sacrifice. Where leaders had once been inclined to alleviate societal pressures, they will now aggravate them to command the nation’s attention. The regeneracy will be solidly under way.” – Strauss &amp; Howe, The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy - What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America's Next Rendezvous with Destiny, Paperback – December 29, 1997

                Donald Trump is the perfect Godsend, because he's the least likely person in the world to be anointed with this divine task. Those who choose to abandon him now in the final hour will live to regret it.

                 DJT is very unlikely, and he has been underestimated. Whoever thought he would win the election? Comey was so confident in HRC that he even "reopened the investigation" in October and then they tried to swing the electoral college. And look what has he done since January, nothing that makes the establishment happy. (except drop the moab, they liked that)

                   I think the reason that Comey re-opened the investigation was to take any attention away from Seth Rich news, he knew he was going to say 'nothing to see here in the new batch of emails' so everyone would rush out and vote, he did not plan on it being a negative response! with people rushing out and voting for Pres.Trump haha

                   for a while I thought Comey was on our side because he reopened the case, but he must have had a lot of pressure from fbi staff which I think he did, and a lot of confidence that H was going to win regardless. The new tarmac email proves that Comey was obstructing justice.

                   There was no reason for Trump to hide that. By doing that he's carrying water for the Deep State. He's protecting them. It's unacceptable.

                    There is a perfectly good reason to hide the tarmac meeting. Because the contents of the redacted notes would expose Pedogate.  Once Pedogate is exposed, there's no going back in time. So when we strike at the heart of the Deep State, it will be at the precise moment for maximum impact and exposure. August 6th is not that day. Patience.

                    You do understand that Muellers special counsel is for Podesta, Hillary, Obama etc? We're building a rock solid iron clad case against them. Trump and team plans on taking down the global Human trafficking criminal
syndicate, without initiating WW3.

                     I've seen no evidence of that. Please provide a link if you have one. I highly doubt they talked about Pedogate. My guess is Bill Clinton called for the meeting and it went something like this:

                       Pedogate is horrible but killing 3500 people in cold blood on 9/11 and then killing millions in two unjust wars in the Middle East are infinitely worse.

                        I describe Pedogate has a holocaust of children. Billions of lives stolen, two world wars, mass destruction, all so elites with infinite money can rape, torture, murder, and canabolize them en mass. They cook their stolen organs and serve them at $33,000 a plate dinners. They have hunting parties where they chase terrified children through the woods. They sell white children to the Saudis and buy black children for D.C.

                         You have both interesting views on this. I my self, am not a believer in god. I never liked Trump or his shows and i thought Hillary would win. (I know that she was corrupt) " i had already given up on the elections in the US. Then Trump won" (!?) i couldn't believe it first, something changed!!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Now i have a strong feeling we wont get any justice without Trump. or at least it will be hard to get any convictions. I have followed every election sens 2000 never have i seen anything like this election. 125 leaks in 126 days, MSM literary attacking the president up to 9 months after election, Impeachment filed (that would not hold in court), that he is a Russian puppet, etc..  I am have a hard time seeing Trump as one of them. I could be wrong...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         But then we are all probably f**ked. But it will not end, there so many people that know about PG.. And the majority won´t let this go.. So the End wont be pretty.

                        <p>
                         But we will win.

               Trump doesn't have the power to do it by himself. Why do you think he signed of on sanctions against Russia when all his previous signals indicated that he wanted to improve relations, especially regarding Syria?

                  Trump and Putin are so far ahead of the swamp that they laugh when shit like this happens. They know that ultimately it will be inconsequential because by this time next year, all anyone will care about in this world is how we've been colonized by a 2000 year old Satanic pedophile cult.
