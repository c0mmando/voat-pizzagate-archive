<p><strong>Was Spacey\'s accuser threatened? It has just been announced that one of his accusers of sexual assault has dropped charges. From the article:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;A man who said Kevin Spacey groped him in a Nantucket bar in 2016 has dropped his lawsuit against the actor. Mitchell Garabedian, a lawyer for the man, announced in an email Friday that the suit filed June 26 in Nantucket Superior Court has been voluntarily dismissed.</p>
<p>No reason was provided either by Garabedian or in the court filing. Garabedian said he would have no further comment.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, the suit was dismissed &quot;with prejudice,&quot; which means it cannot be refiled.</p>
<p>An email was left Friday requesting comment from Alan Jackson, Spacey\'s attorney. Spacey still faces a criminal charge.</p>
<p>Garabedian\'s client, the son of Boston television anchor Heather Unruh, alleged Spacey got him drunk and sexually assaulted him at the Club Car restaurant, where the then 18-year-old man worked. Spacey pleaded not guilty to indecent assault and battery, and his attorneys previously claimed the accuser was trying to get money from a high-profile figure.</p>
<p>While there are a range of reasons why a civil suit may be dropped so quickly after being filed, it could be an indicator a private settlement was reached and that the accuser may ultimately stop cooperating with prosecutors, said William Korman, a former prosecutor in the Suffolk County District Attorney\'s office who is now a criminal defense lawyer specializing in sexual assault cases.</p>
<p>&quot;Any settlement could not be conditioned on a refusal to cooperate with the prosecution,&quot; Korman told The Associated Press. &quot;Nevertheless, money is a great motivator for an individual not to follow through.&quot;</p>
<p>It\'s also possible prosecutors, upset with the timing of the civil suit, specifically asked the accuser to drop it, said David Yannetti, a former prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer in Boston. The civil suit was filed months into the ongoing criminal case, but such suits are typically filed after a criminal case is decided, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the prosecution said it\'s either about money or it\'s about a crime, but it can\'t be about both and you have to make a decision on where you want to go with this,&quot; Yannetti said.</p>
<p>The civil suit was likely filed before completion of the criminal case because the three-year statute of limitations is approaching, added Yannetti.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;We\'re operating with very little info, but it\'s clear something unusual is going on here,&quot; he said. &quot;Either the prosecution got involved or there was some sort of civil settlement.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>More than a dozen people have accused Spacey of sexual harassment or assault. The actor was subsequently dropped from the Netflix show &quot;House of Cards&quot; and the film &quot;All The Money in the World.&quot;&quot;</p>',
