<a href="http://thefellowshipfoundation.org/service.html">http://thefellowshipfoundation.org/service.html</a>
About 300 projects are located in over 60 countries, with a wide range of focus depending on the needs and the location. Examples of these include:</p>
<p>Befriending and mentoring children in poor areas of the US and other countries to keep them in school and out of trouble. Mentoring at-risk young people and providing shelter, food, life skills, and training for literacy, vocations, and service to their communities. Assisting single mothers, reconciling between races, economic classes and generations, and connecting those with needs to those with resources.</p>
<p>Mentoring Young People
<a href="http://thefellowshipfoundation.org/activities.html">http://thefellowshipfoundation.org/activities.html</a>
This group works with marginalized young people in developing nations as well as the underdeveloped urban centers in the US. These young people are committed to being together for 18 months-3 years and are mentored on behalf of the leadership of their country or city in four areas:</p>
<p>life skills based on the teachings of Jesus;
literacy;
a viable vocational skill;
and consistent service to their community.</p>
<p>Interesting adherence to secrecy
Small groups are the primary vehicle to build lasting personal friendships. It\'s in meeting together on a regular basis that we learn to love each other. Jesus is quoted in John 13:35 as saying it this way: &quot;by this shall all men know you are my disciples, if you love each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Certain simple factors are necessary for such groups to succeed:</p>
<p>nothing said is repeated outside the gathering,
no advantage is taken over another\'s revealed weakness,
no fixed hierarchy or authority structure is mandated,
and the safety to &quot;struggle together&quot; and wrestle with personal challenges is preserved at all times.</p>
