<p>The full text:</p>

<p>The Agency\'s posture toward the media is basically defensive, reactive and tongue-tied.  What we say is: &quot;no comment:; &quot;that disclosure was wrong and outrageous.&quot;  Next we wring our hands, send emissaries out to brief key people in the Administration and Congress and correct the record, then hunker back awaiting the next blow.  Maybe it\'s time for an offense as well as a defense and an attempt to get things in better balance.  Here are some personal thoughts as to do\'s and don\'ts on this score.</p>

<p>This is a plan to create something.  <a href="http://archive.md/o66kQ">With this CIA document, dated 8 June 1984</a>, one wonders if this was used to guide Brock in creating his CTR, and possibly in previous iterations of similar projects. </p>
<p>Given the EXACT same wording, I\'d say it\'s worth looking into; Brock and his CTR could be CIA.</p>
