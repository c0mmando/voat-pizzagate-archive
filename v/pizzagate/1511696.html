            I don't think this list is helpful because it cannot encompass the discoveries that are happening on a daily basis. It's premature to jump to hasty conclusions and dangerous since you might miss something.

             Thank you for your reply. I want to be helpful in termination of child abuse programs and pizzagate and would like to the see two causes match up. Also I want to encourage common people to take back answering questions for themselves, and promoting those answers, instead of relying on others, especially popular authority figures, to say what is a word owned by the people.

            Don't make this easy for the perpetrators and MSM to debunk by creating a narrow definition of pizzagate. It is too early to define or lock this investigation into a box of sorts.....this is a tactic employed to debunk and change people's minds. Often used in sales too. I propose that pizzagate is in discovery stage and is not an official investigation. Do not define it because the MSM will then debunk what you define it as.  A shill was just trying to say that pizzagate is about pedofilia and not canabilism regarding abromavich....this is the tactic Megan Kelly used interviewing alefantis. Limit pizzagate to code words and debunk because he is a pizza shop owner. As citizens we have not even come close to gathering the evidence or connecting the dots. It is the The grand jury and prosecuter that will need to define pizzagate . As citizens our role is generate public awareness.

             Public awareness is also one of my goals. I like to host pizzagate related items here for the criticisms and feedback but ultimately to make a case when I talk about pizzagate to someone in person or online.

             This is an important topic because it is about information authority and general authoity. Everyone has an internal lexicon that accepts new words and connects concepts, ideas, other words etc. The one responsible for that internal construction is you. It is something you do and have oversight of in your brain and in your mind which includes the feelings and reactions of your body. I am getting too abstract and pointless now.
 I just see criticism and i was looking for your short definition. My post is attempt to merge my own ideas of what pizzagate is with my perspective of what it means to others while answering some common questions like who what where when why how.
 Next i will define the pizzagate argument as best as i can by picking out what i think are the most incriminating items in the catagories of emails, art, instagrams, associations, statistics, and history (interviews, stories, (redpill videos), etc)
And this is not professional but more a common volunnteer effort to help people win debates when it comes to answering public questions about pizzagate like is it real? Are the people in question guilty? Has their been an official investigation? Should their be an official investigation? (I was talking to my ex on the phone about a week ago and she thought the story had been investigated by the fake-actor-shooter)
Should there be censorship of pizzagate?
Should you feel taboo to talk about it?
Should you feel scared to talk about it?
Why should you feel scared to talk about it?
Many important questions to work on answering.

              What are you talking about ? You sound like a crazy person. Right and wrong is simple.Just so you know it has just been revealed by the dc police on FOIA that they never investigated. Although they stated in a press release that they investigated. There is no investigation this is a cover up. The citizens are focusing light on everything these evil elites are doing. Their lies will be exposed to the world. Like I said tick tock every dog has his day, every child who has been harmed will be acknowledged and avenged. The investigators here will not let it go.

            I would remove the word  Comet in number 8.    Pingpong seems to be a global code, which has been noted  globally,  (London, Berlin, Japan, ) not just in Comet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd mention the word WikiLeaks and remove the name Podesta with politicians, elite and average public.   It's so much more than podesta's the molestas, although they are one part of the WikiLeaks.
