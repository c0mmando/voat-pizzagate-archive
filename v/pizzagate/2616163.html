<p>Meanwhile an american <strong>Seth Bekenstein, convicted of heinous CP, is brother of Joshua Bekenstein, director at Bain capital.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;One of those arrested in the US for purchasing and distributing the videos was Seth Bekenstein, brother of bilionaire Joshua Bekenstein who posted Seth’s $500,000 bail. Seth pled guilty and was given only 18 months in a federal detention facility, even though he was distributing pornography that showed the torture and murder of children. In comparison, non-jewish George Thrasher was sentenced in Florida to 360 years prison for possession of 60 non-violent images. In Arizona, Morton Berger was given 200 years for 20 non-violent images.&quot; 18 months!!!</p>
<p>Both the brother and his colleague at Bain <strong>Jonathan S. Lavine, who you probably DONT recognize as a director of Center for American Progress alongside founder John Podesta, are involved with Horizons for Homeless Children.</strong></p>

<p>That leads to another interesting article: <strong>What happens when Comet Pizza’s James Alefantis knows too much? - Capriccio For A Sausage Fest By Chef Alefantis  By Yoichi Shimatsu</strong> 
<a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=63032">http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=63032</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>December 11, 2012 2 p.m to 9 p.m. <strong>Jimmy Comet was invited with 757 other guests to First Lady Michelle Obama’s Toys for Tots</strong> collection. Alefantis, who collected toys from customers at Comet Pizza and his Buck’s restaurant, was scheduled to arrive at 2 p.m. indicating that he may have attended an unlisted meeting before the evening reception. Undoubtedly, the regulars at Comet Pizza had closets full of toys for young boys and girls with enough to spare for orphans and poor youths in the ghetto, an investment in the future if there ever was. Merry XXXmas, kids. Want to sit on Santa’s lap? </p>

<p>The full article here: <a href="https://rense.com/general96/capricciopizza8.htm">https://rense.com/general96/capricciopizza8.htm</a></p>

<p><strong>Pinging Doktor Pong</strong>
 
<em>The Obama-Alefantis connection has deeper roots, as shown by the availability of a ham-and-pineapple pizza in East Berlin. Our passage to Hawaii starts below the Berlin Wall, or what’s left of it, into the Death Strip on the edge of uber-hip Green Party stronghold Prenzlauerberg. This section of the infamous wall was preserved as a stretch of open space to memorialize East Germans who attempted escape but were gunned by the GDR border guards. ..</em></p>

            In 1998, Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons, a child welfare service company, merged with Corporate Family Solutions, a firm that provided similar services and which was founded in 1987 by Lamar Alexander and Bob Keeshan, who had been known to millions of American children as television’s “Captain Kangaroo.” The merged company, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, was acquired by Mitt Romney’s former firm, Bain Capital, in 2008.

Seth pled guilty and was given only 18 months in a federal detention facility, even though he was distributing pornography that showed the torture and murder of children. In comparison, non-jewish George Thrasher was sentenced in Florida to 360 years prison for possession of 60 non-violent images.

             Well I agree with you that as a demographic women are being manipulated and 'nudged'. Not the only demographic, of course.  Society as a whole is being engineered via the transformation agenda.

            The network of child care providers linked to Alexander is also linked to the University of Tennessee and Penn State University, the latter the nexus for the pedophilia scandal involving former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and his The Second Mile Foundation. Graham Spanier, the former president of Penn State who was fired over the Sandusky scandal, had previously served as chancellor of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Spanier's close friend was his predecessor as chancellor, Ronald Roskans, a close friend of and adviser to fallen GOP rising star Lawrence King, who operated the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union of Omaha. King was implicated in a major GOP pedophile scandal, known as the "Franklin Cover-up," said to have involved former President George H W Bush.

            I remember reading about this quite some time ago.  They also closed down two day cares owned by Alexander and Keeshan.  Had a VERY hard time finding any info on the close down of the day care centers and sexual abuse claims by parents.  BUT of all things I found one in Wa-Poo.

            "If they ever said, We're sorry this happened to your daughter,' we wouldn't be here," the father said. "Not only did they never say that, they don't think it happened to her."
           </p>
           <p>
            But child protection investigators in two counties found that sexual abuse did occur, and one investigation named the teacher as "the maltreator," which if upheld would put her name in a national registry of abusers. Nonetheless, Montgomery County prosecutors declined to file a criminal case because their medical expert was not certain the girl was abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            The teacher's attorney denies her client molested the child and will appeal the maltreator finding. The center's owner and operator also dispute the allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            An investigation by child protective services in Prince George's County, where the family lives, cleared the father. Child welfare advocates, state regulators and other agitated parents say the case would have been less wrenching if the center had followed a cardinal rule in all child abuse allegations -- a prompt report to the local hot line.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are such shenanigans involved here with the teacher charged and those supporting her actions, it is just totally ridiculous.  There is back and forth and the doctor verifies there was truth in the child's remarks and suspicious charges by the teacher blaming the father.  This is the usual response from those that are guilty and pointing the finger back at the accuser.  TOTAL BS.

            <p>
             Founded by Domino's Pizza owner, Thomas S. Monaghan in 1987, this
foundation is a primary conduit for his charitable giving. Apart from
the Vatican and local Michigan charities, the chief beneficiaries have
been conservative Catholic causes with ties to the Ann Arbor,
Michigan-based charismatic Word of God-Sword of the Spirit network
[investigated by the Church for cult-like activities]. Monaghan insists
that, though he admires WG-SS, he is not a member.
            </p>
            <p>
             Monaghan has also provided at least $100,000 for the televangelism
programs of Word of God-Sword of the Spirit cofounder Ralph Martin, who
serves with him on the FUS board, and of Sword of the Spirit
televangelist Fr. John Bertolucci.
             <strong>
              Both Martin and Monaghan were
inducted into the Knights of Malta in the late 1980s and participated in
a January 199 ceremony which featured a keynote address by outgoing US

             BREAKING NEW PIZZA LEAD: Pizza-Vatican Connection, Domino's Pizza Founder Tom Monaghan Connected to Catholic Child Abusers
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan is a Catholic devout and activist. He is the founder of Legatus, and is a close friend of Cardinal Bevilacqua, who was for many long years his ecclesiastical advisor. He still calls him "invaluable" and a "dear friend"
            </p>
            <p>
             Cardinal Bevilacqua was found by a grand jury to have excused and enabled the sexual abuse of dozens of priests on hundreds of children at the Philadelphia Archdiocese between 1987 and 2003. He covered up and transferred an extremely dangerous predator, Father Romano J. Ferraro, who is now serving a life sentence. Three priests and a parochial school teacher were arrested for the rape and assault of young children in their care.

             Lifting the lid on the pizza man
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            excerpts:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Domino's Farms, the headquarters of the worldwide pizza business outside Ann Arbor, Michigan, is worth the detour, as the Michelin Guide would say. The building is a sleek, low-slung brick affair in the pleasing style of Frank Lloyd Wright and there are added surprises, like the herd of buffalo roaming the grounds and a children's petting zoo. If you are a journalist, however, don't bother.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing about Mr Monaghan's ultra- conservatism, his devotion to word-of-God Catholicism and his already public philanthropic forays in Central America. And certainly no mention of his opposition to abortion. Could I, please, pass by the farms and pick up any press package you might care to give me? "It'll be in the lobby."
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Or could it just be the Tar Paper Shack that was worrying them? A deliberately humble structure somewhere on the grounds, it was originally designed as a playhouse for a grandson but recently has been favoured by Mr Monaghan for high-powered meetings and even for entertaining visiting Catholic cardinals.
            </p>
            <p>
             A pizza man for almost three decades now, Tom Monaghan, married with four daughters, is a figure of baffling contrasts. Most recently, there has been the devout, almost monkish Monaghan, the anti-tycoon. Insofar as he has mixed at all with his corporate peers, it has been as founder of Legatus, an association of 450 Catholic chief executives from around the country, who occasionally travel together to places with some Catholic connection.

             I think it is because they transgender the children. That's why you never find them. Example is Ray Chandler's casting company. All of the those kids and teens were transgendered.
