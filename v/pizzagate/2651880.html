<p>detectives have uncovered an “unprecedented” amount of child pornography including images, videos and other explicit content discovered within the walls of the Vatican.The Vatican Promotor of Justice, Gian Piero Milano, released a report in response to the allegations which he read in full to Catholic Church officials during a judicial ceremony.Due to the Catholic Church’s internal investigations protocol, Milano claims he is under no legal obligation to actually name names of people accused of pedophilia and possessing child pornography.However, Federico Lombardi, spokesman for the Holy See, showed a rare display of openness and named Archbishop Josef Wesolowski as one of the accused that had triggered the investigation.Although this may seem like a forthcoming gesture by the Vatican, reports of Wesolowski not only possessing more than 100,000 images and videos of children being forced into sex acts but also of him sexually abusing multiple children in Poland and the Dominican Republic have already previously been exposed in 2014.</p>
<p>Due to the Vatican’s internal policies, Wesolowski was investigated but escaped jail for “his own protection”.In an unusual move by the church, the high-ranking Catholic official was facing trial from the Vatican’s prosecution for his crimes and had been placed under “protective” house arrest, but mysteriously died before the case even reached a “courtroom”.The lack of justice following his death left many of his victims frustrated with suggestions that the only reason for the house arrest is the fact that word got out that he was allowed to roam free after he was quietly whisked away from the Dominican Republic and back to the Catholic city-state by Vatican officials in order to avoid prosecution there.</p>
<p>According to Church and State, the descriptions of what was actually found on Wesolowski’s computer were more than a little stomach-churning:There were more than 160 videos of teenaged boys being forced to masturbate for the camera and perform sex acts on one another.In addition, the boys were raped and forced to perform sex acts on adults, as well.Wesolowski was tedious and protective of his child porn collection, filing more than 86,000 images into categories in locked folders.In addition to the images and videos present on the computer, at least 45,000 others had already been deleted.</p>',

            , could you add some corroborating links to this? The "USAPatriotsNews" site looks like one of those Macedonian Fake News purveyors. I'll give this the the 24 Hour Grace flair. Thanks.

            Catholicism is Satanism. These things will be made public to further solidify to the sleeping masses that Christianity is synonymous with The Catholic Church, and therefore Christianity and pedophilia are inextricably linked, and will pave the way for the final demonisation of Christianity, the Bible, and Christ, as these are the things these complete lunatics hate most, particularly the Vatican who literally and outwardly worship Lucifer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Catholic Church is a useful and necessary tool used by (((them))) to "expose" the pedophilia to the masses, and then ultimately usher in the abolishment of true Biblical worship of Christ and implement total Satanic New Age slavery

            Since Jesus says to kill pedos, let's at least be creative about it and use those words in the pedo priests.

            Tie a millstone around their necks -&gt; give them an oxygen mask -&gt; put them on a naval transport full of catapults which sets sail to the Marianas Trench -&gt; put mill stone in the launch pad of catapults -&gt; fire the catapults. Monokuma costumes should be worn by the people manning the catapults.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hint: Its not drowning that kills them. It's water pressure that does the job.

              The part about being tied to a millstone and cast into the sea. That's what been read from you pedo defending libtard.
             </p>

              The fact that you don't believe pedos should be put to death JUST for being pedophiles everything about you.

             I can't help but think that it would be better to have him and the stone in the catapult together, that way the force of the stone pulling the rope around his neck does not snap it and he dies before reaching unbearable depths.

             I would really like a reference to Jesus'  position on pedophiles. India, I believe has instituted the death penalty for raping a child.  Its not so much the revenge factor for me but rather eliminating  these  freaks of nature from the gene pool. Now Hitler killed off homosexuals. I wonder if  Germany's percentage of homosexuals is lower than other nations as a result. I am in no way suggesting killing homosexuals but rather Im pondering whether the death sentence for pedophiles who rape  would provide a solution for society.
