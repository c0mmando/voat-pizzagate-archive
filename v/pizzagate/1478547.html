            Flairing as possible false flag (disinformation).
           </p>
           <p>
            Ted Gunderson was a disinformant (controlled opposition/black propaganda).
           </p>
           <p>
            His goal was actually to
            <strong>
             discredit
            </strong>
            claims of elite pedophile rings (and claims about 9/11) by introducing fake evidence, "poisoning the well," giving talks to groups of conspiracy researches to get them to adopt bad evidence and false "tinfoil hat" versions of their theories (e.g. "no plane at the Pentagon"), in order to discredit the true general claims (e.g. 9/11 = inside job) with the general public. He promoted the "Pentagon missile" disinfo, and he promoted the McMartin Preschool case as an example of an elite pedophile ring. The McMartin case is a well-known case of false allegations. The mother who made the initial allegations was crazy (some claim her suspicions of abuse
            <em>
             made
            </em>
            her crazy, but she admitted in court she already had mental issues). She based it all on her son having disrupted bowel movements. The jury exonerated the accused because video showed the interviewers basically coercing the toddlers into saying they were abused, using leading questions that violated California guidelines at the time.
            <strong>
             One of the kids sent an apology to the LA times as an adult
            </strong>
            . That case was the real case of false memories that spawned the whole concept. I have seen claims that Gunderson has connection to The Temple of Set (founder was Michael Aquino, Presidio military abuse case perpetrator), and that he married Anton LaVey's widow (can't find reliable source on that yet).

               Gunderson has been a promoter of just about every bogus theory one can come up with: Area 51, reptilians, the Illuminati, FEMA internment camps, a United Nations army taking over the United States, chemtrails, "pineapple bombs" at Oklahoma, no-planes on 9/11 and
               <strong>
                millions

               alex jones, and others, if they have been following orders, will hopefully be moved to stop doing so, soon. He has not been very real, and it is a worry. I was hoping he might distinguish himself, on pizzagate. This should be an issue, that brings all people out of their respective corners. Even disinfo agents if they have been, need to be reviewing their choices now.

               you overcredit criminals and pedophiles to think they are capable of double bluffs, and reverse -reverse pshychology. look at them panicking now, that they have been found out. they are barely conscious resisters of life, who can not help, but be exposed for their unbecoming ways. ted represents the truth in all of us, that should be talking at every meeting we can, until this is known. the man was murdered for speaking out. for the record no one is an agent. even agents are not agents. they are under a spell. they do not want to be doing those things. they think they have to. there is no such thing as evil -let alone, is it everywhere- it does not even exist. There is just extreme resistance to life, by about one percent of the world. We have no real reason to feel helpless at all. Please be careful, not to credit them too much. I commend your caution, but a certain amount of realisation, of their lack of realisation, is needed. If they were aware people, they would not be doing these things. They would fill their life, with good things, instead, and be loved for it. they do these dark things, to avoid the light of life. when we can see that, the battle will be mostly won.

That would take phenomenal planning, and these people are barely awake.  Overcrediting these criminals, is big mistake. They are one percent of the world, and just a group of life hating, truth resisting,  old pedophiles, who no one likes. They have no great power, unless we give it to them. stop giving it to them. Focus on the information, because whatever you think of Ted, it is unquestionable.

                   nothing wrong here. I just believe he is one the most credible witnesses that has spoken out about this, and that any claims about his integrity, need to be very well validated. i remain convinced he is an inspirational saint. I find it extremely hard to believe, anyone in government is going to pay someone to make the claims about them, that he did. I am glad you have raised this concern. it gives me the incentive, to research him more, and show he is genuine. if he is not, i will be the first to admit it. i am certainly not ruling anything out. fixed mindedness, is not the way to the truth. i hope you are also open to the possibility that i am right, and he simply was a courageous man, who spoke up about what was happneing. there are a great number of them, who are good, and do not like what is happening. i hope we will see many more.

                    Then you are naive to something called black propaganda.  If he really was trying to expose what was happening, they would have suicided him.  Instead, he went to groups of people who already knew what was happening, and poisoned them with fake evidence and sensationalized "tinfoil hat" versions of the truth, which effectively kept the truth from spreading.

                     nothing tinfoil about what he said, in my opinion. That was one of the things i liked about him. He was objective, and let the facts speak for themselves. If these high level criminals had the cleverness necessary, to conduct such strategies, they would not be abusing children. They would do good things instead. Only people, in a bitter fight against awareness, do any of these dark things. They are not super intelligent. They are not very powerful. The only power they have, is what we give them. They are simply craven pedophiles, who only know how to make transparent propaganda, and to say how dare you, when caught out, instead of answering the concerns . There is no way on Earth, they are going to employ someone, to say they are pedophiles. If they did, they should not have picked someone so solid, clear ,and forthright. The shills they do employ are obvious and easy to spot... Jeff Gannon is Johnny Gosch, and he is afraid to speak up, because people like us, are too busy arguing over the finer points, to see, what they add up to, is something that should stop all of us in our tracks, and have us doing nothing else, but scrutinise it, until it is solved.

                 no one, is really an agent. no one is really a politician, or any of the other personas. no one would  would be doing that, or any of the other things they do, if the truth were known. it is purely the result, of the truth being resisted.  all people, alive, aware people, would be doing all they can to help children. that is why i believe ted. i do not believe that any pedophiles or criminals, who are so sick and life hating, could have the cleverness, to put out an agent, who acts like an ex fbi guy ,and expose them but poisons the water. they are not aware people. that is chess level thinking, and they are checker players.    ... he died on arsenic poisoning. that is murder. he does not talk like a liar either. he is very clear and forthright. liars, read from scripts, and pause all the time.

            Well, it's certainly a compelling theory, and I can see a resemblance. Did his mom actually say she thinks it's him, too? In the documentary "Who Took Johnny?"  I believe they said he secretly visited her and told her to stop trying to find him. I always wondered what he told her that day, because she listened and kept such a mind-blowing secret for years. It definitely supports the idea that he could still be alive, though. Thanks for the new info, I think this case is so important to understanding all that we are up against. Especially for anyone who says that this kind of thing doesn't happen. Sadly, we know all too well that it does.

             she knows it his him, going by what she has said. she has asked him, if it is not him to prove it.. he still wont. if anyone were investigating the case, they would have gone straight to him. but they have not touched it.

            This is very old news - "JG" connection to many other aliases, etc. but always good to review for newcomers. Lots to learn from the Franklin case and the associated murders of researchers, victims and a sweet dear woman who served as foster mother to horribly abused kids from the Franklin family...

            The argument against Schurter would be that he himself is an anomaly for what would normally happen to these victims. So what's to say there aren't other anomalies like keeping a brain washed soldier?

             i have seen that argument. and i am always open to the truth, wherever it leads. i am sure it is him, though, as are other survivors ...his own family would have spoken up by now, if he really has one. as would any family members of the children in the photos on alefantis's page. who would stand by, while speculation like that was alive? they would disprove it, if they could.

              It's certainly bizarre. I was reading more on that David Schurter's blog about Scalia. After everything we've read historically speaking, about the prior investigations and witness statements, his theory sure is interesting.

               I think, whatever the case, she could have some valid reasons for not pressing the truth of this matter, and Jeff could, for not admitting who he is. There needs to be a universal agreement of some kind, that makes the truth welcome, and makes people that come forward, feel confident. Until there is, the root of this problem, appears to be, that the law prosecutes victims and protects offenders, when it comes to this most serious of crimes. It is something nearly 99 percent of us, feel wholeheartedly about, yet they have managed to make us feel helpless about it, so far. I think it is a big wake up call. Until children, are safe beyond a doubt, then no one is really living. To think they are, is fooling themsleves. We are living in minoutaur maze, and we need to find the way out..

               i have to agree. he does make some excellent points. all these points will add up to a full picture, if we keep sifting through them.

            i did not know this before. johnny came and told his mu,. with a minder in tow, not to pursue this. fits the jeff gannon story perfectly. no way jeff gannon is ten years older. he is the same age. he is just waiting for some public support to get real, before coming out. I can hardly blame him...
