<p>Jason Leonard, from Haslingden, has been described by police bosses at a court hearing as ‘one of the most dangerous’ registered sex offenders in the region.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old brazenly admitted to wanting the freedom to travel to a country where the age of consent is lower so he could form a sexual relationship, the court heard.</p>
<p>Police told the hearing Leonard had told them his ‘ideal’ partner, would be aged between 12 and 14, Burnley Crown Court was told.</p>
<p>A judge heard that Leonard claims paedophiles in the UK are being ‘persecuted’ and likens his treatment by society to that of ‘homosexuals 40 years ago’.</p>
<p>However, after losing a court appeal, he will now only be granted permission to travel abroad if he has written permission from a police chief constable.</p>
<p>Leonard was jailed for 32 months in 2013 after downloading 251 indecent images of children and then sharing them on the internet.</p>
<p>Detective Constable Andrew Ashworth, who manages more than 90 registered sex offenders in Lancashire, told the Crown Court hearing that Leonard is ‘one of the most dangerous offenders I have met’ and that he posed an ‘exceptional risk’.</p>
<p>Mr Leonard has expressed his desire to leave the country because he believes the police, judiciary and government in this country are persecuting paedophiles.</p>
<p>“He is very vocal and adamant about this persecution.</p>
<p>“He likens it to the persecution of homosexuals 40 years ago.</p>
<p>“He believes that in the fullness of time paedophilia will be accepted in the same way that homosexuality is today.</p>
<p>&quot;He has expressed a desire to move to other European countries. He has talked about the Netherlands, France, Spain and Italy because he believes they have a lower age of consent in the mid to low teens.”</p>
<p>When DC Ashworth asked Leonard in March this year what age is too young for sexual activity he replied ‘if a child is old enough to talk it’s old enough to have sex’, the court was told, and that when Leonard was asked about his views on rape he replied ‘no comment’.</p>
<p>&quot;Leonard] has accepted that his mother, who he has a close connection with, is a factor in holding him back as to his sexual lifestyle.</p>
<p>“He has indicated that when she dies, and she is an elderly woman in her 80s, he will go abroad to seek children. For me the only pro-social influence in his life at the moment is his mother and that’s purely because she is alive.”</p>

            This is so sick and disturbing! But thank you for a great post! It is definitely an example of the mindset to promote pedophilia as just a sexual orientation.

            , can you add a line to this explaining that it is relevant to
            <em>
             elite
            </em>
            child sex abuse via the pop culture trend of normaliing child sexual consent and because it demonstrates how pedos seek to exploit age of consent laws? I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit. Thanks!

            Omg he's a land whale! Let him have sex with a wood chipper. Sometimes I think these kinds of pedos feel they have to resort to kids because they're so hideous that women unilaterally reject them, but a child that's vulnerable enough juuuust might be groomable. 12 year olds are already too sophisticated for him though. They'd run screaming and that tub of lard would never catch up.

            Glad to see you back.  Mama better get some protection if his sick perverted needs are not met.  Possibly she is helping provide them?  Or she is his means of support, monetarily.  I don't believe for one minute he is not acting on his pedophilia.

                        And all the sheep hang on every word about the Royals.  Their bleeping weddings and fake prego babies.  Wake Up. I think both Harry and William are Gay.

                            I was not into the hippy scene either.  my parents would have killed me. lol.  They hated those clothes. I did go wild over the Beatles but that's about it.  Royals, Nope.  Never interested me, but never thought about them inbreeding and raping children.  Who knew.  Horrid stuff we are finding out about the rulers.  Not that I ever thought highly of any of them, I never suspected what we now know.
