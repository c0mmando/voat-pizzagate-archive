<p>I have to add that I have some questions on this guy. He has been &quot;verified&quot; with Reddit, but I am an concerned because his name is never stated.  It\'s the only AMA I have seen with out a name. His description in the AMA is very specific, yet not detailed. His AMA is very informative and he even continued to answer questions days later.  He was very positive and after he was initially asked if Trump was aware of pizzagate he did not answer, but came back a day later and said &quot;we confirm.&quot;</p>
<p>I also find it strange that for someone who is so connected to Trump that he doesn\'t have much twitter activity (retweets and likes) and his tone on his tweets is much more negative than the AMA.

<p>Anyway, hopefully he is who he says he is and is connected to Trump just like he says.</p>',

            I asked on twitter, several days ago, if he was the one who did the AMA, and he said Yes.  His tweets have been hysterical.  He's going HAM on tons of people, which is entertaining as hell, but definitely a departure from his demeanor during the AMA.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I read his tweet about Podesta, it gave me some hope as well.

            I hate to keep coming back to this.. But this guy's Twitter and the AMA don't match up. Is Reddit to be trusted to really verify a person. I know the AMA links to the Twitter and the AMA has been referenced in his twitter, but I think it was actually some one else answering the questions on the AMA. If someone could figure out who this guy is,  I am super curious.

             I've also noticed the big difference in tone between the AMA and the Twitter account. In the AMA he's very respectful of people. The twitter account attacks people.

            That's the point that we don't know how much to trust Seaman's sources. He was right about some things it seemed so we were giving them more credibility, but now he's been wrong and he's doubling down. If he's wrong again, I think we have to stop trusting his sources.

            A bit weird. He seems rather unrestricted when tweeting than the AMA, aside from a few shitposts. Nevertheless, seems promising that someone this close to Trump is on board the PizzaGate revolution.

            I been here from the first few posts on vote pizzagate, I have gone through every post and every bit of information wether it seems bullshit or fabricated that i can consume and to be honest have completely lost my fucking mind thinking how horrible that this god damn awful shits been taking place for so long and just now people are beginning to look 2017 how many victims have been lost, they are hiding something podesta is obviously involved the spineless police who have covered it up and protected them need the full wrath of the law brought down on them, where are the good people are they doing enough if not as a collective people need to act if we don't see arrests made then we cant let it be covered up its too sick they have to pay for this fuck these motherfuckers. Sitting in Australia i feel powerless to act :(

             Jesuits and catholic church has copped some flak in pedo regards.Maybe they take a little heat from them selves by establishing that it is not a priest, but societal problem.

             I am in the USA and I also feel powerless to act. These are massive opponents we have. Giants in the political world. Our only hope right now is Trump, and if he doesn't come through...God help us. But we'll keep fighting. And we appreciate the support from our foreign friends!

              Pray....what does the bible say about the protocol for dealing with evil people?.....We had the Cronulla riots in Australia over some muslims apparent bashing of the good ol" australian icon "the lifesaver"
                     All the caring aussies gathered together for some good wholesome fun of striking up a BBQ and unleashing the drink at 8 oclock in the morning....After the had heard the speeches the crowd decided they wanted to locate the alledge accused and met out their own justice....They did not find a lebanese person but entered into the trains and started whooping into anyone that fitted their broad minds image of what the lebanese look like....They bashed a bangladesh man...
                    Dont become the lynch mob....the lynch mob had the same judgement as a jealous husband........

            , you can see something is brewing. What that is is just a guess by anyone at this point. Now Roger Stone gets in on it and this guy from the AMA. It's clear the deep state is playing games trying to stage a narrative with Trump being "out of control", Russia being pissed, ect. Looks like a narrative for a False Flag with a set-up to blame Russia and plunge us into another unending war which means $$$$$ for all the pedo elites.

            You know, I didn't even consider how much easier it would be to get one of them to just spill everything voluntarily out of self preservation by stressing them out; making each day their last as far as the pedos know. Won't nab Podesta that way, but potentially some of those who have been complacent and possibly in on the whole deal who are wanting to step to the side of the fan before the shit starts flying.

             By time someone such as Podesta or the Clintons gets to where they are in life, they really think and believe they will never be caught. They think they are smarter than the rest of us and lack hubris. Usually greed or lack of hubris brings them down.

            Well if he flees to Mexico...they have great machetes. One thing Mexicans don't tolerate is competition for their little girls.

            I do not believe any of them will be charged with anything related to pedophilia. If we want them jailed for life or executed we're going to have to hope for RICCO, corruption, traitor type charges. Let's get honest with ourselves..our country currently does not really punish pedos. Hopefully the pedo shit will be mentioned...but to ensure a lengthy prison term they probably shouldn't charge them with it.

            It's happening!  It's going down.... what your seeing is everyone stepping out and going public... Courage is contagious as the WikiLeaks store shirts say... they are rallying the troops, they are letting them know they are behind them..  They are saying in effect we got your back, now gear up and go do this!!!!!

            If you follow the details that he gives away in the AMA it's not all that difficult to sort out, but why do you want to dox him. If he was a fake he would have been called out. Trump's media staff monitor TD. Trump has done an AMA.

            Fuckin A I'd run naked down the street in joy (ok well that's probably a crime) if Podesta the Molesta is the first to hit the noose. He won't be captured alive, but I will  CELEBRATE his death. WE WILL make PIZZA ok to enjoy again.

             Trump is just as guilty as Podesta. There aren't going to be any arrests. You guys are buying everything the Trump people are trying to sell. All you're going to get is excuses.

            I'm at a point where I gave them last week. I was even willing to push it back from mid-week to the end of the week. None of the high-profile arrests promised happened. I'm not calling anybody a liar, but I can't afford to wait for things to happen anymore. None of us can. We need to start being skeptical of all of this stuff and send a message that even Pizzagate investigators are waiting until the arrests actually happen. It's not good enough to dangle a carrot any longer.

              1) Atheists do understand the concept of faith, we just don't rely on it (in the religious sense).
             </p>
             <p>
              2) #Pizzagate is an investigative movement based on evidence, not a religious movement based on faith.

               Do atheists believe in evolution, or is that a 'false dichotomy'? How did we 'get here'? What's the difference between an atheist and an agnostic? Is science a religion? (Just curious about the way everybody thinks.)

               Understanding religion will help to make sense of why this is happening. But it is not required to investigate. It just makes a hell of a lot more sense why its happening if you read the kabbalah.

                Why do you think an atheist can't "understand religion"? I grew up in a Catholic household for crying out loud. I went through every year of CCD but one. I was baptized, went through 1st communion, had godparents, and was witness to a wedding in a Catholic church. I've read at least parts of many holy books, including many different versions of the Bible, the Tao Te Ching, the Qur'an, etc. Heck, I've even said the rosary as well as prayers, sung hymns, been a part of masses, went to mass on a weekly basis, etc.

                imho, it's ignorant to think atheists aren't familiar with the various nooks of religion; more often than not atheists grew up in a religious home or were religious themselves before embracing critical thinking and atheism(not that they hold a monopoly on critical thinking; it's just that the best way to debunk the Bible is to use all the inconsistencies in the Bible) ..

                That said, this investigation may have religious elements, but those elements can also be explained as part of the CIA and their hard ons for MK Ultra; religion has been used for eons to control people. Children raised in religious homes can be compelled to do fucked up shit out of fear of going to Hell. Show religious kids Hell on Earth through torture, and they'll do whatever it takes to survive.

                 Reading the bible will not tell you why this is happening. You must read some books on ceremonial magik. The bible has rituals in it but it doesn't really explain what you are doing. Got to read some more specific stuff. Not many people have read the Torah or Kabbalah. Let alone the Talmud.

                  People can do those rituals, doesn't mean they are literally invoking very real demons. One can look at rituals from the Assyrians and even the Brahman priests in southern India (which is an older civilization when compared to those in the Middle East) ... they can do the same rituals for ten thousands years, doesn't mean that the beings they invoke are literal beings and not mere archetypes.

                  I own books on ceremonial magick. I served in a pagan circle for a handful of years as a priestess (we were the cuddlier type of pagan, following the Wiccan Rede; "and if it harm none, do what thou will.") so I feel I'm somewhat knowledgeable on the subject.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The History of Magic and the Occult by Kurt Seligmann is one of my favorites. The first line of the foreword goes:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   "I don't want realism," cries Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams's
                   <em>
                    A Streetcar Named Desire
                   </em>
                   , "I want magic." As Kurt Seligmann makes brilliantly clear in The History of Magic and the Occult, his authoritative study of the supernatural arts, she is not alone in that desire. Since earliest recorded time men and women have struggled to make magic-- that most elusive and inexplicable wonder-- in an attempt to control and make sense of their world and themselves.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  At it's heart, magic is about control; nature, animals, events, people. Those associated with the Moloch worship are seeking control. To them, the ritualized actions give them power. They aren't in power because of their actions, per se, but because those who have the power to stop them choose to enable them instead, because it makes them money. I have come to this conclusion due to reading The Franklin Cover-Up where John DeCamp talks about the ritualized abuse of those kids, and then Trance Formation of America by Cathy O'Brien, where she talks about the CIA using religion as a means of psychological torture; the murder of babies by children as a means to break that child's psyche for training. The rituals, to me, are like a horrible play/snuff film directed by the CIA. They get politicians to participate as "actors" to help torture/train some of these kids; politicians get little career boosts for being part of the super-secret club, the CIA gets child porn they can sell, and children they can sell/trade/dispose of like they are the fucking Lalauries of New Orleans while making buddies overseas by gifting them with abused children.

                  I suppose to sum up my views, is that there may be some who practice this brand of evil for esoteric reasons, but I think the majority who partake do so at the CIA's behest, because they are sadists, get off on power trips, and enjoy torturing children. They engage in it because they can afford to do so and is a symbol of status for those in the know. That they will pass whatever legislation CIA whispers into their ear for dicking other countries because if they don't comply with their masters, they get outed and career ended, maybe even imprisoned due to the blackmail the CIA curated on them. That if they go along and don't rock the boat, they'll make some cash. Moloch is an excuse to commit these crimes against humanity because at their heart, power and greed are their true gods.

             What is it that you can't afford to wait for? Seaman promised to out his "confidential source" if the arrests promised didn't happen. You make it seem like it's just this OMG reddit/voat has evidence..ARREST HIM. The point is to do it and make sure he cannot wiggle out.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also do not expect them to be arrested for child abuse. Please use common sense. Even the Mafia couldn't ever actually be charged for their actual crimes, they got them using RICCO.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're likely to be disappointed if you're expecting child abuse charges. FUCKIN A we want him in prison for the rest of his life, not captured and released like the rest of the pedos!

               HAHA what's the punishment for that? Being banned from twitter eh? Nah, they're either gonna jump or be charged with everything BUT child abuse/pedophilia. That's fine....we need to take them out of circulation ASAP and KP charges are not going to do the job. Sadly.

                Someone said that seriously after Alefantis had been threatening that PG researcher, it just really tickled me, like that got Capone for tax evasion, they can get this pervert for cyber bullying. It made me laugh even more that they were serious and hadn't seen the funny side. No idea what the punishment is for cyber bullying, but seems like it would be something along the lines of detention or no TV after 8pm or something.

              That's not good enough for me. We were promised high-profile arrests by Wednesday. It's now Sunday and nothing. Now we're getting more promises for the future. I'm sick of promises. I want results. You should demand results as well.

              He has been reportedly briefed on the situation, and obviously he has been working with these agencies already. The swearing in is a bit of a formality as long as he gets the confirmation vote. Remember that we were promised arrests I think around Monday or Tuesday or maybe Tuesday or Wednesday by FBI Anon. Something like that. I gave it a few more days. Nothing happened. Now we're seeing more promises. He had Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Why should I think that Monday will be different? Maybe it will be, but I need to see results to believe it now. David Seaman even said last week we were supposed to see high profile arrests, and we didn't. Why are you making excuses for them? Hold them accountable on the evidence that they made predictions that did not come true.
