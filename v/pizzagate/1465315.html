English is not my first language and unfortunately I don\'t have time to add the sources to each of my arguments below, but I still hope they make sense. </p>
<p>First: I think it is <strong>very important</strong> to always mention the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyMvYT0vBV0&amp;feature=youtu.be">validating the authenticity of two of Alefantis\' instagram pictures</a>. (please somebody archive it) We need to make sure the simple counterargument &quot;those pictures are fakes / have been photoshopped&quot; are destroyed with hard evidence. This video proves it and makes the whole pizza story more credible for skeptics.</p>
<p>Now, here is how I usually &quot;pitch&quot; pizzagate.</p>
<p>I usually start by attacking media bias. Media argue that those are pizza restaurants for families and young people and that people claiming otherwise are conspirationists. So first thing to do is to make them lose all credibility to the eye of the skeptic: don\'t use big words like &quot;pedophilia&quot; or &quot;satanism&quot;, just start by saying how unprofessional the medias are for not considering the deviant sexual atmosphere of those places. Here, show the instagram pictures, and get ready to face a &quot;those have been photoshopped/fake account&quot;, and immediately show the Alefantis\' video above confirming the validity of the two main pictures. Then build on that: show the other pictures, show the art in the pizzeria, and show videos of the crazy artists they invite, while claiming it is for all age. Don\'t insist too much on &quot;pedophilia&quot;, be much more focused on how deviant it is, and how unprofessional the medias are when claiming there is &quot;nothing to be seen here&quot;.</p>
<p>Once you are done with the pizzeria, explain how it is related to our favorite politicians (podesta, hillary, etc.). Show the pictures demonstrating the relationship: you have now enough credibility to put it as a fact. Hillary, Obama, and Podesta are related to this thing. Check.</p>
<p>Go one step further by opening a good selection of wikileaks e-mails. Here, it is crucial to explain why those e-mails are legit: a combination of i) wikileaks historical credibility, ii) the absence of denial from Podesta, iii) the presence of digital signatures by Google confirming at least several of those e-mails.</p>
<p>Start showing the pizza/hotdog-related e-mails, in particular the one about ordering for 65000$ of pizza/hotdog. Get back to Alefantis\' pictures and show all instagram pictures mixing sex and pizza so that the association between the two words gets as strong as possible. Insist on how 65000$ of pizza ordered from another city makes no sense, and how the answer to this e-mail confirms they are not talking about pizza.</p>
<p>Start showing all other e-mails related to pizza codes and children. Here, you can also show the pedophile-logos of pizzerias to start pushing the child-abuser narrative. Insist at every stage on how &quot;one can never prove that this horrible scenario is true, but at best, there is some extremely deviant sex-related story here that media are completely avoiding&quot;.</p>
<p>Start with the Spirit cooking / satanism / cannibalism topic. Show all deviant art from the Podesta, the e-mails relating them to Abramovich, illustrate spirit cooking with a video of Abramovich and the simulation of cannibalism. Here again, express your feelings: you find it very hard to accept that such deviant people are the most influential people in Washington, and that Clinton/Obama are close to them. Add to this that it is very odd that a not-even-exceptional pizza chef (Alefantis) is so closely related to them, and so powerful in Washington.</p>
<p>Conclude by showing all convicted pedophiles around Podesta/Clinton. Bonus: show Bidden\'s &quot;creepy&quot; videos where he touches girls in a deviant way.</p>',
