<p>Relevance: Child pornography by a priest</p>
<p>VATICAN CITY –  A Vatican court has indicted on child pornography possession charges a diplomat recalled from Washington last year amid ongoing investigations in three jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Vatican said in a statement Saturday that Monsignor Carlo Capella, who was the No. 4 official in its Washington embassy, would face a trial starting June 22.</p>
<p>Capella, a high-ranking priest in the Vatican\'s diplomatic corps, was the subject of investigations by the Vatican and in the United States and Canada. He has been in Vatican custody since April.</p>
<p>The Vatican recalled him after the U.S. State Department notified it in August of a &quot;possible violation of laws relating to child pornography images&quot; by a diplomat in Washington.</p>
<p>Canadian police have said Capella allegedly uploaded child porn from a social networking site over the 2016 Christmas holiday.  [&lt;&lt;&lt; How very Christian of him]</p>',

            I think we already had several posts about this case, but unfortunately, I don't recall the details.

             I know it came up back when he was expelled.  This is new information - the indictment - I believe.
