            That's a great idea. Let's start to sticky submissions not because of their value, but because the boyz who posted them got feefees.

            They need false flags like this in order to repeat that Pizzagate is fake and Alefantis isn't a pedophile connected to powerful elites. Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis are indeed their soft spot.

            Very interesting that the first time he jumped the fence at the Washington Monument, was arrested, then released.
           </p>
           <p>
            He then goes back the next day to do it again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pretty obvious what's happening here IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whoever is handling him directed him to get arrested to he'd be caught for starting the fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the police didn't put 2 and 2 together the first time they arrested him, he just went and did it again.

            I can't remember which article I read it in but it was right after it happened. The article stated that according to an employee the man bought 3 beers on a credit card, left a nice tip and also left behind a diaper and a baby bottle in the booth. Anyone else see that one? Plus the way he looked straight up at the camera on the way out. It was like he wanted to get caught. And they only find him because he was trying to climb the fence at the Washington monument.

The credit card part stood out as they would obviously know who he was, and he himself would know that they would know who he was, by using one to pay for things before setting the curtains on fire. So yeah, I'd reiterate a comment I made yesterday about him being either a hire, mentally ill, or seeking some sort of fame - but probably a combination of the three and used to bring more attention back to this "fake news" story and the damage fake news does. Something like that.

              They have yet to prove to the public that there was an arsonist or a fire.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first video pic of the suspect was from the day of the Comet curtain "fire." It was not clear from the security video clip if the moving blob of light behind the jacketed suspect was actually an uncontrolled fire. It did not increase in size, nor was there visible smoke. The person in the video wasn't in a hurry to leave and stared straight into the security camera. No firemen witnessed the alleged fire. It was reportedly put out by CPP employee(s) before their arrival. The supposed burned curtain has not been shown to the public, nor has the security video of employees putting out the fire. Did the sprinkler system go off? Smoke detector? Was the curtain fire retardant? I don't recall seeing any CPP customer cell phone vids/pics of people evacuating. Even after a small fire, there is a strong smoke smell that lingers. They were reopened after a day or so. It would be interesting to see CPP's insurance claim for the alleged fire.

               Just looked at the video, looks like a fire to me, it changes shape and seems move like a fire, tongue of flames separate from the main source.   What point are you making?  it was a controlled fire?

               </p>
               <p>
                I’m gonna f#cking murder you, you stupid f#cking c#nt. I’m just letting you know, just to let you know that when it happens, you were f#cking warned bitch. You’re always puttin your location out there, so it’s real f#cking easy to get to you. I have a nice beautiful Desert Eagle that’s gonna be used on you. So keep thinkin all your health sh#t is gonna help you, cuz guess what, c#nt, it’s not gonna help you live another f#cking day.
I’m gonna step right out from the pedestrians on the street and blast you right in the f#cking chest. Not the head, cuz I want you to squeal, bitch. I’m gonna make you f#cking squeal and shake on the ground, flailing, bleeding out. I’m gonna kill as many of you f#cks as I can before I go down. You’re done bitch, do you understand me?
I’ve thought about how to do it for a while, and I have it pretty much down. I want to pull you off the road and torture you to death, but it’s just too f#cking hard to pull off. Another idea I had is when you’re doin one of your live things, I want to walk right to the door and shoot ya live on camera, so everyone sees you f#cking begging, c#nt, you’re gonna f#cking squeal so hard, cuz I’m gonna hit you in the chest, then the legs bitch, to make ya suffer before I finish you.
I want everyone to see how you go. I f#cking promise you I’m comin bitch. I just gotta decide how I wanna do it. Maybe when you’re giving one of your dumb ass talks, I’ll go sit in the audience towards the back and do it. But it’s not easy to kill all your dumb c#nt friends that way. No, it’s pretty obvious to me that I gotta come to your f#cking autism sh#t center and shoot you right through the f#cking door when you’re on camera. That’s how I’m gonna do it.
I’m gonna kill every single one of you f#ckers. Do you understand me? I’m f#cking comin for ya. So be ready for it. I don’t wanna see any shock on your f#cking face when I’m at the door bitch. I’m [gonna] f#cking shoot right through that door with a shotgun c#nt, I’ll kill every single person in that house and then I’m gonna torture you good bitch. I’m gonna make you bleed til there’s nothing left of you, then finish you.
I just need to get a few things in order before I do it, but I’ve been wanting for a long time, and I’ve finally decided I have to do it, no more f#cking around. I want to make you scream so bad, to taste your blood and watch you scream bitch. I’m gonna kill you and I want you to know that when it happens, you could have done something. And you didn’t. That’s gonna be the best part you see, because I’m tellin you plain and simple. I’m comin now. Let’s see if you’re prepared when I get there for ya, or whether you look like a total deer in the f#cking headlights when I blow your f#cking head off.
See you in hell. "

                Schiff falsely characterizes the recent Washington State measles outbreak as an "epidemic."
                <br/>
                According to "pennlive":
".....noting the current outbreak, which has sickened at least 56 people in Washington and Oregon, is more alarming than the state’s three previous ones."  NOTE The 56 total is for BOTH Washington and Oregon. 
CDC's "Morbidity and mortality weekly report, Vol. 16, no. 15 Week ending April 15, 1967"

                is the measles benchmark MOTHERLOAD. It was published during the FIRST 12 weeks of the BRAND NEW NATIONAL MEASLES VACCINE PROGRAM BEGUN IN 1967. The NCDC is still trying to convince the public to get on board with the program. THEY NEVER USE MEASLES FEAR PORN. Instead, they persuade by COST EFFECTIVENESS AND SAVINGS!
               </p>
               <p>
                Why? Because parents would LAUGH at them if they tried to pull a Rep. Schiff. They list the BENCHMARK MEASLES STATISTICS.....PRE-VACCINE:  Page 8

                NOTE: Only natural immunity is life-long and can be passed on to nursing infants. Before vaccines, BABIES AND THE ELDERLY WERE PROTECTED. After vaccines, susceptibles are recurring because the vaccine does not give life-long immunity; hence, need for ever increasing boosters. Waning vaccines and boosters MAKE MORE MONEY FOR PHARMA.

                Out of 20,000 cases, 19,800 were mild enough to be TREATED AT HOME.

                BASED ON THESE OFFICIAL CDC BENCHMARK MEASLES STATISTICS BEFORE MEASLES VACCINE we can conclude that one has MUCH GREATER RISK OF DYING in a CAR CRASH while driving to a DOCTOR'S OFFICE to get a measles vaccine, than DYING FROM MEASLES.

                In conclusion, 56 cases of measles is NOT an epidemic. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Statistically, NO DEATHS with that LOW number. Those 56 will now have LIFE-LONG immunity. No need for a measles vaccine. They can be around CANCER PATIENTS!

Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease – it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved.

                  "The following video is a portion of a Jan. 11, 2018, legal deposition of “acclaimed” vaccinologist Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who is widely considered a godfather of modern vaccine programs. In the video, we hear an astute attorney asking Plotkin revealing questions about vaccination research practices. Plotkin’s answers deliver a series of devastating truth bombs:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Q: Have you ever used orphans to study experimental vaccines?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A: Yes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Q. Have you ever used the mentally handicap to study experimental vaccines?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A: (Hesitant until he was cited from his own writings, whereby he confirmed.) Yes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Q: Have you experimented on the children of mothers in prison or jail?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A: Yes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then comes the doozy at minute 00:01:20 in which Dr. Plotkin acknowledges that he expressed a preference for experimenting “on children and adults who are human in form but not in social potential.”"

                  2/million is the TOTAL national measles' death rate for 1 year.  123/million was the TOTAL car crash deaths per year (2017).
1 individual's risk of getting measles compared to 1 individual's car trip to the doctor's office.  THE COMPARISON IS CORRECT.  With that great of a risk spread, death by car crash will always be the greater risk.

Thanks AWS for showing genuine concern for vaccine safety advocate Dr. Suzanne Humphries, MD. Her book, DISSOLVING ILLUSIONS: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History, has influenced many regarding the ongoing vaccine safety debate.  IS THIS WHY SHE WAS THREATENED?

                 <p>
                  Your add ins are not part of the official definition of a made-up word (propaganda). It does not qualify how safe or effective the vaccines are. If you believe they are 100% safe and 100% effective, then you have chosen to believe a proven lie.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  All in all, Rep. Schiff is desperately concerned about citizens who are discussing a vaccine for a disease that has only a 2/ MILLION death rate and which he claims was "effectively eliminated from the United States decades ago" (huh?) and WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO DO SO; YET, he has no interest for doing the same for Face Book groups discussing the high car crash death statics (123/ MILLIONS.)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  All I can say is, does Dr. Plotkin know that Rep. Schiff perfectly fits his stiff requirements for vaccine safety trial studies volunteers?

                    You didn't ask who Dr. Orenstein is?  How interesting. Most computer geeks living in New York wouldn't know about him.....unless you live in Brooklyn. Hmmmm.

                    In fact, why are we only hearing about Washington and Oregon AND NOT NEW YORK?
Why does Israel have 2000 cases of MEASLES?  Adam Schiff is Jewish. Why isn't he calling for A BAN ON ISRAELI IMMIGRANTS? This sect DELIBERATELY DOES NOT VACCINATE.
Such logical questions.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I never could figure out why Dr. Orenstein would call an emergency meeting at a METHODIST RETREAT CENTER IN GWINNETT COUNTY (Simpsonwood) after reviewing a 1999 vaccine safety study showing a 7.6 RR for AUTISM when comparing two groups with matching vaccine schedules except for one group receiving the hep B shot at birth (25 micrograms of thimerosal difference). Of course, the transcript of the meeting was read into the Congressional Record. Lucky for us)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So far you made no comment on Plotkin's admission to experimental testing of vaccines on orphans, mentally handicapped, children of mothers in prison or jail, and "children and adults who are human in form but not in social potential".  DO YOU APPROVE?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Interestingly, Dr. Stanley Plotkin is the son of Israeli immigrants.  WHO KNEW?

                      OBVIOUSLY YOU APPROVE OF USING UNLICENSED EXPERIMENTAL VACCINES ON ORPHANS, MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, CHILDREN OF MOTHERS IN PRISON, AND "CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO ARE HUMAN IN FORM BUT NOT IN SOCIAL POTENTIAL." 
Does the Talmud approve of such things....if they are "goy"?
