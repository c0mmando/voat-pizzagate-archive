Shouldn\'t we try again to spread the word and let the people know that we are the ones being good and seeking for justice?
To me it feels like it\'s slipping out of our hands, even though we\'re making huge progress in investigating all of this, but the MSM has more power in convincing the masses. 
I don\'t like the idea of raiding sites and commentsections either, but I can\'t think of any other option right know, before the MSM takes away all of our credibility. 
PLUS I\'m not sure how spread the topic is beyond American borders. I\'m german, and there hasn\'t been a single word about #Pizzagate on MSM-platforms, TV nor Online. But there has already been a shoutout from politicans against FakeNews. 
I\'m with you guys since #Pizzagate got big on reddit but I\'m not good in investigating or hiding my ass behind proxys and shit, but I just can\'t watch, wait and hope for justice to come. 
But I can spread the word, whereever I go. I just don\'t see many other people doing this. </p>
<p>So my question again, is, shouldn\'t we have some sort of planned and thought-through &quot;campaigns&quot; (if that\'s the right word for it..) focusing on making a huge amount of people aware? Reddit had 24k subscribers to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, voat only has 7k and it slows down. 
Or atleast make some sort of sticky with instructions for people that aren\'t good in investigating but want to help in any way possible?</p>
<p>English ain\'t my mother tongue, sorry for some sort of confusing sentences. </p>
<p>I love each and every single one of you motherfuckers, putting your heart in this. Fighting for justice, fighting for a better world.</p>
