            Victory of the Light said that Swordfish was Tom DeLonge (others thought is was Justin Bieber).
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless one or both of them had a sudden change of heart and found out about the "Root" in Racine, Wisconsin, neither of them are going to Save anyone. Bieber is part of a cult church involved in ritual abuse, and DeLonge is linked with Scientology, LDS (Mormons), OTO and Kabbalah. DeLonge was also closely tied to Podesta through Chester Bennington.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since you brought up Nazca mummies, does anyone know about Man Mound in Wisconsin? 
"One answer is that the image is of a Native American shaman wearing a headdress such as buffalo horns or a bear’s head. Another somewhat more involved possibility is that it is an image of the White Water Spirit which, according to Ho-Chunk creation beliefs, was a powerful spirit from the watery underworld who “alighted upon the land and took the form of a human walking, with horns.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Tom DeLonge is also linked to a cover up organization in Racine called The FIght to End Exploitation which is also connected to the Clintons, McCain, Ashton (Chris) Kutcher, Kristin Bauer van Straten, Caron Butler, the Johnsons, and many others involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Swordfish wants to do something really important, they should shine the light on Tom DeLonge, Ashton Kutcher, Caron Butler and others linked to the "Root" of the real agenda and the real Truth in Racine and Wisconsin.

             Caron Butler the basketball player?  I was always a fan of his all the way back to his UConn days...I'm surprised by any involvement he would have.
            </p>
            <p>
             DeLonge is an interesting case...Scientology and Mormons?  It doesn't seem obvious...I don't follow him that closely but he isn't blatant about those ties...his Podesta connections seemed fairly empty.  He had the email, yes, but it seemed like TDL was more reaching out to anyone who would listen.
            </p>
            <p>
             What cult church is Bieber involved with?  I know he has been shown going to bible study in the news recently.  Hopefully he is just a kid with too much money with a good heart who will find the error of his ways and turn it around for something positive...you never know though.  I didn't know the church he was connected to was specifically bad, unless you think all churches are.

              Yes Caron Butler the basketball player is a freemason who was "reformed" (see MK Ultra) in detention centers, and sold his soul to the elite in Racine to help push Community Policing, prison-labor reform, Cradle to Grave educational reform, and other programs that lead to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast. Look at who else was on the Young &amp; the Guest list in DC with him including James Alefantis, Huma Abedin, Eric Braverman, Mae Podesta and others.
             </p>
             <p>
              Scientology, Mormons, OTO and Kabbalah are related in more ways than you may think. Look at Poway, California where Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker are from. There is a large LDS movement in the West linked that become involved in Freemasonry, Scientology, OTO and Kabbalah.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many former Mormons familiar with Scientology, refer to Mormonism as 'Scientology Lite.' Some say that Mormonism in Utah, when it was under the strict control of Brigham Young, was in several ways even more similar to Scientology today. According to one viewer, "The difference between Mormonism and Scientology is one of degree only."
             </p>
             <p>
              Bieber is involved with a church called Hillsong. There are many questions about this church which many refer to as a cult, and how the business model shares similarities with Scientology. Many celebrities are used to draw people in with music as a central theme. "At any given service, the evangelical, praise music- and worship-based church welcomes a slew of celebrity congregants. Everyone from Bono to Vanessa Hudgens to Nick Jonas has attended services."
             </p>
             <p>
              Look into what Fiona Barnett has alleged about Hillsong. Among many more disturbing allegations, she wrote that "Hillsong founding pastor Frank Houston was a convicted pedophile who sought and trafficked children to the Sydney VIP pedophile ring based in Kings Cross boy brothels. Houston was named multiple times to the Wood Royal Commission. These children were sought by Hillsong from low socioeconomic families with single mothers, parents in trouble with the law, and who had been brought to the attention of the Department of Children’s Services."
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a coalition of many groups that are all moving toward ONE WORLD RELIGION, ONE WORLD CURRENCY, and ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT with a real agenda of Global Enslavement built through the lie of Sustainability with the Mark of the Beast enforced through AI and Community Policing.
             </p>
             <p>
              The "Root" of the global coalition is in Racine, Wisconsin, whether or not Tom DeLonge or Justin Bieber ever figure that out, and even if they do, they are not here to Save anyone. If you want the real Truth, it is in Racine and Wisconsin.

The Community Church of Poway, the town's first church,  making it the house
 of worship with the longest continual operation in San Diego County.[17] It is now affiliated with the 
United Church of Christ. [18] Today, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Mormons 
constitute the majority of Poway's religious demographic.[citation needed] Living Way Church, a 
non-denominational Protestant church, through Berean Bible College, is the only church currently in 
Poway that offers bible college classes.

                Victory of the Light knows about the Root of the Truth in Racine, Wisconsin, and they are right about a lot of things including this.

               <p>
                This ties directly to what we know about so many involved - Blink 182's Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker, Evan McMullin, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Timothy Dolan, Warren Jeffs, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, Podestas, Clintons, McCain, Peter Lavenda, L Ron Hubbard, David Miscavige, Jack Parsons, Aleister Crowley, and many more.

                It is part of the bigger network that all connects back to Racine, Wisconsin.

               whatever happened here.....justin bieber is a member of Hillsong Church,a Pentecostal megachurch, New
South Wales. Founded in 1983, by Frank Houston, When it was started, a youth group was established.....
              </p>
              <p>
               Houston sexually abused a seven-year-old boy, The victim told the Royal Commission into the 
Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that Houston offered him 10k as compensation.  Houston
eventually confessed. The commission also heard that he was involved in the sexual abuse of other 
children in New Zealand.  Houston resigned from Hillsong Church.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Hillsong child sex trafficking network included government social workers, Aunties and Uncles
 program staff, Hillsong architect Ian Longstaff, collected kids for church youth club, and 
convicted pedophile and Hillsong staff John Baxter.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hillsong founding pastor Frank Houston was a convicted pedophile who sought and trafficked 
children to the Sydney VIP pedophile ring boy brothels based in Kings Cross
              </p>
              <p>
               Houston was named multiple times to the Wood Royal Commission. by Jewish members of the Wood Royal
 Commission pedophile network.
              </p>
              <p>
               These children were sought by 
Hillsong from low socioeconomic 
families with single mothers, parents in trouble with the law, and who had been brought to the attention 
of the Dept. of Children’s Services.

                This is part of a much bigger strategy to corrupt all churches in order to form a one world religion coalition that becomes anti religion in effect through fake science, artificial intelligence, and project bluebeam.

               <p>
                The model and root of this agenda and coalition is in Racine, Wisconsin.

              Anyways, the swordfish thing went quiet after that end of july thing, has he been around?  I would think if it were Bieber, he would have something more substantial considering he is on top of the music industry...
             </p>
             <p>
              TDL, I would think, would have more as well...
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately, Swordfish was less than what I hoped for.  High five for the effort though...
             </p>
             <p>
              What a roller coaster this whole thing is...

            I saw some of them and 4 chan had a thread. However, they was very hard to read and redacted.
Had stuff about 9/11 being a hoax, but I never saw any pizzagate things? then again I could hardly make out any of the screenshots! Then they deleted the posts b4 I could get through half of them.

            But yes I'll say it again VOTL implied Tom DeLonge is swordfish.... They seemed to say he outed himself somehow through twitter...anyways that was posted on a number of other sites and to be honest I still don't believe it but was wondering what the experts of Voat thought?

             If it is Tom DeLonge, it was a poorly devised plan to further discredit investigators, and we know Tom DeLonge is deeply involved so unless his programming suddenly broke, we know for certain that he is not here to Save anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Swordfish really wanted to help Save the world, he wouldn't be posting about Phil Collins and Lady Gaga. He would be exposing the real agenda, the real Truth and the real "Root" of the entire system which is in Racine, Wisconsin. Same goes for Victory of the Light and all of the others who are claiming to "expose the system of Global Trafficking and Corruption".
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is the only thing that is not part of the controlled narrative, and the weak link to the entire network. This is the only thing they are really afraid of being exposed.

             Don't be sorry...I was just surprised to see no mention of it.  I'm not sure what happened to the whole swordfish fiasco but this seems to tie in to that...is that generally considered larp too?  He seemed to have some good posts before that big promised expose.

             I may have missed something but VOTL basically stated that Tom DeLonge was swordsfish...I saw that on other websites and was surprised that it was not considered here...Unless I missed that too?

            I'll just mention that there were at least 30 emails released in image format.  Supposedly there were more but they said only protonmail users could have them?
