<p>Well, it\'s happened! James Woods\' tweet about the film CALL ME BY YOUR NAME that attempts to normalize pedophilia went viral. Here\'s the exchange with Armie Hammer. Just when you thought it was over, MSN does a feature on PedoWood whore Amber Tamblyn who was called in to recite a false narrative of how Woods hit on her when she was sixteen. </p>

<p>I\'m usually not quite this hard on women, but it doesn\'t take a brain surgeon to figure out the bitch is lying. Why? Well, think about it. What are the chances that the same unattractive lump of shit that points an accusing finger at Woods is the self-same idiot that tried to tie in yet another sexual assault with words Donald Trump spoke? </p>

<p>That part of my body, which the current Presidential Nominee of the United States Donald Trump recently described as something he’d like to grab a woman by, was bruised from my ex-boyfriend\'s violence for at least the next week. I had a hard time wearing jeans. I couldn’t sleep without a pillow between my legs to create space. </p>
<p>It\'s funny, but I never knew that words someone said could physically assault someone. Must be like the snowflake fascists fantasizing that statues are going to attack them. Those statues need to be defaced and covered with sheets!  Maybe they\'re confusing normal statues with the statue of Baphomet they worship in their sexual ceremonies/blood rituals? </p>

<p>Yup, so Amber Tamblyn is hit on by Woods; has just written another stalking story about a crew member that was interested in her after she flirted with him on set; and on top of that feels violated because Trump\'s rights are abridged by someone taping a private conversation and leaking it to the press?!!!! And she\'s complaining about not being believed? </p>
<p>MSN has the comments disabled, but you can always tweet her a loving message about how it might be better for her to just stay home and lock herself in a closet if she attracts all this violence in her life. Or at least find out if she still sleeps with that pillow between her legs ...</p>',

            Quite honestly, I always try to see both sides when this happens, but James Woods is an articulate man who has a great Twitter following.  I am sure he is considered a threat that needs to be silenced.

             This. Although this is pertinent now, think about it. It's what's upcoming that he needs to be silenced about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now, if he tweeted what he knew, he'd be sued and all that money he's rightfully earned through his career and investments would be taken away. But when revelations come out, the ones hidden and that will come out as soon goddamn Assange releases those files, he'll be able to speak about them and back the "facts" of what is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Until then, he says what he can.

            This is amazing.  She's lying?We know that James Woods hits on young women.   How do we know?  Here's a picture of his gf who's 46 years younger than him.

            They started dating at 19.  Just like his previous gf.  They also started dating when she was 19.  He was only 41 years older than her.

            Well, even though James Wood's has been speaking out some it must be more out of drug brain damage than altruism because I'm sure he knows and has done a whole helluva lot more than what he's actually saying.

             That's the problem with us mortals. Most of us have warts.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're not perfect, and there's plenty to pick at, but it's a whole lot different to make mistakes than to be wholeheartedly indulging in an agenda that includes not only child molestation and sacrifice, but to destroying America and normalizing these sick criminal acts.
            </p>
            <p>
             THAT'S the litmus test. Is an individual involved in The Cannibal Elite or are they supporting it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Let human foibles fall by the wayside. I don't want to know if James Woods dates nineteen-year-olds. I don't. Again, his career was ruined by admitting to being a Republican. One of the best actors around reduced to being on the Z-list of don't ever call for a part. If a guy like that wants to speak out, let him. He is not the enemy. The group Tamblyn is fronting for is. And she has been rewarded for the treachery. I am making like the humble gopher and digging, digging, digging.

               Well, luckily he hasn't contracted the many disabling diseases the PedoWood skanks have so he can still think clearly. That's why he invested wisely. As he freely admits, he can live the way he wants because of buying Apple shares. #pizzagaterssmart #pedowoodersdumb

            Trust no actors. It's their job to lie. Woods knows all the players in Hollywood on a first name basis. I think it is nothing more a scene/script/plsy they are more then likely being paid to act out. Trust no one especially a fucking Hollywood actor. Question evrrything.

            Okay, let's just say that women can be revictimised, and time and time again.  It's a thing.  Especially if you're an existing sexual assault survivor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Source:  Me.  I was raped as a child, and I've encountered so many Dude Bros who think talking about what they'll force you to do against your consent is "totally flirting".  (that's not flirting, it's sexual harassment)  And you know, a woman can flirt with a guy.... and then he will turn around and be a pervert and we can say no.  That's a thing that's allowed to happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            But yeah.... as per Woods, I definitely think he's like Trump: he's being framed by all these nutcases for things he either hasn't done, or things he's done in the past but which he's turned away from (because you know you can have been part of a fucked up circle of friends.... then leave that circle of friends and create a new life for yourself where you call out the bad shit!).
           </p>
           <p>
            Just some thoughts anyway.

             It's not that women can't be revictimized, it's that Trump didn't even touch her and she chimed in! So she shows a hatred for Trump by getting in on that feeding frenzy and now, guess what? She was also propositioned in Las Vegas by James Wood, a staunch defender of Trump!
            </p>
            <p>
             No, I don't think so.  And in her "fairy tale narrative" she wrote for MSN, she wasn't assaulted or touched either! She openly admits to flirting with some crew member, but objects when he stares at her because he's probably interested. She flirted because he was cute even though she had a boyfriend. So why not go up to the staring crew member and say, "Look, I'm sorry, but I think you got the wrong impression. I do think you're cute, but I'm seeing someone." If he continues after that point, THEN talk to someone about it!
            </p>
            <p>
             So, no, she was revictimized. Sorry about what happened to you, but this is not the same situation at all.

            I think that Woods is doing a great job for pizzagate.  However, he does like his women really, really young---too young for an old dude like him.

              Exactly. Shit....Hollyweird is FILLED with old, wrinkled men with young women. Woody Allen comes to mind and it's his own adopted daughter.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, movies do this as well, old men actors with young women. Common theme, common push to the masses. Interview with a vampire with Kirsten and Brad stuck out like a sore thumb to me.

               Not only Hollywood. It's common enough for successful men to have trophy wives, and the women that want to involve themselves in that sort of lifestyle, line up to be selected. It's why musicians, baseball players, doctors, etc. have no shortage of applicants for the positions.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing is: that is not my war! If an nineteen-year-old woman is spectacular looking and decides she wants to marry a millionaire and dates and marries one, I don't freakin' care! They're both getting what they want out of the arrangement. But if a twelve-year-old child wants to be an actor and is latched onto and groomed by a lecherous, fucking old man director, that is my business! It's our collective business!
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact that a decent movie hasn't come out of Hollywood in at least a decade bespeaks of the inbreeding and decadency going on. They're so busy with their mindless pursuits and keeping a cultlike lid on their cabal, that no new creative types with actual talent are even allowed in the New Sodom and Gomorrah! Now they're cannibalizing producer's offspring and old star's kids that know the ropes and are acquainted with the rituals. Problem is most of these kids are lame, lackluster, abused remnants of a childhood gone oh, so wrong.

                As usual, well said!! I agree, a consenting dumb bimbo can do as they please. The grooming of this from Hollyweird is just what it is. But as we all agree, young kids, under the age of consent is NOT going to be tolerated.

            Obviously you have never been abused like that. You know, many women can be and frequently are harassed or worse more than once in their lives. She works in a field where abuse is rampant, and where grown pervs hit on teenage girls all the time.  You appear to only believe women whose politics agree with yours. Think about it.

             Ya, take Caroline Heldman for example. She was harassed by many top men at Fox. SMDH. Many women can be harassed multiple times, but many women falsely accuse as well. A fine line between fact and fiction and these incidents reek of fiction.

             I suppose Amber marrying a man twice her age was a result of her abuse from Woods.

            I take  issue  with  your thesis-Woods is a  Hollyweird  icon  who makes  his  bread  and  butter by this satanic group, it  does appear that woods  has tasted a  lot  of  young  female  flesh,  which  makes  him untrustworthy and creepy, she  may  be a  bitch  but the  evidence  supports  the  fact  that  Woods is at  best a  hypocrite

            Smh .. it's so fishy ! Her piece came days after the actress claimed that James Woods tried to pick her up when she was just 16, allegedly inviting her to Vegas and saying “even better” when she told him she was underage..... Who even says " oh , but I'm underage? "
Wouldn't you say wth are you talking about perv  !? I'm only 16!! ?
