            This is a big reason why Hollywood is afraid of opening the panopticon of child sexual abuse, particularly MALE child sexual abuse, and it's connection to promiscuity, pedophilia and drug use among the homosexual community. If you watch closely at how Hollywood has attempted to SLIDE THE OVERTON WINDOW OF YOUR MORALITY slightly SOUTH in order to MATCH the ideals of PIE(Pedophile Information Exchange) of LOWERING THE AGE OF CONSENT.
           </p>
           <p>
            The WIZARDS and SORCERERS of HOLLYWOOD (Remember: the wand of Harry Potter's witches is holly wood) decided that if you will not let them have sex with your children on the down low they are going to turn your children gay at a very young age through cartoons and young age programming, so that eventually, those brainwashed children and their multigenerationally brainwashed parents will start calling for sexual rights. It's already here and happening.

             bs. i hang out with ACTUAL GAY PEOPLE. none of them are promiscuous. none of them are pedophiles. NONE of them use drugs. period! and none of their friends do either. and none of the people that i meet through them are like that either, you piece of shit. they are business owners, charity workers, sweet, gentle people. and some of them are fantastic parents whose almost grown children absolutely LOVE them and are totally healthy.
            </p>
            <p>
             so i don't know who the fuck you're talking about, and apparently, NEITHER DO YOU.

              How very reactionary.  Typical in today's very volatile liberal environment.  Listen,  I didn't mean to offend anyone.  But,  I see that some people can't entertain multiple dynamics to one scenario.  Please believe me that I am not bigoted,  however,  the issue of homosexuality is very complex,  which I'm sure you understand but will not acknowledge. Another very typical problem among the homosexual community. Along every social dynamic there are many different strata. Just because homosexuals have held parades for 'their rights' and 'struggled' doesn't mean you get to lose foresight of every aspect of your 'culture'.  I am not against homosexuality I just do not believe that homosexual couples can FULLY live up to what they imagine IN AN UNHEALTHY SOCIETY.  I DO believe healthy homosexual couples ARE LIVING HEALTHY 'NORMAL'  LIVES,  but really,  what constitutes healthy?  Raising a child in a Kardashian world with Disney backpacks and kelp sandwiches while the hubby goes off and does tennis?  Sit around and talk about false idols in fashion,  TV,  music?  What I see is two of the same sex trying to live up to the ideals of the fading nuclear family,  if they're not what are they moulding the family unit into.  If you were homosexual would you REALLY want your child to grow up all icky hetero?
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe that there are homosexuals that try to live a 'sane and sanitary'  lifestyle,  but there are also many other types of homosexuals as well,  a very diverse crowd. If you read Scott livelys Pink Swastika you will understand that there are groups of gays that HATE EFFEMINATE HOMOSEXUALS.  If you notice those that try to live a peaceful and understanding and empathetic lifestyle,  those that DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW BIG THE CONSPIRACY IS and would want children to raise 'normally'  WERE THE ONES HUNTED DOWN BY HITLERS MACHO HOMOSEXUAL SQUADS.
             </p>
             <p>
              I say this as a warning.  History has shown that the Hitler regime set out to brainwash the populace and turn them into every kind of despot by providing them everything they wanted to defile themselves,  drugs,  sex and eventually violence and every type of perversion was rampant and soon children got thrown in the mix.  Idk.  I'm rambling,  it's an unbelievably complex subject and one so deep it's easy to get lost.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm saying is that the same snafu that hemmed up homosexuals in WWII is happening again here in America.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's so much wrong with the modern American homosexuals conceptualization of the world its ridiculous. In the first place who has to ask the government for any rights at all,  especially to marry...  There's only three things in that arrangement,  you,  your partner and God. Asking a 'license'  from a corporate entity means your asking for permission to do something otherwise banned.  Who the hell bans love?  Lucifer.

             Right on every point.  There is nothing that you have said that I would not agree with.  It is beyond disturbing.  Some think as well that Hollywood is a Cesspool, but it goes way deeper than that.  You have nailed it.  They have a deeper reason, it is not just a few bad boys and girls running amok.  It is about the brainwashing that has been going on for decades and their purpose is Deeply Evil.
