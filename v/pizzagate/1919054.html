All sexual preferences are normal, healthy and even heroic. While most would agree that gay or straight does not matter, society does not condone adults preying on children for sexual gratification. Society does not accept that children can consent to such behavior with adults, and because of this, the adult is being abusive by taking advantage of their uneven stations. But the elite have conspired to use celbrities to push their agendas, one of which, is to open the door for their fabricated pedosexual gender.</p>
<p>I gave the example of George Clooney on anotherr thread. He is married to Amal Clooney, who I suspect is a man. Even the name Amal, seems to be a word play on the phrase &quot;A male&quot;.  The entire corporate media has sold us that she was pregnant, had a baby bump, and now had twins. I would think this is impossible. Here are some telling Amal Clooney pictures. </p>

<p>In itself, marrying a ladyboy is no big deal, buy Lying, and saying she is a biological woman, and is giving birth to twins, is obnoxious and deceitful. Since the press is involved in the lie, it is clearly an agenda.  Matt Damon has even commented that he was almost in tears when he heard the news about her pregnancy. He is a well known friend of the Clooney\'s of course  <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matt-damon-thrilled-over-george-amal-clooneys-pregnancy-w466182">http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matt-damon-thrilled-over-george-amal-clooneys-pregnancy-w466182</a></p>

<p>It seems, that in exchange for fame and fortune, Hollywood stars and other elites have to push the agenda of the Cult they are intitiaited into. Some of the suspected agendas are transgenderism, global warming, global digital currency, Nasa fraud, one world government and population reduction. We also suspect the DC elite and Hollywood elite work in tandem with the CIA to traffic children to the elite, and harvest their organs for financial gain. </p>
<p>Not only does George Clooney seem to be pushing the cabal\'s gender agenda, he also has a foundation that deals with children and refugees, something the suspect Clinton Foundation is also known to be involved with . <a href="https://cfj.org/about/">https://cfj.org/about/</a></p>

<p>George Clooney also is pushing the Global warming scam, and has resorted to ridicule to make his argument.

<p>It seems obvious that the reasons celbrities are used to push the elites agendas, is because the little people worship the big people. The want to know who they are going out with, what their houses look like, who they support, what they think about issues, and want to see what awards they win.  They trust these people and think it is absurd that they would lie to them about everything, and their real job was to form peoples perception of reality, through lies, manipulation, and subliminal content.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, that the best simple step we can take to begin fighting these evil sellouts to humanity, it to defund the Beast System
1) Withdraw all your money from the banking system. The bankes are owned by the elite families who control western society, are at the top of the secret societies, own virtually all of the worlds central banks who the CIA and Mossad work for, and are behind virtually all of the worlds suffeing.</p>
<p>2) Cancel your cable. Don\'t give monthly payments to the corporate media. They are all owned by the elite families. They are the propaganda and social engineering arm of the cabal. Do not fund them. Ever.</p>
<p>3) Stop buying movie tickets. Watch movies for free online of it means so much to you. Do not fund their propaganda. Do not support financialy  the arogant unethical celebrities they use to manipulate you and your sense of reality, right and wrong.</p>
<p>This is a very genral thread, just to remind each other of what our role is as aware citizens. We have no ethical right to fund the very people who are part of the matrix of lies and crime. It\'s time to look down on the celbrites for the week and needy narcisisist hat they are. PizzaGate happens because we do nothing but type. Not ready to revolt phyisically? How about denying them your money and doing so religiously?</p>',

1) Withdraw all your money from the banking system. The bankes are owned by the elite families who control western society, are at the top of the secret societies, own virtually all of the worlds central banks who the CIA and Mossad work for, and are behind virtually all of the worlds suffeing.
          </p>
          <p>
           2) Cancel your cable. Don't give monthly payments to the corporate media. They are all owned by the elite families. They are the propaganda and social engineering arm of the cabal. Do not fund them. Ever.
          </p>
          <p>
           3) Stop buying movie tickets. Watch movies for free online of it means so much to you. Do not fund their propaganda. Do not support financialy  the arogant unethical celebrities they use to manipulate you and your sense of reality, right and wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a very genral thread, just to remind each other of what our role is as aware citizens. We have no ethical right to fund the very people who are part of the matrix of lies and crime. It's time to look down on the celbrites for the week and needy narcisisist hat they are. PizzaGate happens because we do nothing but type. Not ready to revolt phyisically? How about denying them your money and doing so religiously?

            Nobody but you needs "proof" of who is and isn't male or female. We look at them, and we know. Hence the pictures. With you on the other hand, it is a complicated procedure to figure out who is male and female in this world. You are gender challenged. The rest of us are not challenged in identifying gender. Put a man in a dress and you are in confusion.

            The fact that you need documents to discern who is male and who is female, is telling of your life experience. Sorry, no paper work available to help you identify the official gender of origin. I will keep making obvious observations about peoples gender while you continue to be on the fence on who is and is not male or female. You should stay out of bars, unless you are a switch hitter and it doesn't matter.

            Holy shit!!!! Amazing post. Wow. I never read nor care much about celebrities anymore so I never knew much about Amal but I believe u are correct. She is a male and so is her sister!!!!! Wow. I googled for pregnancy pics and full term pregnancy pics there is barely any that she couldn't fake. The gala white dress pregnancy pic is obviously staged for pics. I'm stunned. So George Cloony is gay, no wonder he always made those comments about never settling down or getting married. Why fucking lie about it though. The chin has definitely been shaved down and obviously Adam's apple removed or whatever they do. Maybe they even had the twins via test tube in a lab for 9 months as they can do that now, no woman even needed they can do it all in a lab. Mind blowing.

            Hollywood is definitely a big problem and is definitely trying to program everyone and destroy the general populace through degradation.   Most of the actors/actresses are mere dupes for the evil at the top (though Clooney is probably a bit beyond that) though they become part of it once they know what's going on and play along imo.

             Matt Damon and Clooney seem to be directly involved, and are not being encouraged. They seem like CIA Hollywood OPS. Go to the CIA's website(Yes they have one), they have a liason to Hollywood and offer scripts and "assistance" to movie makers. Notice how so many movies have CIA or FBI/NSA spook storylines? Notice how they used to be hidden and now spooks are openly in the news everyday? They have full control now and aren't so invisible anymore. They put themselves openly in storylines. Hollywood seems mostly beholden to them in exchange for the careers they are allowed to have, but some seem to be directly involved, I also think Sean Penn was doing a rediculous psyop with El Chapo.

              the deep state gets involved in many movies and works closely with studio heads.  i could be wrong but i doubt damon and clooney have too much direct involvement in more of the nefarious works that are done by the cia or other agencies, and are more of the willing dupes like many low level cia/fbi agents.

               Matt Damon pushes every Psyop and Globalist agenda. He made the movie about mars, and Elon Musk is pushing the fantasy of colonizing Mars within 20 years. Damon Pushes seizing guns, and told a european crowd that their government did it right when they just took them away. He also did a lot of middle east propaganda work, transgender psyop with the Clooney's and stared in the spook series of Jason Bourne. The guy is a real piece of shit.

                idk. he could be just ignorant (re: seizing guns), covering for a friend (not outing clooney if amal is indeed a tranny), and being a part hungry actor (doing the Bourne and mars movies).  don't know what you mean by middle east propagana work (if it's pro israel, yeah that's another problem).  he could well be a pretty bad guy, i just don't see him as that significant in the big scheme of the crap we're concerned with.  whatever his significance his, in a few years when his parts dry up as they normally do at his age, he'll be cast aside by the real power brokers

                 Came out of nowhere with Good Will Hunting which was a pretty shitty movie BTW.  How many people with real talent and better scripts never get a movie made?  Oh and it just so happened to star his best friend too who can't act for shit.  Yeah sure.  Wake up, you don't get anywhere in hollyjew unless you are connected to the bloodlines.

                  nah GWH was good (at the time) IMO.  agreed bout the fake Js runnin Hwood (and partially everything else).  I'm not scouring local playhouses and art schools for "really" talented actors and screen writers that can do better than GWH, though i'm sure they could exist  (i've also seen a bunch of obviously independent stuff by ppl who think they're super creative and talented that ain't great).  the powers that be especially through the abc intelligence orgs apparently meddle with most films these days, and i wouldn't doubt that damon or any other major actor is in some way implicated/involved  (possibly as simply as knowing there's a huge psyop component to most films)  whether he or affleck was groomed since a very young age (damon was getting bit parts as early as 18 if not earlier) i don't know.  please feel free to enlighten with some corroborating info....

                    that hwood prefers attractive similarly symmetric faced leading men isn't all that surprising.  the bloodlines info is interesting, like to see the citations, and don't know how much apparent rampant nepotism tells us that damon is definitely a "cia asset"  idk...maybe

                     They go in to the golden ration and how it was considered before this analysis took place.  The probability of all of the facial alignments is pretty slim for a small population of actors.  I think they're on to something.

            No, picutres of men pretending to be women is pretty strong evidence to normal people. If you are struggling to figure out if they are men or women, you should just go through life again starting from the begining. Hang in there cupcake.

               Cryptos are making people wealthy. Most will dissapear and wipe out peoples money, but the few that remain will make their investors a lot of money. The Banks can't manipulate them, so it is the only free market in the world that the banks can't rig.

            Nah, I don't think sexual preference between adults is perversion of complicated. I think however, when you lie to society, and collude with the press to represent your spouse as a biological female, and she is having twins, now we have a huge proble, A conspiracy to deceive the public for an undisclosed end. It is not for me to condone if somebody takes hormones, has sex with adults of their choice of either sex. It is no bridge at all to adults taking advantage of children. I reject your attitude towards this. But I think those pulling these psyops want people to think this way.

            George is an Illuminati slave. Amal is his handler. Amal looks like she has anorexia which can mess with estrogen as well as degrade the female form, not to mention lower the chances of conceiving and carrying children to almost nil. She could be a man, but if by chance she is a woman, this could explain her appearance.

            If you can't be asked to read the whole thing, just scroll down to the images of pages from the Jewish Talmud and read what has been underlined.  The Talmud is a cornerstone of Jewish life and ideology.

             Thanks for posting the links...normalizing pedofreaks is not some 'down the road' event..it's been happening for years and more recently is getting more attention due to Pedogate Pizzagate.  Remember when Nambla was all over the news?  When was the MSM silenced from anti-pedo reporting?  After Oblowhole got elected?

            It's my understanding that male middle fingers are by and large longer than the ring finger... while female fingers the ring fingers are usually longer than the middle finger. So Amal seems to have feminine looking hands, which would be hard to fake with hormones etc. Is there any proof or anything with this rumor?

             Im going with the part where she looks like an obvious ladyboy?   Besides that, in the very first picture, the middle finger looks longer. The hands are dude hands all the way. And the ape long arms. And the neck. And the cleft chin. And the lack of hips etc etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then there is her "sister. Does this llady hand lookin pretty to you?

              Like I said, it's the length of the fingers, which don't show in this pic at all. Overall she has angular features and is somewhat flat. I just want to see more than a rumor based on someones being physically unattractive before jumping to accusing them of pedophilia.

               You apparently can't folow this thead. I did not accuse Amal Clooney of being a pedophile. I accuse her of posing as a biological female that is capable of having children. I accuse her sister of the same. I never called either ugly. So, what do you think of the "sister"? Unsure male or female? Advice, Don't go to a dark bar and get drunk. Unless you are looking to make this "mistake". Wink wink.

            Bang on. Hollywood and celebrities is a big key to this. And still somehow only one branch of a network of deceit.

            I work in the beauty industry and me and a friend have long said it feels like they are normalising paedophilia .. cue Pizzagate. Blonde hair, blue eyes, button nose, no hair anywhere, bleached bumholes (I kid you not), labia removal through cosmetic surgery .. then constantly bombard it our faces that this is what sex is through the porn industry, celebrities and adverts. We have white woman paying to be dark with fake tan and dark women paying to be white through skin bleaching .. again to achieve the beauty perceived to us through celebs and media. The worlds fucking bonkers.

            "It seems obvious that the reasons celbrities are used to push the elites agendas, is because the little people worship the big people. The want to know who they are going out with, what their houses look like, who they support, what they think about issues, and want to see what awards they win. They trust these people and think it is absurd that they would lie to them about everything, and their real job was to form peoples perception of reality, through lies, manipulation, and subliminal content."
