&quot;The violent themes in Serbian artist Biljana Djurdjevic works reflect her development as an artist during the horror-stricken 1990s – when violence in her country peaked following the collapse of the communist regime in Eastern Europe. The body of works featured in this exhibition represents a selection from several series created by Durdevic between 1999 and 2007, in which she gazes directly into the darkest abysses of the human soul.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through her work, Djurdjevic posits that our existence in the industrial age has become akin to factory work – routine, a continuous production process.&quot;</p>
<p>She may have proved one point. People think this is art and it is sickness.</p>

            I found the story of the pink bunny when I researched "laughing israelis" -- a group of men who were seen laughing and jumping up and down when the trade center fell. They were reported as suspicious and found in New Jersey. Hell, where is that video -- a guy wrote a book -- well, the Gelitin performance group included israelis. Gelitin is a covert word for explosive putty. They have changed their name now. The performance that they did in the World Trade Center was to open a window on the 91st floor and stand outside while a helicopter flew around taking pictures of them. They had to get special permission to do this stunt. They also built a workshop in their office there, made of empty boxes that held explosives. --

            The pink rabbits in her paintings reminded me of a group of performance artists called "Gelitin" (who did one performance feat on the same floor of the World Trade Center that was struck by a plane on 9/11) -- who did a performance involving a giant pink rabbit that fat people were sliding out of. This article says "on the hill with its entrails streaming out."  -- Of course, Marina Abromavich is a performance artist as well. --

            Tbh I don't see much difference to classical art. There has always been dark, disturbing, brutal and disgusting art just like this. You don't like it? Ok. It's art anyway and by no mean different in nature than art was 300 years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying, that it isn't pretty telling and disgusting, that Podestas prefer this one very certain stil of art, but leave alone the artist.

            commenting on my own post: -- at first the tiled background in some of these pictures makes one think of a bathroom, gym, washroom, maybe depicting a fence -- but -- remember those old diners?? the walls were tiled. And the wallpaper patterns and carpet patterns she uses are gaudy like a whorehouse -- nothing you'd really put in a home.  Perhaps the wall paper could signify confusion, or be depicting the circumstances. And then there are the girls laying dead in the water. Look at the titles of the paintings.
