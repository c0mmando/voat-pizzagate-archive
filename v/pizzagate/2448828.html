            - thanks for this post, great job! You might want to point out in your text that (((Prince Andrew))) is the Duke of York (!). Yes, the same Prince Andrew who flew to Epstein's Island.....

              This is disgusting just like the Royals.  The police are put in place by May and her cohorts and the Royal Family.  BUT.  We have the same program going on here.  Possibly it started in the UK decades ago, so it may be deeper, but it is well entrenched here also.  Sick all the way around.

             What I didn’t realise until Richard e mailed me was that Lynette had been forced into prostitution at the age of 14, escaped from the gang involved but had been trapped by them again and forced back into sex work – Lynette was murdered just before she was due to give evidence in two criminal trials, one involving an allegation of attempted murder and one involving an allegation of procuring a 13 year old girl for prostitution. Since Richard e mailed, I’ve done a bit of research into Lynette’s case and the police corruption involved – it’s a seriously grim sequence of events spanning many years.

            <p>
             During the police corruption trial the defence counsel constantly raised objections to the non-disclosure by the prosecution of relevant documents. In Nov 2011 Sir Nigel Sweeney ordered the prosecution to produce specific documents requested by the defence. Four documents were found to be missing and the police concluded that they had been destroyed in 2010 on the instructions of Detective Chief Superintendent Coutts.
             <strong>
              Nicholas Dean QC, counsel for the prosecution, offered no further evidence on 1 Dec 2011 and invited the judge to direct the jury to return not guilty verdicts. The trial collapsed. It was revealed that the instruction to Nicholas Dean not to offer further evidence had come from the very top of the CPS – the DPP, Keir Starmer.

              Fury as judges deny thousands of child abuse victims compensation after court ruling stops claims against local councils

             <p>
              Thousands of child abuse ­victims may be denied compensation after a court ruling stops claims against local councils.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many of the abused will be unable to sue councils for negligence, even if records show social workers KNEW about their ordeals and failed to act.
             </p>
             <p>
              Child abuse victims today told of their despair.
