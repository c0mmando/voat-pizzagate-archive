            WTF,,, seriously,, why the attack. was it just me or did you say the same to the five other people that had much better answers to your shitty post then me. All I said was couldn't we just get the FBI to confirm... pretty simlpz. Not nearly as eloquent as all the other people who replied to you saying just do a fking google search amend the date range and you'll find the info that predates the wikileaks post.... what an asshat, how would my simple post make me a shill

            I actually completely agree with you 100% that we are being led along with this by the counter coup, we're all just a little antsy becuase the clock isi ticking and something insane is going to happen (either they get away with it or they dont) (Sorry if I seemed rude btw)
