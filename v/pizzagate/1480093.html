           I've never been abused. But, when I was a kid growing up in a divorced family, for a short time I had a "big brother". He was creepy, but I was too young to notice.

            I was groomed by my stepfather. Of course I didn't know that's what he was doing at the time, in fact I only realized what it was when I was 30 YEARS OLD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortunately for me I firmly rejected his advances so he didn't get that coveted pedo "consent", but if I had not rejected him I would not have had ANY IDEA what I was "consenting" to. NONE. I think I was about 10 or 11 years old at the time. Like I said, I didn't realize until I was 30 and I found out he had molested my older sister.
           </p>
           <p>
            To this day he still insists he "did nothing wrong" and that my sister, who was 11 when he molested her, "knew what she was doing". Scum of the earth. I have never spoken to him again since the day he said that to me. Today he lives as a hilbilly hermit all by himself with no one in his life. As he deserves.

             NerdyNoodle, I'm so sorry you and your sister went through that. I never even imagined how common that kind of evil was until I dated a woman who went through something very similar. Before I met her, I didn't even know "grooming" was a thing. Her stepfather had pornographic images plastered on the inside of her and her older sister's bathroom medicine cabinet. Like you, she told me that her older sister "took the brunt of it", and sadly, I think she carries guilt about that to this day. I never knew what to say or how to make it better, but maybe there just are no words. Maybe that's why I'm here. I believe there's something to pizzagate, and I want to help, if there is something to it. And, if there is, then that's probably only the tip of the iceberg. Evil is real.
