            This is a tragedy, and these are the first children we should be thinking about. I feel for the illegal aliens, but they are criminals, so they should get a clue and go back home. With so many thousands of them able to pick up and leave, why is it they are powerless to take care of the bad people in their own villages and towns? I don't understand the helplessness, but maybe this is because I am an American, and we fight.

            , please review the submission rules. All links need a brief description of content and how it's related to elite child abuse. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit.

             . Elite child abuse??? Really??? Just WHERE do YOU think this access to throwaway CHILDREN started??? This horrendous 
ABUSE of POWER has been going on even BEFORE the CLINTONS...  Also, is not OP's sub Title pretty damn descriptive? For the record, long week, nobody pissed in my Cherio's but there ARE MANY CHILDREN in the world at this moment I write in the hands of MONSTERS while OP now, per your 24hr GRACE needs to take time &amp; get PC or deleted, instead of AWAKENING others to the real world!!! Which WHY the ELITE (your words) keep getting away with MURDER... JMHO!

              This argument should be made as part of the submission.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you click the link in Rule 1 that goes to the definition of pizzagate, you'll see that Rule 1 includes anyone who is helping promote or cover up child abuse by the rich and powerful and members of rich and powerful organizations. That includes those systematically increasing the supply of abusable children. It is very broad. BUT the OP has to make the case for why whatever news item they post is relevant to what we are investigating: the global cabal that uses sexual abuse of kids to keep themselves in power. You can't just dump links with no explanation on the board, and make multiple posts that ignore the submission rules and not expect it to be taken as a forum sliding operation.

              is not new here. She knows our rules and has taken issue with them before.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mods did not make these rules; the community did, and they've voted multiple times to keep them. Under Voat's anticensorship rules, mods have to administer subverse submission rules consistently no matter how much we like or agree with the topic of a post.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the topic of medical kidnap: Because it's not immediately obvious how sick kids being removed from families who aren't being handed out to pedo foster parents is related, submissions regarding this need to include an explanation of just how this helps keep the pedo Cabal in power. I would include:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               A link to a previous post or outside article explaining (with linked evidence) how CPS was set up by the Clintons in the 1990's (and any Republicans who helped) to pay states, local governments and nonprofits for taking kids away from parents
              </li>
              <li>
               A link that shows how many kids put in foster care end up being abused, and how many end up being adopted to abusers (i.e. this is part of a systemic pattern of child rape and abuse)
              </li>
              <li>

               A description and stats about how CPS's reach, power and budget has grown since the 1990's, and a statement that it has become a bloated monster with such runaway abuse of power that it can take anyone's kids now for medical reasons. I.e. medical kidnap -- while it might not be directly about elites grabbing kids -- is a direct symptom of the massive corruption of a monster government that treats kids like meat and thus a reflection of the upper cabal that treats kids like meat.

               * This is similar to how Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry are related to PG -- they launder taxpayer funds to pro-abortion political organizations on the one hand, and cover up the sexual abuse of kids and provide an unlimited supply of fetal tissue to the biotech industry on the other.

              Once a medical kidnap submission has been made that clearly lays out the case for this being relevant, we can add a link to it to the Definition of Pizzagate thread linked in Rule 1, forever enshrining it as relevant. To my knowledge, though, no one has done this.
