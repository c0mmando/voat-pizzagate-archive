<p>In my recent travels I have noticed that the world of high art has moved towards the satanic and the pedophilic, with many symbols connected to pizzagate.  </p>
<p>ST TROPEZ, a small oasis for the super-rich, has numerous art galleries featuring some of the most well-known artists such as Banksy and Koons.  I notice that in this world of high art, one need not possess any talent or creativity, but simply be able to put forward any excuse for what the work of art \'speaks to\'.   Koons is famous for his balloon dog. He has risen to great heights because he has money and connections, because he is bereft of any skill or talent.   In the same art gallery selling Banksy and Koons were these \'sculptures\' both displaying the FBI pedo swirl and the satanic single eye:</p>

<p>MONTE CARLO once a picturesque, idyllic little principality, that could have been the back-drop for any fairytale with its Pink Palace and the little ladies cleaning the streets in the mornings has in the last 40 years become a shadow of its former self. It\'s become a caricature.  Monte Carlo, tax-free haven for the super wealthy, is tasteless, ugly, gaudy and graceless. And its chock full of satanic and pedo symbolism:</p>
<p>Monark Club (Route de la Piscine)  recently had its opening in Monaco.  Open from midnight to 5 am. The website speaks for itself:  </p>
<p>monark.club/</p>
<p>Take note of the symbolism (ie single eye, monarch butterfly, reptilian skin): </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/clubMonark/photos/a.1725015444464011.1073741826.1725013447797544/1730203230611899/?type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/clubMonark/photos/a.1725015444464011.1073741826.1725013447797544/1730203230611899/?type=3&amp;theater</a></p>

<p>Directly outside the Oceanographic Museum in Monte Carlo is a large sculpture by Phillipe Pasqua.  It is of a young girl with half her face torn off, revealing her skull.  In a time when violence against women and girls is increasing, artists like Pasqua are allowed free reign to de-sensitive people even more to women and girls being gouged open, bloodied, mutiliated and dead.   This is Pasqua\'s sculpture:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hellomonaco.com/culture-arts/exhibitions/philippe-pasqua-s-borderline-exhibition/">http://www.hellomonaco.com/culture-arts/exhibitions/philippe-pasqua-s-borderline-exhibition/</a></p>
<p>Further along is a large sculpture by Pasqua of a skull covered with what appear to be monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>Pasqua is \' known to produce such violent, powerful and imposing images&quot;.  But why does the violence have to be directed towards girls?  This is more of Pasqua\'s art. The nude models are clearly pre-pubescent girls</p>
<p><a href="https://au.pinterest.com/pin/492722015457417629/">https://au.pinterest.com/pin/492722015457417629/</a></p>
<p>No doubt Pasqua is a celebrated artist because of the pedophiles who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for each of his drawings.  Even if Pasqua has never molested a child, he\'s pretty much a pedophile for exploiting his young models.   Note also that his depictions of women are girls have them bloodied, bruised or dead: </p>

<p>World famous artists are incorporating this symbolism into their art.   Has the art world cottoned on to the fact that the elite have a penchant and predilection for Satanism, pedophilia and violence against women and girls?  I suppose they know which side their bread is buttered. They understand that one wealthy pedophile Satanist who buys a piece of theirs can set them up for life.</p>
<p>World famous artists like Frank Hyder often feature the pedo swirls in their paintings.  Hyder has a series called \'The Harvest\' and \'The Janus Project\'.</p>',

            "Satanist" is a red herring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many cultures have a devil figure in their mythology, none use spirals to represent it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spirals represent the infinite and energy cycles up and down the chakras of the spine from brown eye to third eye IN KABBALAH WHICH IS JEWISH MYSTICISM

              <p>
               First, your comment: CALLING THEM SATANISTS.   Can you point me to where in my post I've called them 'satanists'?? Nowhere.  I've stated that the art is 'satanic'--you have inferred incorrectly that they are 'satanists'.
              </p>
              <p>
               Second, your comment NOTHING "MODERN" CAN BE AT THE "CORE" OF ANYTHING.  Again, you're inventing things.  Nowhere have I said that anything modern is at the core of anything.

                What youre calling ART is actually termed KITSCH

               <p>
                The art angle is money laundering, the biggest participants are JEWS and financiers, i.e. JEWS, and i pointed this out just to enjoy the immediately resulting shillfest

                I like your post and did a similar one from Portugal and the idea of pedotourism is obviously super interesting.
