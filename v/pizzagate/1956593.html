<p>MONTE CARLO once a picturesque, idyllic little principality, that could have been the back-drop for any fairytale with its Pink Palace and the little ladies cleaning the streets in the mornings has in the last 40 years become a shadow of its former self. It\'s become a caricature.  Monte Carlo, tax-free haven for the super wealthy, is tasteless, ugly, gaudy and graceless. And its chock full of satanic and pedo symbolism:</p>
<p>Monark Club (Route de la Piscine)  recently had its opening in Monaco.  Open from midnight to 5 am. The website speaks for itself:  </p>
<p>monark.club/</p>
<p>Take note of the symbolism (ie single eye, monarch butterfly, reptilian skin): </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/clubMonark/photos/a.1725015444464011.1073741826.1725013447797544/1730203230611899/?type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/clubMonark/photos/a.1725015444464011.1073741826.1725013447797544/1730203230611899/?type=3&amp;theater</a></p>

<p>Directly outside the Oceanographic Museum in Monte Carlo is a large sculpture by Phillipe Pasqua.  It is of a young girl with half her face torn off, revealing her skull.  In a time when violence against women and girls is increasing, artists like Pasqua are allowed free reign to de-sensitive people even more to women and girls being gouged open, bloodied, mutiliated and dead.   This is Pasqua\'s sculpture:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hellomonaco.com/culture-arts/exhibitions/philippe-pasqua-s-borderline-exhibition/">http://www.hellomonaco.com/culture-arts/exhibitions/philippe-pasqua-s-borderline-exhibition/</a></p>
<p>Further along is a large sculpture by Pasqua of a skull covered with what appear to be monarch butterflies.</p>
<p>Pasqua is \' known to produce such violent, powerful and imposing images&quot;.  But why does the violence have to be directed towards girls?  This is more of Pasqua\'s art. The nude models are clearly pre-pubescent girls</p>

<p>No doubt Pasqua is a celebrated artist because of the pedophiles who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for each of his drawings.  Even if Pasqua has never molested a child, he\'s pretty much a pedophile for exploiting his young models.   Note also that his depictions of women are girls have them bloodied, bruised or dead: </p>

            "Satanist" is a red herring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many cultures have a devil figure in their mythology, none use spirals to represent it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spirals represent the infinite and energy cycles up and down the chakras of the spine from brown eye to third eye IN KABBALAH WHICH IS JEWISH MYSTICISM

              </p>
              <p>
               First, your comment: CALLING THEM SATANISTS.   Can you point me to where in my post I've called them 'satanists'?? Nowhere.  I've stated that the art is 'satanic'--you have inferred incorrectly that they are 'satanists'.
              </p>
              <p>
               Second, your comment NOTHING "MODERN" CAN BE AT THE "CORE" OF ANYTHING.  Again, you're inventing things.  Nowhere have I said that anything modern is at the core of anything.

               <p>
                The art angle is money laundering, the biggest participants are JEWS and financiers, i.e. JEWS, and i pointed this out just to enjoy the immediately resulting shillfest
