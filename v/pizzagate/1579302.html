<p>So I really like this one movie critic, YouMovieSucks on YouTube. He\'s super critical and has amazing suggestions for movies to see. This documentary he recommended is called Ticked (2016). It\'s about the son of a rich Wall Street guy who basically has infinite money and is into male on male tickling videos. He pays to get young (mostly males) to make tickling videos of each other, and seemingly chaotically, doxes and releases those videos, while sending emails and making calls to friends, family, employers and schools of those who participated for more videos, and remain a part of his obscure tickle fetish video ring. This sounds super fucked, I know... but hear me out. This documentary did really well at Sundance, it\'s not a fly-by-night production. This is exactly the tactics I believe they would use in a pedo ring, with politicians reputations and lives on the line. It\'e even manned by an insane and wealthy individual (think Soros, or any and all deniers of pizzagate, really) who throws around cash like candy and has a Joker style of educing chaos based on their own sick will through blackmail and manipulation. His money makes him seemingly INVINCIBLE (you will see in the documentary). Makes me wonder how we\'re ever going to get anything done here. Have a watch and discuss. Thanks.</p>',
