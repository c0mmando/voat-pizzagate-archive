            Maybe you could collect a list of as many local journalists and media people as you can, local to the ring obviously, and release to them at the same time as the in-state police and FBI office? Then you can say to the journalists "I have notified the FBI", and to the FBI "I have notified the press".

            First of all backup everything. Second of all dig untill you have a decent case to spread here and on 8chan so others can start digging.

            Collate. Everything. Try and find links between more people. Dig deeper &amp; maybe you'll know when the time is right to bring it all to light. Or at least who to pass your findings onto.
