            Hey! Being that I'm the topic of this thread I figured I'd hop on and clear some stuff up. I've got a personal family issue going on right now that really needs my attention. If you go to my twitter account you'll see what happened with that anon- he basically gave me a heads up that I was wide open to issues. I had my show scheduled Friday night, but ended up having to rush to the hospital and cancel it. The timing of it all was ridiculous-- I know all of this looks absolutely horrible-- but there are two separate issues here. Canceling my show caused a firestorm of conspiracy theory- rightfully so, in the climate we are in. As this was happening that anon was publicly tweeting me on twitter- I was trying to mitigate that while taking care of stuff at the hospital. My videos did open eyes- I put some stuff together-- however this has just become a nightmare for me personally right now. If I wasn't dealing with this family thing this would be a lot easier to mitigate- but let's say these few things:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             I didn't and don't have any "secrets". I was just putting things together that anyone else could have done.
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I made everything private because I sincerely wanted to shut it all off to focus on what is important to me right now. It ended up being a RIDICULOUSLY stupid mistake. It just made everything more crazy. I'm dumb. Was acting out of emotion. Wanted to just unplug.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Whatever is going to happen is going to happen without me or anyone else being involved. Thats my opinion anyway.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Thank you. For being a community- even if you were only concerned about me for informations sake, I appreciate it. It was the perfect storm. Right now, I just want some privacy and to disspell these rumors so there isn't unecessary and "rumor mill" attention on me. I'm just not continuing my fact finding for the foreseeable future because my family needs me. I hope that you guys can understand. Again, thank you. Sincerely. My thoughts aren't coming out exactly as I'd like right now

             Thanks-- I saw your post on Twitter. Sorry if I posted to hastily and made it worse. That said, something is definitely whacked with that Anon acct. I don't know exactly, but I think I won't try to piss them off. Interactions are very very strange.

            what they are getting into... is libeling many people in a big way with zero evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe one day they actually get served with a writ or get a letter from a lawyer, I dunno, cos many people being libeled in PG are blissfully unaware it is even occurring, since this is but a small echo-chamber in a corner of the web.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally have alerted 2 0r 3 VICTIMS of PG libel, and they were bemused shocked etc. Ppl can go on about the 'victims' but many alleged victims are in fact victimizing other innocent (presumed) people, Fiona Barnett being a classic example of a victimizer pretending to be a victim. 
These are lowlife IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe at some point some of these PG riders of the PG wave actually realize what they are doing and their empathy kicks in,  and they desist, or maybe they get the legal reality check/wake up call, or maybe some other karmic thing happens, or maybe as this woman says, real life intrudes and they reassess their priorities.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALl I ask if imagine if it was say your dad or brother or someone you care about, or YOU- getting accused by a bunch of STrangeRS on the net of doing range 0f heinous activity with NO REAL EVIDENCE. !!!!! and what passes as 'circumstantial' evidence here for most PGers is pathetic, tbh.... which is why it all goes here instead of to the nearest POlice station. they know it would not cut it in a police investigation, let alone a court of law. WELL if it does not pass the sniff test for the cops, FBi or an imagined court of law it should stay in your heads.

             You ask for our empathy, but empathy, like love, friendship and so many other things, is a two way street. Witch hunts are lowly uncivilized things and often hurt innocent people. If this is a case of a witch hunts, and most or all; of the accused being wholly innocent, (which I personally doubt), that would be a tragedy. And an injustice. But then there is the other side. What if even 10% were true, and we as citizens are standing idly bye as children are abused under our noses? One in three girls is abused in her lifetime. 1 in 5 boys. So believing in pizzagate is not like believing a UFO landed in DC. The possibility , even probability of a group of  elites in DC molesting/trafficking children is not at all strange. EX: The Franklin Cover Up. You need to step in our shoes as well for a moment.. Many of those riding the "PG wave", are also past victims of sexual abuse. So this takes on a personal meaning. And frankly, the fact that besides being on that airhead Kelleys show,  (which was not a real interview!) and one or two other brief interviews; You and others have not addressed the heinous issue of CSA. Not doing so lends itself to some thinking there is culpability. If I were personally accused of such a crime I would speak out not just in vehement denial but also try to understand why the accusation was being made in the first place. And then speak out against the horrid issue. Same with Podesta's. This is not some dark corner of the internet. Many people are involved in believing this and rather than acting imperious, like we are lowly unwashed masses, speaking to us directly would solve a multitude of issues. Silence is deafening..
There is a lot that does not add up. No one talks in codes like that lest they are drug dealers or something else. And you don't help your case with all those flippant pics &amp; comments on your Instagram. Ya, I know you are arty and kitschy, so am I. But you know what? I don't blame my neighbors for thinking i am a vampire freak when I dress all in black &amp; goth makeup to go dancing. I take responsibility for my eccentricities. So should you. You should own this. Calling your buddy :"chicken lover" whilst he is holding a male toddler is more than a tad suspicious, even if meant to be innocent. You see this is not just about one thing, it's many things. Like disparate pieces. And they just don't feel right. Hell if they don't feel right to me,a bonafide freaky chick, can't imagine what the normal's think. You don't do yourselves any favors with your elitism . We are not all just a bunch or right wing, homophobic hillbillies. We are just concerned citizens that don't want harm to come to our children. Threatening youtubers lives also does not help your case. Though I know If people were harassing my mother I would probably go nuts too.The homophobe Jesus freaks picketing outside of Comet are just deranged and prejudice. Most serious PG researchers shun them.
            </p>
            <p>
             My advice is to be interviewed by one of us. Not the dingbat bleach blonde, talking head that failed to ask you any serious questions and fawned over you. (incidentally this only exasperated PG, did not help.) But by one of us. Ya, "our culture". Not sure about that. We are a hodge- podge bunch. But we do have basic morality in common. And nothing is more sinister than CSA and CF and CP. WHy? Because it breaks minds, destroys souls and lasts a life time.

               no offense but i don't believe you. I've read all your comments and writing patterns and speech pattern are strikingly similar. If not James, who are you then? And why pretend to be him until now&gt;?

                 You truly sound a lot like him. It's scary. Guess I believe you. Why would the real JA lie about this now? BTW, I am going to make a submission with the response I made you with some minor twerks because I think this really is key to getting down to the bottom of this.  He needs to be interviewed by one of us. Because none of this is going to go away anytime soon. Also, did you ever watch the video where he threatened Ryan? If not, you should. That was not normal.

            I followed anon's posts all day- 911 related and   I feel like something else was pointed out to. Like -where the remenants of people are going possibly? Could be wrong on that.  I am pretty sure Ben Swann's Tzuday is 2-22-22.   Which Is used in hashtags on different social media websites.

            for what it's worth, i haven't checked the Wiki's to see where this goes, but re: Ben Swann, this guy noticed something not mentioned or misinterpreted, in Swanns goodbye video the word Tuesday is spelled 'Tzu day' which yeilds over 1100 hit in Wiki archives. some 1/2 wits  attribute it to 'Art Of War', Sun Tzu,,  too easy, too loose.  we need a termite or 2 to dig into the results this guy culled with this clue.  --&gt;

            she was making garbage . The football player for instance. WROng Fucking guy and it took me ten minutes on google to establish that. If ppl cant do basic research for real then they have no biz making claim to 'becoming the news' as this clown did. 
whatever happened to her she should take it as a blessing in disguise cos the crap she was putting out into the world was just that ...CRAP

            This person had been posting videos about the hints from the Anon account. Apparently she figured it out and had to "step back". She posted a video earlier today. I'm not sure what to make of it, but she sounds a bit scared?

After a family emergency on Friday, and an experience with an Anon on twitter that was shocking and eye opening, I realized I need to take a step back for a while. I had originally made all of my vids private because - let's be honest- I was a bit taken aback and surprised and not in a position to ensure I am focused on this right now, but after a few people emailed me I decided to make them public again. This is like a nightmare I wish would end but I can't wake up. Lol. 
I seem manic right now-- public-private-public-private-- but I think things have normalized. Thanks for your support.

            Edit - Her video on Friday, Feb 10 was posted during the day. In the comments, someone stated that George Webb was trying to contact her. This was before her normal Friday live show on Youtube. At some point after that, she tweets out that she has a family emergency and live show is canceled. I was following her on Twitter when this happened. Then she posts the video today saying she's shut down all her social media.

            Is there any way to tell if WikiLeaks ever released anything when the servers went down?
Have we ever caught up with that possibility?
Can this Vault#7 prove that WikiLeaks isn't compromised, that Assange is OK?

            <p>
             Or Do they have proof that Seth Rich was photographed giving information to Wikileaks, thus proving Rich was murdered?

             Anonymous Scandinavia seems kind of legit to me. But I could be wrong about that. He posts about all kinds of Clinton Foundation stuff, and other things, which give him credibility in my eye. He posted a letter to Chaffetz how the web hosting company that hosted Hillary's server, and the last time they updated their server. He's either a genius level LARPER or has inside information. Very different than my other experiences with Anonymous and false promises.

            My take:  They're A-OK if the Deep State turns on Trump, and they know that there is something there with Flynn and the Russians.

              What has been released from WikiLeaks since the Kerry visit to UK?
Was anything actually received from WikiLeaks before or after that server disruption?
Other than the suspicious appearances of Assange by audio or in interviews?

               You are going to be gravely disappointed if you think they're going to be charged with KP. They're all going down but they're going to be charged with...treason, RICO, corruption, influence pedaling..If they got charged with KP, they'd get off with probation. My feeling is the pedo information will be released, but they won't be charged with it. They're going after the USERS, the DEALERS, and the SUPPLIERS. But it won't be KP charges. I'm expecting Alefantis and a few others to have some murder charges. OH yeah Jimmy, they know. The ones that won't fall under RICCO will be charged with whatever is possible.

              Wikileaks said Vault7 would come from them alone. No surprise there - cause that's how they've done every other release and they host them on their servers.

              I can't even remember - has Anonymous (Scandinavia or otherwise) ever done anything meaningful except lame DDOS attacks?

              Trump's Hollowed-Out State Department
             </p>
             <p>

They include Patrick Kennedy, who had been the undersecretary of management since the George W. Bush administration, as well as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration Joyce Anne Barr, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Michele Bond, and Gentry Smith, who directed the Office of Foreign Missions.
Trump administration sources told CNN that the officials had been fired rather than quit. State Department spokesman Mark Toner, meanwhile, presented the departures as routine changeover.
