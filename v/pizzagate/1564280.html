            I agree this seems significant.  The Pentagon purportedly issued the statement to Schwartz, I suspect as a stern message.  The fact that Schwartz will command the National Guard into the inauguration and won't be allowed to received them at the Armory after the inauguration is most curious.  I think we will find in time he is part of the cover of the DC Pedo ring and he is the first target in Draining the Swamp...just a hunch.

            Reminds me of the replacement of the SService head just before the JFK hit. Can't find the link but it is well-known. However, I don't think there will be an assassination attempt on Trump, they'll probably try to deal with the situation another way. Who knows, maybe they're so divided and screwed up (w/ defectors to the Trump camp) that they're becoming more powerless. Nothing has worked on Trump so far ... but still, I cannot imagine Trump being freely given the keys to the kingdom. We'll see.

            this is what happened - typicaly the DCNG position stops duty at 12:01 noon 1-20, Trump asked him to stay on longer for the remainder of the day, he instead resigned

             Correct me if I am wrong please.  I have read on here a couple of times that BO might be the Manchurian Candidate.  Is this not a play of that movie with the plot being a little twisted to create the outcome.  Due to a few different circumstances they may have to revise it to some extent, but that could be the CIA plan.  I have heard that Trump wants to pull funds from the UN.  The UN is involved with the Unification Church as are the Bushes and Cllintons.  This is a whole conglomeration of crazy combinations.  So confusing.  I have not seen Vantage Point but I did see Manchurian  Candidate but cannot remember the whole plot.  All I remember is that they were planning to assassinate the incoming President.  Frank Sinatra was in the Original Movie and I read on here that he may have been a product of MKUltra (there was not a source given so don't know if that is correct).  I sent out an email with some of this info but not too heavy to some friends and a couple said it was some really heavy stuff.  I wrote back that these are heavy times that we are living in right now.  If some of this goes down most of the country will be in mortal shock and totally unprepared.

            Yes Obama is ordering his removal not Trump. This is something to worry about because this morning weapon stashes have been found in DC and the Clinton Crime Cartel bought 150000 assault rifles immediatly after the election.

             This stuff is scaring the hell out of me.  I did not vote for Trump.  Stein.  I am willing to wait &amp; see what he does, but I will say this.  If we have an assassination, this country will be in turmoil.  There will be people in the streets with guns and our police have been militarized and the national guard will be called  out.  I think a large amount of people will die, including children.  This would be a horrific.  My take on this is that we believe that allegedly BO &amp; GWB are involved in this Pizzagate.  This General was probably running whatever they had him doing with these black guards.  Obama wants him out in case of an Investigation.  Or you may be right.  There is something being planned against Trump.  I am hoping it is that the Present General is being pulled out because of his being complicit with the School.  We know this is probably what they have been up to there anyway.  They do not miss an opportunity to fool around with kids.  Either way this is awful.

              I don't think they're THAT foolish. They may as well hang themselves if they're looking to cause chaos. The only thing keeping them from complete eradication is the little bit of law and order; take that away and it's open season.

              I agree both BO and GWB (and his father, the founder of the CIA and likely the person that decided to kill JFK) are very likely involved at least indirectly.
             </p>
             <p>
              And yes, any sort of assassination, or voided election would likely lead to a major civil war.... And no one probably wins in that scenario.

               I very much agree.  I do not agree with some of his cabinet appointees, but am in agreement that we may need him to drain the swamp right now.  I am scared for our education system, for our social security and medicare for the elderly.  A country that cannot or will not take care of the young and old is not a country imo.  But we must do what is necessary to stop the trafficking and sex crimes against the children of the world.  A war will also create more organs and blood.  Those that are perpetrating all of this have already lived far too long.

               I in no way am going there and have just found out from my friend that our  friends will not want to be near there either.  I think it reminds me of the saying They gave a war and nobody came.  How about They gave a coup/assassination and nobody came. I cannot believe that the Progressive Faction would be dumb enough to not figure out what they are trying to achieve.  This could actually be the CIA plan of a coup.  I am sure Trump is no dumb bunny and this has occurred to him.  I just don't know how he will counter it since a lot of the Old Guard is still in control at the Pentagon and CIA.  The UN has also been compromised.  What the Hell Has Not?  I just read the Zero Hedge Report and it is a stunner.  Totally Believable.

                I think a hard coup would end badly for the CIA/Clinton.  Google "Obama military farewell".  The pictures say it all.  Look at how many Generals Trump has appointed to cabinet and key positions, and the numbers of military that voted for Trump.
               </p>
               <p>
                They would clearly back Trump if it became a shoving match.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't think the chances of using some fake story/intel to legitimize Trump enough to void the election is possible.  They've been trying that for the last several weeks and it hasn't really taken hold.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think assassination attempt is a possibility and it's probably the only way they could stop him from taking power at this point, but I doubt they would be stupid enough to do it at the inauguration.  Hopefully he has luck on his side after he's sworn in, because he's hated by basically everyone in DC (both sides).  Obviously the MSM, CIA, 100% of Dems and probably at least half of the Reps would be dancing in the streets if he was shot.
               </p>
               <p>
                He may not be the greatest guy in the world, but he may be very useful in this time and place to drain the swamp that is DC and the political/corrupt class that runs this country and most of the free world.

             the general submitted a letter of resignation to give the new administration a clean start.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two military officials with knowledge of the situation said the Trump team decided to accept the resignation. A person close to the transition said transition officials wanted to keep Schwartz in the job for continuity, but the Army pushed to replace him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Schwartz, who was appointed to head the Guard by President George W. Bush in 2008, maintained the position through President Obama’s two terms. He said his orders came from the Pentagon in the form of an email that names his interim successor, a brigadier general, who takes over at 12:01 p.m. next Friday.

             yer, the man himself says he just got the order from the pentagon, but doesnt know who ordered it, although 'tradition' says its the president who does the hiring and firing for this position

            Not sure where to drop this, but French daily Le Figaro's Washington correspondant just wrote a piece with this heading : "Trump en guerre contre les espions (et vice versa?)" which translates like "Trump at war with spies (and vice versa?)". Notice that the question mark is between the brackets with implies that Trump's war with SS is taken for granted but not the other way...
           </p>
           <p>
            The conclusion goes like (French original under) : "Many resignations are said to be currently registered among services. Unless he would quickly take up again with his spies, the 45th president could find himself short of ressources in front of the terrorist threat or the next international crisis."
           </p>
           <p>
            "De nombreuses démissions seraient actuellement enregistrées parmi les services. Sauf à renouer rapidement avec ses espions, le 45e président pourrait se retrouver à court face à la menace terroriste ou la prochaine crise internationale."
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know where from this guy gets his tips but this sounds like an open threat from the SS.
           </p>
           <p>
            And please note that I've not been bothered about the US presidential election,. But what's going on seems extremely unusual to say the least.

              I mean I never understood this new fashion here in France that the MSM would spend so much time commenting on US elections. It has been non stop for the last few months. When I used to watch TV and read more press (many years ago!) you'd have to be really interested and look for it to find anything substantial about US campaign. Now we're flooded.
             </p>
             <p>
              since long French politics have come to a point where there is possibly less  at stake than in US. Le Pen again would bring a "front républicain" before or after being elected and everything back to "order" sooner or later. If she would make it... they cannot even fund their campaign so nothing to compare with Trump. Believe me I'm not for the army but it seems over here the only realistic move for a radical change  would be a military coup.
             </p>
             <p>
              What's surprising in the current US situation is agencies being brought to light so much. And possible internal, between agencies and between agencies and Trump strong opposition. Very unusual that it comes to light, even in alluding or coded leaks. The only good side of it would be a conflict on moral issues. That would be impacting the whole word for the better.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it could be violent. Here no one has arms except the government so if it turns bad no chances to move for the better.
             </p>
             <p>
              And what I find funny is that I was pesting before the elections that "We don't care about Hillary/Trump" but I now find myself following all this with great interest!!!
