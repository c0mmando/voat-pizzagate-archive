<p>The Dutroux case is significant not only because of the deep depravity of the crimes committed and witnessed, but because the evidence that emerges from the case is validated twice over; First by legal proceedings, secondly by the publication of many of the prosecution’s records by Wikileaks in 2009.</p>
<p>The Dutroux Affair was further validated by the extreme suppression of evidence in what many have called a coverup perpetrated by the Belgian establishment. The episode is a definitive example of the exposure of deep judicial and political corruption leading to widespread public distrust in the legitimacy of their institutions of government.This sentiment has been echoed most recently in the U.S., where many feel that the rule of law has come to mean little in the face of an utterly corrupt establishment that has become unaccountable to the public.</p>
<p>Belgium’s Dutroux scandal set a terrible precedent for future investigations of child trafficking, murder, and pedophilia rings. However, it also set a precedent of mass public protest in response to such abuses, evident last year in South Korea’s response to the scandal surrounding President Park and her advisor Choi Soon-Sil. </p>
<p>It took almost a decade for the Belgian legal system to convict Marc Dutroux for the mid 1990’s kidnapping and rape of six girls, four of whom were murdered. The case was infamous for an inexplicably high number of mysterious deaths, suppression of evidence by the police, and numerous accounts from witnesses of extreme abuse perpetrated by a well-connected, violent pedophile ring.</p>
<p>The case eventually prompted three hundred thousand Belgians to take to the streets in “The White March.” The Dutroux Affair left such deep scars on the consciousness of the Belgian population that roughly one third of Belgians who shared the surname ‘Dutroux’ with the accused had their names legally changed. Despite the case having been legally concluded, many years later it is apparent that numerous significant elements of the important case remain unresolved.</p>

            The Chateau des Amerois in connection with the Dutroux affair is the source of GH Bush's phrase 1,000 Points of Light. I believe that his use of that phrase was a message to the world that the US is a Pedo Nation.

            Hi red --
What was so disappointing - heartbreaking -- was that after "The White March" the cover up
smeared one of the major witnesses/victims of this abuse, Regina Louf.
It's been a while since I've read of the case, but Regina Louf was one of 11 witnesses who
came forward to tell what they know of the pedophile rings where they were also victimized.
I can't remember exactly at the moment but it was the demonization of Regina Louf
which made many Belgians reject the idea of a wider conspiracy than the 6 children
originally found harmed -- 4 murdered.
Within the investigation (as I recall it) many very honest investigators were overturned
and the truth denied by power from above.
I don't know if the people will ever be able to go back and have the truth told about 
what happened -- and what likely is still happening in Belgium.
And, again, Church and government officials were involved as well as Royals -- all of which
resulted in a very high level and total shut down of the investigation of the case which would
have shown much wider corruption and exploitation of children.
           </p>

             That's exactly what the article posted by OP talks about:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Louf’s struggle to speak out on the horrific abuses she claimed to have experienced and witnessed ultimately failed. Investigators who believed her testimony to be credible were removed from the investigation, and her real identity was leaked to the press.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Louf’s identity was made public, her reputation was systematically destroyed. The BBC wrote that after her identity became known, a government-owned TV station RTBF began a campaign “designed to prove that Dutroux was an “isolated pervert” kidnapping girls for himself, that there was no network, that Jean Michel Nihoul was innocent and Regina Louf was a liar.” After this point, the public effectively gave up struggling to find real justice for Dutroux’s victims. To protest systemic corruption was to be associated with insanity, and so outrage was morphed by shame into heavy silence.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..... In the end, the only answer to the known and unknown victims of Dutroux was the same: a resounding silence."

             <p>
              Well, I think we agree that the smearing of Regina Louf and other right wing propaganda 
used to cover up the case was able (sadly) to convince much of the public to "go home -- 
nothing to see here."  Whether the public truly bought all of the cover up or whether they
just felt powerless when the honest investigators were removed is an open question.
But right wing propaganda and lies do work.  At least for a time.
             </p>
             <p>
              The case is one of the best examples of what truly goes on in the cases from the thugs like Dutroux
to the higher ups like Nihoul who arrange things for Elites.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the most effective things we can do, imo, is to ensure (as this OP does) that more 
Americans know about the international cases where they can begin to see the similarities
of the testimony of victims and also the similarities of those at the top who protect them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also to move the US information to international websites.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the past, I've always posted long term on websites where we had a lot of people from
UK - China, whatever -- and from many US states -- where you could feel fairly confident
that the information was getting out there and their info getting to us.
Currently, I'm not posting on sites where we have that mix any longer -- at least not where
I'm aware of it.

            I agree. My interest is more in older groups which parallel pizzagate, as well as the aspects of it people seem to easily forget, like Podesta's references to cannibalism at Truckee, his painting of cannibalism, and also Marina Abramovic's spirit cooking. These are all verified - and point to ritual abuse that most people do not understand, so they forget it. It's not in their concept of reality.

            This is one of the most saddening stories on pizzagate/pedogate, not just because of the details we know about, but because of the weight of the details we don't know. If we know this much, so much worse probably happened. Belgium seems to be a major center of this darkness. I wish we could investigate this further and get something
            <em>
             done
            </em>
            or changed somehow.

            i'll never get over this case. the police allowed to girls to starve to death in dutrouxs basement because they were covering up his crimes. that is going to haunt me forever. plus the public rioted when dutroux was going to be released. the police were in on this 100% and this is the global paedophile ring we are all trying to expose.

            The absolutely only way to teach these less than human dregs of society a lesson, is to reinstate the
STAR CHAMBER. ONCE A PERVERT HAS HIS D_CK
SHOVED DOWN HIS THROAT WHILE HE CHOKES ON IT....IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET THESE PR_CKS ATTENTION.
BTW, Those of us who have ' expert marksmenship'
ribbons will soon be neutralizing antifa, blm, amn,
AND Any other domestic terrorist organization.
AND FOR ALL YOU CUCKS IN THE FEDERAL BEAURACRACY, YOU'RE NEXT.
YOU CAN RUN.....BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO HIDE. WE'RE COMING FOR YA.

             That works both ways, you know.  The ONLY way to have an effective Star Chamber court system would be if "we" controlled it.  "We" do NOT control the current system, so any replacement would also be controlled by "them."

              Trust me , there are a whole lot more of us than there is of them.
And don't think for a second that we don't have some of our own jurists who are itching to get some real action. Don't fu_k
with those of us who raised our hands to defend the constitution. That's what most of you who haven't served don't understand: WHEN ONE PUTS ONES LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THEIR COUNTRY, THEN IT'S DEFENSE ,NO MATTER WHAT, IS JUSTIFIED. HOOAH

                It doesn't matter where or what the constitution is.....it's your ticket to freedom,
AND THOSE OF US WHO PUT OUR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR YOU IN DEFENSE OF THAT CONSTITUTION WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD LEARN A LITTLE HUMILITY. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND STOP CRITICIZING AND WHINING. WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE, INSTEAD OF TEARING OTHERS DOWN WITH YOUR FOOLISH COMMENTS....OR YOU COULD RE-HOME  TO N. KOREA!!

           <p>
            The trouble with this is patience wears thin when nothing changes.  The Dutroux case implicated many high level perps such as politicians and royals.  We know this goes on amongst the elite, and yet we are stuck waiting for something to change.  I hope there will be a pressure cooker type release at some breaking point in the future where enough people go from 'marching' to something far more definite and conclusive.  I also hope that I live to see the day.

            Truth can only die once all evidence and witnesses are disappeared. Even then those trying to hide it, know. So they have to be suicided as well. If you can manage to do all of this stealing and killing without any trail or anyone noticing. There will still be you who knows....
           </p>
           <p>
            Truth doesn't die it just gets covered up for a time.
