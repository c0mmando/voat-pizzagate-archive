            I came across this on you tube today. I find the Martial Law aspect of what this man says very intriguing......what if the QAnon thing is a well orchestrated plan to get us to accept Martial Law......a Great Deception......I am at the point where I trust no one.

             Unfortunately, this might be highly likely.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember what 'Q' said? "Military is the saviour. Trump is the saviour."
            </p>
            <p>
             No, they aren't. They're up to something, trying to fool us. (If you accept the notion that Q is legit.)

            It is not clear if they gave Trump money before he was elected.  My understanding is that nobody thought that Trump would win.  Did this change?

            OP, you'd gain a lot more credability if you left the UFO stuff out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apart from that: Yes, of course Trump is part of the swamp. I don't think he is a satanist, but he won't dry the swamp.
           </p>
           <p>
            This "Trump will drain the swamp" story is bogus.
           </p>
           <p>
            At best, he will throw some of the HRC cabal into prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            After that, it will be business as usual.
           </p>

            It'a a pity most people here will probably downvoat this submission without even reading it.

            Reality means almost all Senators and Congress members have been compromised by the Deep State in order to have any political party backing &amp; funding. Those that aren't natural pedos get invited to private parties with top donors. Then they're drugged and secretly filmed with a child planted in their beds.

            Trump knows he was put into office by a rebel group of FBI agents and the powerful adamantly against the NWO elite. He's far from perfect. Sure once he was friendly with Epstein.

            Trump hasn't made over 2 dozen trips to pedo island and done rituals in the Satanic temple at that location.There aren't pics on the internet of the 8-year-old sex slave whose vagina he sadistically cut &amp; disfigured.
           </p>
           <p>
            As long as Trump overall does more positive deeds, following the rogue FBI's who want to clean up the swamp he'll have my ardent support. As an actress I've lost a lot by being anti-Hillary already.

              I am still trying to understand exactly how much Trump controls who is appointed to his Administration.  It is easy to assume that the decision is solely up to Trump, but I think that no President has that control.

            It doesn't surprise me.  While Trump may skim the surface of the swamp and sift out scum that floats, he has too many friends who are also Satanists so he won't want to do a deep clean.  Personally, I don't think Trump is a Satanist, but he has supporters and friends who are. He knows they wouldn't be happy with him if he called them out.

             He'd never have been able to run for presidency without the support of these friends. He is a deep state puppet, unfortunately. I agree that probably he isn't a satanist, but his political career wouldn't have been possible without him playing the game of his friends.

             'Draining the swamp' means (for him) getting rid of some of the old Clinton cabal members (maybe), and that's it.

             After that, it will be business as usual, another faction will take over, as dirty as the current one.

              In what way are people fooled?  I have a lot of friends that will never believe his intentions are good.  I thought it was a great sign when Trump had that conflict with the CIA last January.  I cannot recall another incoming President going through that.
             </p>
             <p>
              I honestly believe that Trump thought he would not win for one reason or another.  I expected the election to be rigged, and I kept waiting for the results on election night to "miraculously" slide towards Hillary.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyways, I read your posts and I know you know a lot, but I am just wondering what information you have that makes you think Trump is not for real.  I have not been able to connect him to the Bilderberg Group or the Council on Foreign Relations.  Trump is connected to a Rothschild banker, but I am still not convinced that Trump is a NWO globalist.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am sure that Trump has sexually harassed GROWN women.  I think that if Trump screwed a kid or someone underage, then it would be on videotape.  There is no doubt they tried to entrap him giving his connection to the fuckhead Epstein.

               That's all you really need to know to make an informed decision but its an extra nail in the wall when you learn a 15 year old victim of Jeffrey Epstein was groomed OUT OF TRUMPS MAR A LAGO by his lesbian procurrer Ghislaine Maxwell.

               I don't. The legend is in the naming place. An interesting fact is that the Swastika stone on Ilk(ley) moor in Yorkshire is the oldest known depiction of a Swastika in Europe.

              Richard Sullivan, of the lobbying firm Capitol Counsel, is a bundler for the Clinton campaign, bringing in $44,859 in contributions in a few short months. Sullivan is also a registered lobbyist for the Geo Group, a company that operates a number of jails, including immigrant detention centers, for profit.

              As we reported yesterday, fully five Clinton bundlers work for the lobbying and law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison company in America, paid Akin Gump $240,000 in lobbying fees last year. The firm also serves as a law firm for the prison giant, representing the company in court.

                 The transition would be messy because they will not go down with a fight.  However, it has to happen, and now is a great time to do it.  For the sake of humanity, these people need to go.  They had their chance to do something great, and they squandered it.
