              Jung worked directly for the OSS and personally for Allen Dulles who gave us MKULTRA.
             </a>
             This is a big one because obviously Jung was massively influential but he also worked for this group during the critical OSS -&gt; CIA time period.

             Point is, the OSS was all into black propoganda/psyops, just like the CIA is about mind control and brainwashing. (It flips governments using these techniques as much as they abuse individuals, and as much as they do domestic publish brainwashing etc). The people into ritual abuse seem not just tied to military agencies or intel agencies but always specifically linked to psyops.

             <p>
              Also, there are many cases of people who were child victims reporting that it was their own parents, employed by intelligence or other government agencies, who offered them up to the abusers in the name of research.  Could be that Sally Quinn was one of those children.

             <p>
              "Most concerning is the ongoing abuse of children in CIA mind-control experiments. In the 2007 Extreme Abuse Surveys there were 147 extreme abuse survivors who answered “yes” when asked if they were currently being accessed/abused against their will by ritual abuse-mind-control perpetrators. Some survivors claim they had their own children kidnapped to be abused and perhaps killed, through these government experiments done on our taxpayer dollar.

               Definitely troubling and interesting.
              </p>
              <p>
               An add-on to what you're saying about multi generational abuse:
              </p>
              <p>
               I noticed a lot of people tied to Findhorn claimed to be able to see spirits/fairies/dragons/whatever and even to be some type of hybrid of these things (I do not believe in this, but I noticed their claims about it as odd). Point is, I think ^ This ties into the experience of dissociative and ritually abused people, who can sometimes claim to experience the paranormal AND see visions which might be interpreted as alters..
              </p>
              <p>
               Which I bring up because if Quinn's father was military intel and we assume she was abused in some type of
               <a href="https://archive.is/Mm4RF">
                MKULTRA
               </a>
               type program which also used ritualistic practice, it would make sense for her to claim to experience 'spirits' as part of a symptom of this. Also, there have been
               <a href="http://archive.is/d0Ogr">
                legitimate ritualMKULTRA survivors
               </a>
               who have claimed that part of the training was sometimes focused on
               <a href="http://archive.is/dHRYB#selection-8243.102-8243.187">
                attempting to psychically kill people
               </a>
               , as Quinn basically claims to be able to do in her own memoir.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again... her self reported history and beliefs are really ringing a lot of bells for me as far as her life history and sounding like other RA survivors. (Not that I'm excusing her by any means). Especially when it comes to her own belief in psychic powers to kill people - even if I think that's ridiculous, she reports to believe it, AND her father was CIA/OSS as you pointed out, AND that is exactly what the CIA apparently was interested in.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again though, it is absolutely bizarre to me that the CIA-backed WaPo would publish this, knowing how damning it looks. Wow. I have no clue as to what they were thinking or not thinking with this.

                Excellent point about the military's psychic killers.  It ties in perfectly.
               </p>
               <p>
                As to why WaPo would throw Quinn under the bus, I believe

                 @10487016
                </a>
                's comment in this thread could be on the right track.  Maybe it's damage mitigation and an attempt to control the narrative on this issue going forward.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I wonder is why Quinn would come clean with all of this now, especially after the hoopla caused by D.C. spirit cooking coming to light.  It's almost like she's whistleblowing.  If her mind actually has been fractured through ritual abuse, could it have been a rebellious alter who wrote the book?

            This is an incredible article in that the Washington Post incriminates itself/its own former longtime leaders as having participated in what look like numerous different aspects of pizzagate. It's the article on which the latest Breitbart piece is based.
           </p>
           <p>
            My honest question - WHY would the WaPo do this, now? They hired Podesta, they know what pizzagate is. What the hell is going on here?
           </p>
           <p>
            The article includes WaPo admitting that its longtime 'first family' were involved in:
           </p>
           <p>
            -Spirit Cooking type Voodoo practices.
           </p>
           <p>
            "like her mother, she believes in the deadly power of hexes — and suggests that she has harmed people by using them. If the hairs just stood up on the back of your neck, believe me, you aren’t alone."
            <br/>
            - Why would WaPo write this and incriminate themselves?!?
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Attempting to kill people with rituals and magical practice, which they believe worked.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            "Her belief in magic and the occult began in early childhood in the 1940s, when she often lived with maternal relatives in Savannah and Statesboro, Ga. As she writes in the memoir, her great-aunt Ruth was a “nice Presbyterian lady” and “a devotee of Scottish mysticism,” and all of the black domestic staff members “were adherents of voodoo, which they practiced regularly.” Quinn describes spirits showing up to make breakfast before the family rose. Years later, she writes, one welcomed her to Grey Gardens, a famous mansion in the Hamptons that she and Bradlee bought in 1979.""
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             An astounding, disturbing paragraph about Quinn kissing her infant son that almost reads as pornographic, and Quinn herself compares her behavior towards her son to that later expressed towards her husband:
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            "Halfway into the book, Quinn offers a glimpse of what this memoir could have been had she stuck to her promised topic of chronicling her lifelong search for spirituality. She describes hovering over the hospital crib of her newborn son, named Quinn, in 1982, hours before he underwent surgery to save his life.
“I was overcome with an animal, visceral, raw need, like a mother lion licking her cub. I carefully took off his blanket and his little nightgown. I leaned down and began to kiss his body. I kissed his head and his little pink ears and his eyes and his button nose and his rosebud lips.”
“I wanted to have his taste in my mouth forever if anything happened to him. The love and desperation I felt for my baby was the strongest emotion I had ever experienced. I was in agony. Later I would do the same to Ben the night before he died."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is all incredibly creepy and extremely pizzagate related due to the Washington Post having hired John Podesta AND because their owner, Jeff Bezos, took a $600 million contract from the CIA. This is the same agency which has been heavily discussed on this sub as involved both with MKULTRA and cults/ritual abuse (this combination is most succinctly found in the Finders case which included trafficking, MKULTRA type activities AND ritual abuse).

              I heard somewhere that its because they know its coming out and they want to be ahead of it.  Plus there is no hiding it anymore, too many exposures have come out now already.  I also heard it is called 'signaling' to others that they mean business and they all come out together worldwide, ie when Tillerson and others criticize this shows publically whos side they are on.  I said I won't believe Mike Pence is involved until I see it, but the sad fact is the more I hear about him the more sceptical I am becoming.......so sad I still hope hes on the right side! :'(  - MUST WATCH:-   Breaking: Mueller To Charge Trump With Supporting Perjury -
