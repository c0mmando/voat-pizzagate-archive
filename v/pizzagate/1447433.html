A primary source is really to me and other skeptics what makes the difference between fact and rumor and lies. Look up the difference between a primary and secondary source to really understand it.
Wikileaks emails and documents are a primary source. Andrew Breitbart\'s tweet is a primary source. Anything posted to facebook by Monica Petersen is a primary source.

            I found the pastebin containing a lot of the info from the original reddit post. There are a lot of primary sources in there. I'm still very sketchy on the whole 'satanism' thing though. Does anyone have anything BESIDES 'Spirit Cooking' to prove that connection?

            Ive stopped looking at MSM sources all together. I check /pol/ Washington Times Voat Drudge Ajones etc every day and they usually link to woke sources. But you have to even be skeptical for these sources because you really don't know what is part of the disinfo campaign. Lots of people trying to get us down CTR rabbit holes. Shills trolls and sliders. Watch out for em.
