            My hopes rest on the NYPD. Supposedly they made copies of Weiners Emails just in case the FBI wouldn't follow through. I believe once Obama is out of office and can no longer pardon people they will drop the bomb if the FBI doesn't. If that doesn't happen then that means a much tougher road ahead for everyone because it means Trump is not who he says he is. A little more patience is required.

While 'pizzagate' was catchy at the outset, it is now narrowly (and sometimes prejudicially) associated with Podesta emails and DC/US politics.  The actual subject of investigation now is not only the pedocrats in Washington but also the suspected establishment that may be linked by deviant behavior and beliefs beyond borders, political affiliations and occupations.

               Mods here are hopeless. Yesterday I had over 200 points, today I have 55 and that's all because I'm critical. Mods here took away all my motivation to investigate. They don't own the investigation. They don't decide whats a top priority or what is. They're taking over the investigation, steering it, shutting up critics, etc, etc

            How do you present pizzagate as non-partisan when it started with Hillary Haters at /4chan and /theDonald and it started with the very basic premise that Podesta is a monster and then went looking for evidence of that monstrousity and it's that mindset that led to the discovery of "code" in his emails.   If there's no "code," there's no case.

            I saw that someone wanted to show that THEY try to divide us by race. How about using a meme for BKM to piggyback on BLM? MAKE A MEME with black Haitian kids for Black Kids Matter. Lead people in with something they are already halfway programmed to accept. Then after a while you can bring in other races. White kids matter or Asian kids matter or All Kids Matter.

            I think, while I agree this should not be political, it is at the moment. We need to get the millions who are turning a blind eye to this simply because they believe CNN when they say its a witch hunt, I think for now it is an excellent strategy to show that both sides are in on it, and maybe show as well how they've corrupted law enforcement, child services, charities etc. The Weiner/Hastaerts meme is excellent, I think that'll really make a dent.

            Liberals like em. Let's recruit some of our members who are good speakers to do TED talks incorporating some of the ideas from the CBS woman ex-reporter who did a TED talk last year about how astroturfers use the media to get people to believe their lies. I was very surprised to hear her expose Snopes as a false medium too.

             This sounds amazing. I've noticed how Snopes has become a disinfo outlet over the past couple years. Do you have a link to the TED talk?

            <p>
             EDIT: Think I found it. Is this it?

              I guess it's not so easy. Looks like speakers have to be nominated. See

             <p>
              In that case just do a video and call it TED-like or something.

            Pizzagate is a hoax. It is fake news and has been debunked. You folks need to find a new conspiracy to investigate...perhaps chem trails, bigfoot, or Obama's birth certificate. Haw haw haw. Now don't you feel silly believing that a family restaurant is a den of nefarious activity?

            I don't see how the 1% can collapse. They keep stealing as much as they can from the common people, making us weaker and weaker as they get increasingly stronger. To me it looks like we, the common people, will more likely do the collapsing.

             Nah, we have the power of the internet now. Do you even realize what we've done through Pizzagate? We're exposing widespread crimes that have been kept secret for millennia. Their secrets aren't secrets any more. Even that is amazingly powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
             But more generally, we've learned that average people have incredible power when we can work together, and the internet allows us to do just that. This is a revolution.

            You address their counter to the power of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate has the power to unite all good people in a way no other issue out there can.  What decent person would not be outraged and driven to action to defend children from pedophole murdering cannibal scum?

            As I just posted on another thread
PIZZAGATE IS AN ACTIVE CITIZENS INVESTIGATION INTO A PEDOPHILE RING GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP MAY BE INVOLVED IN.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not news.  It is a newsworthy investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is newsworthy because:
           </p>
           <p>
            Government officials appear involved
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement appears aware but not pursuing

            Ties to foundation which Presidential Candidate runs

           <p>
            MSM willfully overlooking this major story
           </p>
           <p>
            Gov appears to support actively suppressing it

            Agreed. One thing I would also suggest is piggy-backing on the existing wealth of child trafficking organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The term Pizzagate, itself, just sounds "conspiracy theory-ish." Why don't we try to rebrand ourselves as the International Coalition Against Child Sex Trafficking? Or something more digestible, but along those lines. Whenever I talk about Pizzagate in real life, people's eyes just roll. But when you talk about child sex trafficking, there's a much more concerned response.

            BRING TRUMP INTO IT!! This has been the best way I've found to get my friends to even listen. Trump rode on the Lolita Express at least once, and was a business partner AND friend with Jeffrey Epstein while they were business partners for a TEEN MODELING agency. I couldn't be happier watching Hillarys demise, but this information creates a scope of how big Pedogate may be. #Pedogate. The media commandeered and wrote the story for Pizzagate, kinda like how we took over twitter's #rememberwhentrump. Pedogate pedogate pedogate! Let's write the story and make it ours.

            It's overstatement to say Kissinger expressed optimism about Trump.  I think he's just getting on his good side, refusing to join in the bashing.  Also, Kissinger traditionally sides with Republicans.  Could just be attempting to maneuver and manipulate the President-Elect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kissinger did
            <em>
             consider
            </em>
            endorsing Clinton.  He did not consider endorsing Trump, as far as I'm aware.

            Yes! It's time to replace the false Hegelian dialectic with the Truth. That combined with meme magic may be an unbeatable force.

            He didn't endorse Trump, though.  He endorsed neither candidate, and he did
            <em>
             consider
            </em>
            endorsing Clinton.  Calling his statements about Trump "optimism" seems like overstatement.  He is just cautioning people not to pre-judge him.  Maybe he is trying to get on the good side of the President-Elect.

            I agree, this is a great strategy. Just this year alone they have tried to divide us by race (black lives matter also funded by Soros,# NODAPL Standing Rock), by political part (Hillar and Trump, Sorosfunding Hillary protests), by gender with this new transgender or gender fluidity agenda, and let's add to that Pizzagate believers and fake news. And it tells you a grim story about the psychopaths in charge

              Yes everyone is. You misinterpreted me or maybe I dint make myself very clear. I love people from all walks of life, but I have a problem with people telling tiny children they can decide what gender they want to be.

            it contains a list of known convicted officials, might be easy to track partisanship?

            This election was really tough for me, because I hated both candidates. A month ago, I was devastated that Trump would be president, now I'm just glad that Hillary didn't win. I was never for her in the first place, but I thought that she would be light years better as a president than Trump. Then this whole pizzagate thing happened and I felt like suddenly everything about her made sense, why she lies so damn much, why she says she's going to do one thing and then does the complete opposite thing, the cheating of the election, the fact manipulation of events. I don't fucking trust liars.

              Just as the pope will never undermine the Catholic Church by informing the flock that it isn't needed, so politicians will never tell us the truth... That they aren't needed. The moment we wake up is the moment we become dependent on our own innate ability to be responsible for ourselves and our community. No sooner.

             I hear you.  Just want to say that, in part, Trump won because many were, for whatever reasons, simply able to see all that much earlier.  At some point, none of them/us knew.  We don't know what we don't know. And it's a process not an event. :o)

              Trust me, I knew that she was bad. I know I'm going to get downvoated to hell for saying this but just because Trump isn't a cheater/murderer/blatant liar doesn't make him fit to be president. I'm glad Hillary didn't win because if she did, this whole investigation would be shut down so fast it would make your head spin. But that doesn't mean I'm excited for a Trump presidency. Trust me, I want him to do well, but my experience with people like him (I actually have some) is that everyone that works under them is less important, and that they'll do anything for profits, even if that means making shady deals and screwing the little guy. I hope I'm wrong, I really do.

                No, not really. I've seen him say/do way too many idiotic things for any of that to matter at this point. I appreciate you trying, though.The only thing that will change my mind is a more prosperous, less corrupt country with less war and more peace. That's something hugely difficult for anyone to accomplish. We'll just have to see if he can do it. Based on his campaign, I'm remaining doubtful for the moment.

             At first, I opposed both Trump and Clinton.  Then I started to realize how unfairly the media had treated Trump, and given that Pizzagate and FBIanon corroborate each other, Trump probably really does plan to drain the swamp as best he can.

              I was exactly the same way. I woke up once I noticed how slanted the media was. They were telling me who to vote for. I wondered why. So I decided to do some research and man, I found myself a lot more than I bargained for! But I'm not going anywhere. I'm glad I know the truth, and I will do all it takes to raise awareness.

                </p>
                <p>
                 Trump cast his reversal as a unifying move that, contrary to some of the early backlash, he believes won’t upset his supporters.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “I don't think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain it that we in many ways will save our country,” he said, adding that prosecuting Clinton “would be very, very divisive for the country.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Trump did, however, suggest he wasn’t taking potential investigations into Clinton off the table, while still remarking that he doesn’t want to “hurt the Clintons.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 “I'm not looking to go back and go through this,” he added.

                 But if the investigations go ahead and all this comes out, then it won't be divisive for the country anymore, because everyone will want to see her locked up. So hopefully he's saying that now, knowing that they'll be outed to the whole world soon enough. I don't know though - I know loads of people think Trump is literally God's gift to America, but even ignoring the media bias, I've only seen a very small man in terms of integrity, and someone whose ego seems to be number one priority for him.

                 It makes sense for him to say that, regardless of his intentions.  He needs to avoid the "political witch-hunt" narrative and let the FBI and DOJ do the dirty work.

            Your Thatcher link is 404. Or is it just me.

            I thought of something reading the comments here. When you start with the bipartisan stuff I already know their reply. "It's alt-right and they don't like the establishment GOP" . I think I've already seen it in real life but I'm not certain. After I "came out" in public with this, someone called me alt-right for absolutely no reason. They shouldn't have even seen my posting that I believe pizzagate to be true. I think a friend of mine is talking about it to other people. Most likely saying I'm nuts. He's that sort of person. I think the other person slipped when they accused me. Not much about me is alt-right. I'm a left leaning libertarian for crying out loud! At least that is where I fall on the graph whenever I take one of those "where do you fall politically" tests. (I'm strong on 2A)

             True, but we can counter that narrative as well, such as by showing screenshots of the anti-Semitic flood posts on the morning of Dec. 16th, showing how they were all downvoted and deleted (well, once I got online anyway; I was sleeping when they started).

              I'm not quite sure what you mean but most of the people, at least that I know, including many Christians and Jews, aren't anti-semitic, rather they are anti-political Zionism. Sadly, the two are often intentionally conflated to cause the very division and censorship we're trying to mitigate against here.

              1 minute vid that changed a lot of minds, if you're interested:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqJH1KXlPs">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqJH1KXlPs
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              This is also a very tough topic, given at least part of the history of pedophelia and luciferianism that we're addressing.  The following 40 minute video of a Jewish speaker was recommended to me by a Jewish pizzagate investigator.  It is interesting yet challenging to watch.

             <p>
              I'd rather not believe any of it but I/we don't have the "luxury" of turning away from any source that may help put all of this in context.   For many of us, context is imperative to making connections and investigative headway.

            I agree, but I'd go one step further and try to avoid the words
            <em>
             Republicans/conservatives
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             Democrats/liberals
            </em>
            altogether if possible. What we need to emphasize is that this is not a political cause. Sure, its implications
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            political, but the core boils down to human conscience and responsibility, and we need everyone on our side who's otherwise alienated by the slightest hint of a political movement.

             Sorry, but I'm not interested in further burying of the facts. IMO, the best strategy is seeing repubs, dems and non-affiliated all aggressively engaged.

             And, as the OP says, going after pedophiles equally regardless of their affiliation.

             I think it would be wiser to 'pretend' you support Hillary.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hear me out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most people I talk to assume Pizzagate is an Alt-Right conspiracy against HRC.  It isn't.  It's not partisan.  Make sure your sign makes this clear, the media would love to label us with the right wing conspiracy nuts.
             <strong>
              It is absolutely VITAL that you are crystal clear that you are not a Trump supporter, and instead support HRC (lol).
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             It's really the only way.  The problem with Pizzagate is the Podestas and Clintons make this entire topic very hard for die-hard liberals to even listen to at all.   Trust me, I am very liberal.  I avoided pizzagate for a long time because I assumed it was more right wing bullshit.  I wanted Bernie to win, but HRC stole the nomination (if you don't believe that you're a moron), and during the entire primaries, I was focused on wikileaks very closely.  I watched pizzagate come out from under the wikileaks emails, so I get it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most liberals, however, don't.  They aren't less intelligent, they are less aware of what's happening.  Our government is being controlled by corporations; for years the left has complained that the right was run on big oil and weapons manufacturing, and for a long time, that was true.  However, warefare is not really the most efficient way of fucking over people for the top of the corporations food chain; instead they find it more profitable to game BOTH sides of the political parties, which is why the democrats are being controlled by big pharma, banks, associations, wall street, etc.   I realize that.  They don't.  They see BigOilWeapons vs LiberalRightsFreedomForGaysRainbowsHappyTime.
            </p>
            <p>
             So please, just say you support HRC.  They might actually listen a bit.  They might look into pizzagate, and find comet ping pong, besta pizza, and all the fucking really weird shit regarding them.  That's the bait.
            </p>
            <p>
             They take the bait, they realize all this shit can't be coincidental, it can't be all chance.  So they start reading more, and uncover the truth, whatever that turns out to be.  I don't know what we are looking at, to be honest, but I definitely feel like there is something here.

                People are listening. It just takes time, and one red pill at a time. More people are listening than to any "conspiracy theory" ever. The media and the governments are already lying blatantly in their faces. What should (and mostly does) set us apart is transparency, authenticity, and maturity. We shouldn't play
                <em>
                 their
                </em>
                game, and we don't
                <em>
                 need
                </em>
                to: we don't need a fabricated truth because the evidence is on our side. We just need to be upfront with people about it. That's why I'm saying state what Pizzagate
                <em>
                 is
                </em>
                , not what it

             Bingo, making it a political issue has effectively divided us. Fairly predictable; as long as far right thinks the far lefts are absolute morons, then this will be par for the course.

             Agreed. I'm British so am neither Republican or Democrat and I wouldn't class myself as either Conservative or liberal either. This is about people doing wrong and being held accountable for it.

              Exactly, this about stopping pedophiles, not attacking media. The top priority should be saving the children and this can be only accomplished by finding the smoking gun which can only be found by doing research instead of attacking the media.

               Exactly. Whatever, whoever we focus on for too long gives those ultimately behind this the power to create scapegoats (albeit likely guilty scapegoats). They have a talent for slipping into the shadows while letting useful idiots take the fall. This is a human issue, beyond govern (controll) ment (mind), beyond religion, beyond Hollywood. If we focus on turning our back on the notion that we need to be dependant on Elites, then we undermine the potential for "elites" to abuse the power we have given them, because it ALWAYS FUCKING HAPPENS.

              There is one good reason to give examples of "both" republicans and democrats, and "powerful political parties" in Europe.  This is about GOVERNMENT doing wrong and being held accountable for it. What differentiates PIZZAGATE is that the people we are discussing are a part of the COUNTRY POLITICAL SYSTEM in several developed nations like USA, Great Britain, Belgium, which are systematically exploiting undeveloped nations like Haiti and Libya.
             </p>
             <p>
              Furthermore, PIZZAGATE recognizes that sexual child abuse enables mutual blackmail, economic and political relationships that support government corruption.
             </p>
             <p>
              The divide and conquer narrative being played out is that PIZZAGATE is an alt-right conspiracy, fomented by Trump supporters against Hillary Clinton and democrats.  You can see how this would be an easy sell to already bitter democrats. Showing that the investagation is not about party politics and whatever political lable you wear, but about trusted government institutions filled with compromised and frankly depraved individuals that are engaging in unspeakable acts for personal, political and financial benefit.
             </p>
             <p>
              The point is, you don't have to be a democrat to be a part of PIZZAGATE.

               documentary from 1989 (release date of 1994),

                Conspiracy of Silence

               One of the best comments re this documentary; "The country is only run by a government when the citizens abandon their responsibilities in exchange for comfort. We the people ARE the government."
              </p>
              <p>
               It involved a number of Government Officials within the Bush/Reagan Administration. As well as a large number of State &amp; Local Government in Nebraska, centered around the famous
               <em>
                Boys Town

               charity/orphanage/homeless juvenile center &amp; Lawrence E. King Jr., aka Larry King, the man who originally planned &amp; organized a huge pedophile prostitution/sexual abuse/ritual sexual assault ring that shipped some of the chosen children into Washington D.C. for pedo parties involving politicians &amp; the elite of the nation.

              Wouldn't something along the lines of "this goes beyond our political stances" suffice, without explicitly spelling out those words? I know I'm so resistant to political blabla thanks to a continuous disappointment and frustration that if I see one of those words mentioned anywhere I scroll right past. And I know many do the same. Also, this is global, and as

               Maybe with just labeling "R," "D," etc?  They have to be labeled in some way, in order to prove the point that Pizzagate is unbiased.

                It's not important to prove that we are unbiased. An unbiased or credentialed source is only important when you are using opinion in your argument, it doesn't matter who the source is when you are arguing with facts.

                Facts that show that the issue is real are the roles of people like Jeffrey Epstein, Dennis Hastert, Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith, Leon Brittan, and the testimony of people like  Det. Jim Rothstein, Wayne Masden, Sibel Edmonds, and the misrepresention of the corporate media eg "that PizzaGate is a debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring from Comet Ping Pong and Celia Kang's fictional account about the Vigilant Citizen article.

               <p>
                Sibel Edmonds made a valuable

                  Interpretations can be justified rationally by using Occam's Razor. The argument that the most reasonable explanation for the known facts is that a high level paedophile ring is operating in Washington DC and that it is being covered up by corporate media is derived from the minimal number of assumptions necessary to explain the facts as compared to alternative explanations.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Occam's Razor doesn't tell us that the most reasonable explanation is actually true, only that it is the best working hypothesis given what we know so far. This argument is essentially a appeal to reason, and it relates to the duty of care at common law (as compared to the ceremonial "Cremation of Care" of the Bohemian Grove elites).

                Yeah I agree with you - people won't notice that there are Republicans in there necessarily and will just scroll past thinking it's an al right thing. I think maybe a header saying something like Pizzagate is NOT a partisan issue, with pictures of different pedophiles of different political persuasions and label them. Hopefully people who are put off by seeing either Dem or Rep will first see the heading saying it's not partisan, and will be more inclined to look. The whole idea of showing it's politically neutral doesn't work if there aren't labels pointing out which party each pedo is from!

                But does this prove that point any more substantially than a general phrasing of the same thing? I think we need to emphasize what Pizzagate
                <em>
                 is
                </em>
                , as opposed to what it
                <em>
                 isn't
                </em>
                . "Pizzagate is not a conservative or liberal cause" sounds like explaining yourself, and evokes a lot of complex emotions. "Pizzagate is a human cause beyond political ideology" is to the point, and imprints a simple message.

              So you'll announce in public what you're doing, not how you're doing it, or when you're doing it. They can read our plans here, can we read their plans? I opt-out for an unlevelled playing field. If they use bots on Twitter to steer opinion, we can do the same. I understand this is not transparent, or fair or whatever, but it is not illegal. If it was illegal CTR/MMfA would be illegal too. We can use exactly the same methods as they do.

               Public vs. private is a bit of a false dichotomy.  Even secure chat connections can be vulnerable to infiltration by moles.  I don't think we need to worry much about the enemy discovering our planning (worrying too much about that prevents us from
               <em>
                doing
               </em>
               much planning or organizing).  Secrecy is useful to us to an extent, but it's mostly the weapon of deceivers.  Our main weapons are truth and transparency.

                We have to agree to disagree on that. Being transparent in everything "we" do is not always the best way. You can sometimes better wait before you show it all. I had to smile at the last sentence though, thanks for that!

                         First, that's an exaggeration of what I said.  Second, me saying what I feel we should do is not "speaking for all of us." You are using an ad-hominem, not refuting my actual point.

                            Again you don't respond to anything I said and make some psychobabble claim. If anyone is projecting it is usually the person saying someone else is projecting. Look it up.

            Edit:  I personally would not focus too much on Thatcher's government for the moment.  That is already well documented and will only muddy the waters.  Researchers here have enough to do with the US gov't.  All that stuff that is still in the dark needs to be brought out and a bright line shone on it.

              Great angle. Even the demographics from 2013 show that a VERY large number of missing or exploited children are black or african american. White/hispanics outnumber them by only a very little bit but I'm pretty sure if you split the two blacks would come at as the #1. AND we could introduce the Haitian angle as a redpill tactic.
