<p>I decided to RANDOMLY look into the Hir5ch Foundation because I saw the name many times. There is little information about this foundation that operates out of Dallas, TX.

<p>Camera pans to a school sign with a goat on it. Child speaks in front of inverted yellow stars. Teen loves Ketchup Saturday (a big red splosh in a circle symbolizing people in a circle catching the energy of the sacrificed being in the middle) That\'s three symbols for Luciferian bingo. And it\'s fucking annoying to see this again and again and again.</p>
<p>I was sincerely looking for official data but I think that this foundation has abandoned the process of caring about looking legit since 2014. All the names on this list, which we have not investigated yet, need a looksee!</p>
<p>Rant out.</p>
