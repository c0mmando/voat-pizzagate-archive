            In order to convince the masses, there needs to be a better explanation as to the "why" of it. People will never believe that all of these politicians just happened to coincidentally be pedophiles who ended up starting a ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know there is blackmail involved. We need to focus on the "why" of that. People have a much easier time accepting that people do horrible things for self-preservation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's really difficult to do those investigations here. It's often considered off topic and posters are often called shills for trying to make the subverse look nuts.
This shit IS nuts. Not sure how we avoid looking nuts ourselves if we really want to figure it all out. Lol
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point, to move forward here, we need to report where research takes us regardless of the subject matter.  We need to understand the big picture. The good news is that they don't need to hide the big secrets because nobody would believe them anyway. I think we should capitalize on that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember debating in class? The rule was that it didn't matter which side of the argument you were assigned, you argued the facts and everyone knew it had nothing to do with your personal beliefs. I like that approach because it removes the element of ego from the equation. Defend your research, not yourself.

            I agree that pgate has a perception problem even if its had gains in msm (dr phil) but the problem is pgate doesnt have a smoking gun, just much odd circumstantial evidence so its hard for it to gain viral traction. Even then, we will be fighting msm disimformation when we get one.

            Its demotivating when you see nothing happening or no arrests getting made. I have been reading voat when the pizzagate subreddit got killed. Lately you can see it has been taking over by shills shitposting and shitcommenting with conversations that make absolutely no sense. I think its time to start talking to people in the streets.  Maybe wear T-shirts with slogans or sayings, getting a loudspeaker and talking in public/places where you are allowed to speak and debate, and places where lots of people are gathered and will take notice. Post it on youtube. Plan something. Do something. Get people interested and involved. The interest is dying because how much can people read about such a shocking topic? We have to get people interested in it again. We need more people to investigate in real life. Go to these CPS places. Just watch people. Follow them if you can. Learn how they work. These are the people doing the kidnapping and getting paid 6000 bucks for every child. Be stealthy. Bring your video cameras or hidden cameras and gather intel. This is what we need more people doing. What happened to Pegasus? Why has no one gone to investigate?

            we need something big to happen.......... 
it's taking too long.  my mom and sisters don't think it's real anymore because nothing major has happened. :(
they aren't researching it daily like we are so they figure since podesta and alefantis haven't been arrested then it must have all been fake :(
i told them there's soooooo much more than just podesta and alefantis and the clintons.  but they haven't taken the time to look into it for themselves

            i agree.  we are in an echo chamber.  i created a twitter account to spread awareness.  you can reach anyone through twitter.  the retweet is like a gossip line literally.  you can spread spread spread news.  pedophile articles etc.  the biggest misconception i notice on twitter is that clinton supporters think pizzagate is just to damage hillary clinton but it's not.  so i try to get them to consider pizzagate by naming some republicans we think are involved.  i try not to be rude and just ask them to look into it in an effort to save the children.  i've been hashtagging pedogate and savethechildren

            It's a difficult subject to tackle. It's unrealistic to expect large numbers to jump in on this? And then to commit?

            I think that I do not remember as many shills as when we were doing more investigation and research.  Maybe we did not have the time to notice them doing our work, or when we lagged they took over and people got turned off by it and got pulled into fighting them.  I think it is better to down voat if you can and move on.  They want to distract us and take away from the work we were doing.  We need to get back to basics.  Unearthing the nasty heinous deeds that TPTB are and have been committing and just plain ignore them. Giving them attention is their objective and purpose.

            People are losing hope---they see Alex Jones apologizing to Alefantis, they hear "oh a big arrest is coming soon" a few too many times, and they see that lower level pedophiles are being arrested and getting off fairly  easily--. But Voa t serves a very important function nonetheless--it cements the community with an ongoing hope and resolve to get somewhere with this. I too am here mostly as a benefactor of others' hard work and research, but I spread the word on youtube and Facebook groups, provide links and talk to people who are open minded. We are a bit of an echo chamber but remember there is power in numbers. I am very very thankful for all researchers who have the ability to bring fresh perspectives and new information to us who are struggling to find the TRUTH.

            The people that truly need to be convinced are the people that won't ever subscribe here. For a majority of us, our role is not to investigate, it's to illuminate. The fuel for us to continue the process of illumination mostly comes, at least for me, from VOAT :)
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a ton of people who I love here. The courage and bravery to recalibrate your world views based on such evil. The amount of time people have spent here... Even ones I've had tiffs with or hell, even PGisstupid!!! (Obviously not arguing that he benefits the research lol) but he's probably here more often than most of us!! Even if we never added another person to VOAT from here on out, we have enough quality humans to keep the tide of truth rolling. Agents of truth that can go back out into the fucking Twitter trenches and get the job done LETS GO.

             The information and research which comes from here and is collated here, is taken and disseminated all over the Internet. We should be proud. I don't think we need to be larger.  Look at

            I don't understand your point. I AGREE. These psychopaths are raping children and stealing organs. You're preaching to the choir.

            We all know voat is compromised beyond belief and if people want a legitimate investigative tool to share info they're gonna need to go deep. It's like shooting fish in a barrel in here. They like us spinning our wheels. Not to mention hardly anyone knows what voat (or reddit,  or 4chan, etc etc) is.

             It is funny how we sometimes forget that people haven't read what we've read and watched what we're watched.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not compromised beyond belief though??? Perhaps it's misrepresented in post frequency? Not everybody has the time to post and contribute daily, but over the course of few weeks to definitely see a ton of amazing people popping in and out

            agreed the constant infighting, distraction, obvious shills..not so obvious shills.  The 'investigation' died right when they wanted it to.  October 2016. Right after they took out Assange, stopped wikileakes from being a reliable source and turned it into controlled opposition (at best) .   Unfortunately.  We just didn't get the memo.

            This is not surprising when good posts are deleted or buried right away and the so-called mods allow dozens of identical posts which are nonsense to go on and on: such as all the whining about Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich, who are bogus on their best day.
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed so may trolls being the first to comment on any posts that I do not see how anyone can take the "moderation" seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            There also are some  members who have done nothing but downvote people.

             Yes this is absolutely happening, I see this is a major flaw that needs to be addressed here and everywhere on the web. It would be nice if people made sure they down-voted the shrills and trolls when they see them, and truly look hard at the paid ones who are pretending to be us. As far as the moderators deleting posts, i dont know what to do about that, but suggest that they leave it all alone, and let the people feel what is important or not, just leave it alone, stop trying to manipulate everything.

               Just after the Reddit Exodus, I saw quite a few simply asking for upvoates. It seemed to work -- when others saw it, they would join. Eventually, there would be this long list of simple comments asking for upvoates... it was pretty funny. Honestly, I couldn't say if it was a shill brigade just beginning their glorious semi-careers on voat or what but funny nonetheless. Leastways, have an upvoat on me.

            Agree x 1,000,000, but I despise the ending "gate" for any issue, whether it's serious or not.  It started with Watergate and then took on a mind of its own.  I can't even say the name pizzagate out loud because it sounds ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all know that pizzagate is an evil, bottomless pit, and although it is a huge part of the big picture, it's not the whole picture.  We can neither ignore nor forget Assange and Snowden.  The sheer wealth of information they and their anons have thus far provided along with the organization of the files is beyond belief.  Everyhing they have provided to us is the real deal, "straight-from-the-horses-mouth" information.  Every person in this country who has half a working brain needs Wikileaks shoved down their throat.
           </p>

            The entire planet is fucked-up with one debacle leading to another, and we are its ringleader.

             Frankly, I am tired of downvoaters unless it's well-deserved and it's obvious.  Otherwise, you are an asshole.  So, for my downvoated comment that is undeserved, have the balls or your pussy hat on to give  your reason.   I do not expect you to be polite or brave because losers are neither.

            , I will leave your post up ;-) - although mod colleagues might decide to delete it per rule 4. Also, I like the sincerity of your submission. IMHO - and if you are right - developments like these are quite normal. Once the novelty has worn off, only the committed people stay or are attracted. We will not give up the hope that this can and will change, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Another reason - again, if you are right - may be that users on this subverse do not concentrate on the investigation like in the beginning. Many, many posts don't violate the rules, but don't really bring the investigation forward.

              I Agree...not in million years would I have thought that the problem was so orchestrated on a global level, that the normalization of pedophilia in America had been going on for so long, and that it has and is supported by so many in power, regardless of party.  Or that it is part of so many professions which citizens have long trusted: the medical profession, child related protection and support services, charities (especially those), and so forth...(I say law enforcement but many people have had a longstanding distrust, a topic unto it's own).
             </p>
             <p>
              But back to point...the long haul requires a lot more then worrying about the sensualistic headlines to validate the cause, or worrying about so called 'spokespeople' (AJ) selling out, his waffling or drifting wherever legal winds blow...
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's take a moment to foresee the future, given the trajectory of pedo-planned cultural decay, which will happen much quicker without people here on Voat and other groups spreading info via tweets, FB or where ever and to whomever they can.
             </p>
             <p>
              Consider what we have now in the popular culture:  Otherwise quality cable TV series now featuring normalized SM scenes including main characters being urinated on.  Soft porn is very common, dropping in gratuitously within movies or immediately following a movie on some pay channels.  Increased depictions of sexual violence compared to even 10-15 years ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now...knowing what we here on Voat have learned so far, let me give you an example of what I believe the culture will eventually see if people do not persist in protesting the orchestrated normalization of pedophilia:
             </p>
             <p>
              Movies showing baby showers where the adults make jokes about the how much fun it will be to have a 'new baby'.  Maybe baby shower gifts will include the child sexual prep kits that pedos use.
             </p>
             <p>
              Media sitcoms depicting adults with child bride/groom, "oh poor Mr. X, just wait until his wife starts her period! (canned laughter).
             </p>
             <p>
              Kids' Birthday parties with sexualized themes, not just for the adults at the party, but for the kids too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Eventually those who oppose pedophilia will be labeled pedophobic and it will be a hate crime to express opposition to pedophiles' rights to pursue sexual relationships with your kids and grandkids.  It will be child abuse to NOT teach about having sex with adults and other kids, including incest.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is just a drop in the bucket...if people think they can't handle the frustration of slow days on Voat, consider what it will be like when having a forum like Voat/pizzagate is illegal because it 'harms' children's rights to have legal sexual 'relations' with adults, and perhaps even to have rights as 'sex workers'.
