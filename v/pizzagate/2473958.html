<p>A long story short:</p>
<p>A woman went missing in the Netherlands, she unfortunately was found dead later. During her disappearance, the Twitter account <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a> sent a tweet to the police with &quot;a tip&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tgDYjtpjP74dtnPkCn2N-A.jpeg">Coded tip</a></p>
<p>This was a code which was sent to the police. Someone decoded this with rot13 and found out that the tweet said: Hier is een tip, Dutch for “Here is a tip”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a> account later disappeared. It had tweets which linked it to <a href="blackdog808292">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCOvh9nqk0_eEmiy8Fb_eRSg</a> on YouTube and <a href="https://voat.co/user/808292bd">@808292bd</a> on Twitter. It also had links to <a href="zeaux_cxt">https://www.twitter.com/ZEAUX_CXT</a> on Twitter, the codes of ZEAUX_CXT ment to put awareness on Elsagate, were supposedly used by copycat accounts like blackdog808292 and <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a>.</p>
<p>We don\'t know yet where Michael P. hid the body first, so we can\'t say with certitude that he was wrong about the location which he mentioned.</p>
<p>InvestigatingYoutube was contacted about this, as <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a> supposedly was part of it, but he was taken out of InvestigatingYoutube after this incident. According to PK17, ZEAUX_CXT, <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a> stepped forward to the police and admitted his mistake, but even InvestigatingYoutube doesn\'t know what happened with <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a> afterwards so it\'s strange that he has this knowledge as it isn\'t known anywhere if he even admitted his mistake.</p>
<p>The codes of ZEAUX_CXT were used by <a href="https://www.bxtimes.com/stories/2018/7/08-torobomb-2018-02-23-bx.html">two bombmakers from the Bronx too</a>, so these codes have been used in two criminal cases now. The question is why <a href="https://voat.co/user/9_3x09">@9_3x09</a> did this, because for just a troll it\'s strange how these accounts seem linked, like the Mahomet Dogar account on Facebook which turns out to be related to Blackdog808292.</p>
<p>Does anyone see or find more things in this code network? It seems like it is more extensive then the original PK17 ARG by St. Äma.</p>',
