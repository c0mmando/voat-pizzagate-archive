<p>So thanks to user SethRich2017, I am beginning to see a whole lot deeper into River Phoenix\'s death.

<p>So now we have at least 2 or 3 big names in Hollywood who are saying that they think it was foul play.  Could it be that River got to close to exposing elite pedophile rings, and they killed him for it?</p>',

            Just as a reminder, in the cult that River's parents belonged to, partner swapping was commonplace, children were encouraged to be in the same bed as the parents during sex and children were initiated into sexual practices at age FOUR.

            I know this post pertains to River, but Joaquin ? I wonder were he falls into all of this? ... or any of the River children...

           <p>
            Side note:
After a google image search of the two brothers I see absolutely zero facial features that would lead me to believe they are even full siblings. Could it be they have different fathers? If promiscuity was promoted amongst their family values it could be so... far fetched maybe. I just seem to question anything I'm familiar with, like having half siblings.

             Thank you. ALWAYS thought this too! Absolutely ZERO resemblance. But they WERE close though. Joaquin was the one who placed the 911 call from outside the Viper Room. Poor kid.

             ya know, I've always thought Joaquin and River looked NOTHING alike!  I'll have to re-look at pics of his sisters, I believe their names are Rainbow, Summer and Liberty.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can say River and Joaquin are both phenomenal actors.

               wow... do you know if River's hair is naturally blonde/light brown, or if he dyed it? So far from pictures I can see that Rainbow and Joaquin definitely look a lot alike.   Added:  Ok, Liberty, Rainbow and Joaquin definitely look very alike; the youngest girl Summer, perhaps looks the most like River, or the least dissimilar from River. Added:  ok now I'm looking at pics of Summer as an adult, and I'm thinking she looks like Joaquin, Rain, and Liberty a lot, but not like River.  It seems perhaps River resembles his mom and the others resemble the dad.

             You're right, there are two cults called The Family.  From my knowledge, the one that had ties to the White House was NOT the one River was part of (i.e. Children of God/ The Family/ The Family International.)  I'm pretty sure The Family with ties to the WH was the one where all the kids had that weird haircut and dyed blonde hair....  Thanks for sharing the link

              Actually, that makes THREE totally different cults that we know of calling themselves The Family. The blonde kids are Australian, and brought forth Assange:

               https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/d757dy/a-look-inside-australias-most-notorious-cult-the-family
              </a>
              The one in WDC I mentioned above also calls itself The Fellowship, and it's really more about think-tank, espionage, spook-type government influence stuff. But it only makes sense that such a seminal concept as "family" would be repurposed by more than one dishonest con artist. Similar to the situation with "satanic" cults... NOT a hierarchical organization all connected to one dogma. The idea of The Opposite of God is free for interpretation by all. And is very attractive to con persons seeking to present a structure that can be used to sanction their deviant behavior and attract victims and co-conspirators.

                And let's not forget our other very famous Family. We don't think of "organized crime" as a "cult" but they do share certain important characteristics, especially when it comes to using the concept of "family" to make its members forgo their own real natural families in favor of an enforced alliance with this criminal gang that dominates and exploits its own members.

            There was always something close to the truth about his performance and story line in My Own Private Idaho. There was one scene where it didn't feel like he was acting that was his life.

             I will have to rewatch it-- haven't seen it since the early 90's.  What about the character do you think is similar to River?  I think I remember the main characters were gay.

              I checked and the scene I am referring to is the camp fire scene which he actually wrote himself.
So thats the scene I remember where he appears to be being himself rather than acting.

            Poor River. He was forced to have sex with other children when he was four.  When questioned by an interviewer, River called it 'making love with other children'.  That to me showed that he was still in denial about the abuse he was subjected to; he still hadn't come to terms with it.  When someone pushes the abuse underground, as River did, it still bubbles up and often the person--in an attempt to keep it underground--gets involved in alcohol and drugs.   He had started to speak up about his experiences.  Perhaps that lead to his death; I don't know.

             That caused a massive upheaval when ZG got outted..  Devastated the spiritual truther community he had built up online.  I read everything I could about him at that time.  He disappeared from the internet briefly, but then someone tried to post a link to his new site in here, and I had to set them straight in his history.

              thats the problem. New agers have been tricked into worshipping the devil. His audience was full of New Ager type folks who believe in crystal vibrations and chakras.

               I can see why you'd say that.  After watching Tara Brach appear on Katy Perry show, I think they are trying to co-opt and corrupt the American Buddhists.

                      CIA engineered the counterculture and promoted eastern mysticism/psychedelic drugs. It was a giant psyop on the masses and ultimately lead to todays degeneracy.

                       Eastern philosophy and mysticism is fantastic if you get your info from primary sources and actual people, but yeah, the counter cultural revolution was quickly hijacked by the CIA and made to lay the groundwork for paperclip inspired mass degeneracy. Its all been a setup to prepare society to accept the crimes of the elite cult.

            If you search Voat you will find exhaustive links that will lead you directly to these facts including the details of his death at "the Viper" room owned by Johnny Depp who was present.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also direct links to "The Family/Children of God cult" visiting the Bill Clinton Whitehouse for 7 years straight from 1993 to 2000. I posted a letter that was written to President Clinto and Hilary Clinton at that time posted in an open forum imploring them to stop inviting them to the Whitehouse detailing the horrific pedophelia and incest with adults and very young children.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mentioned this was well known at the time and this cult was part of CIA intelligence operations. You are going to discover very soon so is the FLDS. The Clinton's knew this of course and the US government still allows and operates it. River tried to tell his story. If you listen to Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood interviews talking about the pedophile control of Hollywood you will hear them both say "there are Vipers" everywhere. There is a reason for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also numerous threads on Johnny Depp and his involvment in Satanism and pedophelia. His relationship with Hunter Thompson should send chills down everyone's spine. Hunter snuffed (killed) a young boy in front of victim Paul Bonnaci of Franklin Cover Up at the Bohemium Grove and teased openly about hunting children for sport.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next check Johnny's defense of the West Memphis Three. Some people have tried to defend them but if you study actual case history including crime scene forensics, and Damien Echols own writings where he pays omade to Aleister Crowley and numerous other older teens admitted to being involved in the santanic frantic sex rituals they just did not go as far as child sacrifice. Study heard it is all on Voat. It woould be nice to be organized.

             Makes you wonder about Waco too, seems like a similar pedo cult to FLDS &amp; CoG... what did they do to piss off that dyke Janet Reno to make her burn them alive??

              ever seen the documentary "Waco, Rules of Engagement"?  The official story is total b.s.  You're right that they burned them alive and that child sexual abuse was going on

              ugh the practices of Warren Jeffs and the FLDS are truly chilling. Audio recordings of ritual child rape were presented in evidence. Even more chilling?-The M church is founded on these sex ceremonies -though most members don't know it- which is the reason they were so vehemently hated and persecuted through their early history. Though they have tried to mainstream quickly and have changed most of the original rituals, there was still naked touching in temple ceremonies as recently as the late eighties, maybe even later. No one prepares you for the true details of these rituals, you show up and it happens. So members that have not gone through this level of ceremony don't even know it exists and will deny it.
             </p>
             <p>
              but my point is..cia yes, but really this is another good example of proof that it's the CIA that is involved in a MUCH older 'conspiracy.' Check out the churches founder's relationship to masons, magik, and lucifer worship. The M church has always been a satanic mirror. It's hidden in plain site.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't say the M word unless you want to invite a shill. They offer returned missionaries shill positions to "continue their service in church PR" haha.

               I'm fairly certain that the sexual abuse you said was going on in the 80's in the mormon church was not ubiquitous.  I had two Mormon friends when I was in high school back in the 80s and they were part of a great family and I actually went to a number of church events with them.  I AM NOT DEFENDING THE RELIGION, I'm simply saying that not all Mormons (not talking about FLDS) were being sexually abused in church in the 80's.  Warren Jeffs is a monster. I totally agree about the CIA

                I'm not talking about one off sexual abuse. I am talking about specific rituals all mormons go through as a coming of age ceremony in temples. This is well documented church sanctioned ritual. It still exists today but without naked touching. Any temple married mormon or missionary has gone through it- NO JOKE.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your high school friends would not have gone through that ceremony yet. Most mormons I know are good people who give more time and intention to their families than almost anyone I know. They are obedient to the church- including the requirement that they never speak of these rituals - even to eachother. Many are secretly traumatized by them even today so much so the church has a real problem with temple attendance.

                 thanks, I'm glad to hear your non-bigoted opinion- seriously.  the couple of Mormon people I've known have been some of the most giving and caring people I have ever met.  There are also some who grow up into it and it's their culture and their family but they are actively trying to change things.
                </p>
                <p>
                 on another note: there was also a big SRA scandal in the Mormon church that is hardly talked about
                </p>
                <p>
                 also, you say the marriage ceremony does not consist of naked touching... what does this ritual actually consist of?

                  you can look up the endowment ceremony history, originallly done naked, in the eighties it used to consist of a kind of apron that was open on both sides that the temple workers would reach through for naked touching. I understand touching is done in the air above areas now lol. merely suggestive of touching.

                    seventh generation mormon. I really disagree with the relgion, but they are still my people. I'm always up for defending the good in them. You'll find more exmos who are than aren't, it's just the internet that makes it seem so contentious.

                   and for sure. no need to be bigoted. I have a ton of respect for mormons.  they are a million times better than their leaders in my book. I worry about how ostracizing the world is and only hope for a safe landing pad for those that escape. It's a more harsh break than most people realize.

            Thanks for looking into this.  I was a big fan of River Phoenix, too, and only had time to take a cursory glance at the other day's posting.  In any case, I am reminded of Natalie Merchant's song about his death.  Here are the lyrics:
           </p>
           <p>
            "River"
           </p>
           <p>
            Young &amp; strong Hollywood son
In the early morning light
This star fell down
On Sunset Boulevard
           </p>
           <p>
            Young &amp; strong beautiful one
One that we embraced so close
Is gone
Was torn away
           </p>
           <p>
            Let the youth of America mourn
Include him in their prayers
Let his image linger on
Repeat it everywhere
           </p>
           <p>
            With candles with flowers
He was one of ours
One of ours
           </p>
           <p>
            Why don't you let him be? 
He's gone
We know
Give his mother &amp; father peace
Your vulture's candor
Your casual slander
Will murder his memory
He's gone
We know
And it's nothing but a tragedy
           </p>
           <p>
            Lay to rest your soul and body
Lay beside your name
Lay to rest your rage
Your hunger and amazing grace
           </p>
           <p>
            With candles, with flowers
You were one of ours
One of ours
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw cameras expose your life
I heard rumors explode with lies
I saw children with tears
Cry and crowd around the sight
Of where you had collapsed that day
Where your last breath &amp; word
Had been sighed
Where your heart had burst
Where you had died
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw how they were lost in grieving
All half-believing you were gone
The loss and pain of it
Crime and the shame of it
You were gone
It was such a nightmare raving, 
"how could we save him
From himself?"

            Mega-creepy that they call themselves "The Family." That's how the Luciferian groups refer to themselves too. Remember Lynn Rothschild dissing Podesta in that Tweet for messing up their "family"?
