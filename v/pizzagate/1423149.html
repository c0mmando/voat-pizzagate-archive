            Opinion: maybe the tunnels were uses as didn't someone complain about the screaming or noise from them?

            Here is what I could find on pizzagate and tunnels.

             I wasn't sure what to think of that video. I had seen the clip but, I was unsure whether it was something worth looking into. Possibly a red herring. Looking at maps of the area, possibly city maps, or records of underground construction, and sewer maps may give a better picture of any secret area. Besides actually raiding the storefront and thoroughly checking for secret room this seems pointless to pursue as it's too difficult to verify without boots on the groud.

            These people have money, they land on private airports in private jets with hired pilots, hired muscle and hired guns. Yo. can't compare a coyote smuggling immigrants across the border to this! Pizzagate is far more terrifying and probably well financed
