<blockquote>
<p>The mysterious murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich just got a lot more mysterious with the release of a new report that utterly debunks the official version of how the man died last summer.</p>
<p>According to a new investigative study released Tuesday, Rich may have been killed by a hired killer or serial killer. It took a group of volunteer students and graduates from George Washington University to dig into this unsolved case, despite unanswered petitions asking the government to appoint a special investigation into Rich’s murder.  These forensic-psychology students and instructors made up the group known as The Profiling Project. </p>
<p>“Seth’s death does not appear to be a random homicide,” the report stated in its summary of findings. Contrary to the police reports claiming that Rich’s death was a robbery gone awry, the report stated that “Seth’s death does not appear to be a robbery gone bad” and was “more likely committed by a hired killer or serial murderer.”</p>
<p>As others have noted, most robberies don’t end in murder and most robberies do end with stolen goods. Rich still had all his valuables on his person.</p>
<p>The Arlington, Virginia based Profiling Project said the “offender brought a most likely unregistered firearm to the crime-scene, utilized the firearm and most likely carried the firearm away from the crime-scene with them post-commission.” The report characterizes this as “bold behavior in D.C., which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country.”</p>
<p>The facts of the case as studied by the volunteers points to a killer who was well aware of these laws, and was comfortable in breaking them. The killer was able to successfully elude police after the deed, “Indicating (the) offender had either previously killed, or a significant amount of preparation had gone into planning for this kill,” the report found. </p>
<p>Additionally, like a scene out of ABC’s “Scandal,” “The crime-scene appeared to be almost sanitized … No firearms casings were reported to be found, no physical evidence was reported.” They concluded the killer did “not appear to be psychotic,” but rather methodical in the execution of the crime and in fleeing and remaining unidentified by law enforcement officials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this applies to Pizzagate, because Seth Rich is thought to be the one that leaked to Wikileaks. Because of that, it lead us to discovering Pizzagate/pedogate. Bringing down his killers is our goal, and could expose many more revelations.</p>',

            I read the whole PP report yesterday and their conclusions were on point and well based. Yet they had no more access than we did here on Voat.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained other than to maybe cause more public scrutiny.  Which until someone from the Rich family accesses the DC, Hospital report( including any labs, x-rays, Dr. &amp; Nurse notes) and the Coroner's Report all we have is assumptions that are nothing burgers...

           <p>
            However,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the report deems it not likely that the Russians did it or that Rich was killed for allegedly being a leak to WikiLeaks (for which there is no evidence)
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , unless evidence is produced that a toxin was used in the death (none has been; police say Rich was shot). Rich, who was shot in the back, did not die at the scene, the report says, and did not even realize he had been shot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rich was shot and killed on July 10, 2016 at about 4:19 a.m. in the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW in Washington DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            The team’s central findings:
•	Seth’s death does not appear to be a random homicide. 
•	Seth’s death does not appear to be a robbery gone bad. 
•
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Seth’s death was more likely committed by a hired killer or serial murderer.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            LMAO!
•	There may be additional video surveillance of the crime and crime scene. 
•	The resolution of prosecuting the individual(s) responsible appears to be hindered both actively and passively. 
•	Seth’s killer(s) most likely remains free with in the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, **
            <strong>
             although the report says in the opening that its authors believe the murder was “more likely committed by a hired killer,”
             <strong>
              in other places they say that a professional killer would not have been likely to leave Rich alive
             </strong>
             , as he did not die at the scene, rendering that theory less likely.
            </strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            They NEVER reveal WHICH evidence they had access to and reviewed. That is a HUGE red flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until there is a DEATH CERTIFICATE and an AUTOPSY REPORT, Seth Rich is NOT DEAD.

            Good post, Srayzie.  ^
           </p>
           <p>
            “It took a group of volunteer students and graduates from George Washington University to dig into this unsolved case.... These forensic-psychology students and instructors made up the group known as The Profiling Project.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The wording suggests that they just all spontaneously got together and started digging into it.  Not so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jack Burkman, a Republican, contributed office space to the Project.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Heavy.com (link below)
           </p>
           <p>
            Burkman has made controversial statements on the case before.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I was approached by a guy who styles himself as a former U.S. intel officer,” Burkman said to the television station. “I quizzed him. I think he’s credible – you never know the motive of people. But what he said is basically this – that Seth discovered that the Russians had been hacking and therefore the Russian government did away with Seth.”
            <strong>
             <strong>
              There is no evidence to back this up,
             </strong>
            </strong>
            and Rich’s family has repeatedly decried conspiracy theories into their son’s death.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Burkman has contributed more than $100,000 to a reward fund in Rich’s case.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The team describes itself as an “all-volunteer group of current and former George Washington University forensic psychology graduate students and instructors.”
