<p>THIS RELATES TO PIZZAGATE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE PODESTA BELONG TO AN ELITE CLASS (THE CABAL) WHICH PRACTICE CANNIBALISM AND THAT AUTHORS HAVE BEEN WRITING BETWEEN THE LINES ABOUT THEM SINCE FOREVER AND THAT THEY ARE NOT AN ISOLATED GROUP OF A PEOPLE BUT HIDDEN SOCIAL CLASS AMONG THE ELITE.

<p>The story is very short and i stress everybody should read it. There is a real reason why this story exists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lu-xun/1918/04/x01.htm">https://www.marxists.org/archive/lu-xun/1918/04/x01.htm</a></p>
<p>According to wikipedia A Madman\'s Diary is a short story published in 1918 by Lu Xun, a Chinese writer. It was the first and most influential modern work written in vernacular Chinese in the republican era, and would become a cornerstone piece of the New Culture Movement. It is placed first in Call to Arms, a collection of short stories by Lu Xun. The story was often referred to as &quot;China\'s first modern short story&quot;.[1] This book was selected as one of the 100 best books in history by the Bokklubben World Library.</p>
<p>The story is the diary of man who finds out his own whole village is populated by CANNIBALS and he is being stigmatized as paranoid or crazy by them. Take note that it is explained in the preface that the character has recovered from his craziness and has gone elswhere to take an official post. So, strangely the paranoid man, was promoted to a job right after his paranoid episode?</p>
<p>I believe that there is a hidden message inside this story. The author is urging us to read between the lines much like the main character.</p>
<p>I read intently half the night, until I began to see words between the lines, the whole book being filled with the two words—&quot;Eat people.</p>
<p>In the story, the main character little sister was killed to be eaten to aid his mother sickness.</p>
<p>Take a look at this. Exactly what they do to us everytime. They label us as crazy or conspiracy theorists. Remember yesterday Podesta\'s &quot;pizza gate crazies&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;Then I realized part of their cunning. They would never be willing to change their stand, and their plans were all laid; they had stigmatized me as a madman. In future when I was eaten, not only would there be no trouble, but people would probably be grateful to them. When our tenant spoke of the villagers eating a bad character, it was exactly the same device. This is their old trick&quot;</p>
<p>Take a look at this dialogue. It speaks about secrecy as a main directive in (((them))). In the story it states they have been doing this for 4,000 years.</p>
<p>What am I talking about? They are eating men now in Wolf Cub Village, and you can see it written all over the books, in fresh red ink. **His expression changed, and he grew ghastly pale. &quot;It may be so,&quot; he said, staring at me. &quot;It has always been like that. . . **</p>
<p>&quot;Is it right because it has always been like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I refuse to discuss these things with you. Anyway, you shouldn\'t talk about it. Whoever talks about it is in the wrong!*</p>
<p>And then it continues to state how they are taught from a very young age to cannibalism &quot;He was much younger than my elder brother, but even so he was in it. He must have been taught by his parents. And I am afraid he has already taught his son: that is why even the children look at me so fiercely.&quot;</p>
<p>A portent of the future.Take note that the village where they live is called Wolf Cub Village.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don\'t change, you may all be eaten by each other. Although so many are born, they will be wiped out by the real men, just like wolves killed by hunters. Just like reptiles!..You should change at once, change from the bottom of your hearts! You must know that in future there will be no place for man-eaters in the world . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The last line of the story will send shivers to each of us in this forum. This is why we must persist in our cause.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are still children who have not eaten men? Save the children. . . .</p>
<p>I have found that both history and literature is full of references both to (((them))) and to their practices. I have also found that there is always an intention to keep the truth hidden &quot;between the lines&quot; in these texts. As if it was only right to expose the truth to some selected few. I have not only seen this done by (((them))) but also by writers which i deem good guys so i can only presume there is a good reason to share this knowledge to the common public.</p>
<p>I have even seen this bluntly written in the Dead Sea Scrolls. At this moment i am bit agitated by so much information but i am willing to share some of my findings if there is any interest. I feel that giving everything away might be counterproductive at the moment. I ask everyone to please share this story and relate it to Pizzagate and the cannibal pedo elite.</p>
<p>As a sidenote Lu Xun was born in the elite and attended Western education. AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN WIKIPEDIA Imagine an iron house: without windows or doors, utterly indestructible, and full of sound sleepers – all about to suffocate to death. Let them die in their sleep, and they will feel nothing. Is it right to cry out, to rouse the light sleepers among them, causing them inconsolable agony before they die?&quot; Qian replied that it was, because if the sleepers were awoken, &quot;there was still hope – hope that the iron house may one day be destroyed&quot;. Shortly afterwards, in 1918 Lu wrote the first short story published in his name, Diary of a Madman, for the magazine.</p>',

             I was the original creator of that post. Glad to see someone reposted it, they deleted several times.
As stated several times, this has been going on since Ancient Egypt times and i can elaborate a lot over that.

              Its been going on a lot longer than Egypt. Also, as recently as the 16 and 1700's when people went to public hangings (((some people))) would go to the hanging with cups or bowls. As soon as the hangman cut the body down they would pay the hangman to cut the body and drain the blood so they could drink it. This is not fantasy. Look it up. The info is out there.

            The battle between good and evil has been raging forever. People have been writing about it for centuries but it seems every generation discovers the open secret too late to do something about it. Never ending circle of events.

             Its the most important short story in modern chinese literature. It is impossible to deleted it from the web. They are saying it is a social critic but i insist that even the title of the short story speaks about what has been hidden from us while (((they))) label those who want to speak out as "madmen"

              No problem. I reported the post as SPAM. Should get whacked in a bit.  The reason we archive links is to avoid sending commercial-value traffic to sites like marxists-dot-org that they can generate revenue from.  You want to support marxists-dot-org???

               yeah i think you are either missing the importance or deliberately pointing towards somewhere else. I doubt 10$ in their pockets will change anything at all. 
You should provide a better link to read the texts if you are really proactive instead of destructive.
