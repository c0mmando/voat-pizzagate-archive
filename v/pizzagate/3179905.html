<p>Ok, moving on.... here is an article from 1999 about Steve Danzig helping his daughter-in-law to set up her diaper business : <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/17250">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/17250</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spokane, Washington, inventor sketched her concept on paper, produced a prototype, enlisted the help of an invention marketing specialist, and ended up licensing her idea to Kalencom Corp., a New Orleans company that sells baby accessories. In late October 1998, Kalencom introduced Quinn\'s product with much fanfare at the Juvenile Manufacturers Product Association convention in Dallas. </p>
<p>... Quinn began by brainstorming the idea with her husband, Robie, and her stepfather-in-law, Steve Danzig, the president of Juvenile Products Development, a Spokane, Washington, firm that specializes in licensing ideas to manufacturers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever heard of Kalencom?  Well, they are quite interesting..CEO is Monica Kalozdi <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working/2015/04/monica_and_kicker_kalozdi_talk_about_running_a_family_business.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working/2015/04/monica_and_kicker_kalozdi_talk_about_running_a_family_business.html</a> </p>

<p>Right next to that is Cheeky Chompers, a baby products company:</p>

<p>The business, whose founders Julie Wilson and Amy Livingstone set up the business after meeting at antenatal class, secured the accolade for their efforts in international trade. <strong>It comes after the company launched its products in China in recent months, with the business now exporting to 36 countries. Export sales account for 70 per cent of turnover, led by the US, China and Taiwan as its biggest markets.</strong> </p>

<p>Obviously, there is much more to look into and at the moment I\'m all out of time.  Posting for other researchers to take a look into this....</p>',

            By Daisy Luther
If you had a business selling something that made you well over a hundred billion dollars per year, would you take steps to eradicate the need for your business? Or would you make every effort for that money continue rolling in?
           </p>
           <p>
            Take cancer, for example.  Don’t let all the media hype about “The Cure” fool you.  No one who is in a position to do so wants to end cancer because they are all making a killing on the big business of treatment, while ordinary people go broke, suffer horribly, and die.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will never be a “cure” brought to market because there just isn’t enough profit in eradicating the disease entirely.  There will never be a governing body that protects consumers from being subjected to known carcinogens, because that too, will stop the cash from rolling in. A great deal of research is covered up and many potential cures are ignored and discredited because there is far more money in perpetuating illness than in curing it. In 2012, the reported spending on cancer treatment was 124.6 billion dollars.  Blood money.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Grim Statistics
Just the word “cancer” sends a frisson of fear down the spine of the most stalwart optimist.  Terrifyingly, almost one in two people will get the dreaded disease, and the numbers are only getting worse.  Here are some quick stats for background:
           </p>
           <p>
            Nearly 40% of all Americans will develop cancer in their lifetime. (source)
Over half a million people in America died of cancer in 2012. (source)
In 2011, cancer was the #1 cause of death in the Western world, and #2 in developing countries. (source)
Cancer is the #1 cause of childhood death in the United States. (source)
This is a fairly recent increase.  A hundred years ago, the number was far different.  At that time, 1 in 33 people was stricken with the disease. And despite billions of dollars being spent to find “the cure”, the World Health Organization predicts that deaths from cancer will DOUBLE by the year 2030.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s being normalized.  The news is full of photos of babies who are missing an eye, of beautiful bald children who have lost their hair to chemo, and of people who have had to have body parts removed in order to survive a few more years.  But cancer is NOT normal. It isn’t something that “just happens”.  Researchers know the things that cause cancer.  Government protection agencies do too, but they do nothing to limit these toxins in the marketplace.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because, cancer is big business and those who are profiting have great financial interest in seeing the deadly trend continue to increase.
           </p>
           <p>
            Poisoned for Profit
So what has changed?  How did we go from a  3% chance of contracting cancer to a 41% chance?
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s the advent of Big Pharma, Big Agri, and Big Business.  They are getting rich off of poisoning Americans through the manufacture of toxic elements that we are exposed to on a daily basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless you live in a bubble and have no contact with manufactured items, outside air, or the sun, you are exposed to a staggering number of known and suspected carcinogens every day. (Check out THIS LIST to see the known and suspected carcinogens that are readily available in the United States.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The statistics support that the cumulative build-up of all these different toxins in the human body eventually results in cancer in many people.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, the manufacturers and the “food” producers profit when we buy their poisoned goods.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the medical system and pharmaceutical companies profit when we become ill and must fight cancer.

              has been posting about connecting names, I wondered if they are inserting hints in different places. Using them over and over and then putting them out there as a joke of some kind. You know, having a laugh on us because they can get away with it. That would be cruel, which is exactly what they are. It has been at the back of my mind a couple of times. Don't know if that is the case, but it is haunting me. Kind of like the criminal leaving his mark.

              In the books written by Cathy O'Brian and Brice Taylor , the NFL is mentioned as being very corrupt. And have read from this website how there is more child sex trafficking during the big games. For several years, the NFL play off half times were so satanic it was mind blowing ......usual suspects performing...katy perry and madonna.Also ley lines are very important...they are to the earth what our chakra system is...basis for acupuncture I think. When these ley lines cross, there is great power on the location. These locations have catholic cathedrals on them often, military bases....ie Minot ND, nukes. ..Thomas Jefferson's house was built on one.... Dr. Joseph Ferrell (you tube) says design of cathedral types of music like Bach played on organs effects a bigger area. Surprised that our ancestors knew these things and we don't hear of it?....
says that the organ music in cathedrals, rectangular shapes  and type of music played affects larger regions. (wish this website would place comments in the order that they are placed...for continuity and understanding.)

             Just went over the blog.  Interesting take on the court case.  I have to say that I am developing a different view on it, given the stuff that I'm digging up here.  Check out this link :
             <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/global-technologies-inc/">
              https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/global-technologies-inc/
             </a>
             Those men were all working with Raniere.  I believe that his girlfriend was used as CEO of Global Technologies so that they could distance him from the government connections.  Either blackmail was involved or they were working with various agencies.  The narrative that he was an ego-maniac acting on his own is Standard 101 intelligence tactics to deflect the public from the truth.  Look at the various locations of the company.. it was still operating at least until he was arrested.  The patents he submitted were developments on the others. They simply took turns in submitting new ones every year or so.  Look again. This rabbit hole is very very deep.  We must not look away now.

              OK. I believe you. I just couldn't find a lot when I went looking into GTI.  What I got was a lot of other companies called Global Tech Cosmetics etc. etc.  that were unrelated.

              I think you are right he/they may be working with intel agencies to do all that hacking.

                (David Hawkins) is chasing patents in particular split tunneling. This patent thing tied to Keith Rainer is totally out in left field. Dude doesn't have any tech background what so ever. Anybody associated with him on any level is suspect to include the the patentees list on the invention. (former patent agent here...so I know something about patents).

                 Raniere is a H.S. drop-out...he couldn't contribute a shred of technical capability in the development of a patent within 379/Telephonic Communications. He was (allegedly) backstopped by Bronfmans (anybody what to read a detailed exposition on drugs, liquor, and other criminality start here:

               OK, but tell me why you front-holes, as anonymous posters, care more about cordiality and smiley faces than basic delineations that establish your position re: the sub itself.

               You realize that in the press, where 90% of normies get informed, #pizzagate is now an afterthought of JewAnon, a future historical footnote about a "right wing fake news conspiracy epidemic" EXACTLY like they have rewritten the Joe McCarthy saga (who was of course hunting Jewish communist spies and was vindicated with the release of the Venona project
               <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project">

              </p>
              <p>
               I mean at this point it's flat-out irresponsible for pizzagaters to not be using Jewish networks (some 7,000 organizations in the US alone) for research.
