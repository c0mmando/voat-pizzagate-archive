<blockquote>
<p>Sept. 16 (UPI) -- A federal judge in Florida ruled Monday that a non-prosecution agreement for Jeffrey Epstein must be kept secret due to the financier\'s death last month.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra said he can\'t reveal the details of the secret agreement in which the 66-year-old was allowed to plead guilty to lesser state charges to avoid serious federal sex crimes charges. His victims sued, saying that under the Crime Victims\' Rights Act, prosecutors should have notified them in 2007 that Epstein would not face federal charges.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of Mr. Epstein\'s death, there can be no criminal prosecution against him and the Court cannot consider granting this relief to the victims,&quot; Marra wrote.</p>
<p>Instead of federal charges, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence in prison work-release.</p>
<p>Epstein died Aug. 10 in his Manhattan Correctional Center cell in what authorities believe was a suicide. He was arrested in July for separate charges.</p>
<p>The non-prosecution agreement also gave immunity to other people who allegedly helped Epstein recruit dozens of teens for sex. <strong>Marra\'s ruling means the victims won\'t receive monetary damages.</strong></p>
<p>The judge urged the victims to &quot;take solace&quot; in the fact that their lawsuit brought attention to the Crime Victims\' Rights Act and the Justice Department\'s mishandling of the case. He said their case also played a role in another investigation that led to Epstein\'s arrest in July.</p>
<p>The attorneys who represented some of the victims issued a statement to WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach, Fla., that their clients should be &quot;proud&quot; of their efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;As Judge Marra alluded to in his Order, this case undoubtedly elevated public awareness of Mr. Epstein\'s crimes and played a vital role in his eventual arrest in New York,&quot; Brad Edwarda and Paul Cassell\'s statement read.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, this is not the ending we had hoped for, but the enormous progression of victims\' rights through this case will ensure that violations like this never happen again in this country.&quot;</p>
<p>Epstein was arrested in July as part of a joint New York City Police Department-FBI investigation and he was charged with one count each of sex trafficking and conspiracy. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>The millionaire financier, who was forced to register as a sex offender in Florida for the 2008 conviction, was accused of giving girls &quot;hundreds of dollars in cash&quot; to engage in sexual acts at his mansions in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., and sometimes paid victims to recruit other victims. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said the reported incidents occurred between 2002 and 2005.</p>

            "Enormous progress", huh? Like, say, progress in the elites finding more ways to better keep their sickness secret? More progress in finding new ways to misuse the just us system for their own benefit?
           </p>
           <p>
            How can anyone still have faith or respect for our legal systems when this kind of shit is all over the news, exposed damn near daily, and it's always a bunch of nothing that happens.

            The reason why the victims weren't granted compensation was that the judge ruled that the federal prosecutors hadn't acted in bad faith....but denying justice to the victims (which was ruled to be illegal) because the perp was an intelligence asset

             Totally agree. It can't be allowed to end with a lie as big and bold as that one. Somebody has the blackmail files and is using them. Someone else has a new job to take Epstein's place in the cabal. The devil hasn't been stopped yet. You can bet on that.

             COME ON! Don’t be so dense and use some logic and common sense here! Just think about it. We are talking about the absolute most heinous, most godawful, most unimaginable crimes being committed that’s physically possible. Crimes that are physically impossible to turn a blind eye to, to ignore, to cover up or do nothing about no matter who it is, how close of a relationship, or how much money they offer in return. So when it’s so massively widespread that the most respected, influential and powerful people in the world such as United States  presidents, secretary of states, chiefs of staff, attorney generals, pentagon, senators, congressmen, governors, bankers, celebrity’s, movie stars, musicians, prominent businessmen, and media journalist/outlets are themselves the ones committing these crimes so openly that anyone random joe blow with just a internet connection has access to enough evidence of these crimes they are with out a shadow of a doubt are guilty of committing. For a massive system so Impossibly corrupt for something like this, it has been corrupt for decades or more likely even over a century or more for it to be physically possible to sustain itself long enough to get to this point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump has been in office for just 3 years. He has a hundred years of corruption, propaganda, and brainwashing that has launched an all out war trying overthrow and or imprison him that he has to very carefully, strategically, and covertly disable step by step. You don’t think if he went scorched earth out the gate they wouldn’t killed him like the handful of other presidents, the thousands of American citizens, or the millions of people around the world who stood in their way?

             Trump and his administration has gotten to a point, where THEY WERE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE, INDICT, APPREHEND, AND TAKE FUCKING EPSTEIN DOWN!! Epstein!! FUCKING EPSTEIN! The top of the top, the untouchable of the most untouchable, the one who turns people into puppets and his puppets into United States presidents, the most powerful of the most powerful, JEFFRY FUCKING EPSTEIN!
            </p>
            <p>
             95% of America and the rest of the western worlds citizens are far too blue pilled to be able to accept just 2% of pizzagate being true and what that would mean. Getting Epstein associates first is the worst thing he could do as that would be a blind population the media would turn on him for being an out of control totalitarian dictator arresting beloved &amp; respected politicians and anyone else who opposed him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Arresting Epstein who publicly has very very strong connections to presidents, royalty, CEOs, and worlds elite for a massive child sex slave and sex slave trafficking operation in which made hime a billionaire. Opened a lot of peoples eyes up making them think “oh fuck”. The fact the most high profile well connected billionaire prisoner in modern history was murdered while on suicide watch proved not only was he indeed a billionaire child sex trafficker but even as someone as powerful as a billionaire who was just arrested had so many people so unimaginably powerful in the government who were so scared of him that they were able to do the impossible by having him murdered while on suicide watch in the most secured high security facility in New York City. That opened the minds of the masses who just had their eyes opened, that makes any Epstein related indictments and arrests seem only logical and justified regardless of how powerful they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barr who if is he was swamp, would have never in a trillion years touched Epstein, has stated that without a fraction of a doubt the death of Epstein has no effect on the case and every single co-conspirator/associate/facilitator/customer will be charged, prosecuted and justice for what they did.
            </p>
            <p>
             The absolute best thing for the pedophile cabal was the judge releasing those names to the public. Remember there’s a reason why 100% of federal investigations are classified. Had that list been released every name on their would have legal proof they never did anything wrong and obviously had no idea Epstein was engaged in such activities, and the media would have made that 100% and any attempts to touch them an illegal political persecution by dictator trump imprisoning people he doesn’t like. Now the first the world hears about their connection to Epstein will be them being arrested for a specific child sex or human sex slave crimes engaged in through Epstein. Impossible to deny or flip that narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barr got FUCKING EPSTEIN!! Everyone else is 100% easier. Trust barr. Any doubt of barr is pure pedo shilling.

               Tapper's wife was one of the first celebs to come to the defense of Comet Ping Pong after pizzagate broke. Prior to that the place had mediocre reviews on Yelp. She declared it to be one of their fave family restaurants and suddenly the Yelp reviews improved greatly.
