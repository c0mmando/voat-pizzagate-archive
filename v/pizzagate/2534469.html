            I don't think this is David Pelzer. He is an author but not really the go to child abuse expert that this kind seems to describe. Also, he was seriously physically abused but I don't recall from his book that he was sexually abused. Not to say someone has to be sexually abused to be an abuser, but he would statistically
More likely to be a physical abuser than anything else.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say this is likely someone who either worked in the field of law enforcement, or therapy....

            Might be Dave Pelzer as suggested by commenters.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was a
            <strong>
             media sensation in the 1990s
            </strong>
            with best-selling books and cross-country multimedia marketing blitzes telling the story of his childhood abuse.  He was on Larry King and told how
            <strong>
             he worked with social services and law enforcement, so he was considered sort of an "expert" by the media
            </strong>
            .  Larry King:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/RnSntzvGteI?t=406">
             https://youtu.be/RnSntzvGteI?t=406
            </a>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then controversy arose when
            <strong>
             people began to question the veracity of his abuse claims
            </strong>
            .  This article refers to him as "the child abuse entrepreneur."

            He went to Joplin, Missouri after the big tornado:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Pelzer said he
            <strong>
             travels the country
            </strong>
            presenting information about child abuse and
            <strong>
             counseling survivors and educators
            </strong>
            . One of the things he’s doing in Joplin is
            <strong>
             working with foster families
            </strong>
            who have been traumatized by the tornado, but he’s also pitching in on the recovery effort. This week he is working with
            <strong>
             volunteers at College Heights Christian Church
            </strong>
            , passing out supplies."

             0.12 seconds in is a photo of the kids wearing those God awful 'Thing 1' 'Thing2' etc...t-shirts that those poor kids that were abused and murderd by the Hart's were wearing.
How anyone can relate to their child as a 'Thing' is beyond me...bunch of degenerate sick f@%ks!!!

             <strong>
              I met/worked Jim Clemente  sometime in 2007 when I was a stand in for the character Garcia on Criminal Minds
             </strong>
             for four years....
            </p>
            <p>
             I....emailed
             <strong>
              a retired FBI agent and former co-worker named Jim Clemente
             </strong>
             in Nov 2014 about my experiences being groomed and stalked by Ben Stein....
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              I came forward to Jim Clemente in 2014 when the Bill Cosby story came out because he was an expert in child sex crimes and dealing with pedophiles.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Jim Clemente told me he would report Ben Stein to the FBI in 2014. I do not remember him telling me to file a police report in 2014, he may have but I don’t think he did, he told me he would notify the FBI during that phone call.
            </p>
            <p>
             A year and a half later, he told me to file a police report in 2016 after I commented on Allison Hope Wiener’s show “Crime Time” did a report on Elijah Wood, child actors &amp; pedophiles. She replied and was adamant that I go to the police ASAP and file a report.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              I feel like Jim Clemente completely failed me after my experiences coming to him as an adult survivor of child sex abuse after what happened from 2014-2017.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              He told me my child rape story was boring in June of 2016 when I called him to read him my statement.  I called him to read this to him because I thought he was a friend and advocate; and he interrupted me and told me to leave parts out.

             "Clemente retired from active government duty in 2007. Since then, he has worked in Hollywood writing screenplays and serving as a consultant about law enforcement, counterterrorism, and the FBI on films and TV shows.[1] He owns X-G Productions, Inc. and has written several episodes of NCIS: Los Angeles, two episodes of Lie to Me, and an episode of The Unit. He has also appeared on Criminal Minds and The Unit, performed stunts on Criminal Minds and Washington Field, and served as creator and producer of Washington Field, in addition to writing one of its episodes.[6] He has also written for the shows Killer Elite and Blindspot. Since late 2015, he has been a staff writer and technical consultant for Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders.[3][7]

             The Catholic Herald profiled Clemente and his family in June 2016, discussing their involvement in WorkCamp, a summer camp focused on volunteer work. Their involvement began in 1996 when Clemente volunteered as a WorkCamp contractor.[1][17]

              Yeah, and I'm not sure either, but it sure seems as though he's jaded and sticks up for the father no matter what, which seems brash to me. It's almost as if he's a hired gun for dads who need defense no matter if they're guilty or not, Tong's got their back.

            Its OBVIOUS from this blind that Enty knows about us and our group's investigation into sexual abuse of children.

            Seems the fucker in this blind is trying to use our movement to his advantage. Whoever he is, time to out him.

             Yes!  One of the guesses was david pelzer   "a child called it"

             As a child, Dave Pelzer experienced horrific abuse at the hands of his mother. Beaten and neglected, 12 year old David was rescued from his torment and placed in foster care. The story of his journey from a traumatized child to a grown man is told in Dave’s three books, “A Child Called It”, “The Lost Boy”, and “A Man Named Dave”. Please join co-host, Prentiss Pemberton for an interview with childhood trauma survivor and bestselling author, Dave Pelzer.

             As we know some that have been abused can turn into abusers themselves.  Possibly Pelzer is the answer.  Possible.  If he is, he definitely needs to be taken down.  I also agree than Enty is Friend not Foe.
