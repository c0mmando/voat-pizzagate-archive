<p>“He continued to film my reaction for at least 10 minutes as I just sat there, dry heaving like I was going to puke and crying very hard,” Kobelt, a Canadian actress, said in the complaint to the Health Department, adding that Porter began showing her the violent images without warning.</p>

            Here is a July 11, 2017 letter stating that a complaint against Dr. Danielle Roberts for branding women, would not be investigated because the branding did not occur within a patient-doctor relationship.  At least this one advised contacting law enforcement.  The letter is signed by

            Without wishing to self-promote too much here, I must point out the glaring relevance your thread has to the following by me, with regards to NXIVM in Albany:

            Sounds like they could be  testing the efficacy of different situations/visual triggers to induce the types of extreme fear that cause the body to create Adrenochrome.  Why else would some pseudo self-help sex cult put so much methodical study into the science of how the mind reacts to hyper violence and fear? Maybe just for this pervs Drs pleasure, but it sounds like the perfect study for these sadists to perfect their methods of extracting this elite death drug.

            This is very important for Pizzagate, because it is a reveal of the techniques these people use to identify susceptible people for further exploitation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect this kind of technique has been used by other cults and elite pedophile groups.

             I surmise that this same type of thing goes on in all of the "covens", "cults" or whatever you wish to call them.  Someone has to keep the pizza fresh and edible until it isn't.

            Move over bogus "Insectional studies of whatever comes out the University' ass" Scholarly Journal, 
Rational Inquiry® is coming to the scientific and academic world communities. (Not to worry about unethical experiments on humans there, it's actually mainstream within all the 'safe spaces').

            This is a form of SRA.  Satanic Ritual Abuse.  He needs to be locked up for life and with no parole.  Monitoring brain waves?  Is he a relative of The Angel of Death, Mengele?  This guy is beyond evil.

              I wonder if this is how this doctor was created.  Over and over and over of viewing these sick perverted videos or possibly the real thing.  These sick perverts did not just wake up one day doing this, they were also shown the same gory stuff.  This is disgusting and must stop.  When people talk about SRA no one believes them.  That is what these sickos count on.  People that do not believe them.  Yes, I believe they monitor their brains to find out what level of insane their victim is at.  The create most of their psychopaths or they have been created by their parents.

               What I mean is, you can spot psychopaths by monitoring their brain waves to see what parts light up when given certain images/videos. I am talking out of my ass here, I think their pleasure parts light up when they see death, or maybe nothing lights up, ie they do not feel anything.
              </p>

               I am speculating, havent read anywhere that the doctor in question even had an MRI.

                You may be on to something.  There are a lot of things they have that WE don't know about.  Now, knowing what I know, when watching those old horror movies, the ones where they put those wires or metal straps on their heads, I wonder if those really exist.  Remember they always say that our govt. and the CIA are at least 50 years ahead of where we think they are.

            This is a form of mind control. The purpose is to create cognitive dissonance. "There are four theoretic paradigms of cognitive dissonance, the mental stress people suffer when exposed to contradictory information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs, ideals, or values; (i) Belief Disconfirmation, (ii) Induced Compliance, (iii) Free Choice, and (iv) Effort Justification; which respectively explain: what happens after a person acts inconsistently, relative to his or her prior intellectual perspectives; what happens after a person makes decisions; and what are the effects upon a person who has expended much effort to achieve a goal. Common to each paradigm of cognitive-dissonance theory is the tenet: People invested in a given perspective shall—when confronted with disconfirming evidence—expend great effort to justify retaining the challenged perspective."

            In the '80's public school children were experimented on and shown a film in class of a baby deer being burned up in a forest fire. SICK! I believe 911 was used to create cognitive dissonance to get the public/Congress to pass the Patriot Act

             Yes.  So True.  And it also is similar to SRA Satanic Ritual Abuse.  Frightening people out of their wits.  Making them have nightmares and so they cannot unsee the horror.  There are no words for him.

             Yes, they should have taken action before.  Would like to see the Sept. 6, 2017 from the state Office of Professional Medical Conduct informing Kobelt it would not investigate and that “the issues you have described are not medical misconduct.”  Who signed that letter?

               The Bronfman Cash/Raniere Mind Control Sex Inc. operation is bad enough on the human trafficking level, the disgusting 'fright experiments', the women Raniere convinced to commit suicide, the babbling kids who speak no language well and understand less, all that, but keep in mind that Bronfman crime family spawn Sarah set out to apply herself to world politics...in Libya...in 2012.

               That's when something seemingly 'ad hoc' becomes something else, where the clown connection really seems plausible, and the rest is window dressing (albeit useful in a variety of ways).  So, could NXIVM be another one of the many clown manufactured cults?

                Ms. Sarah Bronfman says she has taken a leave of absence this year from her position as a coach at NXIVM to focus on her Libya projects and her upcoming wedding to Mr. Igtet, who says he wants to help his country recover from war.

               <p>
                Besides working as president of the Libyan-Canadian chamber, Ms. Bronfman says she has also taken on duties as president of the U.S.-Libya Chamber of Commerce. "Being involved in global issues is something I'd always wanted to do, and I'd spent a good number of years training myself," Ms. Bronfman said. "I was ready for this type of opportunity and meeting Basit presented that to me."

              <p>
               I assume that her words 'training myself' have (in part) something to do with the secret monitoring of her father's emails.  And given the Canadian connection, maybe the whole circus is involved.

                My brain is about to explode now.  My friend said she can't wait to go to Florida and re-visit Universal Studios.  I kept racking my brain but did not remember til later that Universal Studios is owned by the Bronfmans.  I am convinced they are the mafia.  Seagrams.  All liquor is controlled by the mafia.  There are many involved and connected.  Rat Lines.

                John McCain’s personal fortune traces back to organized crime in Arizona, through his father-in-law, according to a report published by a multi-news agency team called Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc.
               </p>
               <p>
                IRE reporters Amy Silverman and John Doherty, writing in the Phoenix New Times, note that the father of McCain’s wife, James Hensley, was convicted by a federal jury in U.S. District Court of Arizona in March 1948 on seven counts of filing false liquor records. Hensley also was charged with conspiracy to hide from federal authorities the names of persons involved in a liquor industry racket with two companies he managed, United Sales Company in Phoenix and United Distributors in Tucson.
               </p>
               <p>
                The umbrella company, United Liquor, at that time held a  monopoly in Arizona, organized and managed by Kemper Marley, who was accused of mob ties by a reporter who was murdered in 1977.
               </p>
               <p>
                I believe they are in thick with the mafia.  You cannot operate without it.  I allege the Bronfmans are as well.

                  And think about this ... many of those experiencing weird images and thoughts don't even know they were subjected to SRA. They were too young to consciously remember, but the abuse and images are still there.

                 <p>
                  They're depressed, angry, confused, scared and have no idea why or what happened to them. It's why these people are monsters.

             These kinds of videos are even available on the mainstream internet. Its sick. Curiosity brought me to those dark places, seen some videos partially, cause I couldnt take it and dont recommend watching them at all. I also read the comment sections and its full of sickos joking about brutal murders. Lack of empathy on the majority of the users (obviously). Bet those are the socially rejected and most hurt people, due to inner protection they build up a shell where no emotion reigns over them anymore. They are happy when people suffer.
