            Only slightly off topic, but for those who replied here that are interested in the cause and effect of historical and repeated childhood abuse, there is a very interesting read here -
            <a href="http://psychohistory.com/books/the-origins-of-war-in-child-abuse/">
             The Origins of War in Child Abuse
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            It's long but really worth a read.

            There is a strong disconnect in the human psyche that keeps us from understand the cause and effect of pedophilia.   Why it's so strong is a big and important puzzle to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophilia is multi generational and it begins in childhood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not seeing how it starts, not accepting the powerful evidence presented by the brother of Kevin Spacey of his abuse at his fathers hands, and one should assume Kevin's abuse also, is just stupid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking at the evidence and finding cause, is not the same thing as excusing it.   I'm going to say it again.  Looking at the evidence and finding cause, is not the same thing as excusing it.  You don't have to be ignorant to maintain strong opinions.  I part ways with rednecks on that one.

            Loud manly but anonomous Pedo bashers here on voat are skilled at ridicule. This is the most cruel of human emotions, It's also the voice pedo-bully's use to keep the world marching to their drummer.
           </p>
           <p>
            I pray for the day we can see how it starts so we then know where to put our focus.  Only then we will be able to stop it.  You don't weed vines from the top down.  You learn where it starts growing and focus on that.  It's the answer to the often voiced...........WHY DO THEY DO IT?
           </p>

             Thank you for your post and hope that everyone here will give it some attention --
            </p>
            <p>
             The family that Kevin Spacey came from was clearly terrorized by the father.
            </p>
            <p>
             The older brothers descriptions of Kevin Spacey and the Mother suggest people 
in shock, traumatized.  In fact, what he said about Kevin -- and I think he used the word
"emptiness" -- suggests that the degree of abuse may have been so extreme that he may
have been pushed to "disassociation" -- multiple personalities.
            </p>
            <p>
             This refers to the knowledge which CIA/MKULTRA was using -- probably knowledge gained in
practices like "the Inquisition" and "Crusades."  And, likely by others in earlier times who sought
to control others.  The CIA tortured and sexually abused children to CREATE multiple personalities.
These new personalities can be programmed, even taught new languages, given photographic 
memories. The children were used as homosexual prostitutes (despite whatever their normal sexual
orientation may have been) - they were used as drug runners for our government, and as spies....
espionage for blackmail.  This control was held over these children into their adult lives and 
beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I recall of reading about pedophilia, something we have to remember is that NOT everyone 
who is sexually abused will sexually abuse someone else.  The majority of those do not abuse anyone else.
But a certain percentage will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Males are our sexual abusers of children and they are heterosexual males.
Homosexual males are 100X less likely to sexually abuse a child according to studies.
            </p>
            <p>
             INCEST is the most common sexual abuse of children -- females mainly, but males by about 12%.
Their abusers are fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Parents have to know this in order to protect their children.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also seem clear from what the Italians tell us that sexual abuse of children by priests
has been going on in the Vatican/Roman Catholic Church since Day #1 of the church.
            </p>
            <p>
             In order to be able to unravel what has been set loose on the public, we need to try to 
understand it and what the victims are telling us.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I've read of Pedophiles they are believed to have no sexual orientation,
arrested development caused perhaps by some trauma.
            </p>
            <p>
             But there is another class of pedophiles where it is described as "situational."
These are heterosexual males who normally prefer relationships with adult females.
However, when a female isn't available, they may engage in sexual assault of a child.

              I just saw your reply, Thank You so much.  You get all this.  I would add that Pedophiles tend to be very aggressive male dominate types, in my rather substantial experience.
             </p>
             <p>
              They were all made that way, pedo's aren't born as pedo's.  Approximately 1in6 males are sexually abused in childhood.  A small fraction of that, perhaps 10% become the abusers of the future.

             <p>
              How long it's been going on is much debated here.  That it's been done with more or less pre-planning in different times seems likely.  That some adults have abused children for all of time is probably true, we are just a bunch of apes.
             </p>
             <p>
              The upper levels, masonic, church, military etc. feed from the familial front line level of abuse.  In my case it was a grandfather got it all started.  He was mason connected at the lower levels, sharing is mandatory apparently.  Male bonding I guess.  Medical personnel through school exams made quiet notes of the anal abuse and passed me on up quickly to more specialized doctors from out of town, with thick German accents.  Those two memories were all I had been unable to fully suppress in my conscious memory  They were especially powerful and survived in fragments I tried not to think about.   I learned about MK-ULTRA only later and it's impact on my life, while trying in more recent years to understand my own horrendous unfolding memories.   It was a flooding.

              Being a member of any secret society gives one a welcome card at any other branch.  Outgoing dominating Traveling Sales types enjoy many "privileges" this way and are natural power centers in these societies.  It's a passing up of the "fresh fruit", the child abuse system is.  Some go all the way to the Top.
