            Its frustrating to me that even great intentional people who want to expose those involved in Pizzagate and Pedogate are completely on board with supporting Trump. I am not here to argue and be-little people who support Trump, because Trump and his administrators are always making it seem like they care about those victims (children) involved in Pizzagate, saying its a very delegate thing and we have to do it gently...but when you start looking at the current Syrian gas hoax, and the distruction of innocent lives, why would someone care about children in one situation but not in the next? Look at his son in law? Look at the corruption and sexual misconduct in trumps administration, it is crazy. It might be that they are pretending to be working on getting the evil ones out, but are instead doing the exact opposite.

            If Trump was going to do anything about Hillary or pedogate in DC he would have already. The FBI and CIA are NOT our friends, they are there to serve, and cover for the government only, and are involved in pedogate, as is the military elite. We are on our own here Im afraid.

           <p>
            In South Korea millions took to the streets when they found out their President was an occultist giving out government secrets to witches. Millions! They got it done. The USA is much larger, yet we cant get over 300 people to go in the streets to save lives of our own kids. WHY?!! Wth is wrong with everyone? SILENCE MEANS ACCEPTANCE!

            For all of you who are ready to jump the Trump train, think about this, you are playing into the hands of the globalists.  They want to divide and conquer.  If we throw Trump to the dogs, they will chew him up and spit him out.  Then we are NEXT!  I think we should do as Steve Bannon said and that is hold their feet to the fire.  DC seems to be a sea of disinformation and where a lot of good intentioned politicians lose their perspective.  If you chose to believe he is a globalist, fine.  But I remember the political battle he went through and it was nothing short of a miracle that he won.  If he was a true globalist the "demons" screaming for his demise and even is death wouldn't be as loud as they are.  From a spiritual perspective, I have never seen such demonic activity against an individual as I have against Trump.  Any normal person would be hard pressed to stand up under that pressure.  He is a very strong man but he is also human.  I say we pray for him, and challenge him to keep his promises.  And he has for the most part.  We got a conservative SCOTUS, he is fighting to keep illegals out, more pedos are being arrested in the past 100 days than all of 2014 under Obama, and plans are underway for a wall.  The man seems to be getting a death threat a day.  Give him a break. He is doing a lot.  There is a huge spiritual battle going on against this country.  He needs our prayer and we need prayer to stand together and fight this evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I believe the power for change depends on us:
II Chronicles 7:14 - if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior…” -1 Timothy 2:1-3

            Also, I have had threads deleted and been heavily downvoted in the past for pointing out that Trump was likely their controlled opposition candidate. Shame some of you were so closed minded that you needed him to piss in your face before you figured it out. Some of you still think it is lemonade. It isn't. But drink it up if you need to believe in fairy tales and unicorns. Too many people in here are new to the truth movement, and because of that there is friction in here. Learn from this and apply scrutiny for everybody. Have no heroes.

            He is not being manipulated, he is their pupett and the concept of him being an outsider fighting them was a psyop. This was planned as always. IMO, they knew the growing truth comunity would not believe we needed war, but if it came from the anti establishment NY elite businessman Trump, we would believe it. How can you guys still be confused that you have been had and it was never plausable that he was an outsider in the first place? Remember the election of Obama vs McCain? They controlled both sides. They couldn't lose. All elections are like that including this last one. You have been had and you still think they influenced him but can't except that your hero was never a white hat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wake up, because Trump is an eltie NY businessman with ties to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds and alpahabet agencies through a joint business venture, long time friend and supporter of the Clintons, in Epsteins black book and went to his island, good friend and supporter of 9/11 culprit larry Silverstein, backed by zionist bankers iuncluding Loyd fucking Blankfein, and he won an election that is always rigged but was supposedly legit this time. Yet you think he has been tricked into doing wrong. Wake up.

            If I lived in the states I dunno if id be doing anything more than been a keyboard warrior .. in new Zealand. Our govt and media is owned by the cabal/cia same as the states.. our last president (prime minister) worked for Merril Lynch and was practically an american banker, and yet he was sold to the public as a down to earth ordinary guy. 
I used to work in corporate world in our capital city.. for IBM and others.. I saw with my own eyes the corruption.. the collusion and the fear tactics that controlled all my workmates.. 
I left that all behind.. I live in the country now, work part time.. grow my food, use solar for power and have fresh water from a spring on the land.. I am about as free as it is possible to be on this planet.. but its a very modest freedom.. but I'm happy.. I appreciate my freedom every day.. and i have no debt and no credit cards and very little money and my point is as long as your willfully dependent on a system then your beholden to these arseholes.. step out of your confort zones and set yourself free.. anyone can do it.. we have become way too complacent and soft and its by design.. we need to get tough again to be able to stand up..

            Exactly what I've been saying .. below pasted from a reply I sent to a friend who was bashing Trump about Syria..
           </p>
           <p>
            The same could be said of Obama, drone strikes on citizens, his name and family are a lie,  broke all his promises, Guantanamo for example.. said he would clean up the federal reserves powers etc etc.. they all lie and lie and lie.. obama should have been impeached .. Hillary was planning to start wwiii according to insiders.. And anyway do we really think any of these figureheads, the talking heads of an unseen hand really make any decisions themselves .. Obama, Hillary, Trump.. they are all monsters.. there is good evidence that recent chemical attack was done in syria by a cia trained "insurgent" group and the main stream media is ignoring the real story of course. It would make no difference who is the public face of the monsters right now.. there would be missiles been sent anyway. Trump is not the problem. Fake news isn't the problem.. The whole world is a stage and the actors in political circles are just one branch of Hollywood promoting every psychopath to power who plays their game and promotes their agenda. Again and again.
They are all compromised and controlled and there are no famous heros.. the real heros are buried by history and lied about. In the last 4 months or so since Trump got in I've learned still further just how deep the rabbit hole goes .. how the human spirit is strong but trusting and wants to believe is some saviour.. thats always looking out there somewhere for a solution.. which also sidelines personal responsibility.. only we can put things right .. but it requires putting our necks out and risking our very lives to oppose the parasites who have been running this show for a long time.. I've learned how the control structure is using black magic to put a spell on humanity .. that its all about spells (spelling, holly-wood wand etc) and those in control are more or less demonically controlled.. yet we are infinitely powerful.. and they are always desperate to maintain their control and illusions
           </p>
           <p>
            The world stage is called a world stage for a reason.. war is called a Theatre of war.. because its all scripted.. we have conscription and the draft etc.. infant-ry and so on.. our language is all about putting a spell on us.. the newage obsession with ascension also just another level of self absorbed BS too I'm learning.. yet I remain positive.. heaven and hell exist here alongside each other :)
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't look to authority figures .. we have to be the sovereign authority and stand our ground :)

            I don't agree at all about the Syria attack shows Trump is being manipulated.  What I remember most regarding his comments about Syria gassing people is "the babies",  "the children", "children of God should not ever suffer like that", "the babies", "who could do that to innocent children and babies, the babies" "such innocent little children and babies", "horrible suffering of children and babies".  You get the point.  He is not going to mess around with these pedophiles/Satanists/ cultists that abuse and sacrifice children and babies.  He is coming after them and it will be quick when he does.  They won't see it coming.   Just my thoughts.

            EXACTLY! So many people here are merely dipping their toes in the waters, assuming that PG is real but Trump isn't corrupt and he's their savior who's going to drain a swamp.  He's not.  He's complicit, he knows it's going on and he is one of them because he's a powerful elite who lines his pockets with cash, control and power.

            I completely agree and it hurts me deeply to say so because I believed.  That was a mistake.  I believed Trump would do something way before now.  He has not, and he will not.  He is not the savior we hoped for, and I am very close to saying he's a corrupt elitist.  In fact, no matter how old you are, name a president in your lifetime, or at any time, who was not corrupt.  It's going to be too damn late very soon if that Sexual Assault House Bill a/k/a THE PEDOPHILE PROTECTION BILL, goes to the Senate, because that fucking bill will pass, and then nothing will matter anymore if it doesn't already.

             You guys went out of your way to ignore all the facts about his connections and warning that this was a show to trick people into thinking the good guys are in control. He had a business venture with the rothschilds and alpahbet agencies through a front company and is buddies with 9/11 villian Larry Silverstein. There is no pizzagate investigation being done by the authorites because they are in on it.

             I see your pain, but it's better you see the truth now instead of buying into the possibility Trump was ever good.  He personified in him the things you wanted to see, which is exactly what these elites are good at.  I'm sure the LGBT community felt the same way about Obama and Hillary.

             He's part of the manipulators.  And the way you sound so angry shows you're being manipulated by it.  Coming up with nicknames for the opposing side is all a part of you falling victim to their game to keep you angry at the wrong things.  By calling Hillary "Hitlery" or Obama "Obummer" or the way leftists call Trump 'Our Cheeto In Chief"...it's all the same!  It's not that he was once good and is now manipulated...he was never good.  None of them are EVER good.  They're all buddies, they're all in on it and they all have the same 'stay in power, keep the people dumb and under the thumb' agenda.

             The sooner you and others like you can swallow this, the sooner you can wake up and see that nothing will ever be done about this unless we do it ourselves somehow.

            Exactly.  It'll show just how deep and interconnected the web is and goes.  They all know about it in the very least and their prolonging it's ability to thrive.    That's why Trump is NEVER going to expose PG, no matter how hard Trump supporters want him to or think he's going to...he won't .  Because in exposing it...he exposes himself and everyone involved....which is pretty much all of them..in some way.

            I don't know the inside truth about the Trump administration .... but ....
I KNOW the D.C. pedo ring and similar ilk are terrified of us!
So stay strong... try not to bicker with people who feel different than you do about president Trump since none of us are a fly in the white house sitting on the wall.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we all have in common is supreme desire to shut down this pedo ring(s) as soon as humanly possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            God's speed to all those marching.

            Not necessarily..yes..they may not trust the media...but it could still lead down the route of remaining blindly angry and ignorant by clinging onto the 'fake news' agenda in a way that furthers they're love and rallying support for Trump...picking a side by picking him and thinking that he's the truth and he's out to end the media...when in reality the media and Trump share the same shelf and agenda: To cloud, confuse and keep the people ignorant.

            Which I can only assume can go one of two ways:
           </p>
           <p>
            1)They turn in a way that benefits the elite agenda that further keeps them blindly angry and divided.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) They realize we've all been pawns, you cannot trust the media or any of the people in power because they're all in on it and are all complicit.
           </p>
           <p>
            So hopefully it's #2 so people can start waking up.

            Video blocked in U.K. for copyright but Understand the sentiment.  I've seen a post today saying that there's been only one guy alone at NYPD - so if no one can turn out when needed I feel we're going to struggle to get the word out.  The collective needs to collect together.  I'm putting stickers on the inside of ladies toilet doors on motorway services that are used by nationwide travellers.  Open to more suggestions.

            The word propaganda doesn't mean false. That's not in the definition. I am saying that the owners of this world (fucked up Jewish cult of 5000 people) want Trump to use the United States (their little bitch) to destroy the rest of the countries around Israel so that they can have their Israel of the bible. To get the people to follow Trump, they have given a FUCK ton of real shit on his opposition, while pretending like he isn't a blackmailed freak as well.

            Only dogs give their loyalty to a man. Men give their loyalty to their principals and ideals. Unfortuneately a lot of americans have let themselves be trained and lowered to the state of drooling mutts.

            Somewhat agree..or Trump is one helluva 4d chess player.  He was completely manipulated into the Syria attack and it just SICKENS me to hear McCain, Graham, and MSM praise his "bold" actions...anytime they are saying good things you are doing something WRONG...

             He wasn't manipulated, you're being manipulated. He's a puppet.  A poster child.  He's in on it just as much as they all are.  The power elitists who run the world wouldn't allow someone to take power that could bring them down.  They keep tricking us into thinking our voice matters and our vote counts, truth is it doesn't and they call the shots still like they always have.

              I'm starting to believe what you are saying.  The vultures' agenda is too far gone now and this could be part of the plan.  Upset people, get some of the world riled about Trump and get others to feel hopeful and then dive in for the kill (war) regardless of who is at the helm.  One thing, however, is that with hitlery et al not getting elected it stalled things and exposed their foundation big time.  If she had been elected, war may have started months ago with Russia or Iran?

               You're getting the  'keeping the public unaware and divided' portion of what I'm saying, but you mentioned 'if Hillary had been elected'.  She was never going 'to be elected'.  Like I said....you have the illusion that your opinion matters and that your vote counts..but it's just that: an illusion.  Hillary was never going to be POTUS, it was always going to be Trump.  Because, again, these people call the shots...they make the world spin however the hell they want it to.  They have the power to make whatever plans they want and keep the plan going according to the plan.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, to say it would have started sooner if Hilary would've been elected doesn't make sense....they're all in cahoots.  Trump and the Clintons have always been buddies, just like they're all buddies with the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and every other elite world leader.  What you're watching is a silly soap opera at best.

               You're falling victim to the divide, to choosing a side of an imaginary conflict in an imaginary game where they make the rules and always end up winning and staying at the top.

                Good point.  Thank for your comment.  I agree it is all a game and their spin is working.  I still think that this helped uncover her creepy foundation.
I do not want to be part of a divide which is what is happening big time.

                 I agree with her screwed up foundation.  There's a lot more going on..I can only imagine.  Some of the toe-dippers that are still rallying behind Trump as if he's different....yes they're still falling victim to the game because they still don't realize he's one of them...but at least they partially know the truth enough about this PG stuff to try and unveil some portion of the truth (which in this case was Hillary's foundation).

            I agree.  I figure our hope is with Wikileaks or the NYPD.  There could be someone that has proof, but are wisely keeping their mouth shut and not posting on Twitter about it.  That seems to be a death sentence.

            Yes they still make sense. They're propaganda (TRUE propaganda- as in the emails are not fake at all) to get a charged Trump faux-grassroots movement to attack more middle Eastern Countries to carve out Greater Israel for the Jews.

            The PBC (Pizzagate Billboard Campaign) is divided up into three phases. We have to succeed at all three for this plan to succeed.

             Red Pill Tool (website)
I looked everywhere for a website that could provide the info necessary in a professional and efficient manner that won't deter the general public and I could not find one. So now we have to make one. This takes time and money. I'm teaming up with Ryan of The Random Rants of Ryan YouTube channel to make this happen. Our goal is to make simple to the point videos about Pizzagate. 3-5 minutes. Sticks to the basics that got us all interested in Pizzagate in the first place.

            I really don't think the Syrian attack is in step with the neocon mission. This was a warning shot, not a declaration of war. Assad will be forced to step down, Russia will leave Syria, or war will break out, and I think that's the message Trump is sending.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, if we do go to war with Russia, then we'll know that you're right.

             Yeah, this is a ridiculous knee jerk post. People want to either stick to Trump unwaveringly or are thirsting for him to be compromised and take this one action as proof. The resolve and the mindset of PGers and Trump supporters is brittle and uncertain. It's totally understandable that it is. But yet again this action has too many factors to just axe the Trump angle to our war. This was the most restrained way to sate the neocons' thirst for blood.
            </p>
            <p>
             The way that the alt-right is reacting to this is disappointing to me. Of course none of us want more war in the Middle East. Of course we want out of Syria. Of course we want good relations with Russia. Trump has said as much as well. And one action that is questionable but not verifiably damning is not enough for everyone to start jumping ship.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are just so many factors. I certainly don't know who to trust. But as I've been saying since the beginning, all of these "red flags" for Trump are too uncertain to fully condemn him. For example, if he is really warring with the Deep State, then it's reasonable to believe that he has to appease them every now and then while he continues to consolidate power. I know we're bloodthirsty and want the pedos exposed, but if Trump were truly aiming to do that, he'd likely put it off until the most opportune time. Knowing the person he seems to be, he couldn't in good conscience just release everything if he believes there's a way to accomplish it without plunging the nation into civil war.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know, I'm sort of rambling here. But my basic point is that we just don't know yet, especially not from one very restrained military action.

              Its not one action that is questionable .. there have been plenty of signs along the way.. like when he said right after he got in that he didn't want to hurt Hillary.. the fact he has never personally used the word pizzagate or directly referenced anything were trying to expose. 
I defended him and remained hopeful all along because I wanted to believe.. Sanders is also a puppet.. I suspected Trump was and watching how the media attacked him sure makes him look like a good guy or at least someone whos not controlled. I think he's arrogant and stupid.. I think he loves his family and will do whatever it takes to protect them including betraying the american people. A sad truth. Anyone can be bought or threatened into submission.. Alex Jones, Seaman etc etc.. anyone can change their tune and do a 180 if their lives depend on it, and they do.
Lets be realistic here!
Their hands are tied even if they have best intentions to start with. 
Trumps a player.. Hillary may have been the chosen one .. but it doesn't matter.. the result will be the same.. they are just puppets.. figureheads and lets not forget this .. low level arrests can happen .. high level stuff is actually up to us.. we have to make them accountable.. we have to be an army.. a force to recon with..and it does mean being more than keyboard warriors.. its risky.. its life threatening!
I'm serious here.. NO ONE IS GOING TO FUCKING SAVE US AND PUT THINGS RIGHT OTHER THAN OURSELVES! !!
             </p>
             <p>
              GET THAT IN YOUR HEADS..
We have to take our lives back, step way out of our comfort zones .. grow our own food, get off grid.. move out of the cities.. become independent! !
Stop relying on a corrupt system of debt and mortgages.. and 40+ hour weeks and the whole gamut! 
We have to take personal responsibility back for our lives individually and collectively or we will always be ruled over.
Get it?! I can already hear the excuses.. oh its too hard to change... I'm up to my ears in debt..(fake debt that can be legally nullified with the right education in groups).. etc

              Agreed, we can't definitively say what happened and what the best course of action is because we don't know all the facts. I elected this guy because out of the two real choices, he's the one I thought would make sensible decisions when presented with all the data, and Aleppo would be a no fly zone by now under Hillary, which would start World War III. The tax plan, immigration plans, improvements in healthcare legislation and economic deregulation, plus what he wants to do for the VA, those all sound awesome, but primarily I wanted to keep liberal warhawks and their neocon friends away from the button, and I'm still solidly convinced that Trump is not a neocon.

               I am glad a few people still think this. Probably more will come around as the dust settles. It's been rather disheartening seeing the widespread denouncement and cries of betrayal when we still aren't clear on the details,
               <em>
                and
               </em>
               what we do know seems like Trump made a hard decision but still doesn't want to change his Syria stances.
              </p>
              <p>
               I read this on American Thinker:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Briefing reporters late Thursday night, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the strike did not represent a "change in our policy or our posture in Syria," even though it marked the first time the US had decided to take military action against the Syrian government.
               </p>
               <p>
                "There has been no change in that status," he said. "It does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and actors cross the line ... and cross the line in the most heinous of ways."
               </p>
               <p>
                Tillerson said the administration felt the strike was "proportional because it was targeted at the facility that delivered this most recent chemical attack."
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               This all seems pretty reasonable to me, EVEN IF the chemical attack was a false flag.

            Exactly...there's absolutely no evidence that suggests he's one of us or he's a savior.  He's just as much a puppet and is just as complicit as the elites we are fighting against.

            You mean Trump, who changes his stance on things like most people change clothes, did something he said he wouldn't?!?! Well color me shocked. All the times I said Trump was a joke and would do nothing about pizzagate only to be called a shill and get downvoated. What about "he's playing 14 D chess"? All in all it only took 4 months in office for a lot of people to realize a billionaire reality tv star real estate crook wasn't anti-establishment (LOL) after all.

             I agree.  He's one of them.  My question is ...where the hell does all this random loyalty to him stem from?  Where or how did people just assume that he was 'different' or that he wasn't one of them?

              He convinced people he wanted to make the US better. And it seemed like he cared about his legacy. That's the impression I got. A rich man who has done everything, wanting to cement his name in history, in a positive way,  during his last few decades left.

               If anything that's what the other parties do to.  They convince people to believe in something....They give the people little things here and there...they make people believe that real change is happening according to the bullshit these puppets promise and all the while the vast majority of the people remain none the wiser to the truth: They are all in on it, they all are complicit.  There are no true 'rebels' because that would compromise their 'I have everything and I can do everything I want' kind of life.  Trump fooled you into thinking that he could MAGA the hell out of this nation in the very same way Obama gave hopeto the left.  The LGBT community were given the right to marry...people were given the right to stay on their parent's insurance until 26 and now with Trump you had his executive orders..I mean..pick whatever 'accomplishments' she want from any president..this one and the last one included...and it's all the same.  Speckled 'achievements' here and there for the crowds rooting for them to lull them into a false sense of progress, loyalty and un-corruption.  They're all the same.

            I am not tying to start anything at all, so please keep that in mind before you all have my head.  It's pretty apparent that a lot of people on here are firm believers in Trump and are supporters believing that he is one of us 'truthers' fighting the good fight.
           </p>
           <p>
            My question is, how do we know this?  How do we know that this POTUS is the one that all of a sudden is not one of them?  I'm not here to lean politically one way or the other.  I just sincerely believe,like all of you, that there is truth to pizzagate (as well as many other gov't conspiracies that point to high level corruption and evil-doing).
           </p>
           <p>
            I just feel....after everything that we 'conspiracy theorists' have learned is that those on the opposing side (be it pedophile elites, false flag conspirators, corrupted clergy and religious leaders, etc) are always looking to keep up their antics and actions, always looking to remain elite and powerful all whilst giving us a false sense of control.  They always give us a poster child to root for, a poster child that we think is not in on it and doesn't know about anything and is just wanting to make the world a better place like us....but...as time keeps on passing and the deeper I go down the rabbit hole...I just feel in my heart of hearts that we really shouldn't trust anything at face value.  For the libs it may have been Obama or Hilary (please save negative political comments, because this isn't the point) and for many others, it's Trump now.  We always assume these are people wanting to do good, they are't in on it and they are in it for the reasons we are in on it.  But think about it.....if the world really is being run by this shadowy, elitist collective...and they have all the power...why would they let someone...someone who fights against them...to be in power?
           </p>
           <p>
            I invite thoughts....I'm not a shill...but...I'm going to be honest...I really think Trump is no different than any other POTUS/elite....call him a puppet...one of them..poster child...or whatever...I really believe that he's just as complicit.  Because as much as I hear from many of you about how he's in there draining the swamp in one way or another...I heard the very same thing about Obama....Clinton and others of the opposing political party.  There's that "He/She is not a part of the corruption.  He's one of us, he's going to get in there and weed out the corruption and change things for the better." But I don't believe it...I can't...if these people have power...they call the shots.  And I believe allowing us to think we have control and letting us think our votes and opinions matter is all a part of their game to keep us numb and dumb and keep themselves at the top to do as they please.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am sorry for the length of this reply, but I would love your thoughts...and I am kind of hoping that there are other truthers like me...

             All of the sudden become one of them? You still have the mental block. He was always one of them. Tired of producing the evidence. You don't want to look and won't take it in if it's presented to you.

            I've been telling you tards for half a year now, Trump is compromised. They have blackmail on him involving 2 underage girls. He's a pedo, he knows all  about the seedy pedo underworld, but he is going to do nothing about it.  Loyalty to a man is for dogs.  Loyalty to your principals is for men.  Are you a man or a dog?

             Yep it's true. Trump definitely had fun with very young girls that Jeffrey Epstein provided Trump with there is no way Trump could resist that temptation in the 80's and 90's when Trump was the King of New York and Epstein had orgies in his Manhattan townhouse. I bet Trump also enjoyed young girls when he was in Moscow and the KGB has those videos. Trump is owned and it's obvious he won't do anything to bring down the pedo network he was part of it.

             He is not a good guy in the first place. It was all a show. There is no PG investigation. Comey was kept on the job to cover it up. Trump was a psyop and you have all been had. Think Logans run, "Their is no Sanctuary"

             I wanted to get off pizzagate and pedogate last week with all the Trump is going to do something about this jazz and Hillary go to prison crap. Not that she shouldn't go to prison but you and me or her I know what side he's on. I know they're all on that side and it annoys me to no end when citizens that are suppose to be free thinkers think that those making and breaking the laws care anything of the rest of us. Meanwhile we tear each other down to stand against another.

              I agree Chiyelgrl, We shouldnt attack each other over this crap. There were two turds running for office, Trump was a crap shoot, and fooled everyone. It was not unexpected he might be a scumbag, but both parties are. So lets get back to why we are here in the first place. Lets take them all down together.

             Thanks for this!  I'm so relieved to see that I'm not the only one with this thinking.  That is exactly what I have been trying to say too.  It sucks because a lot of threads I have almost contributed to, I avoid because it becomes apparent that many pizzagaters are Trump supporters...and you have to be careful in insinuating that he's a part of the problem and is complicit.  And very well said...loyalty to principals is what we need in order to be true truthers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw,, loyalty to principles can be for us women too ;) Lol, I'm just messing.
             <br/>
             But thanks for saying this because it makes me feel less alone in the tin-hat pool.

              Only dogs give their loyalty to a man.  Men give their loyalty to their principals and ideals.  Unfortuneately a lot of americans have let themselves be trained and lowered to the state of drooling mutts.

               Agreed....some people (whether it;s Trump supporters now, or the lefts that believed in Obama) will dip their toes in to these 'conspiracy theories.  They find the truth and will think 'OMG, the horror ....this stuff is happening and the gov't and elites are in on it.  But not my (Insert POTUS here), they're the good, they're not in on it, they don't know what's going on...and they'll fix it!'
              </p>
              <p>
               Correction: Yes they do know, and no they will not do anything.  Complicit, complicit, complicit.

            Well, I disagree with throwing Trumpy under the bus. And any linear thinking analysis with  instructions I consider highly suspect. Trump is turning our Titanic away from the icebergs. Until I see definitively some actual reports and the victims of it I continue to work with the We The People supporters of Trump to help him. Because he cannot do this alone. You want some evidence? Well here's my handy dandy manual for your Inner Truth Meter cultivation. But please by rubbing brain cells consider who he met with this week before the event. Then consider some of the subtle news such as they knew it was coming and had evacuated. Then consider what you see happening in the us media. Go scalar wave paradigm help shift out of this MK Matrix.

            in FATHERS DAY,IDEAS,PHILOSOPHICAL,SOCIAL MEDIA
I have a short post for this blog that is too long for Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            The social media platform of 140 characters is particularly nice as it engages thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            This message is about a way, a Tao for determining the true from the false. How to make it simpler, so it can be messaged down to 140.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every single solitary person has a truth meter. Here’s a users manual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Draw away from group-think momentarily to examine information free of distraction…
           </p>
           <p>
            …this can be physically or mentally or emotionally – enough to get the hook out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Give it a minute or two until the knee jerk reaction subsides….
           </p>
           <p>
            …or a day or more if its huge or has a mega shock factor. Or in case the hook has a barb on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quietly wonder
           </p>
           <p>
            who’s telling me this,
ask, do they care about me
WHAT IF THE EXACT OPPOSITE WERE TRUE
who benefits if the exact opposite were true
what does the opposite look like
Done
           </p>
           <p>
            Leave it at that and over the next few hours or days or more your sub-conscious, where the actual truth meter within each individual exists, will be at work on it…
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea that sticks with you the most and the longest is the truest. Simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            An easy example is the recent news about peanut butter that passed by my eye briefly. I ignore things I strongly disagree with, such as that. However I have to dwell on who benefits and why. Thus to examine it free of emotional charge is done by simply looking at the opposite of it. After a couple of days that which has stuck like -pardon the pun- peanut butter, is in actual fact the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really wish everyone had the greatest of health and ingested zero medications.
           </p>
           <p>
            My health status is pretty good. As such my truth meter chokes me up and brings tears to my eyes when I hear a strong truth. I know, haha, sometimes inconvenient…
           </p>
           <p>
            ….here’s an example of where that pops – I give you John Denver.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have fun…
           </p>
           <p>
            …look for my long blogpost I’m writing about emotional literacy – it dives deeper into healthy balance of wholeness. It’s the pedal to the metal on the topic.

             maybe Trumps agenda is to run the titanic into the iceberg and bankrupt the USA......if that is done then by international bank of settlements the USA control of allotment of lands returns to the original owner as per the treaty with king george when the terms of the cessation of hostilities between the rebels and the king at the time of the so called war of independence.....The fact remains that the US won the battle of yorktown and the king being savvy franchised control of lands but not economy and finance....to wit the US has paid 50% OF ALL minerals to the crown corporation since....Only land control was granted or ceded when the king dictated the terms of the cessation......the terms are quite clear that if the fiction titled USA becomes a bankrupt body then all titles return to the original title holder(to wit crown corp).......This will hasten world gov't and the USA will not have a legal leg to stand on.......
                   This is where trump is taking the US.

              This is very clearly stated. I appreciate that. The terrible news of it notwithstanding. It has felt like we operate as a Subject of the Crown, often, as it is. I do recognize an obvious turn of events delivered upon the area I am in from geoengineering. Which is no small thing to me. Why the change, I can only hope is because rogue elements are rats jumping out. I suppose equally it could mean they have gone to man the life boats for their benefactor.

            You are totally right on the money! Thank you for writing this, I tried to write something similar and it was taken down immediately, maybe it was to early. Also to note, its always been in the hands of the people to awaken, formulate new systems and relationships with each other that will pull back our energy from these sick people who call themselves leaders. Thank You for sharing this.

             Mine was taken down as well. See the theme? Mods ripped down post that called Trump out as controlled opposition and said this was all a show. Vindicator is big culprit in these removals. I had a 1400 comment contribution account before I was banned for postng this stuff.

              This is outrageous! This is just as important as any other material, maybe even more because it goes to the heart of the matter and gets people talking about the larger picture. Everything is controlled, everything!

            Write it on their precious money. Write #pizzagate and #pedogate on the cash. If they want to fuck kids then we will have to destroy their money because of it, easy as that.

            Trump totally reversed his stance on Syria, so unless it's some 40D chess move (unlikely), then yeah, you're right, he's a Rothschild lackey like all of the other mainstream politicians.

              Anyone who supports any politician now can fk themselves, they are all in it together.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, that being said we need to focus on the pedos and expose them, and stop attacking each other for being pawns in this. Everyone has been fooled, and will be again. How many pedos do you think are moles in here posing as concerned researchers using these groups for jerk off material, and material to troll with later on? I bet a few at least. So lets focus on exposing and taking out these pedo, not each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Put all links you can find here on Trump being a pedo so they can be shared all over the web. Ppl will pay attention. Also all others you can find on the FBI, CIA, the WH, Centers for Missing Children, Military involvement. We need to nuke the net with this stuff. Shake up the dirt bags a bit better.
