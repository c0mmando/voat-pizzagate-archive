            To me it's about sketchy verbage that makes no sense without some sort of code found in emails not intended to be released leading to men (and women) espousing and promoting depictions and descriptions of crimes against children as "art" in the same buildings using FBI verified pedo signs timed with massive scandals of abuse rings involving political and business elites in Canada, Norway, UK (probably more). Now do I think these sick people only operate out of pizza restaurants? He'll no, and I think the name "pizzagate" seems to far fetched for the uninformed and works to our detriment.  But holy shit when I see the media frenzy to discredit this even before the armed investigator, it seems like powerful people are freaking out.  Usually they just ignore this stuff and hope it loses momentum but they creating the greatest Streisand effect of all time.  It's like they learned nothing from the hillary/DNC wikileaks.  I just worry that if they can somehow discredit the pizza aspect of this that we will miss all the institutionalized abuse by politicians/clergy/etc.

            I believe it to be the ultimate outcome of the recent Wikileaks finds. I'm afraid of the conspiracy movement that's attached itself to this and I find the
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            crowd almost as toxic as the SRS and CTR crowd. I find the podesta leaks the big smoking gun but there's a ton of bullshit being whipped up by some genuinely mentally ill people that clouts any progress. Hopefully once Trump gets into power everything is brought to light, ESPECIALLY in regards to what is being held back by key people in the FBI. Remember Obama is still technically in power and doing anything too soon might spook these people or get them pardoned. Anthony Weiner's laptop along with the financial dealings of the Clinton foundation are likely more telling than the 100% CONFIRMED! goofs who think the earth is flat.

             ok so what you are saying is pizzagate is real. Yet you do see the media calling you crazy. You do see that it doesnt make any sense. Right? You know they are lying. You know you are on to something right? How far fetch is it to believe in another conspiracy theory? Ohhhh no that other conspiracy is clearly for nutjobs, 100% confirmed right? Hypocrit.

              I know they are lying but the conspiracy community is just as bad if not worse. When you have schizophrenics who believe in SRA and flat earth theories talking about this along with Alex Jones it does nothing to add credibility to anyone's claims. The problem is the other bullshit assholes like Alex Jones and Jeff Rense ran with were just that, bullshit. They didn't need to dismiss the insane claims these retards were making because there was no merit to them. Exposing a real network of child abusers who hold positions of power is something the media is covering up because it's real, they never needed to cover up 9/11, vaccines, aids denialism, lizard people, or anti-gmo protestors because there was no crime to be covered up. Just fucking crazy people who had nothing to go on. The media is having a freak out because their bosses are in on it. The conspiracy fuckwits are if anything going to help cover up their crimes because you have a guy like David Icke injecting new world order lizard people all while claiming to be the second coming of christ.

               I totally agree with you. Now what if I had this one conspiracy theory that is so outlandish, so crazy, but still I believe it to be true even though I have seen through the MSM lies and I have a bachelor degree in software engineering. Would you be willing to engage with me with an open mind and debate the various points in a constructive manner?

            "Pizzagate is real" seems to have come in response to "Pizzagate is fake" via calling it "fake news".
           </p>
           <p>
            There were a lot of people just looking at stuff from social media, business media and so on, while also reading about the connections between certain people, and looking at the wikileaks emails, and they were concerned that some nefarious shit was going on. So having decided that it all combined seemed rather suspicious, they started investigating further and trying to raise awareness. The investigation itself was called "pizzagate".
           </p>
           <p>
            That is my recollection of watching it unfold, anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when people say it is "fake" it's like.. what are you talking about specifically? And most won't specify, since even they don't know what they are calling "fake" specifically. Most who call it "fake" come across like they are saying the evidence people are looking at it is fake, at best, or if we interpret it at its most nonsensical, they are saying that people being suspicious about the material is fake. Or hell who knows. Some outlets have claimed that it's a conspiracy theory about Clinton abusing children in the back of CPP, although I never actually saw that theory, myself, in the whole time I've been following this. So who fking knows what they are trying to call "fake".
           </p>
           <p>
            But most of the evidence is real. Not all of it, occasionally some BS lead comes up that needs to be debunked. But most of it. And my concern for kids who might be getting abused is real. And child predators existing in powerful governments is real, though it is difficult to pinpoint enough to prosecute. The wikileaks emails are real.
