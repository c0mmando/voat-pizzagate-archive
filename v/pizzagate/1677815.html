            Although Huffpo drives me nuts daily posting this link to eyesshut friends might be a good first step.  Some people do love HP and would hear it more from them than a different source.

            "The CIA says that human trafficking is the third largest criminal industry in the world. It falls right behind drugs and gun smuggling. They also state that women are especially vulnerable in New York and that it is a prime destination for human traffickers because of the international borders and ports, large immigration population as well as the tourists"  You don't say CIA. What a joke.

            DOn't look a gift horse in the mouth they say. This is a great up-to-date well-researched and referenced article, as far as it goes. It does not go into the issue of prosecution and enforcement, but raises the question "why is this allowed to exist?" in any reader.

            What I also find interesting is their stats. I want to tear them apart and examine the source. For example, am I reading that the FBI has only rescued 433 child victims in 13 years? (*1).  That's less than 3 kids a month! How many staff and millions of dollars of resources and technology tools are being used for this endeavor? Facebook, snapchat, instagram, etc can identify more people in five minutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we know 20,000 victims are being sold each year (how DO we know this?) (*2) and we know all this information about from where and how, why haven't the law enforcement agencies obtained a better rate of rescue?
           </p>
           <p>
            UNICEF has an interesting stat (*3). Have they timed it? Are they measuring their own production rate?
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA says human trafficking IS the 3rd largest criminal enterprise (*4).  Of course the CIA would know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Readers and consumers of information should really examine provided stats.  Do they make sense (3 victims saved per month on millions of $$ of resources)? How do the stats from different agencies reconcile with one another?  Do they make sense? Are the stats conflicting with each other? Why? Who is providing the info, and what role does that agency play in the overall scheme of rescuing victims?
           </p>
           <p>
            The government purposely makes the process unclear and complicated. It does not want general consumers of information to really understand, because understanding would lead to questions. Don't take it at face value.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone want to review the legislation that is mentioned in the article and see how it helped or hurt the legal efforts?
           </p>

            References from original posted article.:
           </p>
           <p>
            (1)Since 2003, according to FBI Director Robert Mueller, only 433 of the child victims have been rescued and only 308 hookers and pimps have been prosecuted for these crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) Nearly 20,000 victims are sold and trafficked each year. This number includes the victims who are as young as 5 and 6 years of age.
           </p>
           <p>
            (3) According to UNICEF every two minutes a child is being prepared for sexual exploitation. 1.2 million children alone are being trafficked every year. This number excluded the millions already being held captive by trafficking. UNICEF also reports that approximately 30 million children have lost their childhood through sexual exploitation over the past 30 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            (4) The CIA says that human trafficking is the third largest criminal industry in the world. It falls right behind drugs and gun smuggling. They also state that women are especially vulnerable in New York and that it is a prime destination for human traffickers because of the international borders and ports, large immigration population as well as the tourists.

            Huffington Post is one of the worst propaganda outlets along with Salon, NYT, Washnington times. I would never look to one of their articles to suggest they are turning a new leaf. It is not possible. They are Deep State propaganda. That would never be allowed to change.

            I'm a little skeptical but this could be for real. They may have actually started getting the message finally. But who the fuck knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it is for real then it won't be long now until the mathematics behind "going viral" takes over. Exponential growth just needs a tiny critical mass before all hell breaks lose.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's that? Why didn't that happen with 9/11?
           </p>
           <p>
            Easy answer, you never saw anyone in the MSM legitimizing the facts surrounding the 9/11 Truth movement. I could be wrong but you never saw somebody like the HUFFPO acknowledge the 9/11 conspiracy may actually be real.
           </p>
           <p>
            As bad as 9/11 was it wasn't about poor, destitute throw-away children. There's something faaaaaaaar more sinister in child trafficking. Raping and harvesting the organs of throw-away children is such concentrated evil it has to be dealt with. There is no debate over "nano-thermite" and the melting point of steal that would make people's eyes roll.
           </p>
           <p>
            An epidemic of child trafficking is "All hands on deck!" and "Katie bar the door!". The CIA's Brownstone Operations devolved into getting the worst type of dirt on a politician imaginable. That was great at first, any politician caught with that kind of dirt would not only eat out of your hand they'd probably pay you for the privilege. Eventually though normal non-Psychopaths will find out and react in horror and get all righteously indignant about it.

             Critical mass will happen if/when this becomes a good vs. evil conversation instead of the current Republican  (alt-right) vs. Democrat.

             TPTB want this to be about politics, when really that isn't the case at all.  I despise McCain as much as I do Clinton after seeing and understanding their true agenda.

            In the first fucking paragraph: "It was because of slavery that the states succeeded."  Please note that they might be trying to use this word and the go "oops" we meant "seceded."  That's actually how I read it the first time...and then I thought "wait, none of the states seceded during and after the Civil War - there were threats, but it didn't happen." Then I read it again and summarily shit my pants. Please tell me that they aren't going to try to normalize slavery.

             They are indeed trying to normalize slavery.  They have already succeeded. Some people on this site see nothing wrong with the slavery of black and brown people.  They are considered inferior by many on the right.  They are blamed for their own plight. Text books are being changed regarding slavery and so are many other things that we held true.  These will all be considered "fake news" by the media and their three headed monsters. The Koch Bros. are behind this.  Charles Koch was in Epstein's Little Black Book.  They are all inter-connected.  They are out to normalize their agenda.  We must keep watch and our Eyes Wide Open.  Do not fall for their trying to separate us all.  We must stand up for each other no matter our religion, race or sex for otherwise they have won.  We are greater fighters in numbers.  The better to beat this horrible mess they have created.  They have poisoned our world.  We have to take it back TOGETHER.

              carmencita, thank you for your thoughts. I thought for sure that I had read that wrong, but went back and literally felt heartbroken. I agree with you, that some people on this site don't see anything wrong with marginalizing others...it is always my goal to stay away from doing that, even when I disagree. This is called basic respect for my fellow human beings, however in general that ideology seems to be falling by the wayside. Do you have any insight into any organization working currently to fight the normalization of human slavery/trafficking/child pedophilia? If no organization exists today, we need one! We should all be coming together to fight evil...NOT to fight with each other over who deserves to be treated like a human being. Even as I type this, it is hard for me to believe that we are moving backward on this issue, rather than forward. Thank you, again, for your thoughts. I'm going to try to find organizations (not Soros, or other ass-backward globalist funded NGO) with the above stated mission. Let me know if you end up pursuing this at all, and what you find! Peace, love and strength from me to you!

               I too have been heart broken may times but am not going to let them get to me.  I have also thought about us getting together to start some kind of organization without pizzagate talk, for they will surely try to kill it.  Nothing religious, for the heads of religions will try to worm their way in, etc.  Non-denominational Americans coming together to save our country's children by helping their parents to become good parents.  There is no organization that teaches our children in high school how to become strong adults and parents (if they wish to do so only).  If they do not find themselves as parents, they still will know how to be good aunts and uncles or how to respect and treat other children.  Children are our future.  A country that does not take care of it's young and old will eventually fall.  There would of course be many wrinkles to be ironed out in my ideas.  Maybe it will never come to pass but I will still be able to some way achieve this in small increments on my own.  Thank you for listening.

            I hear what you are all saying re: this story being just an attempt to cover up the real scandal of the establishment's involvement. I agree that's absolutely what Huff Post is trying to do...
           </p>
           <p>
            However...
           </p>
           <p>
            I am feeling a little more optimistic about the opportunity it presents.  For example, I can re-tweet this article to all my sleepy liberal twitter followers without triggering them.  That's a very difficult thing to accomplish these days as TPTB have been so successful at dividing us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure it's not the full story, but baby steps will be the most effective way to open eyes.

             I opened the Eyes Wide Shut of our friends last night and they were in mortal shock.  Just the exact people I thought would never accept my story, have their minds made open now.  The husband believes but with some reservations, his wife believes much, but she is still watching the Oscars tonight.  I told her about Nicole Kidman and her father, but did not go into the whole Hollywood Story and Background. Also mentioned Fiona Barnett.  Too much for one evening.  They wonder what to do about it all.  I said that is what we here are doing.  Hoping to open the eyes of many that have had their Eyes Wide Shut.

               Yeah, we really don't see any of the new movies.  We also cut the cord about 2 years ago.  Now get local news from tv and everything else on the internet.  My next plan is to make them aware of the CNN brain washed robots by the elites.  They have all made really suspect remarks about pedophelis as I have read on here in many reports.  But I am going to let what I told them sink in for awhile. Yeah and no Oscars for us tonight.  We will take it all in tomorrow morning on our local news station.

              I think of how absolutely mortified my staunch liberal friends would be if they saw and processed even a fraction of what we have discovered.  It's a much safer space for them to buy into the MSM one-line dismissal as pedophilia allegations being an "alt-right conspiracy theory."

               Taking the "red pill" to unveil the sick truth is very disconcerting. It challenges ideologies and the view of some people that you may have once held in high regard. It also reveals the truth of the evil that has been hidden for many until they open their eyes, Many find it far easier to take the "blue pill" and remain uninformed...ignorance is bliss.
              </p>
              <p>
               The easiest pathway to get someone to open their mind to this, I think, is to start with the reality...pedos are real...then show them some videos of survivors and the stories they independently share...show them the visuals/images of children/sexual innuendo/perverse art from the sickos we have discovered (the instagram foundation)...show how these disturbing themes pervade the network of friends...show them some videos from Heavy Breathing...show them actual articles "debunking" our findings, having them read the pieces after exposure to this tip of the iceberg...then ask them: Do you think this has been investigated or is being fought tooth and nail? Show them the Ben Swann video and then reveal how it was removed within 24 hours under the lie that there was a problem with the url. Once they realize the censorship, the next question of "why" opens the door to the bigger reality of pedo control of the elite through compromise and threat...and actual murder (next case to show is Monica Peterson, what she was investigating, and the media cover up of this). Once they have seen this picture, the red pill will have been swallowed, and hopefully they have the strength to join the movement.

               I can't tell you how surprised I was at the two that accepted my information and the one that does not accept it.  The one that does not is so very much in tune with what is going on in the world, but it is not what we know to be true.  She has now said, Oh, those Pizzagaters still have a hold one you?  Oh, my how frustrating that was for me to hear.  I am so much working harder now to expose it, for I cannot wait to see her face when it explodes.  Not out of revenge, but out of sincere friendship.  I feel so good about opening the Eyes Wide Shut of my other two friends.  I am sure they are both taking it all in now and trying to process it all.  I have now decided to call it my "Red Pilling Dinner".

                Cognitive dissonance.  Like former neo-feminists who realize what they've been doing.  It's just too embarrassing to admit the truth.  So much pride in a humans, it's hard to overcome.

                 Yes. Cognitive dissonance should be a concept we all understand when trying to convince a neophyte about this pedocracy reality. We should explain what it means...basically that humans have a protective mechanism in which we will generally ignore or toss out facts or ideas that challenge our core thinking as this makes us very uncomfortable. Explain that this happens to everyone. It probably happened to each one of us along the way. Explain that this is not partisan. People that we once held in esteem have been revealed to us to be part of this pedo sickness, and it was disturbing to discover. But we are happy to now know so that we can try to change things and save these poor kids who are being victimized.

            Looks like just another story to try and make us believe they are actually against this or maybe even doing something about it.  But as others have mentioned, no talk of the dirty politicians. But also keep in mind, for them to point the finger at the true pesos, they would have to point it at themselves

            Not one mention of the elites' involvement. Not one mention of the murders, satanic rituals or torture. No mention of the celebrities implicated... TELL THE REAL FUCKING STORY FFS.

             They won't and never will.  Not now.  Unless, someone of high regard puts their life on the line, but whose gonna do that, especially after seeing what happens to those who try.  It's such a sad, helpless situation.
