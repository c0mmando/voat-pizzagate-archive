<ul>
<li>Account started 11/23/2016 (day after Reddit ban); last comment 7/27/2017 (LONG before QAnon ever appeared)</li>
<li>Comments a lot on <a href="https://voat.co/u/swordfish69">@swordfish69</a> posts </li>
<li>His comments sound a lot like those of <a href="https://voat.co/u/alphabravo">@alphabravo</a>, who<a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/2733030"> got us started researching QAnon</a> in Nov. 2017 (is polite and encouraging and talks like an outsider)</li>
<li>For example he <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2012464/9937475/10#9937475">says</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Imagine what can be achieved when no one takes credit &quot;.... Good Iuck Swordfish .. ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And look how he <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1692689/8294874/10#8294874">talks about Podesta</a>: &quot;This guy works for you Paid by govt funding which essentiaIIy is your tax money Not to mention he\'s a baby eating satanist ffs ;)&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Note he says &quot;you&quot; not &quot;us&quot; ...like someone who is &quot;not from around here&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h1>His submission history is VERY interesting. He only made three submissions, all to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>:</h1>
<p>The first is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428962">&quot;PizzaGate&quot;</a> on 11/23/2016 the day after the Reddit ban, which is a simple <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/8igl6e.png">thank you note</a>.  (Tone is remniscent of alphabravo)</p>
<p>The second is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428991">DoD Pedo investigation.</a> also on 11/23/2016, which is a link to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Ol3jJ/all">a very large imgur album</a> titled Pedowood Files <em>created 7/2/2013</em>. <sup>(Coincidence Trump\'s only tweet that day was <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/351930565626298368">this</a>?&quot;)</sup> </p>
<p>Please look at the content of that link and tell me if this isn\'t the motherload of interesting shit! It\'s a bunch of FOIA documents relating to MKUltra and a bunch of other CIA programs, information on that DoD child porn investigation which seemed to disappear from the news, and more paintings by the SRA victim artist Kim Noble who did the painting of the adult raping the child on top of a square of cloth. There is even a pic of Anderson Cooper holding a child\'s drawing of an owl (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2442144">not discovered until 9 months ago by angelafogo</a>). There are a bunch of images I have not seen before. Have you guys seen all these? Please look through it!</p>
<p>I feel like this &quot;drop&quot; he made needs to be gone through with a fine-toothed comb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Incidentally, Michael Flynn Jr <sup>(part of Q team?)</sup> also <a href="https://twitter.com/mflynnJR/status/839879568488030210">tweeted about Podesta\'s Art</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The last submission is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1519908">James Alefantis Identity</a> a month later on 12/27/2016, which is an <a href="https://archive.fo/0U32J">archive</a> of a Buffalo News newspaper obituary of Alefantis\' mother. He doesn\'t make any comments on the thread initially. He just silently drops the crumb. VieBleu posts a bunch of info on AHEPA the same day it\'s posted, and almost a month later on 1/20/2017, IamQ replies, saying &quot;Thanks for that info Much appreciated #KillRoomHunter&quot;. That is his first Voat comment, despite two previous submissions. </p>
<p>A week later (though probably unrelated), Atko <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/1597313">announces</a> he\'s handing Voat over to Putt.</p>
<p>If you do a SearchVoat on &quot;Alefantis&quot; you find that there are <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=Alefantis&amp;s=&amp;u=&amp;d=&amp;df=&amp;dt=&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on&amp;o=on">pages of submissions</a> prior to this obituary drop by IamQ. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1440343">Several</a> researchers had already been working on Alefantis\' family tree. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439057">This post</a> on 11/26/2016 included a reference to his mother\'s obituary, but not the obit itself. It looks like it fell prey to forum sliding (<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/cwerbf.png">784 views but only 3 upvotes</a>). This was the week of the Reddit migration. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1503928">This post</a> just a week prior to IamQ\'s last submission, summarizes the findings on Alefantis\' ancestors, including his descent from a Mayflower family, but remains blithely ignorant of AHEPA connections.</p>
<p>AHEPA was also overlooked in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439624">this other 11/27/2017 post</a> by <a href="https://voat.co/u/szyrk">@szyrk</a>, about Alefantis\' childhood. The comments have some interesting stuff, though, including the claim he graduated from Georgetown Dayschool (not sure where that came from), which <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/hgcwo9.png">piqued RebelSkum\'s interest</a> due to molestation charges. A user also comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whoisonfirst 1 points (+1|-0) 2.1 years ago </p>
<p>The CIA has been breeding MkUltra, manchurian candidates&quot;, baby\'s raped from birth and kept in cages, later put into scientology homes where they can be trained to put on the fake smile ( like all who work at comet-pizza )</p>
<p>Since 1940\'s when operation-paperclip brought all of Hitlers \'super soldier\' program to USA the US-MIL (CIA/NSA/MOSSAD) has been creating 10\'s of 1,000\'s of robot\'s Now that was 60 years ago, Today we\'re into second generation robots controlled to be violent perverts since birth, all addicted to sex, and blood of children, as like vampires the universal program is that these young children are taught to EAT the weak. They are addicted to human blood and tissue. Elephant-fat-arse ( I like children ) is a fake name this is a fake person, this is all a story, a simple story for simple minds. GQ list of top 50 ppl in DC is bullshit, hell they put HRC at what #10, elephant man at best was boy friend of Brock (CTR) a long time ago for a short-time, he\'s a mirage, and everything to fed to all on the net is bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, here we have the &quot;vampire&quot; blood drinking adrenochrome narrative we\'ve seen pushed by <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1512381">the Amalek/Sarah bots</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2205549/10861581">Esotericshade</a>, and which made me think <a href="https://voat.co/u/Nomochomo">@Nomochomo</a> was a shill when he launched his account with a <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=&amp;s=&amp;u=Nomochomo&amp;d=&amp;df=&amp;dt=&amp;nsfw=off&amp;o=on">multipart series</a> on &quot;The Vampires of AHEPA&quot;. </p>
<p>Is <a href="https://voat.co/u/whoisonfirst">@whoisonfirst</a> a shill trying to associate MKUltra (true) with vampire/blood harvesting stuff (maybe true, maybe partly true) and Alefantis being a fake name (false) to cover the true elements? </p>
<p>So to recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>11/26/2016 szyrk posts Alefantis\' parents\' obits which gets 784 views, 3 upvotes and 1 downvote</li>
<li>11/27/2016 WatcherWatcher posts asking about JA\'s childhood, which gets 1053 views but only 5 upvotes</li>
<li>11/27/2016 CaroleLandis posts &quot;Possible James Alefantis family tree and background.&quot; which gets 4114 views but only 30 upvotes and 4 downvotes.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these made the AHEPA connection before they were slid from the front page. </p>
<p>IamQ\'s 12/27/2016 Alefantis drop is the first to mention AHEPA (in VieBleu\'s comment), a masonic organization for Greeks. A SearchVoat of &quot;Ahepa&quot; <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=Ahepa&amp;s=&amp;u=&amp;d=&amp;df=&amp;dt=&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on&amp;o=on">shows</a> researchers only stumbled into this in 2017. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Doesn\'t it seem a lot like QAnon, the way IamQ drops the obit link, then comes back and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1519908/7387467">affirms</a> VieBleu\'s comment about AHEPA when she figures out the significance? Edit: QAnon has repeatedly said &quot;Follow the wives&quot;, and this obit mentions the women\'s arm of AHEPA, the Daughters of Penelope. Could this have anything to do with that <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5680">mysterious Hillary email</a> that mentioned the &quot;Owl/Minerva Rule&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is it that we have a pizzagate researcher dropping highly significant crumbs with the username &quot;IamQ&quot; a year before QAnon showed up on 4chan?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this a case of Q nudging us to look at specific stuff we weren\'t picking up on our own? How many times has he said &quot;You have more than you know?&quot; Future proves past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If IamQ is QAnon or part of the Q team, what does that say about the &quot;vampire&quot; theory of pizzagate?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WTH have I stumbled into, here?</p>

They are addicted to human blood and tissue. Elephant-fat-arse ( I like children ) is a fake name this is a fake person, this is all a story, a simple story for simple minds. GQ list of top 50 ppl in DC is bullshit, hell they put HRC at what #10, elephant man at best was boy friend of Brock (CTR) a long time ago for a short-time, he's a mirage, and everything to fed to all on the net is bullshit.

           IamQ's 12/27/2016 Alefantis drop is the first to mention AHEPA (in VieBleu's comment), a masonic organization for Greeks. A SearchVoat of "Ahepa"

            So I was watching the dark side of youtube earlier and i did come across a very interesting video.  In this video it was claimed that to "Vril" who are these you know reptilians CT's have been talking about forever actually enter peoples bodies during some satanic ritual where they enter thru the eye leaving a black eye as the only evidence. This was interesting to me bc I have been trying to figure out this whole black eye thing we keep seeing in celebs and politicians.  This is out there but could it be something like this is actually real and these Vril cause the host to basically become a vampire type????  I mean there is a long history of vampire stories?  I dont know, very aware how crazy that sounds, but would explain why this clean up is not a simple as we would think it should be.  Food for thought.

            !   You have always posted great info.
I’m no researcher, but I can pick up on patterns.  IamQ used the word “essentially”
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy works for you Paid by govt funding which essentiaIIy is your tax money Not to mention he's a baby eating satanist ffs ;)"
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you noticed how many times Trump uses that word?  ALOT !
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway thanks for your work.   I used to post a lot about Planned Parenthood .   Still believe they’re involved in the blood/organ cabal.

             Hmmm...interesting observation, 4f. "Not to mention" is also a verbal tick that might be worth watching. That would be pretty hilarious if Trump himself dropped those crumbs for us. Q is most definitely

             I, too, believe Planned Parenthood is key -- especially if population control of the masses/longevity of the elite is the overarching concern of the Cabal. Embrionic stem cells are pluripotent and may be useful in treating
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_stem_cell">
              various diseases of aging as well as tissue engineering
             </a>
             . Parabiosis research has shown that

              young blood transfusion
             </a>
             can improve the health of older mice. Though both of these theoretical treatments
             <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/parabiosis-the-next-snakeoil/">
              remain unproven

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              So, what was Jacob J. Sullivan’s qualms with the last paragraph of this seminal Clinton email, an email which was the last internal communication required to cement the official Whitehouse position for Obama and Clinton regarding the 2011 NATO/CIA regime change operation taking place in Libya? Why did this pretty innocuous sounding last paragraph require Hillary’s opinion on whether it violated something formally known as the ‘Owl/Minerva Rule’? The answer is, that the globalist controlled
              <em>
               Minervian Powers
              </em>
              – as explained in the excerpt below – are now highly concerned about the spread of the concept of
              <em>
               self determination of populations
              </em>
              ; specifically the desirability for populations to
              <em>
               choose their own leaders
              </em>
              . This means a truly democratic public choice of a candidate offering election mandates which might be counter to globalist policies such as the Kyoto Protocol and Multilateral Trade Organizations like the TPP-TTIP-TISA, can not be tolerated by Fascist Global Socialist Technocracy! This is the true nature of European Federalism, and as Nigel Farage made clear over twenty years in the E.U. Parliamentary Chamber, the system of governance that the bureaucrats in the European Union have been slowly constructing, is entirely un-democratic, and fascistic.

             I wonder if those Chinese kindergartens that were drugging the kids that was connected to Clinton have anything to do with this.

            I had never heard the theory that MK ultra children were being sent to Scientology followers to be raised - but when you think about Operation Snow White it isn’t that crazy of a leap, really.

              In the 70’s the Scientologists infiltrates government agencies as a way to purge incriminating records, set people up and obtain info that could be used to blackmail people that wanted to speak out against them. 
Here’s a pretty good article explaining it.-http://xenutv.com/blog/what-is-scientology-2/snow-white/

               Yes. We always suspected that Scientology might have been created by the CIA.

                I remember reading a long time ago about how Scientology was kicked out of Germany for breaking into their publc school records. So that is interesting.  Wish I could remember where I read that.

              <p>
               Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.[1] It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,[2] with up to 5,000 covert agents.

            This is so interesting. There’s a lot to read. I need to dig. But from what I see so far, it makes me think of what Q says all the time, “You have more than you know”. Of all names, this user chooses IAmQ? DAMN.

             Just watched a couple of interviews from Greg Bucceroni who was involved as a young victim with Sandusky's network of high placed pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the interview by Scrapple TV, Bucceroni describes "Black Larry"  (there was another - Caucasian -  Larry) as regularly ferrying children around DC for sexual activities with government people.

            Interesting find for sure. In fact this fits my theory that Q team may have in fact helped start Pizzagate in order to start the awakening. I will do a quick run down off the top of my head.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Trump mentions Pizzagate during interview about Anthony Weiner and Weinergate on news. First known use of the word Pizzagate. (2011)
            <a href="https://youtu.be/2wAEcN9UIy8">
             https://youtu.be/2wAEcN9UIy8
            </a>
            -Wikileaks releases HRC emails. 
-Pizzagate gets started on reddit
-Trump wins election
-IamQ posting on Voat
-Q comes on board pushing pedophilia and sacrifice early on and expands on what Pizzagate uncovered
           </p>
           <p>
            So if we are to believe what we have been told, then Q team has been working on this for years. (There are several references that can back this claim up). If you were developing a plan to remove these people from power, and the citizens didn’t really know about their crimes, you would need a plan that somehow informed the public.  How could this be accomplished?
           </p>
           <p>
            Set up the HRC email leak (Seth rich?) and give the people the map and symbols (fbi) needed to decipher the emails. Let the people decipher the emails on their own in order to see the truth. Once the people saw, and were on board, come back and expand that disclosure to a full blown map of the crimes of the DS.
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s my theory. Take it or leave it. Thanks for sharing brother.

             This has the Q codes that connect JA to NSA to Q around #pizzagate from Oct - Dec 2016. Wider truth of what you say is also correct -- we've let them rob and murder us this whole time but it's going to be "crimes against children" that will be the Cabal's downfall! People won't stand for it. Once these crimes are understood as being at the core of what they're doing, their whole house of tarot cards will crumble. Swift trials, death penalty!

            It is sickening, how many citizens over the years have given information to the FBI only to be told later that no action was taken. Many of these citizens died later under suspicious circumstances. They are the casualties of this war. I wonder if we will have a monument to them one day.

               I will look for one, chelsea clinton chimed in on this too, she tweeted “there is a pizzagate 2.0? Of course there is” and gave the same human trafficking number that goes to CGI and CF.

             As I recall, there was also one about Julian Assange by one of the government agency Twitters that was also deleted or corrected.

            This reminds me of Mega Anon who posted on 4chan and claimed to be part of the alliance against the deep state. David Wilcock reported on this and was contacted by Mega Anon so in my opinion this validates that they were legitimate.

            This is an awesome find! I agree this could very well be 'our' Q, however, I do beg to differ with you on the amount of IamQ's submission count.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/IamQ">
             If you look at his profile overview
            </a>
            and scroll down to the bottom, in the middle of three lowest rated comments, you'll see a post asking users to decode a cryptic Linkin Park video. It clearly says posted by IamQ to pizzagate. However, if you go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2018672">
             the actual post
            </a>
            it says submitted by [deleted], (and also is nowhere on his submission page, just the Overview page).
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did he delete this post (and were there others that were deleted), and leave the rest? Any way to know when the deletion occurred? Post was on 7/26/2017 (which would make THIS his actual last post, almost three months to the day, 10/28/2017, of what is believed to be Q's first post on 4chan), was never edited and archived on 10/24/2017 (four days before 4chan post). Thought this was interesting relative to what happened to Chester on 7/20/2017, not to mention the possible Podesta paternity.
           </p>

            On another note, I remember lurking when the swordfish stuff was posted, probably even saw
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2012464">
             This post
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2015796">
             This one
            </a>
            and I always wondered if anything came of it. Maybe we should be looking for swordfish to be wearing green socks at the Grammy's?  😃

              Glad I could assist. : )  My mom used to love a good mystery... I read a lot of Alfred Hitchcock's and Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazines growing up. Wonder why it didn't show up in the search? Things that make you go, "Hmmmm......" .

               Well, Voat had a system-wide port to a whole new code base since then. Some stuff was probably lost from the deleted cache.

            <p>
             He didn't delete it, one of the mods must have deleted it, because it didn't adhere to the rules. If a submitter self-deletes, it always says 'deleted by author'.
            </p>

             If a mod deletes, it only says 'deleted'.

             You can go back in the deleted submissions log 1.4 years (that would be about 15 months), and look for yourself .

              Thank you for that info bit. I'm guessing it was deleted for being a link post? Why didn't it show as deleted on the profile overview page?  If people smarter than me can get to the bottom of it, looks like they need to hurry as the Linkin video post was 1.4 years ago and from what you say, the delete record will be gone soon.

                Awesome sauce, pun intended! You said you could go back in the deleted submission logs 1.4 years, where does it go after 1.4 years? I guess I assumed it gets bumped off, like on 8chan (now there's a crazy place!) unless it's archived by someone. Also, are voat submissions auto-archived at three months? I also have to learn to do that quote a few lines of a comment in a box thing, someday! I appreciate your taking the time explaining some of the intricasies of voat to me.

                 Ah, now I understand. The submission was posted 1.4 years ago, right? When it was deleted by the mods, they will have done it on the first or second day after it was posted, that why I suggested to go back 1.4 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Otherwise, you can go back in the deleted submissions log more than 2 years, in comprises all submissions that were ever deleted on

              Thankyou Moloch for pinging Vindicator, I'm still new and not comfortable bothering the 'old'goats. I was hoping V would see my comment since he obviously saw IamQ's last comment but didn't realize the deleted original poster was IamQ himself.

                Thanks again. I thought that's how it worked, but wasn't sure. I'm a technologically-challenged elder (I'm sure as hell not saying 'boomer' here  😄) with a crappy tablet, but I'm learning!

              Yep. Those headlines are wrong though. This is parabiosis, not blood "drinking". It has to be transfused.

              I mean, the phrasing and wording does not sound like Q.  We all agree on the content of the message.

              I don't see Q using "ffs".  It would be like Q saying "faggot".  Lol.

               Yes...however, it might have slipped out if he was talking informally (as opposed to formally, as Q, leaking on 8chan).

                    It could have been "staff" for Q team.  I imagine they needed someone to show them the boards and to teach them about the culture.  Probably someone who is a lower ranking computer expert in the military.  That would makke sense.

                   <p>
                    Also, I imagine they have people monitoring the boards 24/7.  They would use lower ranking computer experts for this.

               I get what you're saying, but if Q is a team and in any way influenced by Parscale and that other guy whose name escapes me, perhaps they were using the vernacular to fit in and not stick out so much. They were referenced as saying 'you' rather than 'we' like they were an outsider. Maybe the team member who posted that was on the young side and used language they were used to? But yeah, odd for Q.

            Obvious shill.  ES had spent "hours" on his 4 paragraph vampire nothingburger.  We were onto something at that time, deep into pizzagate with the Finders when he pulled that post out of his strawhat

             I remember reading that post and discussing it with him.  Maybe it is worth rereading.  If I recall correctly, ES was saying something about stomach ailments and digestion.  I know there are videos about Blood Libel and the rituals they use when sacrificing their victim and taking and consuming the blood.

             What made you add this 1987 report on the Finders Cult, if I may ask? Was there something about it in the Imgur album?

                The document from Customs in that Imgur post was the most information I have ever read about the Finders. Even after a cursory search several months ago, I had no inkling of what I read in that link from IamQ. Gonna read that WAPO story now.

            Hi Vindicator. Thanks for this great post. I believe the connection to the vampire myth is absolutely correct and i understand everyone scepticism about it. The evidence about it is frankly overwhelming. Most mentions about a a "Fountain of Youth" (do your own search on bunnyears.com, macaulay's website you will be surprised) imply it specifically. They drain blood from the young for its consumption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta mentions it in the live news
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6t6GGit9R4">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6t6GGit9R4
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe most myths regarding jews eating babies are based on these practices made by the Cabal Elite. Which were misinterpreted as being associated to jews (and also gypsies).
           </p>
           <p>
            Also i am written a thesis about the whole Food of the Gods and Ambrosia myth being an metaphor for cannibalism. I believe through history cannibalism has been a deep part of the Secret Elite Societies (which have changed their name, but not their practices or purposes). I have expressed several times how Diary of Madmen from Lu Xun tried to reveal this and then the establishment made an effort to disguise it as social criticism.
 I have found that this blood draining and brain eating practices have probably started in Ancient Egypt under the rule of the Pharaohs. The following is a great blog about the subject.
            <a href="https://bibleforzombies.blogspot.com">
             http://bibleforzombies.blogspot.com
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now. Cannibalism and blood drinking is fully being endorsed by science.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only cool thing about all these revelations is that Pizzagate investigators can now define themselves as Vampire Hunters ;)

             FWIW, if your research points to it starting, it may be because it’s hard to get data on what happened prior to the invention of writing.

             I like your attitude, AF. :-)
            </p>
            <p>
             Because of the massive amount of shilling I've dealt with over the past two years I can tell you with 100% confidence that they are pushing disinfo on this topic with more force than possibly any other. My suspicion is that they are covering something real -- such as parabiosis for longevity + sick ritual use of blood a la Spirit Cooking -- by swamping the topic with tons of crazy-ass stuff no one can ever back up with solid evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stuff that is designed to distract people with BS, stretch the Overton Window of disbelief and make them more susceptible to shills.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you look at the history of EsotericShade, you will see that those who fell for his manipulations were those who bought into the tantalizing adrenochrome/blood harvesting storyline, which was pushed by major Hollywood figures as well as shills here.

              Just the fact that man stream media and those in positions to reveal and/or combat these horrors have either gone silent, muddied the waters, or outright rubbished these nightmarish realities, speaks volumes.
 This thing is ancient and goes deeper and higher up than so many of us can believe.
God help us all.

              What stuns me every single time is the media’s spin of something clearly awful as positive.  For example, “Research has found that child’s blood may hold the secret to the fountain of youth.”  Then they explain how youthful blood has restorative properties, blah, blah...  And those sleeping fools go “Wow, how interesting”!  Not realizing exactly what the implications are.  It’s just one more question these people need to ask and they don’t.  Why do intelligent people (I know a lot of them) just accept and move on, never thinking about the consequences of the research or policies being pushed?

               I assume you noticed the recent public statement issued by the FDA (no friend of any patriot) statong any health claims re parabiosis are untrue/not proven?  That very public drop caught my attention yugely😉  While I do not know whether the alleged satanic and evil
harvesting of children under abuse is true, I know for a fact that we are over the target investigating, because

              I understand your points, and yes, distraction has been a method for shillers. But another method has been to make everyone appear like loonies. "so now, you believe in vampire?".
 Lately also, we have seen shillers disguising themselves as sadists "i would love to get one of those pedos in a room with my blowtorch". The whole idea is to delegitimize investigation by making it sound, well,crazy. The vampire storyline serves as a well placed bait for anybody willing to delve into mumbo jumbo shillery. That does not mean it is not real, it just means it sells to a naive public.
The main problem i have found with the vampire storyline is that it has been hidden by the same people who has fought against it. Its a conundrum. The practice has been hidden because nobody wants people to know that drinking blood from the young actually works for health. It would be dangerous. And thats why i have found that scholars go around it, not mentioning directly but giving just enough hint to understand what they are talking about.

              Take a look at this and compared it against Podesta's fountain of youth video.

               "i would love to get one of those pedos in a room with my blowtorch". - That sounds like something I'd say after a drink or two.

              <p>
               Enlighten me on this vampire discussion/debate.  Are you saying that the adenochrome/CSF consumption isn't real?  Or are you saying that the "vampire" narrative is made up to discredit the A/CSF consumption?

                my conclusion has long been that the vampirism might only be practiced by the top 3% of pizzagate participants. As such, while its 'real' , its not a major motivator or factor and serves to turn off newbies who might otherwise be on the cusp of accepting / understanding the more common utility / motivation - the loyalty through criminal complicity

             The idea that an elite addiction to adrenochrome or some other substance in the blood of tortured children is what lies behind the tens of thousands of children that go missing every year. Do a SearchVoat on Rh- blood, adrenochrome, pineal gland, or coloboma and you will see exactly what I'm talking about. We have been spammed with shitposts on the topic from Day One. Some users have researched it and not much evidence to support it has been found, though there is some. Parabiosis (the transfusion of young blood to cure diseases of aging) does appear to have scientific merit, however.

              great thanks. i guessed thats why Kubrick shows the vampire in clockwork orange along with the words 'drencrom' (adrenochrome) in the milk bar..The name Moloch results from a dysphemic vocalisation in the Second Temple period of a theonym based on the root mlk, or"king"
MLK is Milk, Moloko Plus is Moloch

             Having seen probably thousands of posts of both info and disinfo since October 2016 when Wikileaks dropped the Podesta emails, I would say we have been witnessing a sophisticated communication campaign that began with FBIAnon's leaks on /pol/ in July of 2016, continued with the recruitment of /pol/ and Reddit's
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics">
              r/politics
             </a>
             and
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">
              r/The_Donald
             </a>
             for meme warfare during the Republican primary (i.e. the rise of Pepe), exploded with the help of Wikileaks via the Podesta and DNC emails, the dropping of the pedo food codes on /pol/, the release of the pedo logos by the FBI Record Vault, and the creation of
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">
              r/Pizzagate
             </a>
             , was explicitly helped by Steve Pieszcenik on YouTube, and the Twittergate pedo scandal, and then got a rocket boost from the brutal, cross-platform censorship and "debunking" campaign that silenced Julian Assange, booted
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">
              r/Pizzagate
             </a>
             off of Reddit, shut down Sli.mg, Ben Swann, thousands of Twitter accounts, DDoSed Voat, and finally went into full force with the arrival of QAnon, who has confirmed many of the discoveries we made investigating pizzagate.

              A lot of planning for Qteam no doubt.  Using the controlled opposition too, imo, (Corsi/Alex Jones/Steve Pieszcenik/George Webb).

              Exactly. That's what I thought. Pizzagate and Qanon matched perfectly. I was not around, when Pepe started, but I was already researching about elite pedos since 2014. So I was very early into Pizzagate. Q just seemed to continue where pizzagate was "stopped" (by censorship and MSM)....

              Vindicator, that is an excellent analysis and summary.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would add that multiple channels have been employed by the Q team in broader efforts to get information out.
Sites such as CDAN and Victory Of The Light contain WAY more information than individuals alone would be able to posses.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a contrary type of view, the people/sites/institutions that put forth the most efforts to demean researchers (noticeable as well as subtle) would be revealing which 'side' they are truly on.
This is an invaluable intelligence point when waging a multifaceted, obfuscatory information war.
             </p>

              Thanks, big-time, for your ongoing efforts.

Big duh for us. I'm going to 'smartly' get over how chagrined I feel at having been so caught up in despair that I failed to see the crumbs laid out over the ages...eg., Aesop, Brothers Grimm, Shakespeare, H C Anderson, and many 'Anons.' And, of course, the Bible. The Art of Obfuscation works both ways. ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            Much love, and gratitude to all the diggers, truffle sniffers, autists, anons, patriots, benevolent off-worlders, and especially, those of you who actually grok the semiotics at play in our sector of the Game Board.

             The fact that Dave McGowan died just 6 months after being diagnosed with cancer leads to suspicions of bioweapon tactics.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that Judyth Vary Baker (Oswald's  mistress in New Orleans), was involved in black op  cancer research in the 60s just adds to these suspicions.
The Spartacus Educational site is a treasure trove of info on all this stuff.

              The timing of McGowan's diagnosis and death are suspicious to say the least.  Do you have any links to subject matter in 2nd para?  Thanks.

               Googling  'Judyth Vary Baker cancer research'  brings up a bunch of enlightening posts, with the fourth one down being the Spartacus Educational piece.
I thank you also for your ongoing efforts.

                We all have a dog in this fight.  The Finders were one of the various "operations" from MK programs.  Same as DC Rentboys; CPP; FSB; etc.  The documentation is there to support a trafficking network, likely taking boys from the FL Panhandle to DC.  Maybe vice versa.  Early ratlines.  Wards of the state were forced into certain institutions which fed the ratline.  Areas where the CIA had active MK research programs likely coincided with nearby military facilities; orphanages; insane asylums; reformatories; and adult correctional facilities.

                  Well.....many of us have been here for one or two years already....I think doing an archive is not
                  <em>
                   so
                  </em>
                  dangerous...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  ;-) But that's totally up to you to decide, of course. Was just wondering since I didn't know your screenname, and saw that you just signed up with it. ;-)

              First of all, thanks for posting. Great disovery. Perhaps there are more parts to the whole 'you have more than you know' expression. Crumbs submitted but not referenced directly, in order to keep PG separate from Q (for obvious reasons).
             </p>
             <p>
              Could be "confirmed" if any of Q's posts have referenced these submissions in the past, though, as is tradition, not disproven if not.

               I've always personally thought if you believe Q then you have to believe PG since they both involve the same deep state criminals.

            This makes total sense.  Why wouldn’t Q &amp; company try a few times to get this out?  Sometimes you have to try different ways to get peoples attention.  Plus I think it’s interesting to think crumbs were left elsewhere for the talented Anons to find which shed new light.  Hindsight is 20/20 because it’s all a bit clearer in retrospect.  Finding that out ALL the time these days.  Thanks for sharing!

              I fixed the link:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gViN6xLxxN8">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gViN6xLxxN8
              </a>
              ("COMET PIZZA on Food Channel")
             </p>
             <p>
              The last part (behind "=") was ok, the rest seemed to be temporary by duckduckgo and not valid anymore.

            , you may want to have a look at this and add some details about what made you post about AHEPA as your first submissions. It appears we've had a mixture of truth and disinfo posted by many users on the blood harvesting theory of pizzagate, and that QAnon may have been here in

             I probably have two other (AHEPA-&gt;ALEFANTIS family) posts worth of info set aside. I haven't posted them yet due to initial pushback, but I will return to them and try to post them soon.

              Thanks. Just remember -- any woo woo highly speculative stuff needs to be labeled as such, and all factual claims need supporting links. That's how we fight the scourge of disinfo up in here. :-)  If a post is pure speculation/conjecture, it goes in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              (though you are welcome to add links to it to posts in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              that are more hardhitting, supported research.

             A. I followed pizzagate from the original Chan posts about "pizza" in the Podesta Leaks. A lot of the early research focused on Comet Pizza &amp; JA Family. His mother, Susan Alefantis signed a letter on behalf of a pedophile school teacher. [

            <p>
             B. I watched articles get scrubbed online RE: Lee Alefantis (thus I first discovered the need to archive and dove into PGate - the deletion hinted at relevancy). Specifically, there was a "tasting-table" article discussing an Italian Restaurant that was designed/built by Lee Alefantis' Tribeca Builders' company. It was on the 32nd or 33rd degree floor of its NY buiding, (a significant masonic symbol/degree).  If anyone else remembers or has an archive, plz let me know

             All of these Masonic indications led me to look into the history of AHEPA and it's connections to Political Elite/the Deep State. I discovered the following points of interest

             </li>
             <li>
              Scottish Rite Freemasonry recognizes AHEPA as an official MASONIC organization, and required an oath of silence and loyalty [

             </li>
             <li>
              AHEPA members were recruited for WWII intelligence work; infiltrated Greece pretending to be Communist Sympathizers; Were involved in State Department, CIA, OWI, OSS and other DEEP STATE AGENCIES (also many Presidents and Congressman were members)
             </li>
             <li>
              AHEPA lobbied to change legal definitions to allow children with
              <strong>
               living parents
              </strong>
              to be imported from Greece as "orphans"; AHEPA was the main fundraising organization selling WAR BONDS, AHEPA used disaster propaganda as a PSYOP to increase international adoptions
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2809501">

             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Given the Masonic and Intelligence agency ties, I began researching international Adoptions facilitated by AHEPA. AHEPA was taken to court by the New York DA in the 50's for illegally selling orphans. The President of AHEPA (Stephen Scopas) was the main lawyer facilitating the trafficking. He also built a Greek version of "Boystown" across from Westpoint where the Greek Orthodox Church housed Greek Orphans. In the 70's-90's tons of Greek Adoptees discovered that they were stolen out of Greek Orphanages and Maternity Wards (their birth parents were told they died in birth). They were mainly trafficked to NY and Canada through AHEPA adoption programs on which Scopas was the documented Magistrate.

            </p>
            <p>
             ^Further in the comments I note that the Greek Boystown (St. Basil's Academy) has been the subject of numerous lawsuits brought against it by New York's Family Welfare Dept in which they tried to revoke Basil's charter because it operated illegally/without proper licensing....Moreover, in the 2000s a Greek girl was brought from Greece to serve as an Organ Donor for her "brother" in NY. The brother died before the operation and the mother apparently abandoned her daughter to St. Basil's. This made me search for AHEPA connections to medicine and medical trafficking
            </p>
            <p>
             !!! SO LET'S RECAP:
             <strong>
              Alefantis' family were governing members of a New York based Masonic Organization that has been documentably proven to have illegally kidnapped and trafficked children through war-destabilization efforts, legislative shenanigans, and international adoption programs
             </strong>
             !!! This same organization has connections to shady orphanages and child-organ donation.

             </a>
             ] In it I theorize
             <em>
              why
             </em>
             these Mediterranean Masons are facilitating child trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             My Thesis: Elite Inbred families have higher incidence of genetic disorders that cause gradual organ failure. The need for fresh tissue transplants partially drives child trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             AHEPA is involved in blood transfusion research. AHEPA President, Orphan Thief, and President of St. Basil's Academy, "Stephen Scopas served until his death as the National Chairman of the Ahepa Cooley's Anemia Foundation". Cooley's Anemia, is a genetic blood disorder that requires weekly or monthly FULL BODY BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. Thalassemia, also known as MEDITERRANIAN ANEMIA, is an ANCIENT group of diseases that have existed for over 7,000 years. The name thalassemia comes from the ANCIENT GREEK word for sea, thalassa, as the ancients believed it was an "illness that came from the sea".
            </p>
            <p>
             A high number of CARRIERS of the thalassemia genetic trait are found in countries where MARRIAGE BETWEEN RELATIVES was, and still is, common practice and in third-world or emerging countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Countries like ITALY, GREECE, and CYPRUS have the highest frequency of thalassaemia cases in the world,
             <em>
              10 percent of the Mediterranean population are carriers of this gene
             </em>
             . There exists a thalassaemic "belt" that includes the Mediterranean passing through West and Central Asian countries like TURKEY... Cooley and B. Lee (American physician) described the disease in
             <strong>
              children of Italian immigrants
             </strong>
             in the USA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thalassemia is usually FATAL IN INFANCY unless ONGOING TRANSFUSIONS are initiated.  In it’s major form, “Cooley’s Anemia” is fatal and requires bone transplant surgery. In 1972, the chapter joined hands with the Connecticut Campaign Against Cooley’s Anemia, and with Ahepan Congressman Robert Giaimo in introducing the Cooley’s Anemia Research Bill Act before the U.S. Congress, resulting in the National Funding for Cooley’s Anemia Research. Current "searches for a cure" are exploring/funding gene-editing therapy
            </p>
            <p>
             SO LET'S SUMMARIZE AGAIN:
            </p>
            <p>
             While running an illegal orphan trafficking and adoption ring, AHEPA simultaneously funds medical research into fatal, child, blood diseases that require full body transfusions (A LOT OF specifically typed/compatible BLOOD). They also organized and advertised blood drives.

               So GHW Bush. Has this roommate at his prep school. This roommates uncle is -

                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_de_Mohrenschildt
               </a>
               - I’m still looking for good details on the history of his family but apparently they were high society in Russia until the Bolshevik’s took everything. George’s de M’s bro is a professor connected to the OSS(precursor to CIA). George follows bro to US. At some point he starts dating Jackie Kennedy’s mom. Jackie called him Uncle George when she was a child. Fast forward a few decades &amp; George befriends Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas. Is interviewed by Warren Commission &amp; all. George is a “geologist”. Even looked for petroleum in Yugoslavia for Tito. So 2-3 months before JFK assassination(at this point some of the details are in book &amp; some is just additional info I’ve uncovered on my own) George de Mohrenschildt goes to Haiti where he works for is connected to Aristotle Onassis. Onassis was under investigation by RFK’s DOJ &amp; Jackie Kennedy eventually becomes Jackie Onassis. Things get weirder. At some point Mohamed Fayed(dodi Fayed’s dad... this is Princess Di’s bf at time of death)... Mohamed Fayed is banging George de Mohrenschildt’s daughter I think her named is Alexandra. Mohamed Fayed it turns out is Brother-in - law to Saudi Arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi(Adnan is the recently murdered journalist in the Saudi Embassy in Turkey’s Uncle). Adnan got his import/export business started by importing Kenworth trucks to the Bin Laden family in Saudi Arabia. Adnan was also involved in the BCCI scandal that was connected to Iran Contra. George H.W. connections are all over this... this is the best I can do to describe all the fucked up connections stream of consciousness. More details on Adnan Khashoggi here... Trump knows about all of it. He bought Adnan Khashoggi’s boat &amp; was friends w/ JFK jr. Prince Alwaleed Bin talal who currently can’t leave Saudi Arabia now owns the Khashoggi/Trump boat.

              </p>
              <p>
               Trump got the boat from the Sultan of Brunei who took it back from Khashoggi when he started having cash flow problems. Jeff Epstein picked up Bill Clinton on the Lolita Express at an airport in Japan &amp; flew him to Brunei which is known for its wild sex parties. Sultan of Brunei gave Mohamed Fayed a billionaire $ loan which is how he obtained his wealth/financial independence from Adnan. Big goddamn mess mostly over oil. US military is the #1 consumer of oil &amp; it needs to keep being the #1 consumer to be the top dog. Wild shit. Crazy characters at every corner.

                  I was thinking of the shift to the Petro Dollar just when the British Empire "died." Geopolitics made a shift from imperial hegemony to financial hegemony. From a 50,000 foot view, it seems like those who control the world went from overt (Imperial) control to covert (financial) control -- in combination with a multifaceted program to pacify the masses.

                    Geopolitics made a shift from imperial hegemony to financial hegemony. From a 50,000 foot view, it seems like those who control the world went from overt (Imperial) control to covert (financial) control

                   I completely agree, but what's @ the top of the financial trail? Holding Companies? Cults? Named Moneyed Families? Trusts? Specific Nations? Un-Named Moneyed families? Racial Subgroups? Religions?

                Certainly. You'll probably hit the character limit and have to overflow into the Comment section, unless you tighten things up quite a bit. See the Executive Summary in the sidebar for an example.

               seems to understand the importance of the Kim Noble paintings, which are directly referring to the exact type of abuse alleged and documented by victims of the Global Pedophile Ring. Also correct in the assessment that the Finders are MK Ultra and how it all relates to the British/Royal ties to Comet et al.

              Our government used to kill off people in foreign countries to destabilize governments, a horrible practice.  A better use for those assassins could be found, no?

            I'm wondering now if JA in all the early Q posts were James Alefantis and not Jillian Assuage as many of us thought it was. It would make sense as to why Jillian was never freed. I dont have the time now to research this but will look at the post later in this light.

            another notable item in the imgur  album was a Florida pan-handle school for troubled boys where 100 died - only about 50 bodies recovered, though. I looked it up on the map, and its only maybe an hour from Tallahassie - where the Finders Cult kids were found filthy in that park

             It was located near the Marianna Army Airfield, which was rumored to be an MKU programming site.  Tyndall AFB (destroyed in Hurricane Michael 2018) is also located close by.  It's all related.

             VieBleu waged a campaign to get the community to rally behind getting me made O, and minimum CCP raised to 100 (which would have kept our posts off of

             had problems with her/him from the very beginning. She started out complaining about hate speech early on, trying to get mods to delete comments. Moved to mod bashing when we didn't bend to her will, especially when we refused to advertise the protests at Comet. Every time Voat had problems with bugs during DDoS attacks, she would crank up the "Voat compromised" narrative.

                You were right. It was a very productive, active, and sometimes confusing discussion, but it produced fruit. I still don't think a lot of people understood it fully but after some of them read

                  The fundamental problem is that the deep state won't end it's own self. Me and you have to do that. Us. Its up to us, the citizens of this country have to free their own selves. Ain't nobody going to GITMO bro. Qanon will not put anybody in GITMO and by now, you should have already figured it out. I know it hurts, but embrace reality, bro.

                    Now, a crowd is assembled. We should do something with it. Like REALLY do something with it. We should funnel all this energy into something that makes a REAL difference. It will be dangerous, and you can bet on that. Helicopters will buzz your house. Been there, done that. You ready for the big time or are you just a poser? Right now you are just a poser.

                    So George Soros has a "special space." No shit. He does. He is a special Billionaire. What am I missing here? Coleman Roger (Qanon) is telling you the truth. Ain't no mystery here. Me and you can try to predict the news cycle just like Coleman Rogers does. Sometimes we will be correct and sometimes we will miss.

                    "midterm elections are safe".....huge FAIL by Coleman Roges. The DemonRats (democrats) stole the midterm elections. It was OBVIOUS voting fraud.

                    That really pissed me off. I want Trump to succeed because he tries to run this nation like a real business. Cash in cash out. I like Trump's approach to running this nation. I really do.

                     I don’t know how to make you understand that the midterm election was not a fail. Things were set in place beforehand to catch the voting fraud, which will be used to destroy the fuckers next election. Most presidents do not gain house seats at midterms. The senate was key. If you don’t follow all this, I don’t expect for you to know what I’m talking about. You’re getting your information by youtubers and people posting lies.

                    <p>
                     You must have not read thru the stuff I shared with you, because if you think we all trust this movement because Q can get some news predictions right, then you don’t understand it at all. There is not a doubt in my mind that Q works directly with Trump, and that nothing but good has come out of it, including waking up millions of more people, and making pizzagate go mainstream.

                      We got our ass kicked. The Democrats (jew fukers) have managed to install Governors in a lot of states in this country. It was obvious that the midterm elections got hijacked.

                      I am starting to warm up to this point of view. Ain't no doubt that a huge crowd is assembled. NOW, what do we do with all this busy crowd? It needs direction, focus, and some REAL goals. Needs strategy, objectives, steps, or it will all be useless. What do you suggest?

You keep coming back. You know what you’re doing. I try to stay out of it. But, now you’re bringing up Q and pinging me.

                        TY for saying this, his NPD is getting to be quite tiresome. He won't leave of coarse, too much of who he is has been tied to this place for too long. It's sad really, he could have been a real asset instead of just another lying, manipulative coward (we got plenty of those).

                         I feel bad because we were once really good friends. He changed when Q came around. I think it’s better that we don’t talk about Q with each other. He needs to leave this sub alone. This is getting old for everyone.

                   ESOTERICshade, when you add everything up, I don’t get how anyone can deny the fact that Q is directly connected with our President. Q is a team, of less than 10 people, only 3 are non military. A ton is going on behind the scenes. Have you seen the resignations and firings? The right people are being put into place. What good would it have done, if there were early arrests, when the people that would have protested them were still in power?
                  </p>

                        You are a fucking moron for promoting the above line of bullshit. None of that shit will happen. We have to build a grassroots movemnt from the bottom up, homey.

                        We have a Q movement assembled and waiting for something productive to do. Lets make the most of it. Give them some realistic goals. There is a lot of crowd funded energy in the Q movement waiting on some realistic goals. What do you suggest the Q movement do with all this energy? A real, fundamental, realistic goal? If you suggest a realistic goal I will help you promote that goal.

                         You are talking about people that have taken advantage of the Q movement, and have profited off of it. Am I right? Like clothing? An upcoming book by Neon Revolt?

                        <p>
                         There will ALWAYS be people that will profit off of any big movement. Q Team and Trump do not make money off of the Q movement. I don’t make money running a Q sub.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Q has never asked anyone to donate. In fact, Q spoke negatively about patriots taking money using the Q movement. Please strop spreading that.

                          Crowd funding is good stuff. It has also been called "mob." That is what it will take for us to get our freesom back. It won't be nice. It won't be gently. You understand that right? What would a billionaire do to remain a billionaire? He would pull strings right? Yes he would. George Soros, as powerful as he is, is only a puppet. Look higher. There are people that PRINT MONEY and they are the KINGS of this universe.

                           or Jerome Corsi, that are PAYtriots out to make money off of the movement, is not Q’s doing. You are talking about people taking advantage of Q.

                           You know that the media, and all these corrupt elites wouldn’t feel so threatened by Q, if it was just someone, or some group on 8chan that was good at predicting the news. I wouldn’t be attacked like I am. We wouldn’t be fought so hard, if all this wasn’t a huge threat. That’s got to open anyone’s eyes.

                  Reply to this...List the rules, one at a time, and explain to me how your sticky thread for Qanon met each rule. You won't and you can't, because your Qanon sticky thread didn't meet the rules. I hope you accept the challenge. It will be amusing. Your favorite word is "evidence." You ask for "evidence" regularly. The greatest body of "evidence" for Qanon is that Qanon is full of shit, and you know it. :)

                   What rule did it break, ES? It was all about pizzagate, using commonly known material we've published a dozen times. Eric described the link. If it had been anti Trump, you wouldn't be whining. I said all this in the thread itself, at the time. You are just trying to waste my time, as you are always trying to do. You have no respect for anyone on this board, or you would confine your critique of the administration of the board to the appropriate subverse instead of trying to instigate drama. Everyone sees you now for what you truly are.

                    I knew you would limp wrist on this. List the rules. Spell out how an ANONYMOUS source of information meets the rules. Nobody is in GITMO. Martial Law and military tribunals didn't happen.

                    I"m glad that Trump is the President. Its better than Hillary. BUT i'm not stupid. You are stupid. That is the biggest difference between me an you. You are stupid. You need to study BANKING. They print money. They run this world. Trump has very little power compared to people that print money. Educate yourself. GOD DAMN son this was produced in 1996 I think. You can't watch this and learn something? I can't make you smart. You have to do that on your own. Copy? I private messaged you books on Jesuits. You didn't read them. I lose patience with dumbasses that refuse to study and run their mouth. Watch this video. Jebus Christ.............Lead or get the fuck out of the way. OK?

                     What rule did it break, ES? It was all about pizzagate, using commonly known material we've published a dozen times. Eric described the link. If it had been anti Trump, you wouldn't be whining. I said all this in the thread itself, at the time. You are just trying to waste my time, as you are always trying to do. You have no respect for anyone on this board, or you would confine your critique of the administration of the board to the appropriate subverse instead of trying to instigate drama. Everyone sees you now for what you truly are.

              Pizzagate was banned from Reddit on 11/22/2016 and migrated to Voat, GodsAngell. We were investigating this stuff long before Q made his presence known to citizen investigators. The story can be found

               When the ban came it was a real affirmation that there truly are those watching, ranged against us learning the truth.
I couldn't sleep for days because of disturbing, helpless, fearful thoughts and images flashing through my shocked mind.

                The ban was what pushed it from speculation to reality, for me. I lost one day of sleep after realizing the implications of the handkerchief email. I've been here every day since, chipping away, helping as I am able. I want my country back.

               Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God, and trust in Him is the only ticket out of this mess.
              </p>
              <p>
               Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  This whole world is nothing but The Lords footstool, that these fools have usurped authority over.  They can't leave, their judgement hangs over them at all times, so they exist to take others down with them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't let them take your focus off the next life, and helping other people to get there.
