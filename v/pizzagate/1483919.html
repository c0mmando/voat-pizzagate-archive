            Ultimately we need to stay focused on the smaller players involved, people like Alefantis and his social circle.  Uncover enough evidence of their crimes so that when the new DOJ is in place in 2017 there will be ample evidence for prosecutors to use to go after them.  The way that organized crime syndicates are brought down is by taking a few low and mid-level bosses down while also bringing down a high level boss at the same time.  The low level bosses will flip on the rest of the syndicate so long as you identify the ones who are the most connected.  So James "49th Most Powerful Man In DC" Alefantis is the perfect example of a mid-level boss with all the right connections.  He and his social circle seem to be the most blatant with flaunting this stuff as well, when they are arrested and charged with crimes they will flip on their allies to bargain with investigators for their own self interest.  John and Tony Podesta are prime examples of top level bosses and they have families that they will want to protect so once arrested they will flip on their allies and bargain with investigators in order to protect their wives and kids.

            Check out the Maxi Trial from Italy to get a sense of what I'm talking about.  Italian justice department was able to put 400 mafioso on trial at once.  Here's a documentary about it:

            Just keep researching these people and keep archiving the digital evidence.

            Hey, I see this thread got two down votes. Consider that a badge of honor! They really don't like what you've written. LMAO! How much more transparent can they be?
