            Sad that the only news I read now is what is linked from this sub.  I have been lurking for a long time.   The picture is getting clearer.  Everythig going on now is related to this.  Pretty much anyone who cries Russia is suspect.  Certainly anyone who says pizza gate is fake news is highly suspect.  Any censoring is admission of guilt and involvement.

            Interesting to see that ZH and TD are contributing to the exposure of Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I question promulgating the idea that this [Pizzagate] is
            <em>
             just
            </em>
            the latest in "a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to Israel".
           </p>
           <p>
            Having researched way more than the average person about religious ritualistic child sacrifice, rape, torture, murder and cannibalism: it's ancient and it's the practice of many "groups" whose desired goals, most simply stated, are Earthly transcendence, power and immortality.

            is a 300 year old and recently revealed painting that shows, aptly titled, "Ritual Murder".
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mord Rytualny by Charles de Prevot in 1709" depicts the ritual murder of Protestant children by Jews. Currently on display at the cathedral in Sandomierz Cathedral, Poland it was revealed to the public in 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Rabbi is depicted catching the blood of an infant as it bleeds to death, which they then drink. It is discussed that in Jerusalem, they were doing that every day of the year. The baby’s carcasses were then burned on an alter after they were eviscerated.

           <p>
            Q. What do you mean compromised?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“.  Both tropes come from the same place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Can you explain?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q.  So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone.
