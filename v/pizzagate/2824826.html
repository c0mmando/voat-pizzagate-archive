<p>Human remains found in the basement of Italy\'s apostolic nunciature, speculation ensues</p>
<p>ROME (ChurchMilitant.com) - Human remains have been found on a Church property in Rome, and some speculate they are connected to a decades-old missing person case.</p>
<p>The papal nunciature in Rome was undergoing renovations when human bones were uncovered in the basement on Monday.</p>
<p>The building, located outside Vatican City, is the residence of the Pope\'s nuncio, or ambassador, to Italy.</p>
<p>At the moment, almost nothing is known about the person whose remains were discovered, and forensic testing will be used to determine the person\'s age and sex.</p>
<p>There is speculation that the remains could belong to Emanuela Orlandi, a teenage girl in the 1980s who mysteriously went missing.</p>
<p>Emanuela was the daughter of Ercole Orlandi, a lay official at the Vatican. She went missing in 1983 at the age of 15.</p>
<p>At the time, it was thought that she was possibly kidnapped. In the years that followed, investigators became almost certain that it was a kidnapping.</p>
<p>A wide variety of theories have swirled about her likely kidnapping and potential death.</p>
<p>Shortly after Emanuela vanished, there were anonymous tips by two young men, &quot;Pietroluigi&quot; and &quot;Mario.&quot; Each of them claimed he had spoken with a young woman who fit the description. They both provided accurate details about Emanuela\'s appearance and behavior. A few days later, Pope St. John Paul II appealed for the girl\'s release, as there were suspicions that she had been kidnapped. </p>
<p>After that, there began a series of phone messages claiming Emanuela was taken hostage as a bargaining chip for the release of Mehmet Ali Agca, the man who had tried to assassinate Pope St. John Paul II in St. Peter\'s Square in 1981. The men making these calls claimed that &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Pietroluigi&quot; were actually fellow members of their terrorist group who planted false leads.</p>
<p>Given the Cold War going on at the time — which, in Italy, sometimes burst out into political violence — it was thought that these anonymous callers were part of a communist group.</p>
<p>But some theorize Emanuela was actually murdered by the Banda della Magliana (the Magliana gang), a notoriously ruthless criminal organization in Rome. It is speculated that her father, Ercole, had stumbled across damning evidence of corruption in the Vatican Bank that implicated the gang, and they killed his daughter as a warning for him to be quiet. In 2008, a source told the police that she thought Emanuela was killed by Magliana gangsters at the orders of Abp. Paul Marcinkus, who was then head of the Vatican Bank.</p>
<p>The Vatican has been accused of a cover-up in connection to the girl\'s disappearance. Giancarlo Capaldo, a senior Italian prosecutor on the case, said in 2012, &quot;There are people still alive, and still inside the Vatican, who know the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Also in 2012, Rome\'s chief exorcist said the girl\'s disappearance was likely connected to a sex abuse ring. Exorcist Fr. Gabriele Amorth (who died in 2016) told La Stampa, &quot;This was a crime with a sexual motive. Parties were organized, with a Vatican gendarme acting as the \'recruiter\' of the girls.&quot;</p>
<p>Father Amorth continued, &quot;The network involved diplomatic personnel from a foreign embassy to the Holy See. I believe Emanuela ended up a victim of this circle.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a lot of hype in Italy in 2012 when police investigated a tip that Emanuela\'s body had been placed next to the corpse of Enrico de Pedis, a murdered Italian gangster who headed the Banda della Magliana. Police opened up de Pedis\' coffin (in the crypt of a cathedral) and did not find the girl\'s body. The gangster was buried in the crypt of the Basilica of Sant\'Apollinare in central Rome. An unknown body was found in the crypt, but it was determined to be from over a century ago.</p>

<p>Still more speculation ran wild in 2013 when Pope Francis, then recently elected, told family members of the missing person, &quot;Emanuela is in Heaven.&quot; Emanuela\'s brother, Pietro, told the Pope that he was still hopeful that his sister would be found alive one day. After the encounter, Pietro started wondering whether Pope Francis secretly knew his sister\'s fate, and accidentally let the goose out. But many thought Pope Francis was just trying to offer comfort and chose the wrong thing to say.</p>

             The pope talks in circles and he lies.  Just like the rest of the elites.

              They make sure they never lie...they talk in legal code..
..when he said heaven ...he moat probably knows the definition of hell..
Canon law is juat latin accounting ..
Look up defintion of hell..
There is heaven and hell for them...but its not what we have in our heads ...
Its to do with state of debt ..and our names being surety to it..
When they fish for teens and kills them ...the named account held by rome..is decapitated..
When u die the tomb stone is in full caps lettering...
It is still a ledger on the books of rome...ie it hasnt gone to heaven..it is still in purgatory...
The death certifcate holder transfers that accounts liability to himself...after paying inheritance tax ..ie usage fee..of the inheritance ..

            The Illuminati started in Spain, the founder of the Jesuits was part of their structure when they were called Alumbrados.  Essentially cementing the power of the Pope (assassination, blackmail, extortion, torture and rape) since the days of the Borgia's and Italy falling out with Spain..

              Someone told you what he/she heard about St Malachy. :
In persecutione extrema S.R.E. sedebit Petrus Romanus, qui pascet oves in multis tribulationibus: quibus transactis civitas septicollis diruetur, &amp; Judex tremêdus judicabit populum suum. Finis.
In extreme persecution, the seat of the Holy Roman Church will be occupied by Peter the Roman, who will feed the sheep through many tribulations, at the term of which the city of seven hills will be destroyed, and the formidable Judge will judge his people. The End.

               I believe that Malachi Martin was our St Malachy.  He wrote and told of the sins of the popes the Vatican and the RCC.  He was murdered.  I am waiting to see what will unfold.

            A few days later, Pope St. John Paul II appealed for the girl's release, as there were suspicions that she had been kidnapped. Ehh, it happened right on my doorstep. "We prefer little boys, he says." Side business, and a hit gone wrong.

              I hope you realize that most important buildings in the world have a human skeleton buried in the corner of the foundation. It is an old tradition. I think it started with some ritual, and then they just picked the least useful worker later. Vatican has their own police force, millions of close followers, Opus Dei. and the Knights of Malta.  You think these unknowns slipped through the cracks? Nothing happens there without them knowing.

              Most likely politically connected to the church building right next door. I could call my spy buddies from around the World, if you need further confirmation. I doubt I will get much different. I do not want my typed words to be anything else than the tangled words I have already typed. Hope you understand. I just want to jump up and down with angst, and I am not even, remotely, or immediately involved.

               I am afraid that if the truth starts coming out, there will be a immediate shut down. We know the pope and his cohorts wield immense power in Rome, especially with the police.  I wonder what would happen if they stormed the Vatican?  This new PM is pretty feisty.  Refusing to accept the boats from Libya.

                I hate to sound shallow, but that is a local problem. That is the truth of the matter, and I can hardly speak a lick of Italian. I just hope they still got some good men and women ready to give em' heck over this. I lied. I can order shrimp in half the globe.

                 Correct, it is local, but I am sure any of them if they are in a high level position would be able to put pressure on local LE. I too believe there are still some good people, but they know they may meet the same fate from those that have committed these crimes.  This is a nasty development. Again we have to wonder if the Vatican can pull another fast one.

             .They deserve a very stiff and strict punishment.  And Swift.  They certainly don't deserve the sympathy from the old Italian women that will be crying for them.  They believe the pope knows nothing.  I believe when he said she is in heaven, that he was sending a message.  She is dead.  Remember when the pope said there was no heaven or hell?  Another lie.
