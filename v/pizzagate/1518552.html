            Nobody is going to do anything, most of the videos you can find will be technically non pornographic or non-nude anyway, it's sick, I totally agree, but nobody who can effect change cares.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shit bugs the hell out of me, having known too many people who were abused as children, and many more who pretty much exploited themselves sexually because we live in a fucked up world.
           </p>
           <p>
            You want to change it? Move to Amish country, convert, maybe become Mennonite, it's a little more tolerable.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Other than that people will keep having children, parents will keep being careerists whose professions are more important than their children, and children will either keep falling to the hands of predators, or will get the idea from pop-CULTure media that if they want to be liked they need to be provocative little sex objects. It's a serious problem, a clear symptom of just how far our society is falling into shit, it was never like this in generations past, and it keeps getting worse and worse. Children are supposed to be "the future" but at least half of them want to be objects or sex-toys starting at earlier and earlier ages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still it's become quite clear the social media platforms, along with millions of parents, and their millions of children, as well as the predators, will not stop the stupid shit.

            Yeah but those are adults...the rest of the channel IS absolutely a Pedo collection for fantasy, but it is completely comprised of stolen videos that when filmed were completely innocent...when viewed via the PedoEye however....
           </p>
           <p>
            People need to take this channel and alert everyone they know that has put their kids anywhere on the Internet. It's the families themselves that are literally providing the Pedo's with material.

            The PedoBear Make love youtube channel IS absolutely for pedos, however the videos are clearly all innocent stolen family type videos that stupid ass families posts. The one with the preteen doing a dance routine is likely wearing some type of gymnastics leotards under her sweatshirt as her hair is done up in a dancer/gymnast style. She is dancing for her gramma along with her little sister. Another is a 3 year old little girl running about the house in panties and t-shirt hollering at her parents who are still in bed. I don't recognize the language but my guess is she's trying to get them up. It's really the parent's/family's fault for putting those things on the Internet. I firmly believe this is as important as the abuse videos...because this is where the fantasizing begins.
           </p>
           <p>
            This goes along with two accounts I saw during # TwitterGate...both of them had hundreds of stolen social media photos of children. One way to tell they're stolen is the vast locations, vast differences in the children/ages/gender/race/ethnicity (there's something for everyone) and the normalness of the poses/activities..that when not viewed via the PedoEye, most people would AWE....but Pedos collect videos/photos of such circumstances/kids, it's arousing to them whereas when normal people see a kid doing something cute we see no harm in the videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            So while the channel SHOULD be banned because the content is clearly stolen, unless the people who initially posted the videos find out HOW they're being used and complain, the channel isn't breaking any laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best thing you can do is take this channel and email it to every single person you know that has kids and WARN them to stop posting their kids on the Internet. Social Media this shit too. Depriving the Pedo's of material is the responsibility of the stupid ass people who post it.

            I'm not saying it should be overlooked. I'm just saying all these "use these terms to see pedo content on youtube!" posts are asking for trouble. You say yourself that the images are pornographic. Just because they are highly accessible doesn't mean they're safe to peruse.  I know you're doing it with good intentions, but how do you know searching these things won't be used against you? In this environment, they are looking for ways to nab dissenters. I could see a sudden "bust" of youtube pedo content, and an excuse to shut down
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            . Or straight up honeypot- sure you can stumble across these things so easily it's alarming, that's your point, I get it. But you are suggesting seeking it out purposely and repeatedly. Your every move is being watched and "they" are not on our side.
            <br/>
            I'm just throwing that out there to keep in mind. I agree, make people aware. Contact law enforcement. (not that it's guaranteed to help, but...) I'm not saying it should be ignored, but does it help to bring it to pizzagate? When it doesn't even exactly fit what's being investigated?
            <br/>
            Edit: Seriously, I'm just playing devil's advocate here. This isn't my bag to investigate. I wanted to share that it looks dangerous to me- just my opinion.

             Having actually dealt with the FBI re CP....it's fucking pointless. That's all. Also the YT channel has a Pedo porn name, but none of the content is pornographic to anyone but a pedo. Social media organizations that openly host child pornography, such as TWITTER, need to be held accountable for it. If no one ever looks...do you get the point? I've seen shit on Ytube that IS child torture/porn...how is this possible? To watch a child anally raped by tree branch? ON YOUTUBE? It's the same exact situation. You're being a bit like CNN--only CNN can read Wikileaks, it's illegal for a regular citizen to read Wikileaks....You know how many people simply will not believe that child torture/rape is on Ytube? How many people refused to believe what was on Twitter? Fuck this. I got sick trying to get people to believe me about Twitter. I personally think people should be forced to LOOK AT IT and vomit. Because not looking hasn't worked out for us so far has it? We make it too damn easy for people to "disbelieve".

            Wow I miss old rule #1.
            <br/>
            I get this is important, and it is infuriating. But I keep seeing post after post like this, with links upon links and suggestions on how to find cp, and I just think, honeypot. Also the mods change rule one and just tack on a disclaimer on illegal content. Seems fishy. And I usually don't buy the "voat and the mods are comprised" idea.
            <br/>
            Expose this if it is on your heart to do so, but I think  of twittergate, and how the whistleblower got banned. I think of how stuff like that contributed to
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             r/pizzagate
            </a>
            's demise. I see how this is connected to pizzagate in the grand scheme of pedo activity being right under our noses and authorities ignoring it. But I don't think it really helps to bring it to pizzagate. We're in a time where regular citizens are discovering the government underbelly, and tptb are doing everything they can to stop us. Reading old news stories and public documents and making connections is relatively safe, although they are working to ban it. But looking for and clicking on cp? That makes you an easy fucking target. And posting it here makes us ALL targets. IMHO.

            It's disgusting that they are getting away with it.  Anyone who says they images are not "pornographic" must understand that is in the eye of the beholder what "pornographic" is.  The monetization clearly indicates that.  However, if the standards are acceptable by some nebulous measure of decency determined by YT,  then there doesn't seem to be much we can do by pointing out to them that sick fucks are getting off on the content.  The "people" making lewd comments ought to be targeted.  This kind of wickedness diminishes us all.

            I find it hard to see how this how could be part of the Pedocracy.

           <p>
            Yes, there are people grossing views with bad stuff just within the bounds of youtube.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes there are probably low life CP producers lurking for customers in these comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I doubt the Pedocrats use youtube to communicate.
