            The last thread about this got deleted.

            Two things:
           </p>
           <p>
            First, who is Kevin Annett
           </p>
           <p>
            Second: What is the Common Law Court
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            This is connected to Kevin Annett. Kevin Annett is no joke and no hoax. He outed the genocide of canadian native aboriginal children and their torture by elements in the Catholic Church. Connected the finding of 800 children's bodies in septic tank like enclosures. Some of these people that were tortured are still alive today to tell their stories with the help of Kevin Annett.

           </p>
           <p>
            There was a thread on this about the 800 children found in the septic tanks but it got deleted. This is an amazing documentary. The things the survivors speak about that were done to them is gruesome.

            EXCERPT: "...This documentary reveals Canada's darkest secret - the deliberate extermination of indigenous (Native American) peoples and the theft of their land under the guise of religion. This never before told history as seen through the eyes of this former minister (Kevin Annett) who blew the whistle on his own church, after he learned of thousands of murders in its Indian Residential Schools..."

            I know, I know, its Alex Jones. But in the midst of sewage pearls can be found. Interview with Kevin Annett. AJ actually does not act like a maniac in this interview. Quick way to get clued in on exactly what and who is Kevin Annett.

            This is the heart-wrenching story of the toil of those peoples at the hands of the institutional powers, for the purposes of land theft and eugenics, ethnic cleansing. This documentary also follows the personal history of Reverend Kevin Annett, formerly with the United Church, defrocked and socially outcast because of his brave exposure of the Indian toil.

            The establish judicial hates Common Law Court like Superman hates Kryptonite. They refuse to give it standing and acknowledgement. People that try to use common law courts don't have armies to enforce it so its just tough shit to try to use one.

             ITCCS is a website, it does not represent a court or jurisdiction (power) to hear anything.
Sadly, because some of the allegations discussed on the website appear true.

            There isn't a European Court of Common Law in Brussels, it's fake - can't seem to remember the name of the guy who is behind this right now.  This has been discussed here before, will look for old Voat threads later today or tomorrow.
