<p>What\'s interesting is the developers of the game gave the community an easter egg ARG in a video for them to follow. In it they give out coordinates to type in on a map. When you type it in the coordinates the location where the True Detective episode &quot;Form and Void&quot; was filmed comes up. This episode has been extensively talked about on the Pizzagate sub. In Form and Void we see the pedophile symbols from the FBI Wikileaks release. The episode is about Elite pedophiles who torture and rape children.</p>

<p>&quot;In the HBO original series True Detective, \'Carcosa\' is presented as a man-made temple. Located in the back woods of Louisiana, the temple serves as a place of ritualistic sexual abuse of children and child murder organized by a group of wealthy Louisiana politicians and church leaders. The main characters, Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, storm the temple in the final episode of the season, where they confront a serial killer, who is the most active member of the cult. It is understood that the cult worships the &quot;Yellow King&quot;, to whom an effigy is dedicated in the main chamber of \'Carcosa\'. The series hints at a larger conspiracy which continues beyond the show, which is in line with Lovecraftian horror, as is a vision experienced by one character that underscores Lovecraftian themes like cosmic indifference.&quot;</p>

            Yeah great. You get to sit on your couch believing the cops are doing something to stop kids being sold into prostitution and sex slavery, while the real cops are using child prostitutes and protecting people that do if they have a higher social status than them. Sure they'll make a few arrests of people who aren't part of the racket and fill the news cycle with stories that make out they're doing something about it. It's the purpose of the game really.

            Been playing Octopath Traveler ever since I got it for Christmas. Found even more red pill material in the game’s plot. About 3/4 into Act 3 (there are five acts). Certainly worth a thread about white hats in the gaming industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            If what you’re saying is true, the game in this thread may qualify too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Primrose Chapter 2: In order to assassinate one of the members of The Crow, Primrose infiltrates a facility known as the Obsidian Parlor. This place is a brothel heavily involved in sex trafficking, some victims implied to have been trafficked as kids. A priest of the Sacred Flame is being manipulated into service via “debts and favors”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tressa Chapter 2: The villain Mordock is a pretty accurate submantion of how typical elites view people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alfyn Chapter 2: The villain Vanessa runs a scam involving intentionally sickening people with medicine to profit from the induced sickness by charging high prices for the treatment to the new “illness”. A lot like how big pharma works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cyrus Chapter 2: An investigation into the theft of an occult tome reveals mass kidnappings via an underground tunnel system (BIG pizza reference). Victims are murdered via a satanic ritual esque murder where their blood is completely drained for the purpose of black magic research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ophelia Chapter 3: Reveals the existance of a global satanic cult like group who follow a false messiah called “The Saviour”. Members of this cult kidnap children and wear black cloaks. These same “black cloaks” have been stalking Tressa all throughout the game and Cyrus after chapter 2. Gideon (Cyrus Chapter 2) and the Crow are likely members of this cult since they have the same black cloaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cyrus Chapter 3: The mastermind of the theft of the infamous tome of black magic was the Headmaster of the Royal Academy (where Cyrus used to work). His assistiant is a “black cloak” too. At this point in the game right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dreading Tressa chapter 4, which is going to take place in a town where one can allegedly buy ANYTHING with the right price. Also a major port town.

             <p>
              Your belief that pizzagate isn’t about the problem of child sex trafficking/pedophilia by elites and the respective cover ups shows you are incapable of logic and reason.
             </p>
             <p>
              Theories evolve over time with new findings retard. I’m sorry you’re so stupid that you can’t tell the difference between that and what you call goal post moving (it never happened idiot).
             </p>
             <p>
              BTW, where’s your proof that your alleged Romanian ID card is legit and not a forgery? Show it completely uncovered. That is if you’re not a liar that is.
