            I take it you are asking if there is an Epstein connection to Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. They're about two degrees separated, from what I've seen. You can use the SearchVoat box at the top of the sidebar to plug in key names or pairs of names an see what kind of sauce we've got bottled in the basement. We have several thousand research submissions in our archives. You can search both comments and submissions. Make sure you click the "include NSFW" box as well as the "search post body" box when you get to SearchVoat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, I can't leave this up, if you don't add at least one supporting link (per our submission rules, in the sidebar). I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Thanks!
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. "Pizzagate" was never only meant to refer to Comet Pizza. It's a reference to "cheese pizza" aka "CP" aka "child porn" from a 4chan theory about the strange use of "cheese" and "pizza" in the Podesta emails. We've got a good article on the origins of "pizzagate" in the sidebar.

            Videos are a slow way to extract information, as opposed to well organized information in consumable bites.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeffrey Epstein is connected to the Pizzagate scandal in that he is a known pedophile who is friends and or financially tied to the Clinton machine, which includes John Podesta, James Alefantis and David Brock.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill Clinton flew on the Lolita Express and ended up on Epstein's island many times more than he was willing to admit, even going so far as to ditch his Secret Service detail.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of disinformation was inserted into the Pizzagate debate, early on, and there is a wealth of information, making it difficult for newcomers to absorb. In my opinion, this is by design.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my mind, it is very simple. The Clintons are friends with and financially tied to an inordinate number of known and convicted pedophiles, along with many more suspected pedophiles and occultists and the mainstream media, in cooperation with tech giants, are determined to cover up this information.
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis, David Brock, Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Clinton, John Podesta, Tony Podesta and their friends like Christopher Kloman, Dennis Hastert, Terry Bean, Ed Buck, etc are pedophiles/sexual deviants/money launderers/corrupt criminals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who helps cover up for them should be categorized as the same.

            Lynn Rothschild introduced Dershowitz to Epstein - Lynn is BFF and funded Hillary's campaign - Epstein helped fund-Clinton Foundation-David Brock connected to Lynn Rothschild and Clinton Campaign - Brock and Alefantis were one-time gay partners - Alefantis used Comet to fundraise for Hillary - Podesta bros. also worked with Alefantis for Clinton fundraisers and Tony was linked also through the art gallery scene. Instagram photo links Lynn, Brock and Alefantis. How is a humble pizza shop owner listed as 49th most powerful man in D.C?
           </p>
           <p>
            "The story of Dershowitz’s own reversal of fortune began on the Vineyard in the summer of 1996. A family friend, Lynn Forester de Rothschild, he said, invited him to a party for her husband, Lord Rothschild, where she introduced him to Jeffrey Epstein. “She said, ‘I have this friend, he really would like to meet you,’” Dershowitz said. He said he found Epstein enthralling. He appeared to be more than just another rich guy. "
           </p>
           <p>
            "For around a decade, Dershowitz kept casual company with Epstein, who introduced him to his friends, like Ghislaine Maxwell, a British heiress who acted as his right hand, and Prince Andrew, whom Epstein called “Andy.”"
           </p>
           <p>
            "When Epstein first started to attract media attention around the year 2000, mainly because of his friendship with former president Bill Clinton, Dershowitz served as a character witness for the reclusive financier."

            PizzaGate Breakthrough: ROTHSCHILD and CTR’s David Brock Had Social Ties w/ Jimmy Comet!
           </h1>
           <p>
            "If there’s nothing to PizzaGate, why have researchers found an image on Jimmy Comet’s Instagram of him at a private book party with Lady Lynn Rothschild—one of Hillary’s strongest backers in elite circles—and David Brock, creator of troll shop Correct The Record and propagandist establishment rag Media Matters. Although this proves nothing, we now know that “Jimmy Comet” of PizzaGate fame, at the least, had social relations with Lady Rothschild and Brock. That is unusual; why is a random pizza shop owner hanging with Rothschilds and longtime Clinton insiders like Brock?"

             Don't forget Alefantis and Brock are pals with the Macobees, who sit on the board of Friends of the Orphans, who gave Silsby "orphans" to traffick according to Jorge Puello. Maccobee was the attorney who represented Brock and Alefantis against that guy that was extorting them over the house.
