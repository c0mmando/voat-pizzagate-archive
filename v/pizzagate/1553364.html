<p>&quot;Once a Year in Autumn, When the Air is Warm, A Signal is Transmitted - Who Will Be Waiting At Your Door?</p>
<p>Calling All Village Youth (harelips, freaks, trolls, him-shims, basement-dwellers and wormdicks):</p>
<p>You have heard the lore of Baba\'s Mountain from your brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>You have spent countless hours listening to the APES\' Baba\'s Mountain record, searching for answers.</p>
<p>You have seen the graffiti on the walls. Captain 20\'s Children. Mount of the Child Generals. APES. Imp Ahh.</p>
<p>You have heard rumors of those gone missing: Adolescents, leaving their homes, wandering into the night and never being seen again. The melting of children into feed for the woodland animals.</p>
<p>Please ignore these rumors - rumors created by your teachers, the local media, parental figures. Ignore the ignorant teens-in-heat &quot;blogs&quot;. Spurred by myth, inspired by whispers, many have written us from all over the world, wanting to know more about our mountain retreat.</p>
<p>Why not come see for yourself?</p>
<p>WHEN AND WHERE?</p>
<p>An all night celebration will commence on the last Saturday of October. In the evening, when a warm breeze stirs the leaves, you will know it is time. Place the mark on your door and listen for the horn of the Green Bus. Do not hesitate, for the bus will wait but a moment, and then be gone. The APES extend their hand in invitation, but that invitation is not for the slow of mind or foot. &quot;</p>
<p>If you click \'Journey Onward\' at the bottom it takes you to this...</p>
<p>&quot;WHAT MAY I FIND … WAY UP THERE?</p>
<p>Up there, you can escape the Comas\' transmissions
Up there, we will provide a home for all those willing to learn and burn
Up there, we will teach you to escape the trappings of The Mind
Up there, the apples speak, worms are on foot, and there is love for all beasts
Up there, youth is caught in time
Up there, things smell and taste better   
</p>
<p>WHO ARE THE COMAS?</p>
<p>They are your parents. Your neighbors. Your peers. All of those who are caught deep in a coma-like state, going through mechanical routines day after day after day. It is they who first created - and now serve - the Mind, the force that seeks to deaden us and chain us to the isolating habitual comforts of the past and the non-existent future. Seek shelter from these living dead before they infect you!  
</p>
<p>WHAT CAN I DO?</p>
<p>Accept this once-a-year invitation to the celebration.</p>
<p>Or stay in for the night and succumb to the infectious bite of the Comas! &quot;</p>
<p>The next link takes you to a picture which says you are supposed to place that mark upon your door.</p>
<p>I wondered what \'Mount of the Child Generals\' meant but could only find reference to it in regard to the apes.  However, when I searched for \'Captain 20s Children\' and came across this page </p>
<p><a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/exhibitions/overview/captain-20s-children-c20c">http://www.transformerdc.org/exhibitions/overview/captain-20s-children-c20c</a>   which says</p>
<p>&quot; Witness for the first time the Rock Creek Park Portals and the Recruitment Center of Captain 20s Children. Inspired by Captain 20 himself (host of daytime TV shows for kids in the DC area in the 70s), the Children are conspirators of the imagination. They dwell in think-tanks where they make crafts and candles and work to spread the lure of the imagination. To keep the C20C alive.</p>
<p>Transformer presents a window into their world. You won\'t want to miss it!</p>
<p>Come meet your new &quot;neighbors&quot;?!</p>
<ul>
<li>* * But Where Did They Come From? * * *</li>
</ul>
<p>Long ago, Captain 20 was a faithful guide, sage and soothsayer for the Latch-Key kids inhabiting the suburban dwellings in the townships of MaryLand. He occupied the timeless expanse during a child\'s day devoted solely to the imagination, a time when ideas were free flowing, unconcerned with what was going on in the world. Having a flashlight and a tablecloth, meant that you had a fort; hanging out with friends meant creating secret worlds. In the afternoon hours under the glowing TV eye of the Captain, the Latch-Key kids soon discovered \'secret portals\' and began transporting themselves into what would become the world of C20C.</p>
<p>Today, Captain 20s Children create. They work to spread the lure of the imagination while working to defeat the Comas, those with their creative minds switched off--to keep the C20C alive. The portals take you to the not-so-far away environments of the creative, where the Children are trained in the ways of C20C. The Children are dreaming. They are the imagination. The imagination used to show what is going on.</p>
<p>Welcome to their Recruitment Center!&quot;</p>
<p>I noticed it had a DC address so looked further, so randomly clicked \'collector\'s view\' on the special events menu, which read</p>
<p>&quot; Sharing the private collections of a select and diverse group of DC\'s leading contemporary art collectors through a series of special receptions, Transformer\'s annual spring Collector\'s View series highlights the relationship collectors have with artists, the role they play in building artists\' careers, as well as their impact in creating healthy arts communities – while providing tremendous support for Transformer\'s exhibitions and programs.</p>
<p>Through the generosity of several leading DC contemporary art collectors, Transformer invites Collector\'s View participants into some of Washington\'s best homes for personal &quot;views&quot; of a diverse range of private art collections. Participants will be privy to learn, from an insider\'s perspective, the motivations, interests and passions of these dynamic collectors on the work they collect.&quot;</p>
<p>Remembering about the Podesta house art collection, I clicked through the 2016 images photos and lo and behold... guess who is on the photos of the of the listed houses...Yes, Mr JA himself!  Gets around a bit doesn\'t he.</p>
<p>He is also in many of the previous year\'s photos but 2014 contains images at Tony Podesta\'s house which JA also attended.</p>
<p>Haven\'t checked the rest of the site yet as I thought I would put the findings here for now.</p>',

            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga
            </a>
            It doesn't really say much on the Wikipedia page, but she was feared by children. She was known to eat them. 
Edited to add another article. Interesting.

            I was wondering about the meaning of Baba and other than meaning grandma or father in some other languages, I came across information about Sai Baba, who I remembered as some Indian guru from yeas ago
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathya_Sai_Baba">

            What wikileaks fails to mention is that there are many allegations that he was a pedo.

            So it wasn't a surprise to find him appearing in one of the Ape's (NSFW) videos -

He is coming with his wife. They were saying that though they have enough money, they are not able to do such work. Hence, they want to see how we do such things."  on this site -

            I haven't found any significance other than a lot of people are trying to change Halloween to this date.

           <p>
            Maybe it is because it is easier to hide something on a Saturday than a weekday and more people could attend.

            This part automatically made me think of MKULTRA type programming. It's conceivable that a children's show could have been used back in the 70's to recruit for the project.

            I was curious about Autumn and what they do.... Autumn is extremely active (ugh) for these Satanist.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the below (link) Occult Calendar... Here is the Autumn Equinox
           </p>
           <p>
            "4. Autumnal Equinox - 13 weeks - Minor Sabbath but does require human sacrifice
           </p>
           <p>
            a. September 21 - Mabon - one of the Illuminati's Human Sacrifice Nights
           </p>
           <p>
            b. September 21 -22 - Autumnal Equinox
           </p>
           <p>
            c. October 31 - Samhain, also known as Halloween, or All Hallows Eve. This date is the Illuminati's highest day of human sacrifice"
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal20.htm">
             http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal20.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            More from same link/calendar:
           </p>
           <p>
            "4. Autumnal Equinox - 13 weeks
Minor Sabbath but does require human sacrifice
           </p>
           <p>
            a. September 21
 Mabon - one of the Illuminati's Human Sacrifice Nights 
 b. September 21 -22 - Autumnal Equinox"
           </p>
           <p>
            "From this date through Halloween, occultists believe the veil separating the earthly dimension from the demonic realm gets progressively thinner, with the thinnest night being October 31; this thinning of the separating veil makes it easier for the demonic realm to enter the earthly dimension.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus, on Halloween, evil spirits, ghosts, witches, hobgoblins, black cats, fairies, and demons of all sorts were believed to be running amok across the land. They had to be back in their spiritual dimension before midnight, Halloween, for the separating veil would then get thicker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again, I reiterate, this is occult belief, not mine! October is a most propitious month to the Illuminati."

            Like, as in tunnel portals in Rock Creek Park?

            Does this not match up with the guy that researched the tunnels the other day?  I am not familiar with DC, so not sure, but I think they said the tunnels run under Rock Creek Park.

             Wow.  Another "weird" coincidence: tunnels (reportedly) involve Rock Creek Park.

             "Portals" suggests doors or entry ways.

            <p>
             I'm still theorizing CumPanda means "with Panda" (latin) and I'm hearing that the Panda plaza at the National Zoo faces Rock Creek.

             Actually, this text is amazing. It just says that homosexuals are chased as terrorists. Don't mix up homosexuals and pedos. This Wojnarowicz has potentially nothing to do with majestic apes or JA. They choose to expose him, because they all belong to the homosexual community. But as Wojnarowicz is aware he has received bad treatments, he is more subject to see bad treatments as what they are. JA or majestic apes are laughing about killing babies. They might not be aware of the bad treatments they received themselves.

              I don't have against homosexuals.  No offense was intended.  I only provided the link because several of the people being investigated seem to like buying and displaying art from victims of child abuse (hence the mention in brackets that Wojnarowicz was himself a victim).   The image, however, would likely appeal to pedos.

               Yeah I know you didn't want to offend homos, but I think this connection actually is not relevant. It is good to search everywhere and you are right to search and ask everywhere. But this is our duty to say if we think that something is relevant or not. That's what a proper investigation is.

            This stuff is so gross, makes me realize these freaks lack any intelligence. They have been mind controlled. So, none are given any reasoning ability, no intelligence. Even their controllers are severely limited in intelligence. Trump truthfully states he is smarter than all the other political opponents, and he certainly is!!
Never doubt Trump!

             Perhaps the ones at the bottom are mind controlled almost completely, but the ones at the top have a supreme intelligence... Ancient even.

             Don't underestimate.

              Agreed, and also want to add that the top's supreme intelligence is missing the component of a good heart, so there will always be a chink in their reasoning. That's how we will overcome them.
