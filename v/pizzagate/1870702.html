            I hope so. Maybe that's why Trump is going out of town, the the sh!t is about to hit the fan and he will be better protected out of the White House? But he's going to the mideast.

             Trump is in on it. Arrest are not imminent. The FBI covers things up, they don't push for prosecution or arrest. You still don't get it. This is a show to make you think there is a working system with a few bad apples, and we are always on the edge of locking them up. The entyire system is either in on it, complicit or blackmailed. This has been going on for decades if not our entire history. It doesn't change any day now. The system is run by the cabal and they don't jail themselves.

              Trump pulling out of the Paris accord, TPP, Obamacare doesn't look like he's in on it. I don't think Hillary enjoyed losing to him and George Soros liked losing billions fighting him because he's in on it.

             Suffered enough?  If he does not sing an aria he will be locked up for life.You think flashing and sending pics to a teen while our little kid is in the room and lying in your bed is not suspect?  You have a perverted sense of what is right and wrong

              It was not a little kid. It was a 15 year old woman. If you look at some old genealogy records, I'll bet they will find that several of your great-grandmother's were 15 years old in the 18 hundreds and before.
The People who want weiner to suffer only because he has a funny last name, are the same people who think it is awesome that Skippy is bringing little kids and two showers filled witu snakes in hot water and strobe lights.

               First of all, nobody thinks it is "awesome" when children are abused. Second, aside from the few racists we unfortunately are forced to tolerate here on the pizzagate voat, nobody cares about Weiner's last name. And third,
               <em>
                I don't give a DAMN about any genealogy records.
               </em>
               I care about the emotional trauma to that 15 year old "woman" as you called her (and how dare you!) and I care about Weiner's precious little baby boy that was for some reason right beside him in bed when he was diddling himself and sending pics to this girl.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope Weiner meant every word of his apology. It's a good start. I think the punishment being given is just. I'm glad he will be on the sex offender registry for life, let him wear that scarlet letter til the end of his days. I don't need him to be locked up indefinitely. But he needs to spend at least a short time cooling his jets in jail or prison. Why? Because if anyone else did what he did, that is what would happen to them. I'm tired of one law for elites, another law for the rest of us. I want Lady Justice to wear her blindfold again.

                You have to be kidding yourself if you think nobody cares about wieners last name. That is only reason why he is in so much trouble. Every single headline is a joke about his name. If his last name was Jones, we never would have even heard about this story. This "traumatized" young woman contacted him first, not vice versa!

                You say that nobody thinks the child abuse is awesome, but they sure don't seem to care if it is done with cool strobe lights by someone with a trendy name like Skippy.  Why will nobody here condemn Skippy? People here that watch video seem to completely ignore that there happens to be a child screaming inside a shower.

               To be totally honest with you I'm not really mad. I know you were too young distinguish right from wrong. I did stupid shit too at that age. Just know you'll have to knock it off by your mid-twenties. That's when shit get's serious and the underdeveloped part of your brain called "your conscience" will come on line and it can send out a bit of a shock when it does.

               WHAT?  Who are you to decide when some parent's child reaches the age of consent so that you and others can defile them?  The reason that went on in days of old is that women had no power and vile pedo men could have their "way" with them (as they used to call it so they did not have to use the words  to vaginally rape them).  Your stripes are showing.

              I want him to be locked up, but I want him to rat everyone out with him. I don't want him to get away anything, but I'm willing to soften the sentence if he squeals like a pig. So he gets out early. Where is he going to go? He will be hated by the whole world if the whole story gets out.

               I agree about the locking up.  But he is dangerous out on the street.  Possible implication in the McCann case, member of Knights of Pythias and he will be doing the bidding of pedo elites when he gets out.  He has the ability to become  a supplier to the elites and also become a future Saville.  He is a scary piece of vermin slime, imo.

                Well then a fake plea deal. The FBI tells Weiner he can go free if he sings, and after he testifies, the FBI says we lied and throw his ass in with the pedocreeps he ratted out.
