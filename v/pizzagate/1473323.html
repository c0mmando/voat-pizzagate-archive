<p>At the time i thought nothing.  I asked him the guys name.  She said Tom Turner.  So i look him up.  Looks like the guy owns a  place named Gar Woods.

<p>Super weird  I thought.  I get deeper into the conversation with my friend and she says the owner &quot;Tom Turner&quot;  invited one of her friends to Bohemian Grove, to  waitress for the night.  She asked if i knew what Bohemian Grove was.  I\'ve been researching this shit for 12 years now, so yeah i know what bohemian grove is.  She said they made her friend leave at 10 o clock because it\'s &quot;Men Only&quot; after that.  
</p>
<p>I think we need to dig into this further.  Could turn out to be nothing, but given the nature of Bohemian Grove and who attends,, and what he says on his children\'s menus.  I think he could be a player in the game.  Supposedly he has about 4 restaurants.

<p>(this is my first post i\'m not trying to throw anyone off trail, everything i have said is honest.  This whole conversation happened before the other tahoe connection post about the daycare place came up too.)</p>',

            Hope this help you, Susie Buell, Hillary's best friend, has a home in Tahoe.  There is still a lot on her on the Internet. I guess you know Podestas have a home there,  maybe they are near one another.

            another one of Tom Turners Restaurants, "Calliente"  has what resembles the ping pong paddle symbol.  It is two maracas but looks very similar.
