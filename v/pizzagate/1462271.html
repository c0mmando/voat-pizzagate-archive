<p>Disclaimer:I\'m tired, If something doesn\'t make sense, don\'t be a dick, but just ask me to clarify, and I will...</p>
<p>I haven\'t seen anyone mention that about David flintstone... <strong>I\'m going to discuss the Bethlehem steel plant and the person who owns it.</strong> </p>
<p>But first I\'m going to give some facts about the school\'s directly next door to the Address in Hawaii. Also, I should say that because of all the mining, steel, industrial moguals that have been talked about in other posts, I felt I couldn;t not say anything, In case it was something.(Talking about frank Guistrea or however it\'s spelled.)  LIke I said, this could all be related, Some of it, or none of it.</p>
<p>Lets talk about the The name of the school and ten other buildings right next door to the 577 Pakala St, Honolulu 96825 location.  They  are named After <strong>Henry J Kaiser, who was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_J._Kaiser">American industrialist who became known as the father of modern American shipbuilding. </a>.</strong> In fact, Kaiser founded that area of Honolulu or some shit... Wait, realizing this in the moment... DId Obama live in Honolulu?  Any ways.</p>
<p>He established the Kaiser Shipyards, which built Liberty ships during World War II, after which he formed Kaiser Aluminum and <strong>Kaiser Steel.[1]</strong></p>
<p><strong>He founded the Kaiser Foundation, which happens to be located right next door to the Clinton foundation In d.c.  Speaking of Clinton, Steel, and coincidental addresses,</strong> </p>
<p>Let\'s go back to the Old Bethlehem steel  fire in buffalo New york, the day after the election. It was actually at the Site of the old bethlehem steel factory. Bethlehem steel was one time the Second biggest Steel manufacture in the country... </p>
<p>Ok , Long story short, bethlehem steel was bought up awhile ago, and has a long history, but the company that now owns the building itself, In lackawanna, is Great lakes Industrial, and <strong>the owner has some facts about him, that correlate with facts about the clinton foundation</strong>... Which obviously might not mean anything.  
</p>
<p>But real quick lets talk about Bethlehem steel fire the day after the election, and burned for 5 days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUvtOY8cvJk">forcing a state of emergency for lawckawana</a>  Under extremely strange circumstances, Such as initial reports <em>being that a light bulb heated up some cardboard</em> and started the biggest fire you\'ve ever seen. </p>
<p><em>They also never bother trying to put out the fire, rather attempt to &quot;contain it&quot;</em>.  Even though the mayor was required to issue a state of emergency and mandatory evacuation was issued for surrounding houses, even the fire itself was under no threat to travel to the houses, and although shit ton of toxic smoke, it was blowing away.</p>
<p>The mayor spoke to the news the day of the fire, but not until being pulled aside and directed what to say, by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4oBWL-6tRE">city\'s building developer</a> Here\'s a quote from the video <strong>&quot;It\'s been standing there for 80 years, haven\'t had any issues with any of these buildings so far... and then this happened this morning&quot;</strong>    He was answering a questiong about sprinklers being installed, I believe. Again, Trump is announced as  president, hours later this fire.  
</p>
<p>The Governor of new york, Came and gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHlQhNDEDuE">press conference</a></p>
<p>The Go between fire deputy also stated they were demolishing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwS0sWYEVMQ">immediately after</a>, actually  it was  still burning In some places.  
</p>
<p>The also said that it was inspected  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-EHLu4EL8">2 months ago</a>, and two days later it was they said that it was actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMnlSdychnY">two years ago.</a></p>
<p>The next day the mayor clarified his statements statements saying that it was being demolished that the mayor came out and specifically said, it was only demolition things that were a result of trying to put the fire out... Originally they said they were demolishing and it rose questions as to why they were demolishing  with out investigating the cause of the fire...  
</p>
<p>Oh and what caused the fire? Well originally they said  Light bulb heated up some cardboard. And originally said they were demolishing... Later they said they didn\'t know the cause and needed to investigate, but first had to say they were only demolishing places in the interest of fighting the fire... The fire they originally said they were going to only contain.</p>
<p>Here is the video where they clarify about demolishing... Three days later, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-EHLu4EL8">while the fire is still burning</a></p>
<p>Also, Dr. bob\'s storage was destroyed, burning luxury cars, boats, and possibly planes.</p>
<p>But we\'re going to talk about the owner of Great Lakes Industrial, who is <strong>David Franjoine</strong>... He, It\'s DF again... I actually am realizing this for the first time... That obviously is just a coincidence, Not being sarcastic.</p>
<p>What\'s that have to do with the CF? Maybe nothing, Perhaps they don\'t even know each other...  but the owner of the Great lakes Industrial, Is David Franjoine.</p>
<p>Holds the title Of either President, CEO, VP, Tresaury, or a combination.   For Mainline Contracting Corp., Curtis Investments, Frontier Industrial, Enviormental Recovery Controls Corp, Environmental Controls Co.  <strong>Steel Works</strong> </p>
<p>FUCK, I know I\'m forgetting something important... It\'ll come to me, But w.e he has offices in a bunch of states. </p>
<p>His companies specialize In <strong>Real estate, Mining, Demolishing, Construction, Basically a bunch of industrial Jobs</strong>... What was <strong>Henery Kasier,</strong> The Father O industrialist movement? Or was it shipping containers... Either way, you get where I\'m heading...</p>
<p>I\'m just saying. Here are some facts, that may be relevant, Or completely worthless.</p>
<p>EDIT: SO apparently that is a simple search page... I copied the link of from my david Franjouine results, So I don\'t know it\'s blank... But type in david Franjoine, and it will corroborate everything I said. Here\'s a list of companies and addresses for <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/people-search.aspx">David</a></p>
<p>Here\'s <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/company-search.aspx">Cf</a></p>
<p>The CF also Have offices in a bunch of states. In fact, <strong>In California, it\'s the exact same building.</strong></p>
<p>I guess I got lucky on that one, NEXT!</p>
<p>Holy fuck,  *<em>chicago, It\'s the exact Same building too</em></p>
<p>Wait, I must have did something wrong, Let me try again with Florida. 
Fuck you david Blaine.... How do they share an office building in Florida too.<strong>Florida, It\'s the exact Same Building.</strong></p>
<p>Am I Retarded? What am I not realizing that rationalizes this shit... Fuck it, Lets try Texas. </p>
<p>fuck you world, Fuck you. <strong>Texas the same fucking building.</strong> </p>
<p>Thank god in  Arkansas, CF has a few business at 3 different locations, DF has 2 business at an address in arkansas. And that building is  <strong>at least a half mile from those three cf locations.</strong>  Oh and Curtis investments was one of DF\'s companies that was in arkansas a half mile away from cf.</p>
<p>In nevada.  They have buildings 2.1 miles from each other. </p>
<p>Fuck, I\'m going from memory and I know I\'m forgetting some... But any ways I provided the list, so you can see the ones I Forgot to mention.</p>
<p><strong>Here\'s a lot of stuff, a little bit of stuff...A combination of stuff, and no stuff, Or absolutely nothing. That is all.</strong></p>
<p>Edit: OH, and I was going to say, That Obviously there is a good chance Some sketchy business is going down, with the Bethlehem steel fire, but perhaps unrelated to pizza shady business.</p>',

            This is an unreadable mess. Your "Cf" link is to a blank search page. I don't even know what you mean by "DF" and "CF". I would ask you to be far more organized in your writing, but I'm guessing you are even more neurologically incapable of it than I am.

             type In clinton foundation on that blank search page.. Sorry you fucking cunt, On my page, it is the page of clinton foundation results... IF you don't know who CF and DF are, based on what I said, You're the retard. THe owner of the bethlehme steel site, shares an office with the clinton foundation in Illinois, Texas, California, Florida, it's a half mile between them in arkanasas... and its 2 miles in Nevada. Those are the results you can clearly see if you search clinton foundation, and David Franjoine.  You stupid fuck.

              Don't call me a cunt; you're the one that kept saying you understood you might be confusing and I'm letting you know that this is indeed very difficult to follow and yet I'm still trying to do so. What you found were addresses for registered agent services, the addresses are for locations of places at which you register companies and non-profits and such, at least for the Chicago addresses. So there would be a bunch of companies registering using these services that are located in one building. That doesn't mean CF or DF are operating at that address, just that they registered there.

               You were a dick. I'm not reading past your first sentence, because you've proven to be a peice of shit. You're worthless to me. I was simply stating things that are factual, and said that there might not be anything to it...

               You fucking attacked me because you can't type in the words "Clinton Foundation" and questioned my neroulogical capabilities or some shit stupid shit. GO fuck yourself you pathetic cunt.  I said nothing that deserved your hostile fucking attitude.  I've contributed more to this shit, Than you'll ever know. Which is the only reason I Bothered Making this post, Knowing full well that it might be nothing.

              Do you have some sort of conspiracy theory about this fire? What would the motive be for starting it intentionally?

                What do you even think this Bethlehem steel plant fire is about? I had not heard of it before and I don't know why you find it interesting and I am curious. You neglected to explain what you think might be going on.
