No doubt through his Youtube channel we are learning more about the inner workings of government, policing and the intelligence community.  But at what price?  What else is going on?</p>
<p>Well, George has a brother who, of course, is estranged, standing on the other side of the fence but at the moment is joining his brother and focusing his viewers on Charlottesville also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt-yjTcd3tg">George Webb should Crowd Source the JTTF Charlottesville Incident</a>.  Is this a kosher situation or are followers being led into a trap?  Are you team Webb or team Acton?  <em>Musings on tribes.</em>..</p>
<p>Note the use of the term \'<em>crowd source</em>\'.  What does it imply?  I think it implies that much of the truth community is behind Webb and his band of merry men.  But hold up, who were actually the original crowdsourced citizen researchers?  Isn\'t one of the strengths of crowdsourcing that the horizontal nature of this activity makes it difficult for TPTB to pinpoint leaders and therefore, cut the head off the community, thus destroying it?  Let\'s hold that thought for a mo and have a look at one of Webb\'s colleagues and her journalistic outpouring...</p>
<p><strong>Trish the Dish</strong>.  This is one of her pieces: <a href="https://medium.com/@panegron/an-accidental-journalist-and-his-historic-crowd-sourced-investigation-dc5570ecbae9">An Accidental Journalist and His Historic Crowd-Sourced Investigation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In what has ostensibly become <strong>the largest crowd-sourced investigation in history</strong>, <strong>accidental journalist George Webb is leading the charge</strong> in an ongoing project that ties together the people, places and events of endemic corruption across federal, state and local agencies in his 4-month-old YouTube investigative series. <strong>Now boasting more than 22K Subscribers with an estimated 2M views, the series is perfectly illustrative of the shifting paradigm in modern day news coverage</strong>. And while citizen journalism certainly isn’t a new phenomenon, never before have individuals had a platform with such expansive reach whereby their work can be shared, vetted and further developed in real time. Almost as important is that these individuals who were once defamed, harassed and isolated into silence now have vast online communities to support them, validate and refine their work, and provide a venue for exposing the penalties harshly visited upon those who dare defy the Establishment by speaking out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alarm bells should be ringing for you after reading that.  Let\'s pick it apart a little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>the largest crowd sourced investigation, Webb is leading the charge</strong> - We now have a leader people !  See where this is going???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Now boasting more than 22K Subscribers with an estimated 2M views</strong> - What?  A truther SUPPORTED by Google and Youtube?  Riiight.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The background of Trish the Dish is interesting.  Here\'s my post on her: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2053098">Pedophilia, sex attack charges against Nu Skin Enterprises co-founder\'s husband, and CIA limited hangout Trish the Dish, Goodman and Webb</a></p>
<p>Well, on to George\'s CV:  In the past he\'s worked for Unisys, Sun Microsystems, Keynote Systems and IBM to name a few.  His last stated job was at iJento which dealt with analytics and enterprise software <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ijento#/entity">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ijento#/entity</a> , <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/ijento-raises-8m-from-mmc-ventures-nauta-capital-oxford-capital-partners-for-its-customer-intelligence-platform/">https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/ijento-raises-8m-from-mmc-ventures-nauta-capital-oxford-capital-partners-for-its-customer-intelligence-platform/</a></p>
<p>In March 2016 <strong>Blenheim Chalcot</strong> acquired iJento <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/759b8f22fd27f708ac72f35c92dcf9f1">https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/759b8f22fd27f708ac72f35c92dcf9f1</a></p>
<p>Blenheim Chalcot is based in London, with founders Charles Mindenhall, Manoj Badale: <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blenheim-chalcot#/entity">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blenheim-chalcot#/entity</a> </p>
<p>Looking at the related brands that Charles Mindenhall is involved with is interesting: <a href="http://www.expertimpact.com/?view=oneuser&amp;id=100">http://www.expertimpact.com/?view=oneuser&amp;id=100</a></p>
<p>I\'ve only looked at one- Operation Smile.  We\'ve heard about them before here on Voat:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1598275"> Laura Silsby connection to dentists in Haiti/DR...A LOT but potentially IMPORTANT</a></p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1619718">RTI Surgical, Habitat for Humanity, Dynacorp and the Deranged Dentists</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I\'m advocating caution with people who are putting themselves forward as \'leaders of crowdsourcing\'.  In my view, what is happening is that our own historical crowdsourced investigation is being co-opted.  It is possible that we are being led into a trap.  Note that Webb, Lionel Nation, Robert Steele have all advocated HRC not be prosecuted for crimes that forums like ourselves have uncovered.  Note that with Webb\'s focus on the Awan brothers nobody is asking who actually hired them.  The emphasis is on tracking the Pakistani brothers down. Caution is my mantra, caution.</p>

<p>By the way, thought I\'d briefly return to some of the related brands that Charles Mindenhall is associated with.
