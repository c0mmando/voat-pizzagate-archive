<p>Four For Friday...The Fire </p>
<p>When you saw the title of the blind, you probably were thinking of a fire that happened within the past week. No, that would be too simple. This fire happened a few months back now and the investigation is in the same place it was right after it happened. I wrote a little something about it when it happened and I fully expected some kind of cover story to emerge. That hasn\'t happened. Instead, the name of the game appears to be to just ignore it and ruthlessly crack down on any member of the media who tries to discover the truth.</p>

Instead, the name of the game appears to be to just ignore it and ruthlessly crack down on any member of the media who tries to discover the truth.</p>
<p>It started about a decade ago. Actually a little more than a decade ago. There is a foreign born A list mostly television actor who is probably B list here and A+ list in his own country. We shall call him A just to keep this simple.</p>
<p>A started hooking up with this A- list singer with A+ list name recognition. During that time period, the singer (B) got pregnant. B was doing a ton of drugs back then and chances were good, she was not going to stop while pregnant. The thing is though, she caught A in bed with C. Nothing wrong with that from the outside looking in. Some cheating is very Hollywood. The thing is though, C at the time would have been about 11 give or take a year. You see, it turns out that A was very good friends with that now deceased child molester who was A+ list in his own country and they shared a love of young tweens and teens. When B found out the truth about A, she had an abortion</p>
<p>A was not only interested in C sexually, but also had visions of turning her into his own personal piggy bank. He was going to groom her into someone he could marry off to someone rich and at the same time maybe find someone who could get himself a knighthood.</p>
<p>Over the next decade, A did just that. He kept assaulting/molesting/raping C but also was molding her into someone he could count on for his own future.</p>
<p>During this time, A found himself dating a foreign born B list mostly television actress who we shall call D. The day D found out about C and the dead child molester and everything else A was involved in was one of the loudest fights of the century. It was also around this time that C achieved the goal of A and got married to one of the richest men in the world. No one even asked her why she had spent the past decade basically with A, they just asked about her upcoming marriage.</p>
<p>C, as one of her first requests to her husband wanted to help out A. She not only found A someone who shared his sexual loves, but also made the life of D a living hell by basically eliminating her financial history from existence. Everything was gone and when it finally started to return, C made sure things were changed to make the life of D awful. D stayed silent with what she knew.</p>
<p>C also began plotting to make sure secrets of A and others A had introduced her to stayed secret. The problem is that her father-in-law in his old age wanted to make things right before he met his maker. C began pushing her new husband to do something and kept pushing him for almost two years. What finally happened? An attempt on the life of the father-in-law. An attempt which has stayed completely out of the press and will continue to do so because of the pressure on the media and politicians by C\'s husband. Apparently the father-in-law could have brought down hundreds of top producers and directors from all over the world</p>

            What I somehow can't believe is that Lord Rothschild wants to get clean before 'meeting his maker'.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was born into a family where this shit has been going on for ages, he surely is a die-hard satanist / luciferian.
           </p>
           <p>
            But maybe he wanted to axe someone / several pple for some other reasons before he died, using the evidence he has on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the details in Enty's blinds are not always reliable, although the general info he gives might be true.

             I sometimes feel Enty is controlled opposition. We have no idea if Courtney love made up this story to make Coogan look bad and cover up her own terrible deeds. We just don’t.

              Most people think the 'Illuminati' are a homogenous group, but they aren't. Like in any mob organization you'll find different factions, different interests and a constant struggle to gain more power.

             Agree that it might not always be true, and has the comments have pointed out, it could apply to more than one person, that's why they haven't been sued

            Anyone besides me have trouble believing that:
           </p>
           <p>
            a.  There is an attorney with a conscience
b.  There is an ENTERTAINMENT attorney with a conscience
c.  There is an entertainment attorney in HOLLYWEIRD with a conscience
d.  I’m not sold on the whole JEW angle, but for those of you here that are.....there is an entertainment attorney in hollyweird who is not JEWISH (and therefore according to some of you he must be a Talmud reading Pedo cuz that’s what they supposedly do)
d. If there were an attorney like this....big if.....he would actually spend time with these evil fucks or be close enough to them to get any of this major player pedo ring insider info.
           </p>
           <p>
            ????
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the Enty could be using pedopizzagate stuff he gathers from voat  reddit and the Chan’s as click bait material.  More Ads on there every day it seems to me. And if I’m totally off.....WHY ISNT HE WORRIED ABOUT BEING SUICIDED?

             First off, not sure how old you are, but there have been gossip queens in the past
            </p>
            <p>
             There was Heda Hopper, then there was Rona Barrett.  They used to write a lot of stuff like this
            </p>
            <p>
             Also in one of the rag supermarket magazine, my Mom loved these and they made great bathroom reading, had something like " eye saw" something that hid names
            </p>
            <p>
             No star will try to sue, Without names being given, the Star will spend a lot of money and probaly lose
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you imagine..." so and so, what makes you think this entry is you"
            </p>
            <p>
             Could be embarrassing for the star
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, how many stars call up and say " Is this me"   dont think a lot do, but there's a lot of dumbasses in Hollywood
            </p>
            <p>
             Does a star want to give this place creditablity by trying to sue which could backfire?
            </p>
            <p>
             He does do reveals, does that mean everything he writes is True?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think so
            </p>
            <p>
             But with some digging, stuff does seem true
            </p>

              As far as gossiping about actors and actresses, maybe.  Of  course his "reveals" must mean it's something he knows he can prove if a defamation case came forward. 
BUT, have we seen a Pedo related reveal yet?  One where he named a perpetrator? (dead victims don't count----O'Rourke)
             </p>
             <p>
              Regardless, I don't think the "Illuminati" types are going to sue enty for defamation.........they'll just Arkancide him.
