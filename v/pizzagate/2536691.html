<h1>More arrests expected in case against ‘Smallville’ actress</h1>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Authorities expect to make more arrests in the sex-trafficking investigation of a self-help group that’s already resulted in charges against former “Smallville” actress Allison Mack and the group’s leader, a prosecutor said Friday.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Moira Penza told a judge at a pretrial hearing in federal court in Brooklyn that the government plans to file a revised indictment naming more defendants in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Prominent backers of upstate New York-based group NXIVM (pronounced NEX’-ee-um) have said they were in the dark about allegations that women were forced to have sex with leader Keith Raniere.</p>
<p>Friday’s hearing marked the first time that Mack and Raniere had seen each other since his arrest this past March in Mexico, where they were staying together in a villa in Puerto Vallarta. The actress, who is free on bail but under home detention, sat two chairs away from Raniere at the defense table, but there was no interaction. Raniere remains jailed.</p>

            Are we sure that he has no intention of not making it a top priority? I explicitly explained that there is no legal conundrum to admitting the falsitude of inaccurate statements without determining the veracity of the underlying empirical evidence lacking.

              Probably poor taste to make fun of the shill, but I would slay his lawyer in court, and I am a dropout. I really could have made that longer, and more unintelligible for everyone, but that is why many politicians have lobbied for the end of legalize, the official language of the USA, and Latin as the base. This is not that I support the abolition of any dead language, but to quash it in a paid for society that has great unchecked powers. Most folk don't believe that words have powers you know.

               I am not one of them. Words have crazy magical power. That's why the Cannibal Elite look for orators to speak them and give them even greater power. It's why they choose and rely on actors also. Who better than actor to speak a lie?

                 I don't know why. She's only an Assistant District Attorney. It's what I was going to do. I believe the official gov website listed four district attorneys for NY. So if you use those names to find the individual offices, she might be listed as part of the team or however they're listing other pertinent employees in that office.

If she likes a post or befriends someone, they could say she knows him, or they were communicating. I'm not concerned, but here's Hajjar's LinkedIn and it's not much.

                It's not about ignorance, you're just that predictable. Yes I'm a woman. It's not exactly a secret. Still wondering what to call you because you definitely aren't a man. 🙊

                   Eucalyptus, wtf are you even here for? Every comment you make, you can tell you’re a complete lard ass cunt. Your basic below entry level mindset is literally useless here, or anywhere for that matter. Consider killing yourself 1.2 year older

              I could give a fuck if they are Jewish, Hindu or Catholic.  If they are pedos, execute them.

              Speaking of, how about a couple questions for my survey

             </p>
             <p>
              1) Do you agree all pedophiles should be arrested?
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Do you believe all pedophiles, if found guilty, should be put to death or incarcerated for life in ADMAX/GTMO?
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Publicly renounce pedophiles.

            <strong>
             Children's prostitution is sponsored by the Rothschilds, the Clintons and the Bronfman?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As more details appear in the case of the elite Hollywood sex cult NXIVM, it seems that this story will be endless.
There is growing evidence that this alleged self-help group was just a cover for trafficking. It was also revealed that this group has close ties with the families of the ruling class, including the Rothschilds, the Clintons and the Bronfman.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the accusations, actress Ellison Mac was a member of the cult and worked in a leadership position. Her job was to lure women into programs under the pretext of empowerment. Later they actually fell into slavery to Kit Ranier - they copied their money and property to him, starved to maintain a certain weight. He even branded them with his initials.
            </p>
            <p>
             The indictment alleges that Allison Mack tried to recruit women for exploitation both sexually and for work in favor of the accused.
            </p>
            <p>
             US prosecutor Richard P. Donohue explained that the cult was finally exposed when the daughter of actress Catherine Oxenberg, India, after joining the sect, was extremely depleted from the diet and suffered from serious health problems.
            </p>
            <p>
             When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, told the press the same story of blackmail, branding, and forced labor and forced sexual activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ranier is also accused of pedophilia for crimes that last more than 20 years, involving girls at the age of 12.

                It's men and women both. I never listen to anyone who refuses to admit that. Masculists are just as bad as feminists. And so transparent, too. Insecure males with low T. And boy do they whiiiiine. 😬 so annoying.

             As long as the bankers are in control, the CIA and FBI are in place traficking and covering up, CIA controlling media, No arrest of prominent cabal members, no red pilling of the sheeple, this is all a show. Alison Mack is a teeny tiny fish that the public is not even aware of is part of what she is part of. They think it is simply prostitution and are not aware the entire system kidnaps, rapes, murders 100's of thousands of children each year. Why aren't there tons of traficking victims that are older? They dispose of them, that is why. Anybody thinking this is stopping or we are winning has Peter Pan syndrome. The mods and Q promote this which exposes the mods and Q as gatekeepers. Q is an obvious spook opperation.

              Yeah I go back and forth on Q. Sometimes I think that genuinely good people can get caught up in hoping for some sort of justice but the fact that Mack was let out on house arrest and that the media has given essentially no coverage on the Bronfmans BANKROLLING Raniere (and who's brother Matthew is on the board of an investment advisory firm called
              <a href="https://www.belr.com/who-we-are/meet-the-team">
               Bronfman Rothschild
              </a>
              with Lynn Forester De Rothschild) makes you realize how seemingly untouchable they are. Raniere and Mack are just the faces to a more sinister group of people. That AP article posted earlier in the thread even notes the head of their "Mexican" NXIVM office is the son of a former Mexican president. This shit is on a level that I'm sure we can't even fathom.

             Don’t know why people butthurt enough to downvote you. This place really is the new reddit. 
What you said is right.. in the big picture of things, this NXIVM shit is only a drop in the bucket.. and NXIVM isn’t even getting torn apart itself. I’m waiting to see what happens to these front businesses they have.. until then, I’m sure Allison Mack, Ranier, and the rest are still living pretty lavishly, despite what some independent non source says.

             Salzman sounds about right. They did raid her place also. Wish the Bronfmans got on the invitation to party at Gitmo list. It'd be an early Christmas present for us pizzagaters.

               It will probably become a new legal defense. That along with Schneiderman's ''role-playing''. Really? So you can now beat someone up while hurling insults and claim you were just role-playing?

                   I'm sure a lot of these DA's &amp; police officials have been waiting for the handcuffs to be off and preferential treatment to be not the rule of law.

               Regardless, the AP photo says something to me, if you believe every picture tells a story. Lawyers are not smirking with pre-planned victory. She is looking ill. The cane. They still think they are in Hollywood and it will still work. She used to date Superman is the theme. Raneir is stuperman.  I am leaning towards singing like a bird with major redactions in printed facts.

               Wow, speechless.  I knew about CDAN but never saw this entry.  Such evil, I really was struggling to comprehend

               young women could get sucked in.  This makes it so much more understandable.  Normies just have no idea.  Lets hope prosecution in this case are talented and know how to work public opinion.  People need to WAKE UP.

                 That note should have been enough to hang him. That broke my heart for her saying she was brainwashed and the emotional center of her brain was killed/turned off. It really got to me when she wrote,,,If you find me or this note...I didn't know I was already dead.

            UPVoat!  What the heck is that about?  She should be locked up.  She was right there  while those women were being branded and worse.  I have not one bit of pity left anymore.  Especially for these Prima Dona Criminals that think they should be given special treatment.  You know the story, Give 'em an inch......   Possibly they are softening it up so she will Spill the Beans.  I just don't like her one bit.  Can't wait for them all to be paraded on TV.  If the scope is widened and there is a Cast of Thousands then they will have to cover it.  Yippee!!!

              I know, the victim thing bothers me too.  Also, I wonder if any of these women were MK Ultra.  Such bazaar things, including the money.  This way they were sure to get it.  Also those at the Top Tier, those investors in this, would def be able to pull that off.  We now think that JP and HRC and Hubby were connected as well.  I am sure that UK Royals were in this too.  And some of those Elites from Tex. if you know who I mean.

             Agree. She should be locked up, but she might be spilling her guts. It doesn't lessen what she did, but it might be leverage.

             Yes, I can't wait until the traditional faux media outlets are FORCED to cover this story! Ha! They did back in 2007! And they will again.

              Well the power is surely tighter now, but if the names are big enough and many, Social Media will light up.  That will cause a Buzz that will force it out.

                When will people make it their business to know about the Deep State.  It is hard to know who all the DS are, but we should be suspicious of every one of them.  I can't wait for Mueller to be taken down.  That is Mueller with a Long U sound not short u sound.  As in Heinrich Mueller.

                 Yeah, when that POS is exposed will be the day I break out the champagne! I'm sure there'll be many days of celebrating after that because I'm completely jazzed about the new post from Q.

                  Ha!  I have friends, a few close and some not, that will be in shock.  They deserve it and have it coming.  All running around with their Kitty Hats on.  I will be ROMFL.  There were shaken for the waking during the last election, but went right back to sleep.  I can't wait.
