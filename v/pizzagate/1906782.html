A few days ago, someone in /pol/ linked a video of h3h3 productions commenting on this shitty new kids video trend. Inspired by this, an anon who had noticed some gibberish posted in the comments of a video was autistically paranoid enough to look into decoding it and discovered that it led to a Twitter page, which led to more videos, which contained more ciphers, which led to links to documents such as a a pig pen cipher (which gave us half of a url, and we\'re still looking for the other half), and a yahoo conversation by one of the same people who posted the original gibberish youtube posts on the child videos. The yahoo conversation goes into detail about an organization based in the SE United States called the Finders, who are fairly well-documented by independent sources as being under suspicion of child trafficking. Some names were listed in the yahoo conversation, who I confirmed to be registered sex offenders, primarily in Florida. We were also led to an 8chan thread with suspicious images and ciphers, which has now been taken down. All of the signs lead us to a town called Pelzer SC, where an anons nephew was almost abducted by an ostensible Finder a few years back. He investigated the masonic lodge and mill there earlier today. We also suspected lhohq of being involved but it turned out to be a larp. JB is a cipher pimp, by the way. That is the best tl;dr I can do.&quot;</p>

            Interesting notion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bait kids, especially the ones with autistic talents, to get them into the whole "pedo scene lifestyle."  Bear in mind that the PG/NWO don't just steal and harvest kids.  They also attract and recruit them.  The kids who have been "affected" through GMO foods, corn syrup, big pharma, etc. - they would be particularly susceptible to this type of subliminal programming.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is akin to seeing a word out of the corner of your eye.  It registers with your brain, though the conscious doesn't "see" it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think all of this type of stuff is conditioning at the least.  At the most, I think it is either programming reinforcement as well as a way to attract the kids.  Hell, think of the recruiting efforts based on the comment responses alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            This type of subliminal coding is most likely what is going on with content programming - TV, cellular, and Internet.

             Use the same url but replace the "r" in reddit with a "c"  "ceddit.com**** " and you will go to a scraping site that will have the thread and some posts deleted marked in red.

            Which is this farm and camp in Vermont and the logo stands out, I think a finders cult is definitely plausible.
