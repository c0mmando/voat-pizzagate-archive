<p>Why wouldn’t the decrepit step-hag responsible for pimping out the step-grandkids on the website Evie’s Crib for “raw and uncut” time with the underage kiddies seemingly be tied to the rise in opioids? “Opioids?” you’re probably wondering. “Thought we were talking about the meth epidemic.” </p>

<p>One of the things that got me about the articles included in the post, is that various people kept referring to a “meth epidemic” in West Hollywood. I had no idea what they were talking about.

<pre><code>Twin plagues: Meth rises in shadow of opioids

&quot;Kristin Korpela, head of the Dunn County Department of Human Services, recalled having one of her social workers visit a young mother in jail, where she voluntarily gave up her three kids.

&quot;Meth,&quot; the mom told the social worker, &quot;makes you forget that you ever had children.&quot;

Next door, in Chippewa County, Human Services Director Larry Winter has seen out-of-home placements for children surge from 28 in 2013 to 103 in just the first five months of 2017. Three-quarters of those placements are related to meth abuse, he said.&quot;

<p>I urge everyone to watch the video on what’s going on in Ohio County! Our country is being ravaged and we need to wake the hell up if we aren’t already! It’s like watching the future as it was meant to happen … but it can be stopped! </p>
<p>With that said, when I saw the name Tamera Luzzatto and read about opioids, I suddenly remembered that I’d read a couple of articles on him/her and this very subject. I saved them because they were crucially important and another facet of this One Hemispheric Government that would be achieved through destroying America. I didn’t have time to go through everything, but will make the time now. </p>
<p>The article concerned opioid shipments by pharmaceutical companies to the state of West Virginia. Look at these fucking numbers! </p>

<p>Follow the pills and you\'ll find the overdose deaths.
The trail of painkillers leads to West Virginia\'s southern coalfields, to places like Kermit, population 392. There, out-of-state drug companies shipped nearly 9 million highly addictive — and potentially lethal — hydrocodone pills over two years to a single pharmacy in the Mingo County town.

<p>The unfettered shipments amount to 433 pain pills for every man, woman and child in West Virginia. … </p>
<p>The Gazette-Mail obtained previously confidential drug shipping sales records sent by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey\'s office. The records disclose the number of pills sold to every pharmacy in the state and the drug companies\' shipments to all 55 counties in West Virginia between 2007 and 2012.</p>

<p>I can see why they fought in court to keep those numbers secret, but they were put out there, but how many people were listening? It seems when there is reporting, it’s blown away or ignored because what Beyonce or Miley Cyrus is doing is so much more important than the fabric of our country being torn apart. </p>
<p>But wait, the article kept stressing the years 2007 through 2012. Who do you suppose was in charge of West Virginia at that time? And how did we get to 2007-2012? Who was there to strategize, implement, and usher in the doom WV now faces? </p>

<p>Rockefeller’s retirement was widely expected and puts the seat held by Democrats since 1958 in jeopardy for the party.</p>

<p>The joke is he ran on an “antipoverty program”?!!! Again, PLEASE WATCH THAT VIDEO! See what a Democratic leadership does! Forget about poverty … these people are dead … entire communities dying! </p>
<p>Nonetheless, people in West Virginia voted him in as governor FOR FIVE STRAIGHT TERMS! WTH is wrong with us that we do that? And people are talking confederate statues?!!! Watch the damned video! </p>

<p>Luzzatto was on the staff of West Virginia Senator John D. Rockefeller IV for nearly 15 years, serving as legislative director and chief of staff.</p>

<p>I would like to take every single person in the state of West Virginia by the shoulders and ask, “WTF were you thinking?”, but it seems America hadn’t woken up to the peril. And I would like to throw in for good measure a tidbit about Podesta and ports. Does it have anything to do with this story? Not sure. I’m including it because: (1) those drugs came through ports; (2) I wanted the port story to stay on our radar; and (3) the payments to the scummy Podesta Group are still unexplained. Here’s some links: </p>

            Jay Rockefeller doesn't go to West Virginia, even when Congress takes a month-long recess in August

           But who else was there? Who was by John D. Rockefeller’s side for this destabilization of West Virginia? Yes, Tamera Luzzatto! From the Pee-Yoo link above:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Luzzatto was on the staff of West Virginia Senator John D. Rockefeller IV for nearly 15 years, serving as legislative director and chief of staff.

           I would like to take every single person in the state of West Virginia by the shoulders and ask, “WTF were you thinking?”, but it seems America hadn’t woken up to the peril. And I would like to throw in for good measure a tidbit about Podesta and ports. Does it have anything to do with this story? Not sure. I’m including it because: (1) those drugs came through ports; (2) I wanted the port story to stay on our radar; and (3) the payments to the scummy Podesta Group are still unexplained. Here’s some links:

            Agree that the narcotic explosion in this country has been directed/manipulated by a cabal with an agenda.

            Look at this article posted on voat:

            "Dr. Otani said since 2001, opioid and heroin use has increased 400 percent in America. 
He also said people in Butte County are receiving twice the amount of opioids as the state average.
He explained that the pain from past experiences is often a driving force behind intense addictions. According to him, the best remedy is community connection." 
"It's about people pulling together. I think the epidemic is a result of what's happening. It's just a symptom of things that are happening out in society," Dr. Otani said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Butte Co. is a very rural, underpopulated county like the West Va. counties. Where better to push opiod rx's then where people are unemployed, discouraged, no future? ( Or are all these "legal" drugs being diverted, resold?)
 Dr. Otani doesn't lay the blame for excessive drug use on the doctors, but rather on the people whose emotional pain is driving the need for the excessive drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like another false narrative at explaining why the upsurge in opioids, a narrative put out by the medical establishment. This doctor was speaking to a Seventh Day Adventist meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many,many doctors of the Seventh Day Adventist persuasion. Many hospitals run by them, many medical schools run by them here and all over the world.The federal government via the VA trains at some of these medical schools, notably Loma Linda, Ca.They have facilities in 17 states but their influence stretches more widely as their trained physicians locate elsewhere.

            They've come a long way from what their founder , a 17 y.o.girl from Maine who had visions in the 1840s, stated :

           <p>
            "Ellen G. White pontificated about every aspect of life in her writings, and most of her non-biblical comments are an embarrassment today. She wrote that “drug medication… is a curse.” She stated that using medical doctors was a dishonor to God. She denounced the eating of eggs, milk, cream, and butter. In fact, she stated that eating eggs would make your prayer life useless! She spent most of her life advocating a vegetarian diet even though she ate meat herself. She forbid the drinking of tea and coffee and the eating of mustard, pepper, pickles and cinnamon. She put a ban on card playing, chess, and checkers, saying that such games “open the door for great evil.” Picnics and parties were condemned. Tennis, cricket, baseball, and bike riding were labeled “species of idolatry.”

            Would the Seventh Day Adventists like the Mormons be willing tools for the FBI/CIA? They are considered by some to be a "cult".
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mormons’ command of foreign languages usually learned while on the missionary service Mormon young men are expected to provide in their college years, made them appealing to agencies like the CIA and FBI.
“Our Mormon culture has always been more supportive of the government than American culture as a whole” 
"their image of purity and patriotism allows them to penetrate high into American government.  Howard Hughes hires them because they embody that dichotomy, and can get away with murder while presenting a pristine image to the world.  J. Edgar Hoover does as well."

             WOWZA! Great info. Thanks for passing it my way. I have no doubt that there are many people being taken advantage of.  I think it's more the vulnerability that determines who the doctors prey on. Think about it. You're a predator and need to eat. First you see someone having trouble walking. BINGO: VICTIM! Then you see someone healthy, but that naps on a park bench. VICTIM! Then you see a child with no parent around. VICTIM! You see someone drunk. VICTIM. And so it goes. With the agenda in place, the doctors only need to wait until an ailment or situation arises for them to take advantage of. So if someone is injured, that's an excuse. If they're depressed, that's a reason, etc., etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree it's community. We have to start spreading the word and not letting neighbors fall into this trap.

            Thank you so much for this post. This is very thorough and hits close to home for me. I'm not in WV, but I have several family members battling this addiction and three of those have lost all their children. And to think that there are elite scumbags planning and getting rich off of it pisses me off even more. I often wonder if Trump's opioid stance was the kicker to some of these coal towns. I mean when it's touched your family, you'll beg for help. Even if it's government.

             I'm very sorry to hear this. I know it must be devastating to go through. The strange thing is that we can't see these things when it's happening. That's what makes this whole thing so devious. The fact that Trump picked up on this means he's plugged into what's happening. It makes what The Cannibal Elite are trying to do to his administration so wrong. They are determined to get what they set out to get which is the destruction of home and America.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm extremely glad I posted this, and even happier that people are getting something out of this. For you it's personal, but for someone else, a wake up call.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's hoping your family and others get the help they need. And thanks for your comments. I really am sorry.

            Great post! I especially enjoyed your description of "Throw the kids in the pool" Tamara "Creepy as shit Anthony Perkins in drag" Luzzato.

            People dying like flies fulfills a purpose. The money being made from organ transplants is incredible.  This is all part of the plan as well as obtain the children and sell the little blondes to Saudi.  High $$$ there.  Drugs and shootings in Holman Square in Chicago is another example of push the drugs and kill the people in turf wars.  The elite think these poor people in south and west side of Chicago, poor people in W VA Appalachian area that nobody will care and the elites will snatch their kids. As some people believe, these dumbasses get what's coming to them. This is the attitude the elite hope you have of these poor people. That way there won't be so much of a issue about them dying and scooping up the kiddos. Glad you ripped the curtain open on this.  All people matter in this world that is why we are here.

             Absolutely. "All God's chldren" is are not empty words. They contain a powerful message and instruct us to act accordingly. We are all part of this and need to rely and help one, and not turn our backs. The victims of The Pedophile Elite were lied to. The believed the forked tongued devils and are paying for it mightily.

            I've had a similar theory. Anyone who has read Gary Webb's pieces on the CIA's creation of the mass crack epidemic (and the gangs of California that became so dangerous) or has even heard about his investigative reporting should be digging into the government's control of drug problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            One interesting observation about the meth epidemic is that it has targeted a different set of troubled people than crack did in the inner cities. Small towns have been ravaged by meth. And the government's responses include occasionally dismantling non-government suppliers and then making sudifed an OTC drug (and I'm angry that I pay several times its cost as a result just so that I can breath well on bad allergy days). The government has dismantled pieces of the trade, and yet usage has always grown back to previous levels. Huh. I wonder who remains with the capacity to supply all that meth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Huh.

             Upvoat for that observation. Very astute. Indeed all these drugs target different populations, some bleeding through and others staying in a particular pocket. Think about pharmaceuticals and opioids, they target another population altogether. They're the population who never dreamed of taking drugs. Nonetheless, they're not only one them, they're freakin' addicted to the stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gotta get this information out there. No more addicts! Not for any reason.

              Wonderful, thought provoking research.
             </p>
             <p>
              My mother had a Pakistani doctor that gave her all the sedating pills she asked for at age 84. You wonder why foreign doctors like to locate in poor rural areas? With no legit competition to scrutinize their peers' conduct, they can be the local legalized drug pusher unhampered and reap profits galore while "legitimately"
killing off native Americans.

               Thanks so much for your comments. I do appreciate them.

              <p>
               Another good point. What about those rural areas? They're even taking care of those, and making mass profits in the process. Who would do that to an eighty-four-year-old? Somebody absolutely ruthless in getting what they want. Since this touched you so personally, I can only empathize with what you went through, and probably are going through knowing what happened.
              </p>
              <p>
               We need to all get together and make sure this doesn't happen anymore. Somehow we have to communicate with relatives, neighbors, get involved in political groups and become politically active. We have a lot to do, but we can win if we work together.

I was shocked at the number of deaths the coroner speaks of.  North Korea is the threat?  Are we fucking serious?????  Russia?????  This is BEYOND INSANE.  Then again takes a lot of children to supply the cabal.

                 Brilliant piece of journalism, it should have won every award in the world. I think maybe it could be used to red pill resistant to what the hell is going on. The way that woman and coroner speaks is real. They're genuine. They're not slick crisis actors or NWO CNN hosts that tell lies and speak in false narratives.

                  ps...thank you for referring to them as the Cannibal Elite.  It galls me that they are referred to as just the elite/which I have NO DOUBT they put that in group think to make themselves appear lofty...above us peasants.  That and Illuminati..they are NOT ILLUMINED.  But terms like that further the hopelessness to combat them bc they are elite and illumined.  It's one of the biggest mind fucks going around and yet too few catch it.
                 </p>

            is, we need evidence hers some...my  dr. Small town dr. Director...pretty lady nice friendly lady, in charge for 3 years got my whole community ( it feels like) strung hard on SMOKING PILLS AND METH  just like she and other dr.s are doing to themsthemselves, she is strung out hopelessly i geuss, maybe a patsy, a ward, who knows. It was like the 2nd arrest before she was fired. I spent 3 years wondering why my people were so depressed and getting all these pills and I started only talking to the immigrant guatemalan workers in town warning them not to go to the Dr. In Spanish. They don't take drugs as readily anyway. But now, its been a year, we have dead people and she's finally busted. IBut another dr. Just got busted same rhing near by. I guess at least 2 wrongful death lawsuits against wendy, but I heard allot of people died locally, so many meth heads in Marin it's really scary. I used to not know the look, cause it's not always all skinny guant toothless, its a slightly swollen looking face either flushed of bood and pale, or completely Apple red. Not a very good description, but it's hard to know when someone smoked meth, unless they tell you they're doing it. My first experience learning about it, a friend confided she was on it and had been for years, I avoided her after that but the fact she had told me about her using it, brought on huge paranoia for her and she had an episode where she believed I was in her rafters at her home filming her telling her to get off meth, till she called the police on herself, and told them about me in the ceiling...in any case we are still friends, its been about 3 years since, and she is clean of meth but a really hard drinker that's functional. Knowing her has helped clue me in. Not shunning her was a challenge I am grateful for, but don't recommend trying to get close to someone on meth. Meanwhile I know other people who would run you over for meth, but lie. Honesty is best policy with methheads.

             Hi,  the spread of meth occurred because this missouri man who simplified the way to cook meth around 1990.  It spread throughout the Midwest for years before hitting other parts of the country.

            <p>
             Oxycontin was responsible for driving the opioid market that we see today.
             <br/>
             I recommend the books Methland about meth in Iowa and Dreamland about how heroin followed Oxycontin into Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, etc.  Again Oxycontin didn't come out until 1996.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sam Quinones in his book, Dreamland traces the rural heroin market to "Pill Mills" in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia where Doctors were freely prescribing Oxycontin.  They created the demand, then heroin traffickers from Mexico moved in
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Portsmouth was the pill mill capital of America, really. They had more pill mills per capita in that town than anywhere else in the country. Pill mills are where a doctor prescribes pills for cash without almost any diagnosis of any pain problems or anything like that. Pill mills usually have long, long lines — Portsmouth had a dozen of these, and they prescribed millions of pills a year and was one of the main reasons why so many people got addicted there.
The godfather of all that was a guy by the name of David Proctor. And by the 1990s when the main painkiller in all this, Oxycontin, is released, he sees this as basically a business model. You can prescribe these pills and people will pay you $250 every month to get that prescription, and you will always have your clinic full. And that's what happened for many years in that town. He also taught a lot of doctors who came to work for him how to run these pill mills.
So he became kind of the Ray Kroc, the McDonald's of pill mills 
.....
Ground zero for the pills is southern Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, places like this. In the mid-'90s, at that same time, across the Mississippi is coming the vanguard of a group of heroin traffickers out of a small town called Xalisco in the state of Nayarit in Mexico who are taking their drugs and looking for new markets. All of this kind of coincides.
[Mexican drug cartels] used customer service, they deliver just like pizza delivery, and it really appeals to this new class of addict who were white, really kind of unfamiliar, maybe, a lot of times with the drug world.
They don't want to get involved in Skid Row or some housing projects where everyone has always bought dope. A drug addict wants one thing above all and that's reliability. And these guys provided that above all. They relied on being very low-profile. They did not spend their money lavishly. They looked like the day workers outside your Home Depot. They drove old cars, they never used gunplay, drive-by shootings, any of that kind of stuff because, they didn't need to.

              I can't argue with that. And I think that more recently people have started smoking their pills, like all the sudden over the last recent years....because that's what Dr. Joiner was doing, smoking fentenol.  It was really bad at that time just being around the pharmacy in West marin. Where, when the dr. Wendi bust happened the pharmacist there cut off all her weird super long strange dread locks that would have colorful ribbons and yarn in a huge pile on her head. She's short and white. You have to factor in all the complicity to this and it's not far fetched to reason the upsurge in meth is at least following if not triggered by the upsurge in opioid prescription use and deaths.

             Thanks for your response. It's good to hear, and we're learning together. People have to clean themselves up. Drinking is horrible in itself, but it's nothing like meth. We need to wake up as many people as possible. Don't let them or their families be destroyed. There are so many drug addicts where I live, it's ridiculous. I really noticed it in the past couple of years. It didn't used to be this way and now I know why.

            Worth nothing that there is a theory that meth/amphetamine abuse "turns" you gay.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coincidently, a lot of DJs are gay.
           </p>

            Dont mention this in your posts tho cause there isnt any evidence for this, afaik.

             I've never heard this. I don't think a drug could induce a preference. What it could do is loosen your inhibitions to venture into things you wouldn't normally do. Like with Gemmel Moore. I doubt he ever imagined he would inject himself for money ... or smoke meth for money, but that's what he ended up doing. It makes you desperate.

              You worded it better, this is what the theory is actually.
             </p>
             <p>
              The site where i read this theory said that we have a "Willing to suk a dik"-meter (paraphrasing, it was a long time ago and cant find the site). The number goes from 1-10, 1 is "Ill suck you off no prob", 5 is "meh", 10 is "ill kill you, faggot!". On average men are around 7-8, not anti-gay but wont do any gay shit. The author speculated that drugs bring down the scale by 2, so if u were a 6 "i aint gay, hug me bro" u are more likely to turn gay.
             </p>
             <p>
              Search for "Amphetamine makes me/you gay", a lot of straight people complaining Adderal makes them have gay/bisexual thoughts.

             Yes, if a mother is on meth, pretty much those kids are going to be taken away. It's for a good reason, nobody is arguing that it isn't. The point is that this is deliberately being done. Drugs are spreading like wildfire. In my neighborhood, there are so many zombified addicts roaming around that it's getting scary. It never was before.

              Now we have GAY ONLY ADOPTION AGENCIES THAT TAKE STRAIGHT PERSONS KIDS AND GIVES THEM TO FAGGOTS - exposed at the end of my Jim Fetzer interview here - and how they said the best foster carer in QLD, Australia is a gay dad charged by the QLD police for fucking his foster son - before they went marching in the Gay Mardi Gras and saying - we discriminate against hetrosexuals. Homosexuals who are more likely to rape children deserve first pick of the litter.

             <p>
              Fostercare.lwb.org.au have already had gay foster parents rape more kids since I exposed this.

              PRESENT
An exposé showing that, in Australia, Christians are being ordered by civil tribunals stacked with gay activists, to publish apologies for "vilifying" satanic pedophile cults, in newspaper ads, or go to jail for contempt of court. The same applies for those who were found to have "vilifed" state-media-praised "gay dads" same-sex marriage activists who were later found and jailed for sexually abusing their own infant son due to their deviant homosexuality.   Whether homosexuality is deviant, or "normal" these tribunals do not differentiate.  Any person reported for "vilifying" actions or behavior of homosexual persons will be ordered to apologize, because it is unlawful in New South Wales Australia to "vilify" any person who happens to be homosexual.   However it is OK for homosexuals to "vilify" heterosexual persons.   John also got a letter last month from a "human rights" tribunal for not respecting OTOAustralia.org.au.  That outfit is an Alex Jones Infowars Confirmed Satanic pedophile cult, but in Australia it is deemed to be a religion, and therefore it is not allowed to be "vilified" under religious vilification laws. 
This is what my own father and friend John Sunol are facing, for vilifying the "gay dads" Mark Newton and Peter Truong, referred to above.  Who is doing this?  Gay judges and gay activists without law degrees who sit on panels as part of the State Tribunals of Australia:

Luke McKee has never solicited money in his 10 years in exile as a UNHCR Confirmed Political refugee from Australia/NZ, the latter due to backing of warrants scheme - the same problem Julian Assange has and still wont yet ask for a cent.
But he asks that everyone who wants to see a global end to these
thought-crime laws already in some American states please donate to Bernard Gaynor's legal fund.

Remember the Gay CEO of Apple Tim Cook previously has tweeted to Obama that these same laws be enacted and set loose upon the American people. Do you want to be next?

              Case Law keywords for www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au or austlii.edu.au (national):
"Garry Richard Burns" "Gary Burns" "Garry Burns" (serial applicant uses different names in court over 20 years) "Burns Gaynor" (see 2017 case)"Corbett Burns" "McKee Burns" "Legg Devine" (VIC x4) "CRISTIAN v BOTTRILL" "Sunol Collier". All cases are equally great travesty of justice, and the case law is defamatory to the respondents when you research actually what happened in the courtroom.  TIP: The Filter search results by database feature is very useful on Austlii if you know what state it's in

Now he's called the "Gay Atm" that makes laws to get Masterpiece cakes in Collorado sued for not bending down to a faggot and say take me - I am your slave, I will bake a cake captioned "I SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE". You are my faggot master - and I am your slave, so can't ask you to leave my shop and must do as you say.

              i'm fucked why????? you downvoting shill whose grammar makes no sense. Repost your comment and tell me again what you are trying to say. That bitch pomping out babies without registering them is in a OTO pedo cult and loves meat hookes being rammed through her back and being strung up from the ceiling. People who use meth and do that shit shouldn't breed.

             I wasn't aware of Manchin's daughter's connection to Mylan.  Thanks for that.  Btw, maybe you're thinking of the West Virginia governor Jim Justice who recently turned republican.

             I believe Manchin is still a dem.

              Oh, maybe it wasn't Manchin who switched, I'm not sure. But I know that Trump had a rally there a few weeks ago and someone announced a party switch.

             According to the article linked below, Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park is in close proximity to a children’s center called the Gesundheit!

             Joe Manchin's daddy was a crook too. The gov of WV is proof that the system is corrupt. They are dems when most of the state are conservatives who lean right. Rockefeller was put here so the jews can keep control of our natural resources. Flood the areas with shit like meth, Oxycontin and Fentanyl so that the people will be destroyed and (((they))) can take the land and minerals. (((Hollywood))) helped by demonizing the people of Appalachia, starting with The Beverly Hillbillies

              they have completely destroyed the environment. I've driven through WV and nearly all of the mountaintops are completely flat, its very weird, and there were bizarre huge (fracking?) fires every so often, with smoke blowing across the highway for miles.

             You could well be right. There always has to be a testing ground. And now the same test case will be replicated now that The Elites see that it works.

             I can't get the woman in the video out of my mind. There's such despair in her face and eyes. And the scene where they pan the camera and you see the devastation. Even the coroner where you see the cold room where all those vials are kept. It's staggering.

                For some reason I still cannot find the video!! When I go on the page I get Trump and North Korea videos that play automatically. I see the whole story and there is a photo gallery but no video. I'd really like to watch it but it's so strange I don't see it...
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd also like to mention a very important fact: kids are being prescribed prescription meth, Ritalin, Concerta and the likes for ADHD and it is meth but in prescription form. These drugs are also used by women for weight loss and appetite control. I also think ALL doctors in the WV rural areas should be looked at extremely closely.

                 You see the big black box at the top of the page with the words: "America can't quit its meth habit." That's where the video is. Right at the top of the page. There is no Trump and North Korea so you have to have the wrong link.

                 Good point about kid's being drugged. It's crazy that active, healthy kids are now being diagnosed as having a problem and given medication to calm them down. When I was growing up, if a kid had "too much energy", the parents would put them in a sports program. Swimming fifty laps of a pool takes care of everything.

                  Hi, That's so wierd as your archived page is different from mine when I click the link u provide. It has little clips under one minute long but no video at all and that is what the big black box at the very top shows.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And yes about the kids it's absurd how kids around 9 or 10 yrs old are being prescribed antipsychotic medication!! Their brains haven't even developed yet and they're being prescribed heavy duty doses of these toxic poisons it's heartbreaking. I know of a few doctors in my area who take money for scripts sadly, it's rampant and everywhere. I wonder what happens to politicians whose kids get hooked on this shit. Recovery houses are another huge moneymaker with greedy people involved. You can't possibly tell me a one month stay is worth up to $40k but it's true and people will pay anything for their kids to get sober and healthy :(

                   Which the kids were before the parents got them addicted. Yes, they don't know what long-term effect these things have. Rather than rejoicing about your kid racing around, they put him/her on drugs.

              Indeed.  I listened to a fascinating interview of Dr Leonard Coldwell on Rense recently, full of many interesting items amongst which Coldwell describes how everyone is aware of how much dirt there is on Sessions and how HRC knows this and has used it to her advantage and thus why he is protecting her.  A fascinating piece

            This is evidence free.

            And this is incontrovertibly incorrect.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the opioid explosion was directly responsible for the meth invasion.

           <p>
            Meth has been going on a lot longer than the recent opioid explosion.  They have two different causes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meth took off, because in the early 1990's a guy found out to take a what was a complicated chemistry equation and simplify so that it was almost foolproof and uneducated bikers could do it without blowing themselves up.  What used to be produced in a "superlab" could be produced in a garage or a motel room.  He also didn't keep this secret.  And you could buy the ingredients at Walmart.  They changed the law so you now can't buy this stuff in bulk.  The law that prohibited this tells you how long this has been going on, it's called Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005.
           </p>
           <p>
            The opioid epidemic has a different cuase.  It is result of the introduction of Oxycontin, a drug which was only introduced in 1996.    The active ingredient that gets you high has been around for decades but doctor's didn't prescribe because it tended to get you hooked.  Oxycontin was a patented time release method that gave 12 hours of pain relief.  Problem was if you smashed up the pills and snorted them, you could get that high all at once.  Because of this problem, the makers of Oxycontin changed the formula.  It's not harder to get that high.  So users switched to heroin which is much cheaper than Oxy.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were a 130,000 emergency room visits for meth in 2004.  Oxycodone wouldn't surpass that until 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then with the crackdown in 2005, meth went down for a while.  We are now seeing a resurgence.  It's especially since 2011.  This probably due the Mexican cartels getting into the meth business in a big way, importing the chemical directly from China.  There was a famous case a decade ago of a Chinese businessman arrested in Mexico.  This giant pile of money was in his house

              I think there's a generation gap in knowledge going on here. Older people like myself will have known of a different sequence of narcotic epidemics as opposed to something that came later. Doesn't mean one side is wrong or "shill" or the other is absolute right. We all learn from each other so we can move forward united against the decay afflicting this nation.

             Heroin has been around a lot longer than my Great Great Grand dad.
To the point where the only stimulants to be had was coffee brewed extra strong.
But you had to be rich.

              Of course it has.  But it used to be mainly associated with big cities.   The current opioid epidemic is different in that it's all over rural areas, West Virginia and New Hampshire both having real bad epidemics.  That spread into rural areas has to do with Oxycontin.

              I'm from NYC, ground zero for heroin in the US in the 20th Century.  90% of the heroin entering the US came through New York. As a result NYC was flooded with dope.   Supposedly there was a street corner where just after 4PM (when the cops were changing shifts) a million dollars of dope would be sold each day (or so the head dealer claimed.) The French Connection was not just a movie, it was a real case where they took $70 million dollars of heroin (in early 1960's dollars, mind you) off the street.   At least it was off the street for a little while.  Sometime later, the cops in the evidence locker noticed that bugs were eating the seized heroin which was now actually cornstarch.  Some corrupt cops stole the heroin from the evidence locker and replaced it with flour and cornstarch.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you know what "skin popping" dope is?  It's injecting it into your skin, like before you work your way up to shooting it your veins. A kid right across the street from was doing that.  He got caught and went to jail.  He got killed right like a day or two after he got out of jail.  The story I heard was he got out by giving up the bikers he was buying dope from and they found out and killed him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Popeye Doyle, Nicky Barnes, Chinese Rocks, Waiting for My Man were all part of my childhood.  As was A Hero Ain't Nothing But A Sandwich, Manchild in the Promised Land.  I heard a story of some hippie theater group from San Francisco who came to New York for a brief run and went back to SF as junkies because the New York dope was so pure, they weren't used to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              When heroin first came back big in the earlier 1990s in places like Seattle, a friend said, it's back because these kids never saw a junkie before.  It was not uncommon around New York to see people on the street nodding off.  Certain bars would have no locks on their bathroom doors to avoid people shooting up inside.

              See my other post. My awareness of heroin predates the mid 80's. I know all about Chinese Rocks even how the song got written.  The punk scene in New York was big into heroin.  Johnny Thunders would play New York, but he wouldn't perform until the audience hooked him up with some dope.
             </p>
             <p>
              This currently opioid epidemic is about the spread of heroin into places that never had historic heroin markets.  Oxycontin was nicknamed Hillbilly Heroin for a reason.

               How am I rewriting history?   Meth made became an epidemic in 1990's about 5-7 years before the Oxycontin fueled opioid epidemic.  Meth dropped off for a bit when they made it harder to buy the ingredients, but has since come back strong in the past 6-7 years.

              <p>
               Here's the Author of the book Methland describing his research.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                By the time I went to Iowa in May 2005, I’d already spent six years
watching meth and rural America come together. The first time I ran
across the drug in a way that suggested its symbolic place in the
heartland was not in Iowa but in Idaho, in a little town called
Gooding. I went to Gooding in the fall of 1999 to do a magazine
story on that town’s principal industry, ranching. At the time, I didn’t
know what meth was; it was completely by accident that I found
myself in a place overrun with the drug, though the obviousness of
meth’s effects was immediate. That first night in Gooding, I went to
have dinner at the Lincoln Inn, a combination road house and restaurant.
On Friday nights, the road crews who’d busied themselves
all week paving and grading the county’s few byways descended on
the Lincoln to drink beer. An inordinate number of them, it seemed
to me, were also high on meth
               </p>

              <p>
               The first time the DEA encountered the easier way of cooking meth was in Missouri in 1992.  It spread out from there
               <a href="http://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/">

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                John Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.
It was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.
Instead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.
Cornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.
As Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.
“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word," Cornille recalled in a recent interview. "He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States."

                 Here's my thesis.   The Meth Epidemic is directly related to Meth getting easier to produce.  The opioid epidemic is directly related to the introduction of Oxycontin.   The new recipe for Meth came earlier.    Everything flows from that.  These epidemics run parallel, but meth exploding throughout rural America came first.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would love to see your data to support the ridiculous theory that started this thread, the cannibal elite purposely started these epidemics.

                Actually you are still lying.  I never claimed Charity Navigator didn't rate them for a while, I proved your claim that Charity Navigator didn't rate them because they thought they were "bad" was false and I proved it definitively by using Charity Navigator's own words which positively debunk your claim.

                <p>
                 We had previously evaluated this organization, but have since determined that this charity’s atypical business model can not be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site
                 <strong>
                  is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity.
                 </strong>
                 We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What does it mean that this organization isn’t rated?
                </p>
                <p>
                 It simply means that the organization doesn’t meet our criteria. **A lack of a rating does not indicate a positive or negative assessment ** by Charity Navigator.

            meth and coke are drugs that sexualise you. i have to agree that the elite use the drugs two ways. by flooding communities with meth they destroy families and create abandoned children. and they fuel their sexual desires with cocaine. a lot of the behaviour during the abuse they perpetrate is fuelled with cocaine.

             Oh, one other point is that you'd very likely have to turn to sex to get enough money together to feed your addiction. It's another way of getting youth into being a "sex worker". Notice how they normalized being a whore. It's not "sex worker". It's being a prostitute and whoring yourself out. Let's call it what it is.

               There are so many angles to this. This has so thoroughly been thought out that's it's scary. People like Podesta and the rest are scum-sucking predators who took advantage of our collective innocence. After all, this is America. What could happen here? Well, this is what could happen: it could all be taken away.

              In Haiti they just lone them enough money to survive. Then they end up selling young healthy sons and daughters for Organs or sex (which ever pays more at the time). Organs have been a hot thing for going on a decade. They have medical hospitals all over Puerto Rico and Haiti.
They sill have floating Hospitals moored North East corner of Slave trade capitol of the world, AKA Haiti.
They are dirt cheap, a few $$ doled out every year to each hard up parent. The biological child mothers sell their soul for chocolate and cheap local flowers. No shit.

               So sad. Being poor is one thing. You can have ethics, morality, do better, pull yourself up and go back to school. In other words, there's hope ... and love. Poor + drugs = death and total devastation.

                 I'll tell you this, there is nothing wrong with receiving help. I'm talking in terms of falling on hard times and needing money to tide you over. But when that money is used to cripple your pride, take away your self-respect, and destroy your identity there's a huge, huge, huge problem.
