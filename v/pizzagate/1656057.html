           <p>
            Thanks for the post! A few days ago, I had the thought of how to go about tracing the source of the FMF funding. Where do they get there funding? Stand-alone academics are getting paid to be represented in legal proceedings as “Expert Witness”. Who’s funding them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wish there was a legit all hands crowd-source independent investigation to source the funding.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s well known that the CIA stands-up shell (fronts) with off-the-books banking operations, ill-gotten gains from running narco trafficking, weapons running, and who knows: human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Agency stands-up “fake” banking centers all over the world to keep the trails off-the-books. So then, it wouldn’t be inconceivable at all to stand-up academia, nonetheless, to collude and control psy-ops\narrative via a pseudo-scientific FMF. Even their web-site looks half-ass, is that by design?
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s plenty of well-qualified PTSD theorists to include psychoneuro docs, researchers that have debunked and can debunk the claims purported by the FMF and their paid-off Psychiatry docs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don’t know the veracity of this guy’s reporting or accuracy, but the writing isn’t bad:
            <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/mc/falsememoryhoax1996.shtml">
             http://educate-yourself.org/mc/falsememoryhoax1996.shtml
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the links to other similar pseudo-scientific “False Memory” groups especially the UK group. Same narrative; attempts to debunk claims brought about by victims of trauma. No doubt that kid in the latest vid leaked or sourced via anon in the dark web is no act. 
Trauma is encoded and energy is charged and resides within the body b\c it goes somewhere; accessing it via therapeutic tactics and realizing hemostatic pressure to safeguard against pain is the mind\body’s way to protect itself, hence dissociation. But to discredit basic biology understanding seems incredibly intellectually dishonest to include outright fraud.

            Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.

            I keep forgetting to mention, there is an amazing book called The Politics of Ritual Abuse. You all gotta read it. It talks about the cover up of all the crazy and widespread abuse going on and why there is such a strong force trying to make us all think ritual abuse is not real. Must read !!!

            </a>
            Donald Ewen Cameron (24 December 1901 – 8 September 1967)[1] — known as D. Ewen Cameron or Ewen Cameron — was a Scottish-born psychiatrist who served as President of the American Psychiatric Association (1952–1953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958-1959),[2] American Psychopathological Association (1963),[3] Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965)[4] and World Psychiatric Association (1961-1966).[5] Notwithstanding his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for administering electroshock therapy and experimental drugs to patients without their informed consent. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra mind control program.[6]

            I'm glad this info is finally becoming known. Anne Marie Aikins reported on this online years ago:

            I decided to go ahead and copy her message here that was posted on the codaplus site in 2005.

            RECOVERED MEMORY DEBATE - IF ONLY SHE WERE ALIVE, By Anne Marie Aikins.
           </p>
           <p>
            After spending the past 18 years working as an advocate with sexual assault survivors, my mind is at times overwhelmed by the memories of the courageous people, mostly women, I have worked with. Their faces will creep into my thoughts sometimes unexpectedly, bringing me back to a courtroom, a hospital treatment centre, or a group session, where I witnessed the reliving of their rape, or abuse.
A memory of one particular woman, I will call her "Eve", made me cry recently, after I read in a Canadian newspaper about British scientists whose research validated recovered memories of traumatic events and partially debunked the false memory theory. This theory has been used to promote the view that therapists and counselors are able to implant false memories of abuse in their clients', or patients' minds, making them think they were abused, when in fact they weren't. Articles about the theory have been published in newspapers, magazines and periodicals all over the world and testified about at many sexual assault trials, creating doubt in judges' and juries' minds about the truthfulness of victims' claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            A group of parents and accused people in the United States created an organization called the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, in response to the influx in the 80's of adults coming forward, claiming abuse as children. Their theory was undocumented and unproven, but it didn't stop them from testifying about false memory "syndrome". It didn't seem to matter that the vast majority of survivors always knew they were abused, like Eve, but only began exploring their secret memories as adults. And it didn't seem to matter that their propaganda was hurting many legitimate victims of violence and discouraging them from seeking help or disclosing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eve sought my assistance in 1992 [at] the height of the false memory debate, when she came to the rape crisis centre I founded after I was raped. She had begun to remember how it felt, when her father sexually abused and raped her, when she was a very young child. After attending group and individual counseling, Eve decided she needed to confront her father and stop him from abusing any other children. She reported her abuse to the police and he was subsequently charged.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the trial, the defence introduced evidence of false memory syndrome and the jury bought the theory, finding him not guilty. Eve's father is not the only accused person to be acquitted of sexual assault charges as a result of this "expert" evidence. Eve, like many other survivors, was devastated by the outcome and immediately began to doubt her memories. Her mother began to pressure her to reunite with her family and pleaded with her to put it all behind her. Believing her memories were "implanted" and there was no abuse was enticing to her and Eve eventually returned home, all forgotten and forgiven once again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eve's denial was so strong, she allowed her father to baby-sit her three-year-old daughter, until one day the worst was discovered. Her daughter disclosed to her that her grandfather had been sexually abusing her. I will never forget the desperate phone call from Eve. Her voice sounded like a wounded and powerless child.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eve collapsed into a black hole, a place she never found her way out of, and she eventually killed herself. Her parents never attended her funeral.
           </p>
           <p>
            My own grief makes me wonder what kind of difference the British research could have made in Eve's life: could it have prevented her tragic death?
           </p>
           <p>
            I am convinced these new findings must be comforting and validating to other survivors, who have been diminished by false memory mythology. I am hopeful that it encourages more people to disclose their secrets. And I will be outraged if any other judge allows this type of evidence into sexual assault trials ever again.
           </p>
           <p>
            I only wish the news made the front page of every newspaper for all the Eves in the world to see.

            but then they got off free because psychologists said she created false memories. Even people in this reddit thread believe she created false memories

            Just goes to show how easily people are influenced by this "false memory" propaganda. The girl was clearly recalling a real memory

            The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is one major reason I tend to believe the larger conspiracy view of Pizzagate.  I remember the McMartin case and the horrible demonization of the young child victims and anyone who believed them.  That case changed everything for decades.  After that, the generally accepted view was that children should not be believed when they made allegations of SRA.  I was duped.  It worked on almost everyone.

             This FBI guy was the one assigned to the McMartin Preschool case. His story about it is quite amazing.  This guy spent the rest of his life giving talks for around the country about sexually abused kids and ritual activities. He is dead now but what an amazing man. There are a ton of videos online interviewing him and covering talks that he did. This is just Part 1 of one of them. Can't recommend it enough.

            <p>
             It pisses me off to no end that when that happened I believed exactly what the news told me about it and that was that there was nothing to it. Of course back and then there were only a few television channels and each one had news, then a few newspapers. There was no Internet or any way to get different sides I was story. We live in amazing times.

              A few archaeologists finally got to dig in 1990.  They found strong evidence of tunnels matching the victims' descriptions which had been filled in.  I never heard about that until I saw the report linked at Last American Vagabond two months ago or so.

            Not only pedophiles, but they created an entire syndrome (false memory syndrome) with NO PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALIFICATIONS whatsoever. Besides being an accused pedo, the founder was a mathematician. How on earth these shills were quoted in anything peer-reviewed is beyond me, except the they were straight up CIA sponsored hacks.

            I have personal experience with both real memories of trauma and false memories of trauma. It can be difficult to tell the difference and both absolutely happen. The research into false memories done by Elizabeth Loftus is solid. It sounds like the so called researchers cited by the OP just have an agenda and aren't interested in truth.

             The research by Elizabeth Loftus  is shady a.f.  She did a small study on a tiny number of children, and that is the ONLY research the False Memory Foundation ever uses. Over and over, people will cite this OnE poorly conducted study by E. Loftus to say abuse memories are false.  So many children have been hurt by this.  I've often wondered about Loftus' motives.

              It sounds like the shady FMF has taken a tiny portion of Lotus's work and misrepresented it for their own purposes. For one thing, most of Loftus's work that I'm aware of was done with adults.

                Hmm you and if I might be demonstrating the frailty of memory right now. My (possibly flawed) memory of her "lost in the mall" experiment was that she would try to convince an adult, who claimed to have no memory of such an incident, to later believe that he or she
                <em>
                 does
                </em>
                remember being lost in the mall as a child. Family members were in on it and would feed the subject false details at the first meeting. A few months later the subject is asked again, and some percentage did adopt the narrative as their own.

                 Yes, but it was a tiny study on a small number of kids and not only is the science not valid and translatable to true trauma, but this tiny random study is being used for decades to discredit victims of one of the most massive horrors going on in this world. Her tiny, not truly applicable, decades-old study is the pedo's dream ammunition to discredit survivors. You gotta check out that book I mentioned. It's not valid to discredit  victims on the based on this. Yes, memory can be fallible, but that is another whole long post, and there is specific research on trauma survivors and memory, and this lost in a grocery store shit is not applicable. Basically, that would be saying that getting lost in a supermarket as a kid is equally traumatic to forced child  sex slavery. Severe trauma is stored in the brain differently  than other memories  are. And repeated, chronic trauma has a whole other effect on brain structure and brain development-- Not like what a kid would go through after not being able to find their mom in the supermarket for ten minutes.

                  Of course you are right. Trauma is stored differently from ordinary memories, and a study exploring the nature of one didn't tell us much about the nature of the other.

                      Any detail should probably be saved for private messages rather than on the forum.  Very basically, I recovered some real memories (which I have been able to substantiate to my satisfaction).  Then I fell under the influence of someone who tried to steer continued recovery in a particular direction.  The other person's agenda got in the way of real progress, leading to what I believe to be false memories.  All this pizzagate stuff has given me new perspective and information, to the point where I now hope to be able to dig a little more, without fear or bias, and just see what else is there, if anything.  For example, I saved some songs I wrote when I was a small child which have eerily pizzagate-sounding lyrics when I consider them today.

            I did quite a bit of research into news coverage of SRA during the late 80s/early 90s, when many psychotherapists of varied stripes all over the academic (Western) world came forward with the stories of their patients and persistent reports of ritual sexual abuse. To the therapists these stories seemed to corroborate one another independently.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found the recurring name of a
            <a href="http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Richard_Ofshe">
             Dr. Richard Ofshe
            </a>
            . His statements, his authority on the subject, were
            <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-20/news/vw-37291_1_satanic-abuse">
             used

            and
            <a href="http://www.fmsfonline.org/links/prepressedmemoryMPD.html">
             reused
            </a>
            to debunk SRA, in particular Recovered-Memory Therapy.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Richard Ofshe is not even a psychologist. He's a quack sociologist who somehow inserted himself in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_County_ritual_abuse_case">
             Paul Ingram
            </a>
            case a.k.a. the Thurston County ritual abuse case. There, he conducted his
            <a href="http://www.kspope.com/memory/facade.php">
             private little experiment
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ofshe, during his first day of interrogating Ingram, designed and executed an experiment to confirm his suspicion that Paul was not confessing to crimes he had actually committed (Ofshe &amp; Watters, 1994, p. 172). Ofshe "made a spontaneous decision to run what he later referred to as a 'little experiment' " (Wright, 1993b, p. 66) and introduced a supposedly false allegation into Ingram's interrogation without any advance notification of, or approval from, the detectives interviewing Ingram (N. McClanahan, personal communication, August 19, 1993; Richard Peterson, personal communication, February 1, 1995; Wright, 1993b).
            </p>
            <p>
             Ofshe fabricated a scenario–that Ingram had forced his son and daughter to have sex together while he watched–and then asked Ingram if he could remember this incident (phase 1 of the experiment). According to Ofshe's description of the experiment (1992), initially Ingram said that he did not remember the incident to which Ofshe referred. Ofshe encouraged Ingram to use the same methods that he had used to remember other alleged incidents before sending him back to his cell. The next day, Ingram told Ofshe that he had some clear memories of making his son and daughter have sex, and he produced a three-page, written confession of the incident. Ofshe then pressured Ingram to renounce the confession (phase 2 of the experiment), which Ingram was unwilling to do.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So this utterly unqualified 'sociologist' conducts an utterly uncontrolled, unscientific, and frankly immoral experiment in a landmark case of RSA, and from then on he is taken as an authority on the subject not just in the US but internationally.

            The stench from this particular rabbit hole is only periodically bearable for further digging.

            Great post. Gaslighting has been around a long time, but was unaware that pedophiles and ritual abusers had set up an entire organization devoted to gaslighting victims. This sham organization and the cases they've been involved in need further attention.

             Exactly.  Gaslighting is the go-to tactic for the pedophile supporters every time.  We just saw the entire establishment media turn into one large gaslighting organization over the last few months.  When that doesn't work, they play rough.

            Every conspiracy theory you look at, you will see the CIA or Mossad involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oswald had CIA connections
Osama bin Laden was a CIA agent
Michael Aquino, the Satanist at Presidio, was a CIA and military intelligence officer
The Finders cult investigation was stopped by the CIA
Iran-Contra involved the CIA
Comet Ping Pong is located in a CIA heavy neighborhood, and its characters show evidence of MK-ULTRA brainwashing
           </p>
           <p>
            And so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Around 1945, Wall St. setup the CIA and DynCorp to otherwise-illegal profiteering under the cover of the law. Immediately the CIA started selling heroin out of Cuba to pay for operations. It has been corrupt as fuck for almost a century. As soon as you figure this out, you figure out so much about what is wrong with this country.

              Yes, the point of which is to condition  us plebs to doubt reality. Also to make us think the all-powerful elite can alter past events. Not buying it.

            This is so disgustingly sick. I studied psychology at Uni and they put so much emphasis on "false memories" and how as a psychologist you would be more likely to encounter "false memories" in self proclaimed abuse victims and therefore to be skeptical of every claim of abuse that is presented to you . It's set up so victims are made to feel like they're the ones to blame and that they're insane in order for them to be exploited through psychiatrists and psychologists who just drain cash from them through falsely diagnosing them.

             but then they got off free because psychologists said she created false memories. Even people in this reddit thread believe she created false memories

             Just goes to show how easily people are influenced by this "false memory" propaganda. The girl was clearly recalling a real memory

               This. It's all part of making well-groomed pets for consumerism. It's hard to fit in most places after realizing how duped we've been. Everything, and I mean all consumerism, is a proxy for true love and happiness. God I hope we can break out of this new dark age very soon

                Yeah. I have a pharmacy degree, worked as a pharmacist for a while but got bored so moved into Pharma on clinical research.  When I took off to have kids...my husband was getting redpilled about our corporate government. At first, I complained about him constantly listening to Alex Jones and a few others on what I called "paranoia radio" but we woukd be in the car and I couldn't escape so over a year or so, I started to believe.  That was in 2003.
               </p>
               <p>
                Part of that time, I was listening to the natural health guys about the evils of Monsanto...on paranoia radio and never could go back to pharma.  So I became a freelance writer.
               </p>
               <p>
                By 2006, I knew about bohemian grove and Hollywood and other stuff but I didn't "really" believe it was this much until last summer when FBIAnon came on 4chan and for some reason I was lurking the first night.

                 That was very brave of you to make that change. I know the feeling; I had to leave academia when I realized I was being paid with stolen money to produce outcome-based research. Everything became clear to me about a year ago: Science Is Rigged.

                 Now I'm doing a technology startup on my own—trying my hardest to stay inline with Natural Law (i.e., be good to the planet, non-ego-driven, for the higher Will, etc.). It's been quite a journey since I left the security of corporate-academic slavery. I have to be creative to make a living while practicing spiritually guided entrepreneurship. I have to use my intuition way more than in the past, but it feels good to break those pesky maladaptive neural patterns along the way.

               Yep, and I did 8 years. Don't regret it one bit, but it took a lot of effort to minimize the brainwashing, and I wasn't popular among my colleagues who knew my anti political sentiments. Have to separate the signal from the noise—although the great majority is noise, if not outright misinformation. Such is life in general

            What about all that false scar tissue? I know a psychologist who had memories of being ritually abused as a child, and treated others who had similar stories. She says now, that she has learned that these are false memories. She said that ALL of the people who think they remember such horrors are having false memories! This was 3 years ago, but I couldn't believe she could make a blanket statement like that. I told her that I knew 2 adults that had these memories, and she said they were false memories. How is that even possible? She now is a working professional therapist! So sad. Maybe it's easier to think it's false, b/c  it's too terrible to live with. Makes no sense to me at all, what about the kids with physical damage?

               "A highly recommended new book that calls into question how society views accusations of child sexual abuse. A series of prosecutions against day care workers in the 80's were widely viewed as overly zealous, particularly after many of the convictions were overturned. The book is based on 15 years of careful research by Ross E. Cheit, Professor of Public Policy and Political Science at Brown University and his students. Cheit shows that almost all of these day care abuse cases were based on real evidence of child abuse. This book documents how misinformation promulgated by the media and by professionals led to the public perception of an epidemic of false accusations."

              Grandson Lucien is connected to Pizzagate investigation. He invited the McCann's [parente] to his villa only a short distance from where the Madeleine McCann disappearance took place, soon after the abduction.

             <p>
              . It's said the 2 Podesta's were at Lucien's villa in Portugal at the time of the abduction. Also, there was artwork of an artist Podestas collected shown at the Freud museum in London. And the two-face penis tip call "Janus" [two faced god] hung over Freud's famous couch .

            The fraudulent False Memory Syndrome Foundation was one of the major forces that discredited victims and therapists back in the 80's and 90's, making SRA appear to be a joke. My hope is that the joke will soon be on ALL of them!
