<p><strong>These criminal enterprises</strong> are flat, fluid networks with global reach. While still engaged in many of the “traditional” organized crime activities of drug trafficking, loan-sharking, extortion, and murder, new criminal enterprises are targeting stock market fraud and manipulation, cyber-facilitated bank fraud and embezzlement, identity theft, wildlife trafficking, <strong>trafficking of women and children</strong>, and other illegal activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No matter what\'s your personal opinion on Mr.Comey, but this was FBI\'s last publication mentioning child trafficking before he was soon out of job as the Director of FBI. What\'s more is in this statement, related to pizzagate:</p>
<h1>Operation Cross Country</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>...completed its 10th iteration during October 2016. Over 300 operational teams from 400 agencies across 135 cities and 55 FBI field offices were instrumental in recovering <strong>82 child victims</strong>. Also arrested were 239 traffickers...</p>
<hr />
<p>From the first Operation Cross Country to this most recent action, <strong>837 children</strong> have been recovered and 1,254 johns have been arrested. [ed.note: since 2013]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Innocence Lost National Initiative</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>serves as the model for the partnership between federal, state, local, and international law enforcement partners in addressing child prostitution. Since its inception, more than <strong>6,390 children have been located and recovered</strong>. The investigations and subsequent 2,622 convictions have resulted in lengthy sentences, including 28 life terms. [ed.note: The statement does not mention in how many years]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Health Care Fraud (pizzagate connection: indicators of corruption in high level)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The FBI currently has over 2,800 pending health care fraud investigations. Over 70 percent of these investigations involve government funded programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Public Corruption (pizzagate connection: Corruption exists also on the Border control and in Court)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>It affects how well <strong>U.S. borders</strong> are secured and neighborhoods are protected, how <strong>verdicts are handed down in court</strong>...</p>
<hr />
<p>One key focus is <strong>border corruption</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Going Dark (even pedophilia got mentioned in the statement)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of our criminal investigators face the challenge of identifying online pedophiles who hide their crimes and identities behind layers of anonymizing technologies, or drug traffickers who use virtual currencies to obscure their transactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Can we trust on this statement</h1>
<p>This is an interesting question. In my impression, the main purpose of the wording is ensuring the financing of the operations. Also, many of <strong>the elements of pizzagate are present</strong>:</p>
<h2>Low level of arrests</h2>
<p>As an example, Operation Cross Country 10, lasting 4 days on October 2016, managed to save only 82 child victims, while during these same days only (calculating from earlier FBI statistics) about 670 children were raped.</p>
<p>If more than 300 operational teams really performs this bad... How about those days when these teams are not focusing on crimes against children. The report indicates a serious problem not taken care of. That\'s part of pizzagate.</p>
<h2>Very low level of convictions on sex crimes against children</h2>
<p>As told in the statement, corruption exists in the court. The statement doesn\'t include how many people were finally convicted on crimes against children on the mentioned operations, but I found a blog presenting an extremely low level (2nd source link, ps. The author doesn\'t seem to use sources too well so don\'t take everything there as a fact)</p>
<h2>Clearly, high profile persons / organizations involved</h2>
<p>&quot;criminal enterprises run multi-national, multi-billion-dollar schemes from start to finish&quot;, child trafficking mentioned as one of their crimes, and zero arrests on these so far, further suggesting there\'s serious corruption - (possibly also within FBI, who knows) - Clearly indicates that the pizzagate exists, and is not being taken care of.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I\'d say, that according to this FBI statement, important parts of pizzagate are true and exists today, especially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>child sex trafficking covered up by high profile persons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cover up is obvious, the corruption is obvious, the child sex crimes taking place are obvious. Maybe we should take this as a reliable source, even if from Comey. Recommending to read it through and form your opinion.</p>

                Leaked videos of everything except the actual act of raping a child would force them to. Leak a video to youtube of Pedosta bringing a kid into his house, starting to disrobe, then cut out. They'd have to go after him, or risk a response by the good people of the country.
