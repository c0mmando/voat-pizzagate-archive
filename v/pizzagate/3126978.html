<p>Why are they worried about a petition  with only 1,100 signatures on WH.gov? Sorry for the Pizzagate &amp; Q conflation, but no avoiding it.</p>
<p>Story:</p>
<p>Visitors seeking the most popular entries on the White House’s official online petition site will come across topics that fall within the natural political discourse, like government ethics, abortion, and net neutrality. But it takes just a few clicks to find some startling appeals, including one calling on the president to deploy troops to Los Angeles’s Getty Museum of Art: </p>
<p>“We demand that our Marine Corp be called to OCCUPY THE GETTY, access the elevator to the bunker, and immediately free our children and return them to the surface. Do not allow these monsters to use underground bunkers, under the pretense of ‘continuity of Government’, to rape and eat our children in honor of their Satanic beliefs.”</p>
<p>If the allegation seems like the kind of harebrained theory known to circulate in social media conspiracy circles, that’s because it is. But thanks to a coordinated campaign by followers of the so-called “Q-Anon” movement, a group of conspiracists who analyze anonymous posts from someone claiming to be a high government official calling himself “Q,” it now also appears in the searchable index of the “We The People” petition site hosted by the Trump administration. The site features several other conspiracy-related petitions echoing—and spreading—ideas prominent in Q-Anon, as shared by believers on YouTube groups and on Facebook.</p>
<p>The petitions are attractive to Q-Anon conspiracists as a form of “slacktivism.”
While the Getty petition has only just topped 1,100 signatures, according to metrics from BuzzSumo, the petition itself has ricocheted around social media, receiving over 1,600 likes and shares on Facebook in less than a month. YouTube videos about the petition have over 6,000 cumulative views. This is the ninth time a petition to invade the Getty has been introduced by the same person, and it’s likely, as with the ones that came before, it will fail to meet the threshold of 100,000 signatures that the Obama administration, which launched the site, set to trigger some form of White House. But the social reach of the petition demonstrates the platform’s potential to be weaponized by fringe actors seeking to legitimize their causes by associating them with an official government website. (A Getty museum spokesperson declined to comment on the conspiracy theory, citing “security concerns.”)</p>
<p>It’s not just Q-Anon that uses the site to bolster conspiracy theories. Other popular petitions have called for the White House to intervene in vaccination requirements for children; one, which reached over 70,000 signatures before its voting period expired, promoted Children’s Health Defense, which propagates medically dubious research about the purported health risks of vaccinations. In the fall, the security company New Knowledge issued a report to the Senate intelligence committee revealing that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian disinformation workshop, not only shared but created Whitehouse.gov petitions on topics including gun laws and banning Hillary Clinton from running for president.</p>
<p>Trolling of the White House petition website didn’t begin in the Trump-era. Almost immediately after the project’s 2011 rollout, the platform became a playground for pranksters’ petitions pleading for President Obama to build a Death Star, or designate a Nicolas Cage movie as the official film of the United States. The zaniest, including one demanding the deportation of popstar Justin Bieber, were met with a polite rebuff from the administration. It also emerged as a place to express political dissent; after Obama’s 2012 re-election, the site was filled with calls for secession and birther conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>According to Travis View, a Q-Anon researcher, the Q movement’s appropriation of White House petitions traces back to an alleged post by “Q” on the online forum 8chan in August of 2018 that shared a link to a petition calling for the federal government to designate Antifa as a terrorist organization.</p>
<p>As reported by Politico, the petition was first posted a year earlier by a “well-known pro-Trump troll” following conflict between Antifa and white supremacists during the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. (The same troll made a similar attempt to get Black Lives Matter categorized as a terrorist group in 2016. After the petition topped 100,000 signatures, the Obama White House responded by saying it was not involved in categorizing terrorist groups and couldn’t respond to the request.)</p>
<p>While the Trump administration completely ignored the site for most of his early tenure, after relaunching the platform in early 2018, the administration has responded to a select few petitions, including the one calling for Antifa to be designated as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>View tells Mother Jones that White House petitions are attractive to Q-Anon conspiracy theorists because they fit perfectly into the “slacktivism” the group thinks will bring political change. “This is a sort of an extension of their general political philosophy, which is if they get enough people together they can have an effect on the internet that can bring about real change,” he says. “It’s the same sort of impulse as to why they encourage a particular hashtag.”</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to questions about its use of the platform, whether it was aware of its role in spreading conspiracy theories, or if it plans to respond to a petition with nearly 200,000 signatures demanding George Soros—the liberal philanthropist of Jewish heritage who is a frequent target of online conspiracists—be declared a terrorist.</p>
<p>To Q-Anon believers, there’s another allure to the petition website: the platform’s very existence is taken as proof that purported liberal fears that Trump “is a dictator” are bunk.</p>

**Perhaps inevitably, some online conspiracists have launched conspiracies about the site itself. One YouTuber suggested that the government had tampered with a Pizzagate-related petition, reasoning the number of signatures was “much lower” compared to online interest in the conspiracy theory that Democrats ran a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, DC pizzeria.</p>
<p>While conspiracies like those about the Getty might seem bizarre and easily dismissed to many people, they can egg on real-life violence. In 2016, DC police arrested a man who fired a semi-automatic rifle inside of Comet Ping Pong; a subsequent arson attempt took place in January. Last year, Soros was mailed a pipe-bomb by an extremist who was radicalized online.**</p>

            In Mother Jones we have a jewish guy named David Corn who wrote a book blaming Ted Shakely for the woes at the CIA, while getting criticism from Joseph Finder who claims he was once recruited by the CIA but declined because he would rather write fiction. Finder (Phi Beta Kappa), is a founding member of the International Thriller Writers Association, and served as Financial Advisor to International PEN-New England. He is also a member of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers. He writes on espionage and international affairs for publications including The New York Times and The Washington Post. How could Finder be a member without ever taking a job like that? Joseph Finder was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1958, and spent much of his early childhood in Afghanistan and the Philippines before his family returned to the United States and lived in Bellingham, Washington and outside Albany, New York.  Finder majored in Russian studies at Yale University.  Other names include 'Bauer'lein, Hochschild(Berkely jewish), Micheal Moore, Jeffrey Bruce Klien(larry Flynt) married to Judith Weinstein Klein who died at 48. Since I was alive during most of this time frame, I summarize as cabal talking heads pretending to debate, but really putting you to sleep. Anyone else pick out some patterns?

            "George Soros—the liberal philanthropist of Jewish heritage who is a frequent target of online conspiracists—be declared a terrorist."
First time I've seen Soros characterized this way by Fake News. Laying the groundwork for declaring those exposing/opposing him as "anti-semitic?"
           </p>
           <p>
            MJ then repeats the unproven claim that Welch shot a gun inside Comet Ping Pong: "a man who fired a semi-automatic rifle inside of Comet Ping Pong."  There were no eye witnesses of him shooting a gun nor witness report of hearing a gunshot in the original police report. WELCH WAS NEVER CONVICTED OF FIRING A GUN IN HIS PLEA DEAL. I guess our CPP "arsonist" investigation paid off. That story withered on the vine and all they can say is "a subsequent arson attempt."
           </p>
           <p>
            HERE'S THEIR ZINGER: "Soros was mailed a pipe-bomb by an extremist who was radicalized online."
           </p>
           <p>
            Things have gotten so bad that BILLION DOLLAR Soros now needs protection from FAKE NEWS and "anti-semitism" even though he allegedly worked with the Nazis to round up other jews.......

            More and more reason to think the "string-pullers" behind Q are doing the typical agent provocateur stunts to try to blot out legitimate research into child abuse/trafficking topics... not like this is first time they have tried to pull this stunt before...

              Honestly I try to avoid arguments about Q on here, but there is one thing I want to say: I think we have to recognize that a really effective way of disinformation, in my opinion, is one source that puts out some legitimate information, mixed in with a bunch of disinfo crap, to be blunt about it. I'm not claiming to be an expert on Q, but I will say, I have no doubt at all these kind of disinfo tactics are being tried on society in many different ways

               Of course there is disinformation mixed in.  Disinfo based on truths and echoes. As much as people want to separate themselves from Q, the story lines are completely intertwined.  Everything is related.  No coincidences.

               And Im not sure of what arguments there have been.  Advise.

            All media is "state" now...TV , publishing, you name it. The problem is the system, not who is currently  in the WH. I see this Mother Jones article as a further effort to divide.........when we are divided, the elites who control US are glad. Way to go Voat, you make them happy. Evidence is probing all the filthy rich are involved. Emphasis on filthy. i.e. Trump signed an executive order to make it possible for all assets of those who engage in trafficking to have their assets confiscated. After that the Rothschildren sold their UK family compound and have now gotten out of the lending biz...i.e central banks. Google with duckduckgo........it is there for those who want to see.

             I remember Q pointing out the Rothschild "sale." Who bought it? Was it a child trafficking sight? Was this the only property formally in their name? Very interesting.

            When the fires hit the getty museum , Liz Crokin was saying she hoped there were no children in the basement. She is very popular on you tube exposing child sex trafficking.Remember a video or statement on this website from her and so many did not know who she was. I find that pretty profound. We have to be careful of a limited hangout being tagged to this website......it is getting shaky here....Autists is a fine definition , but stupid is limiting.

            Q is insider that's for sure and he's dropping real intel that's for sure, but there are things indicating that he's a distraction from Jewish question - because Pizzagate is Jewish question. Somehow Breitbart ( Jew ) who personally knows Netanyahu knew that Podesta is running pedo ring? And we should know that Breitbart ( Mossad voice in America ) was attacking Obama because he wasn't enough pro-Israeli in "his" ( in Mossad ) opinion. Ghislaine Maxwell is similar to sketch of suspect in disappearance of Madeleine McCann and she is Epstein ex girlfriend, she was doing child trafficking for him, she's also friend of Donald Trump, her father was Israeli superspy. NOTHING to see here, just many indications that Pizzagate is Mossad operation to blackmail American politicians who aren't enough pro-Israel, destroy them so the only remaining ones are ultra pro-Israel like Donald Trump.

              I'm not saying that QAnon can't be legit. I hope he's legit. There are things indicating what I've said but it can be just the opposite. My comment wasn't conclusive and there are also indications that QAnon understand Israel was influencing and it's still trying to influence US policies on the Middle East and it's not good for the US.

             LMAO Q are all boomers and women and will keep voting for one side of the kosher sandwich.  That's the entirety of its purpose and effect.  "All the woke people" are literally gonna die off soon, thank God.  "slacktivism" LOL they nailed you retards.

             Open mockery is the opposite of being scared.  Again, you're fucking BOOMERS AND WOMEN LOL.  Scared is what they are of the Jewish Question, as all legislation and censorship indicate.

              I'm going to LMAO at you, Donkey, when Q fulfills his promise to kill the Federal Reserve and put the US back on the gold standard. I guess you didn't know he redpilled his millions of normie followers to the corruption of globalist fiat currency and called out all the Rothschild banks individually. That project is going to require a second term for Trump, but he has definitely put himself on the hook for it. Time will tell.

               Gold standard is an old red herring for kike shills like you to throw at the goyim.  As if kikes don't own all the gold anyway.  The PROBLEM is creating money through interest, not whether the currency is backed -- and Patriotard boomer faggots like you LOVE kike finance and muh bootstraps and muh Art of the Deal. That's how easy you are to manipulate.

                ? That would explain your ongoing rage about white girls who "suck Jew cock". You don't see a lot of Jews marrying black women, so either a prostitute or a housemaid...maybe hotel staff? My original theory was that your mom was the Jew and your dad was a gang banger, but this makes more sense.

             I have a tendency to believe your analysis. This is meant to dismiss both Q and pixxagate. Whoever hacked the wh petition site was an agent provocatuer. Like the black bloc anarchists. No way Q would say eating children.

               Anyone who uses "leftist" to describe an event or series of events to attribute the ills of Amerika loses me. Forget g bush stealing the 2000 and 2004 election? 9/11 and resulting bombings of innocent people? It takes a village , of idiots to fall for it.
