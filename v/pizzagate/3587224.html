<p>**<strong>Note: I am also adding this &quot;Part 3&quot; to my Greta Van Susteren/Laura Silsby investigation, to include some important corroborative information about Henry Vinson\'s legal case. Thank you, stay safe!</strong></p>
<p>Henry Vinson, along with Nick Bryant, document in their &quot;DC Madam&quot; book that once Henry Vinson was under federal indictment for allegedly operating a DC-based male prostitution ring, coincidently (or not??), <strong>Vinson claims that a Washington Post reporter recommended that he hire attorney Greta Van Susteren to represent him in the federal government\'s case against him.</strong> </p>
<p>Once Greta Van Susteren mysteriously got set up as Henry Vinson\'s lawyer, she then steered him into accepting a plea agreement where Vinson got only 63 months in prison (he was initially facing nearly 300 years for all his charges). Vinson said Van Susteren allowed federal investigators to grill Vinson for hours on end about his pimping activities, and that Van Susteren was not even present during these interrogations. Considering that Van Susteren was Henry Vinson’s attorney throughout his indictment and trial, the fact that Van Susteren allowed this to happen to her client, is very strange to say the very least. Vinson said federal prosecutors in his case &quot;explicitly told [him] not to talk to the media for that minimal sentence.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>As documented most thoroughly in the book DC Madam, co-written by Nick Bryant and Henry Vinson, Henry Vinson believes strongly that during the course of the trial, Van Susteren essentially helped “steer him in a direction,” so to speak, where he would agree to a relatively minimal sentence in exchange for keeping his mouth shut about the names of the elite DC politicians and power brokers who were all allegedly involved with his prostitution network, and who were allegedly connected with Craig Spence\'s trafficking network.</strong> Vinson also believe that Greta, as well as others involved in allegedly helping cover up significant parts of the &quot;Franklin Scandal,&quot; have been rewarded with great &quot;upward mobility&quot; in their own personal careers. In Vinson\'s words:</p>
<p>&quot;At the outset of my case, my attorney, Greta Van Susteren, seemed very committed to a vigorous defense on my behalf [...] she filed an eleven-page motion to mandate the release of my clientele list [ie list of clients of Vinson\'s prostitution operation] that the government had previously seized from me. Ms. Van Susteren argued that the names of my patrons should be released, because, if the government’s assertion was accurate and my “escort” service was, in actuality, a prostitution ring, my clients aided and abetted a criminal enterprise. But the Assistant U.S. Attorney for D.C. vehemently contested Ms. Van Susteren’s motion with a remarkably disingenuous argument: He contended that the names of my patrons shouldn’t be made public, because the U.S. Attorney’s office feared the “intimidation of government witnesses due to the embarrassing nature of the case.” My trial judge sided with the prosecution and barred the public disclosure of my clientele. <strong>After my trial judge acquiesced to the U.S. Attorney’s office, Ms. Van Susteren started to change her tune, and she urged me to take the government’s plea bargain. By then, my family and I had been subjected to a relentless campaign of terror, and I faced life in prison—I felt asif the feds were wielding the Sword of Damocles over my head. At Ms. Van Susteren’s behest, I accepted the government’s plea bargain,</strong> and I was sentenced to 63 months in federal prison. The feds also included a caveat that wasn’t overtly stated in my plea agreement: <strong>My 5-year sentence was based on the contingency that I not divulge a word about the particulars of my case to the media.</strong> Although I’m uncertain whether or not it’s a mere coincidence, <strong>I should point out that the individuals who were instrumental in the cover up of my case experienced significant upward mobility: Ms. Van Susteren now has her very own television show on FOX, and the U.S. Attorney for the District of D.C., who imprisoned me and ensured my silence, is now a Vice President of the Raytheon Corporation, one of the world’s largest defense contactors.</strong> After I was gagged and banished to a federal prison, I’ve been told that the government sealed, in perpetuity, a myraid of documents in my case. <strong>I’m aware of at least three individuals who have attempted to unseal my documentation, but the government has successfully rebuffed each of them.\'</strong>\'</p>
<p>To make matters even stranger, Henry Vinson\'s federal indictment happened in 1990. <strong>According to Van Susteren\'s IMDb page, right after her wonderful (cough, cough) work on Henry Vinson\'s case in 1990, in 1991 she got hired as a legal analyst on CNN, thus beginning Van Susteren\'s very high-profile career as a TV show host and commentator that continues to this day</strong> IMBd bio. Did Greta Van Susteren &quot;make her bones&quot; to use the mafia lingo, on the Henry Vinson case? Was this some kind of &quot;deal with the devil&quot; Van Susteren made that massively advanced her career? Its speculative, but Van Susteren\'s active involvement in covering up DC sex trafficking in the 80s and early 90s definitely deserves much more serious research and scrutiny. <strong>And the fact that Van Susteren jumps out of the woodwork again in 2010 to do a soft-ball interview with now-convicted sex trafficker Jorge Puello, and &quot;lawyer&quot; for allegedly-Clinton-connected Laura Silsby, makes everything a million times stranger. Was Van Susteren running cover for the pedophiles yet again? Interesting question...</strong></p>',

            While searching for a video of the Puello interview I found this transcript:
           </p>
           <p>
            GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Ten Americans from a Baptist church under arrest in Haiti. Why? Well, for trying to take dozens of children out of disaster zone to the Dominican Republic.
           </p>
           <p>
            The American say they were just trying to rescue the children. The Haitian government says that is not so, that the group knowingly and illegally were taking the children out of the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joining us by phone is Jorge Puello, the attorney for the detained Americans. Jorge, where are your clients tonight?
           </p>
           <p>
            JORGE PUELLO, ATTORNEY FOR DETAINED AMERICANS (Via telephone): They are being detained right now at a police station a couple of blocks away from the U.N. headquarters.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: What happened? What did your clients say?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: Well, I only got access to speak to one of them. The other nine, the police are denying access to lawyers. I don't understand why they are doing that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And so far, what information we have gathered is -- you have to understand that Haiti right now is in a state of emergency. And there is no functioning government and no functioning government offices over there.
           </p>
           <p>
            So they were trying to get these kids out to a safer place. If you go to city there's no food, no drinking water. There's a lot of problems going on, and they were trying to help these kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: I understand there were 33 children two months to 12- years-old, is that correct?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: Yes, ma'am.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Where are those children tonight?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: I don't have no information. The Haitian government has been very unwilling to talk to us. They don't give us information. Our clients are not even charged and so they don't want to give us any documents telling us what the charges are.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Why haven't you been able to see your clients?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: We get to the police station and we ask to see them and they say we need permission from the director general. When we asked them where is the office of the director general, they keep telling us they don't even know, that the building collapsed and there's no one there and they are just giving us the run-around.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Are you in Haiti tonight or the Dominican Republic?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: I'm right at the border waiting for the gate to open tomorrow morning. Unfortunately, I got here too late to the border to cross over.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: So at this point you can't cross over into Haiti?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: No, because they close at the gate at 7:00 at night.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Do you know what your clients intended to do with those children? Was it just to bring them to the Dominican Republic or to the United States?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: There was no intention to bring them to the United States. They were only trying to take them to a temporary facility so they can be taken care of. A lot of these kids don't even know that their parents have died. They need psychological help.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it doesn't make any sense when at the border they are not asking for any papers. But Haitians cross over to the Dominican Republic and the Dominican government is not asking for passports or any ID to cross over.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Where did they find these 33 children? How did they get these children?
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: There was an orphanage that collapsed in Haiti. It was called friends of the orphans of Haiti. And there was somebody over there that told them that the orphans had no place, no room to place them.
           </p>
           <p>
            And these people that came to Haiti to help these kids were trying to do a job that nobody is doing right now. There's too many kids in the streets. There's a lot of people starving to death in Haiti. And they were just trying to help them. There was no intention to do anything illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Jorge, thank you, and keep us informed. Thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            PUELLO: No problem, have a nice day. Great show you have, thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir.
