            OMG!!!! So now autistic scumbags are being brought into the mix of those involved in debauchery and pizza? How thin do they slice their pizza? Is there walnut sauce for double dipping? And are $65,000 chi-town hot dogs there for alternative consumption?

            Pizzagate Paul Biggar? “What’s not O.K. about this scene is that it is so money- and power-dominated,” she said in Chang’s excerpt. “It’s a problem because it’s an abuse of power. I would never do it again.”

            High-profile investors, executives and technology founders in Silicon Valley have been taking part in monthly “drug-heavy, sex-heavy” parties, according to revelations from a new book.

            Elon Musk Attended Lewd Silicon Valley Party, But Says He Saw No Sex. On January 10, Paul Biggar, another Silicon Valley investor, confirmed some of Chang's details about the party in a blog post, reporting that it took place at venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson's house. He also said that he personally saw Musk there (though he did note that he didn't see any sex or drugs). According to Biggar, the party was a corporate sponsored event, officially hosted by Jurvetson's former company, DFJ (from which Jurvetson resigned, in November, after allegations of sexual harassment).

            Right Richter: The new conspiracy theory that's bigger than Pizzagate? Did an elite Silicon Valley VC party feature sex and drugs? “Brotopia” says yes
            <a href="https://qz.com/1178134/brotopia-new-book-says-steve-jurvetson-hosted-party-with-sex-and-drugs/">

            </a>
            Steve Jurvetson, the “J” in the firm’s initials, left DFJ last year “by mutual consent” for unspecified reasons. Axios obtained text from the book reporting that Jurvetson, a one-time director at SpaceX and Tesla, was the host of the party.
How the party has been described
           </p>
           <p>
            Entrepreneur Paul Biggar wrote on Medium on Jan. 10 that the party, described in an excerpt adapted from Brotopia in Vanity Fair, was “way worse than it sounds.” The account in Vanity Fair tells of a party at the home of an unnamed venture capitalist. In Silicon Valley, Chang writes, such events “may be devoted primarily to drugs and sexual activity, others may boast just pockets of it, and some guests can be caught unawares.” The June 2017 invitation for this one asked partygoers to wear “glamazon adventurer, safari chic and jungle tribal attire.”
