             Yes, I know, but why would they automatically appear in the search results for that website when those words were never part of the search or ticked off on the side search bar? I was thinking maybe Fairey owned part of the company and that's why it came up. Remember, all I searched for was 'Obey' and 'Pizza'. I never searched the term skateboard or DC. I just found it odd that it threw the DC wear in when I didn't search for it directly. If you check out the side bar of brands to tick off, there's a lot. How come none of them showed? Just thought it was curious.

              Understood, it's probably the obey part. Maybe pizza but maybe not. I search two word phrases on google all the time, and it very often excludes the word that doesn't yield a higher result. So it's most definitely a paid search result as companies often do. But not saying the search engine is ignoring "pizza". All I'm saying, is DC probably pays a fee to get to the top of the search results.

            "Question Everything: Shepard Fairey on His Influences, His Legal Battle with AP, and Being a Sellout"
            <em>
             In the interview, conducted by Christopher Sprinkle, a producer at Brave New Films, Fairey discussed his progression from struggling to survive by screenprinting pizza restaurant T-shirts and Karate uniforms to being a much sought after gallery artist designing bikes for Lance Armstrong and creating commercial advertising campaigns for Dewar's, Motorola and Saks Fifth Avenue.

            Put him on the map. Don't know Shepard but he went to school with some friends, think I had one of the first batch of those stickers, back in 1988 or so. Wiki says '89, RI but I think it might go back a year or 2 earlier.

             "Interview: Shepard Fairey, Talking with the pop-art provocateur of Andre the Giant and Obama poster fame"
             <em>
              A lot of people are just taking cheap shots at me because it's an easy way for them to say, "He made it because he lifted this image, but I'm doing all my shit from scratch because I'm keeping it motherfucking real, dog." Meanwhile, they're eating pizza and smoking weed and not touching any art materials, whereas I just worked a lot.
