<p>LOS ANGELES – The estate of Michael Jackson is suing HBO over a documentary about two men who accuse the late pop superstar of molesting them when they were boys.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleges that by co-producing and airing “Leaving Neverland,” as HBO intends to do next month, the cable channel is violating a 1992 contract for showing a Jackson concert in which it agreed not to disparage the singer.</p>
<p>The suit states that the contract covered future disparagement of Jackson, and that the film alleges Jackson molested children on the “Dangerous” tour that the concert footage came from. It asks the court to order arbitration, and says damages could exceed $100 million.</p>
<p>HBO said it plans to move forward with the documentary. </p>
<p>&quot;Despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans remain unchanged,&quot; the network said in a statement to USA TODAY. &quot;HBO will move forward with the airing of the two-part documentary on March 3rd and 4th. This will allow everyone the opportunity to assess the film and the claims in it for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Jackson accusers Wade Robson and James Safechuck say that the Sundance Film Festival is first time they’ve ever felt public support for their allegations the King of Pop molested them.</p>
<p>The documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which premiered at the festival last month and will air on HBO in two parts on March 3 and 4, chronicles how their lives intersected with Jackson’s. The film was met with a standing ovation at Sundance , but has been treated with disbelief and even threats from Jackson’s fans.</p>
<p>The singer’s estate has condemned the documentary and called the men’s credibility into question.</p>
<p>Both accusers came forward with allegations of sexual abuse after Jackson’s death in 2009 and after they had told officials otherwise.</p>

<p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Denmark\'s oldest shopping mall has removed a wax statue of Michael Jackson out of fears it could offend customers and may be vandalized because of accusations that the late pop star molested boys.</p>
<p>Charlotte Andersen, marketing manager for the Roedovre Centrum mall in suburban Copenhagen, told Denmark\'s TV2 broadcaster that they had received about 15 complaints about the Jackson statue, mostly from families with children.</p>
<p>The mall had announced an exhibition with wax statues of major stars, including Marilyn Monroe and Julia Roberts, to coincide with Danish schools\' weeklong winter holiday that started Monday.</p>
<p>The 75,500-square-meter (about 810,000-square-foot) mall was the first to open in Denmark in 1966.</p>

            What an accomplishment for a famous pedophile, I'm sure he was the envy of pedophiles the world over when that statue went up.

            Pedo-statue removed, sounds like a success.

             Jackson and E John were admirers of one another.  Police confiscated a questionable picture away from John in the Atlanta airport.  It was of a young boy.  John has 2 boys with his husband (I can't believe I just had to type that).  Oh I do believe they get a tingle up their leg when reading about Jackson.  I am so very sick of fans that support pedos like MJ and R Kelly.  Stomach Churning.  The statue gives me hope.
