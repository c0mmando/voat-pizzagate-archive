            Did Alex Jones fire someone over this? After what he's pulled recently, I was just thinking we should go back and see what he was pushing &amp; what he was trying to steer us away from?

            The thought that you people imagine such deranged things and use them to accuse innocent people that have been threatened and harassed only because of your insanity and inability to discern fact from fiction is mind boggling.

            Probably also the CVS (also owned by the same people in that block) provides them with whatever they need for drugs. I figured Bucks provided them with torture/restraining tools while the nearby cleaner got rid of the bodies. The actor shooting the hard drive would make a lot of sense if all of this were true. Not sure why deleted but the comment I'm responding to is "Me to and I think their filming it, &amp; selling, the whole reason the actor shot the hard drive. I think Bucks is possibly a front for drugs." by username GothamGirl.

              Weird, yeah figured something was up, hope it comes to an end soon as well. Been following this since November expecting something to happen and here we still are, at least it seems to be picking up steam as time goes on and not in the opposite direction, just taking a long time!

            I've been posting about this old menu now for a few days... my instinct says it's ultra fake. The verbiage used was needlessly obvious... but others on Voat are claiming that it's legit.
           </p>
           <p>
            My biggest issue/question/problem with this? If it is legitimate, then it is a smoking gun. There must be a source. That source had to have created it. Case closed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that some people on here are convinced that document is real and are not pushing to pursue it further, boggles my mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I actually believed it was real - I wouldn't waste any time focusing on anything else.

             8Chan back in November did a thorough look at WeThePizza Instagram.  Very damning pics at the White House.  Big Gay Ice Cream commented on the Instagram.  Justin Trudeau and Biden were featured. Saudis were there holding a burger from a joint venture there.  It was a dead end though. Heavily shilled also.  Obama ate there.  2 blocks from the capital.

             I mean how would we know it's real? Not really a way to know but with all of the recent comings out of Alefantis on 60 minutes and Jone's weird retraction a day before, it's like they're scared of something bigger than even child rape coming out. This post was so heavily attacked when it started, just tons and tons of people telling them to provide proof even when they said they would provide it in a day, no one could wait it was just straight up hateful attacks against OP. If the DC police are involved then bringing it to them would do nothing and we would know nothing, they said the source was a computer at CPP they had "worked" on to fix as a way to look into it. Again it's hard af to provide proof with all of this, Google is heavily in on censoring as well as the rest of the forces that control the internet. What people need to understand is that an underground menu very easily could have been on an excel sheet, these criminals are not especially technologically advanced, but they know enough to not get caught.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again it's so hard to find anything in this environment, if I was a serious researcher I could go on the deep web and buy babies within a day, but that's just another honeypot setup by pedophiles. Everything we know has essentially been created as a distraction while pedophiles rape children and sadists torture unfortunate souls. Again this is all just something to think about, our research will never result in a "smoking gun" because nothing will ever happen until shit hits the fan. This whole voat platform was lent as a way to congregate all "pizzagate" research, it just backfired spectacularly on the pedos. I watched as the day this happened, the me_irl forum on reddit was heavily infested by pedos, they we're trading 3000 "upvotes" for 2 "cheese pizzas", another front page post on that forum had a bunch of people literally slobbering over a shirtless 12 year old, the web is run by pedophiles. This was all scrubbed within one night just like twitter was hosting tons of child porn accounts also scrubbed all that stuff afterwards, and NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENED AFTER THAT. People need to understand the entire concept of the "web" is just that, a fucking web of "information" to trap us in while elites go around raping and torturing us at will, a real life devil's playground.

              Sure, I agree with 99% of what you said... and while this may be a "dead end" moving it forward... rarely can something be determined a dead end moving backward. I.E. What was the source? Who created it? Was the source file looked at? What accounts were involved in posting it? Did they gain any other files? Who is/was implicated? What were the actions/next steps defined in the menu? Etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know that this hit big and was shilled hard... so if it is legit, I'm hoping their is something from its origin that can shed a new light.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps all of this was already explored and I'm spinning wheels. But I stick to my guns in saying that IF this menu is legit, it could be the keystone to everything. Whomever created it and if it once existed on a CPP server... that is "Game Over" material right there.
             </p>
             <p>
              From a slightly different light, the validity of the document is called into question because JA (allegedly) absolutely freaked out with the Pegasus Intel... and didn't bother wasting a keystroke on this menu. One would imagine that if this did originate from his machine - he'd be all over it.
