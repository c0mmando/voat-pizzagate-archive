  'formattedContent' => '<p>Assuming you\'re all caught up with my last post, here are some important new facts/ rebuttals/ answers.</p>
<p>Firstly regarding Anita/ Sasha Lord, admittingly, we have no 100% concrete proof they are the same person as of yet, but we do see the style of the drafted email being in accordance with booker/ recruiter. We already highly suspect this woman because of her disturbing comments associated with Majestic Ape as well as Jimmy Comet\'s instagram. Anita could be her real name and Sasha her alias or vice versa. we know that she graduated George Mason in 2005. I can not find any information of her name at that time but I am still hunting. </p>
<p>The emails in question regarding &quot;Dave&quot; and “Anita” were posted to a 4chan thread. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/dVnk4d.png">https://i.sli.mg/dVnk4d.png</a> </p>
<p>The way this investigation was done was by tracking leads from Comet (ergo Lord), the Clinton Foundation and Podesta that led to a common element.</p>
<p>Then the reddit thread happened, apparently others were aware of it before but by using that to learn of cheesy bay and then Dave and then the emails and their information, a series of synapses began firing. Researching &quot;Richard Windsor&quot; led us to information that this name was an Alias for Lisa P. Jackson of the Clinton Foundation.  <a href="https://i.sli.mg/TcumJ4.png">https://i.sli.mg/TcumJ4.png</a> </p>
<p>Progressing on the assumption that has two parties involved were using aliases, it seemed logical that the third (Anita) was also an alias. Sure enough &quot;Sasha&quot; Lord is a recruiter for Comet, but by applying her presumed double role of not only music recruiter but child recruiter, the correspondence begins to make sense. </p>
<p>Dave Stone is proven to use aliases and be linked to the Hawaii compound, his employee suspects him of CP and trafficking and gives us a lead about the Ebay page (which is echoed by the Biff Skipman FB NOT ONLY in respect to living in Hawaii, sharing the FB bio of Dave Stone as a &quot;poobah&quot; but also the shared imagery of Mr. Potato head (a known pedo symbol). </p>
<p>By searching the alias dave stone through wiki leaks the Information about Stone Harbour LLC is gathered. A Private LLC with suburban property in DC ALL neighboring wooded areas and EACH neighboring a school or several just as Pakula road (also attached to the &quot;Dave Stone&quot; name) does. </p>
<p>Now instead of just the &quot;Richard Windsor&quot;/ Lisa Jackson connection to the Clinton Foundation, there is a direct correspondence with HRC that seems to corroborate with all the prior information. We know there is more than one Dave Stone in the Clinton emails as one\'s funeral is attending but she has meetings and corresponds with a &quot;Dave Stone&quot; after the time of the initial death. </p>
<p>Podesta\'s emails reference Hawaii and the &quot;Hot Dog stand.&quot; Now there is link between the CF, HRC, Comet, Hawaii, as well Cheesybay/Distillery/  and its associated alias all because of the common element of Hawaii and the Paluka address as well as the code languages (cheese, hot dogs). </p>
<p>Look at the language in this Podesta email again, <a href="https://i.sli.mg/o0MIxZ.png">https://i.sli.mg/o0MIxZ.png</a> Not is it bizarre in reference to “waitresses” but knowing a little bit about White House protocols you see this email is either a total lie, or it undeniably code for something else. All food eaten in the white house must be prepared on site by White House kitchen staff. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bvLDbkS.png">http://i.imgur.com/bvLDbkS.png</a> </p>
<p>Also I have become aware of a link between Lisa Jackson and Comet. It is stated that Jackson &quot;is an American chemical engineer who served as the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 2009 to 2013. In May 2013, it was announced that Jackson would be joining Apple Inc. as their environmental director.&quot; </p>
<p>While being a member of the Clinton Foundation board, she now works with Apple. For some reason, Apple is linked on the Comet website under &quot;friends.&quot; As head of the EPA she had considerable pull in many places as she could lift/impose regulation on anything relating to the environment. (The implementation of various machinery or chemicals in highly tropical areas or islands perhaps?)</p>
<p>As FBIanon said, &quot;they key is in the Clinton Foundation.&quot; We need to pick apart their donors, their donations, their inconsistencies... </p>
<p>As one of my commentators brilliantly put it: “Every large cartel has a vehicle to not only launder the money but to facilitate the exchange of money in a seemingly innocent way. With Hillary\'s private server and a blackberry hooked to it and the State Department system, she had the means to act as a shadow broker trading data in exchange for money, favors and power over people. People fail to realize just how nefarious her server could have been. The foundation is the conduit through which all the transactions were probably conducted. Look at how all the large donations to and from the charity are all people directly associated with the Clintons.
I think maybe we need to data mine things like correlations between inflows and outflows of cash with the foundation with the rise and fall of missing children and other data sets. Security leaks vs cash flows. Government contracts and cash flows. Questionable grants and cash flows. If the CF is used as a market for transactions, there should be signals to find in the data.”</p>
<p>Apply this to my last post and once again start thinking and start searching. You are all warriors in this fight and you have been armed.</p>
<p>The noose draws ever tighter.</p>
<p>Happy Hunting.</p>

            Two people mentioned in this prior posting, with connections to Anita (Sasha) Lord and possibly John Podesta, are two Dave Stones. The first David Stone was a former TSA official who recently died at age 57. The second Dave Stone is a priest of the Catholic church, charged with child abuse (twice). The first alleged offense was in Alabama. The second alleged offense, detailed here,[
            <a href="http://www.sacerdotus.com/2015/03/former-ewtn-priest-dave-francis-mary.html">
             http://www.sacerdotus.com/2015/03/former-ewtn-priest-dave-francis-mary.html
            </a>
            ]. Father Francis Mary Stone aka David L. Stone worked for EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) in Alabama, and was charged with child abuse in his role as priest. But he was found not guilty as detailed here by SNAP Network, [
            <a href="http://www.snapnetwork.org/al_accused_abusive_priest_is_found_not_guilty_victims_respond">
             http://www.snapnetwork.org/al_accused_abusive_priest_is_found_not_guilty_victims_respond
            </a>
            ]. He fathered a child in 2008 and then was arrested for sexually abusing his own child, but he again escaped conviction. He was cleared as of 6-1-2016. He "cannot present himself publicly as a priest," although he has not yet been defrocked by the Vatican. He remains "at large." however. Is this the man in the email of Sasha (Anita) Lord? The man Podesta may have referred to as setting up a hot dog stand in Hawaii?

            I apologize if this is redundant or irrelevant--it's hard to keep up with so many rapidly moving parts. The Island Distillers is owned by a Flintstone (ya right) whose name has come up throughout pgate discussions.

            Weird, that second link says Malia Obama owns a chain of burger restaurants called Fat Obama Burger. I googled the name and there's literally nothing about the restaurants, no site, no fb, no photos or reviews. Just articles repeating that one sentence about her owning it.

            Regarding the White House hot dogs, I just want to say I find it more likely that Obama simply broke the "no outside food" rules. He's the president - if he wants to skirt the rules occasionally, I'm sure nobody is going to stop him.

             Do the math on that one. 65k dollars worth of hotdogs and pizza. Was there a party for 2,000 people? If you give everyone a pie at $20 and a very generous hotdog at $15, that's 1,857 people.

              If they're flying in specialty hotdogs, I'd expect them to be more than $15, plus there's the shipping costs. And the government isn't known for being responsible with spending.
             </p>
             <p>
              I doubt they would fly in hot dogs for a small event, so yes, I would expect that it was a big event.

               I'm all for arguing against a possible lead because I think like a lawyer. I.e.: What would the defense argue against it? I'd love to see itemization on that order and also an explanation for the "waitresses" that makes logical sense.

            Supposed FBIAnon on 4chan once suggested that they keep children inside of Koko head. The entrance to Koko head is at 577 Pakala street and their are known systems of tunnels that go through it. Go to Google images and search Koko head, then search 577 Pakala street and go to street view.

            Right now our concern needs to be finding the original email files from dave stone, we have the screenshots but we need the originals. The original 4chan posts are now deleted, I'm not sure if there are archived versions,

            Together we can find them.

Damn, 10 years of responses. I have to get in on this.
I google map searched this address and only see new looking homes. I remember this story being told 20 years ago at Kalani high school. There are scarier things I have been through in Kaimuki, like Clayton Hee’s death house at 4011 B Kaimuki. The local “neighborhood watch” was luring homeless men up there and trying to rape and murder them with the protection of HPD and the “Federal Police”. The property was hidden from record until 2011 or so when it was exposed and Hee had to “correct the record” and declare it as a rental. They tried to murder me, I saw other guys there who ran out naked and screaming from the local gimp trying to rape them. One of his victims broke his ribs when he tried to rape them in the bathroom. Robert Smith was wandering the property naked and wailing while this flamboyant homosexual runs out of his house crying rape. The cops just consoled him. The cops and the local “neighborhood watch” treated it like it was some sort of carnival. Sick.
Paranormal stuff? Aside from human shaped shadows but with nobody there in the easement, I can only attest the feeling of dread to the people in the area being evil and having to wait for nightfall to have the neighbors come up to the windows, try to watch us in the house (especially in the toilet) and try to force open the doors or make boasting death threats from their adjacent properties while cocking or dry-firing guns (as long as they had 911 on speed dial)

             I was discouraging goats from digging into bishop estate because it might be decades of unconnected rabbit holes because they're ancient and crooked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then i said if anyone was still going to dig in that direction they should check out OHA because they're locally considered MORE crooked.

             Clayton Hee runs OHA.

              Yeah the links between cheesybay and pizzagate are tenuous. Each investigation stands on their own. The BE might only be indirectly connected as basically a land owner. Hawaii is likely a huge human trafficking hub between US and Asia, so there's lots of potential for furthering this investigation.

               Public record.  Spokeo lists a bunch of people living there so i thought it was nonsense.  But the records match the crazy oha boss story.

            We need to get someone out there to the place from the reddit post, before it's too late. I'll throw $100 in bitcoin towards a bounty for any researchers who go there. We can put up a craigslist ad in honolulu. No problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's focus ONLY on the reddit post for now until we figure this out. This is the most concrete lead we have. Everything else can be done later.
           </p>

            It's near 577 pakala st, honolulu 96825 - Has anyone found the exact location yet?

              Depends on what they are willing to do and what the situation is. Whether they have access to the area, or if it is locked up, etc. But yeah we should write something up.

              Ideally we could get a white guy to hire some sort of illegal mexicans (or whatever sort of low class people you get in hawaii) from home depot or whatever to go and drill the fuck out of it.
