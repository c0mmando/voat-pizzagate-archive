<p>BOSTON – Six former employees of eBay, Inc. have been charged with leading a cyberstalking campaign targeting the editor and publisher of a newsletter that eBay executives viewed as critical of the company. The alleged harassment included sending the couple anonymous, threatening messages, disturbing deliveries – including a box of live cockroaches, a funeral wreath and a bloody pig mask – and conducting covert surveillance of the victims. </p>

<p>In stark contrast to his libertarian posturing, [Pierre] Omidyar is connected at the hip to the very same intelligence nexus that he publicly condemns, particularly Booz Allen Hamilton, the NSA security contractor that employed Snowden in Hawaii and Japan .

<p>Booz Allen and Omidyar Network are corporate members of an NSA-linked consortium called Innocentive, a consultancy focused on crowdsourcing (read: data-mining of public-opinion polls, consumer surveys and Internet-based personal data). Other member-companies include In-Q-Tel, a developer of communications monitoring software spawned with millions in start-up capital from the CIA.</p>
<p>Also represented is the In-Q-Tel spin-off Palantir [think PAYPAL]..</p>

Some of the longest running members of staff were invited to meet them at the presentation including the first student, John M. Dowden. Starting postgraduate research on fluid dynamics at the age of 23 in 1963, John later became a professor of mathematics and was the head of the Mathematics Department from 2001–2005.

             </p>
             <p>
              “Paedophiles are told they are the seducers and rapists of children; they know their experiences are often loving and tender ones. They are told that children are pure and innocent, devoid of sexuality; they know both from their own experiences of childhood and from the children they meet that this is not the case.”

             <p>
              John Bercow and Sally Illman were married on 7th December 2002, at St Margaret’s Church in Parliament Square...John Bercow’s best man for the occasion was Dr Julian Lewis, a long time friend and colleague of his since way back in the 80s...From 1989, Julian Lewis and John Bercow spent several years working together running advanced speaking and campaigning courses for Conservative activists the world over, bestowing wily political skills upon over 600 Conservatives (including many current MPs) by the time they wound up their operation in the early 2000s.. It was in 1994, during the time that Bercow and Lewis were nigh on inseparable that Julian Lewis helped cover up organized child abuse… Thanks to Julian Lewis, in 1994 North Wales Police Superintendent Gordon Anglesea managed to rake in £375,000 from libel cases relating to allegations of his involvement in organized abuse of children from North Wales Care Homes.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, on October 22 2016 a court found Police Superintendent Gordon Anglesea had in fact been abusing kids from care homes in North Wales. Care homes run by a certain John Allen.. Though its welcome that a degree of justice was served in the end, there is much more to this story than it 1st appears. And both Julian Lewis and John Bercow are right in the thick of it…

             Bercow has supported a number of charities. He is a Patron of the ME Association,[48] Brain Tumour Research[49] and a Patron of the Patchwork Foundation[50] founded by Harris Bokhari. He has also spoken at and supported other charities such as the mental health charity Jami.[51] He recently supported a fundraiser for Children in Need

             Women-only co-working spaces are the newest rage in the #MeToo age
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             From cozy community start-ups like The Coven in Minneapolis, to a business with much larger ambitions, like The Wing — which has locations spreading internationally — the women-only office share is the “it” work sanctuary for the #MeToo era.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Wing gets most of the attention, and not just because the design color scheme skews millennial pink. In just over a year and a half, the start-up has raised more than $40 million from investors, including from WeWork, the co-working giant valued at $20 billion. The Wing now has three spaces in New York City with a total of 22,500 square feet, another in Washington, D.C., and three more coming before the end of this year to Brooklyn, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Seattle, Toronto and London are on track for 2019.
