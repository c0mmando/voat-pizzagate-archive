            Absolutely! As a child I remember hearing the term rape for the first time, I did not know what it meant specifically but I knew intuitively that it was something violent and horrible. Just simply by the sound of the word it conotates the violence of the act of someone forcing themselves. Thanks for posting this I will always refer to it as child rape and pedofiles will now be baby rapists. They may want to down play it but I am going to match them and even raise them one by labeling it as extreme as possible! These sick fucks, the psy ops has me really pissed.

            Voat is 100% corrupt.  I post,  it doesn't show.  They don't like this: "Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types."

            Agreed, and thank you for posting that. I also now refer to PedoGate and not PizzaGate except in certain instances, and then I add PedoGate. Why? Even though PizzaGate has NOT been debunked despite what Wikipedia and Snopes claim, the word is a distraction and no longer fits. "PedoGate" is a better word because it's more descriptive and less distracting than a word with pizza in it. Besides, I miss associating pizza with good things.

              The idea of a society of torturing murderers, openly known to each other, controlling not just the UK but embedded in the upper echelons of many (if not all) countries was the stuff of conspiracy websites, those prolific disseminators of unbelievable truths well mixed with repellant bigotry and obvious falsehoods, presented as a whole to discredit all ingredients.

              propaganda arm
             </strong>
             of this international ring of torturers which attempted to normalize abuse of children and babies as ‘sex’ is still very apparent in the
             <strong>
              corporate media coverage of the CSA inquiry which depicts the torture and murder of children as “sex attacks on kids”, “child sex” or a “sex scandal”. Sex is not an attack. This is not sex. The fact that these people tortured and murdered children in their recreational hours does not make them simply pedosadists, or what corporate media still likes to call pedophiles in acquiescence to PIE’s demands that they be depicted as ‘child-lovers’
             </strong>
             . Their recreation may have revolved around torturing children, but their office hours as UK media and government establishment revolved around torture and mass murder of people from all demographics. It is not sufficient to call them psychopaths or sociopaths since very few of those seriously harm others and almost none to this extent. These people who want to be known as child lovers are death eaters. They feed on the agony of others. They torture and murder not because they have to, but because it feeds something in them. The only reason they are attracted to children is the increase in pain, horror, power, and taboo.
             <strong>
              They are no less attracted to mass slaughter than they are to the torture of children
             </strong>
             .

           <p>
            <em>
             Sociopaths are attracted by what repels others. They seek filth, horror and destruction. Using the torture of children as bait to blackmail political opponents is a natural act for death eaters, as is destroying populations with ‘drug wars’ and ‘terrorism’ or using the slaughter of populations to advertise the weapons industry. People are products in the trade economy, and if death eaters are in control, people are their products to use as they wish. They are presiding over the destruction of the planet and beating back any who try to stop them because mass destruction is a compulsion for them.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             The attempt to conflate torture and murder with sex is not unique to the UK establishment. “Our definition of sexy was something like Khadr.” said the man who decided to prosecute a tortured child. Militias in the DR Congo are promised magic power from raping women. Israel uses sexual imagery to promote the destruction of Palestine and rape is a constant in wars, torture, imprisonment, everywhere death eaters act. Death eaters gain power by manipulation of others. Hard coercion such as the control of military and police is theirs when they gain power, but until they have attained it they rely on seductive coercion. An insistence on hard coercion to control society is a denial of the power of seductive coercion.
             <strong>
              Conflation of torture and murder with sex is a perversion of that power. An attempt to depict deeply anti-social acts as sexual freedom is an attempt to normalize deeply anti-social behaviour.

             <em>
              Death eaters are not child lovers. Torture and murder are not a sex scandal. Sex is not an attack. Seductive coercion is used to create society. Its use in dissociated populations to incite acts of violence is a perversion of its power used against society.

             Of course they do. It started with that molester, Sigmund Freud, who called it "infantile sexuality"--blaming the victim--and look what influence that criminal still has.

               It was all calculated to further abuse of the innocent. Pure, sick, evil. No wnder the pedo Woody Allen was in Freudian psychoanalysis for 30 years (to justify his crimes).

              <p>
               It's not just the Sigmund Freud psyop, but his nephew Edward Bernays wrote the book Propaganda in the 1920s, and his grandson Clement Freud is the known pedo who rented his villa in Portugal to the Podestas at the time Madeline McCann disappeared.

                This is clearly a sick family who always seemed to have influence. It is clear our world is controlled by a select few from one generation to another. I am starting to understand why the French Revolution was so bloody and why they wanted to eradicate royal bloodlines.

            Yes, let's stop using 1984 double speak and euphemisms.
Statements like "police action" instead of illegal war. Congress has to declare war, call it a policing action to get around war declaration. No more euphemisms or double speak. Call this sickness what it is. Child love my ass, girl love, boy love Bs

             Also, let's call it pederasty and child rape, instead of pedophilia, because the second part of that word means love, and it is anything but that.

            Very good point in the softening of language. Child Rape is the most-accurate and descriptive terminology, but it is harsh. Child exploitation, trafficking, molestation, do not sound as bad, and with support from the media and groups pushing acceptance, proponents can remove the stigma. After all, if the kids want and like it, it is no longer child exploitation. This is LITERALLY the thinking of these sick people. See:

            Actually there is a distinction between rape and molestation.  They are different crimes with different penalties and almost every state treats them differently.  Rape almost always involves sexual intercourse.   At least that the language used in NYS state law.

            If you look up the world "old" on this page, you see all the various legal distinctions

             This is true the legal definition may be statutory rape but again it is rape nonetheless. My point is that the definition of rape is sex without consent. unlawful sexual activity and usually sexual intercourse carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against the will usually of a female or with a person who is beneath a certain age or incapable of valid consent because of mental illness, mental deficiency, intoxication, unconciousness, or deception —

            I could not agree more.  Calling it anything less than child rape is a disservice to children IMO.  Why should it be rape when it involves an adult women, but watered down with children?
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of people I know cannot even stomach the thought of what child rape is, so they pretend that it doesn't exist, or call it other names to desensitize themselves.

             When I talk pizzagate pedogate with anyone, my wife has to leave the room. It's too much. I'm way past disgust and on to wreaking justice mode. The children who are being abused, raped, tortured, and killed do not have time for shock. They need help. Now.
