<p>From the ninth grade, <a href="https://s21.postimg.org/d8wjvr86v/789999.gif">Anna Nichole Smith</a> was raised by an aunt in <strong>Mexia</strong> whose primary industry from 1943 had been looking after 3000 to 4000 foot soldiers and officers of Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler’s elite blood covenant Schutzstaffel (SS). From 1943 to the early 1950s, Mexia to El Paso running down to Houston and San Antonio became a SS Nazi corridor in Texas. It stand reason to assume that Anna Nichole Smith’s family bloodline roots; and her sudden mysterious rise to international fame and fortune within a Satanic Circle of the Dark Messiah and the BLOODLINES OF WOTAN lies within the SS Nazi Texas corridor.</p>
<p>At the Nuremberg Tribunal, the Waffen-SS was condemned as a criminal organization due to its connection to the Nazi Party and involvement in numerous war crimes and Crimes against Humanity.</p>
<p>The Waffen-SS is a circle of blood oath covenant crusading BLACK KNIGHTS of the VRIL and the DARK MESSIAH. Their covenant is to do the will of their master and father, they are LUCIFER’S SERVANTS.  After WW II, they should have been taken to Nuremberg Prison and prosecuted for Crimes Against Humanity instead of vacationing in Texas. Naturally or unholy, the people of Mexia and Limestone County developed a lot of love, affection, trans-generational links and Hidden Bloodlines with their Luciferian Nazi cousins.</p>
<p>These grand lords, Knights of the Black Sun, masters of deception, were expected by their EVIL CREED to develop and setup clandestine networks with local chapters of their hierarchical subservient blood oath secret freemasons and Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. They developed covert Lebensborn liaisons with local Aryan women to carry their demonic seeds in America. That’s the way they roll under the veil of Inner Circle of the VRIL and the DARK MESSIAH. Why could it be any different in America that they intended from the very beginning to win by CONQUEST.</p>
<p>After the Fall of Nazi Germany in May 1945, members of Himmler’s elite Allgemeine SS rocket team including Sturmbannführer (Major) SS Werhner von Braun moved into Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas. Dr. Hubertus Strughold of Reichsminister Hermann Wilhelm Göring’s Luftwaffe Air Force and his “Inner Circle of the VRIL and the DARK MESSIAH” setup station at the U.S. Air Force’s School of Aviation Medicine (SAM) at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio- just miles outside of <strong>Mexia</strong>.</p>

<p>Enter Prince Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt born Hans Robert Lichtenberg on June 18, 1943 in Bad Kreuznach, Germany to the Chief of Police of Frankfurt, Nazi Germany. On June 17, 1936, Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in the Reich and named Himmler as Chief of German Police. This action effectively merged the police into the SS. If Prince von Anhalt’s father wasn’t SS or Gestapo, he was certainly under Himmler and a high collaborating Nazi Party official.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, Prince von Anhalt‘s family ties had enough wealth, influence and power after WW II to buy his royal title from inside the House of the last German Emperor of the SECOND REICH (Kaiser) and King of Prussia, Kaiser Wilhelm II or William II, the foundation of the 1000 Year THIRD REICH.</p>
<p>Wilhelm’s mother was Victoria, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of Britain’s Queen Victoria. Prince Von Anhalt’s royal title attached to Kaiser and King of Prussia, Wilhelm II and the Queen of England, was extremely important in that it arguable immediately put him within the hierarchy of hidden power and influence of the ultra clandestine, influential and powerful German and English Freemason Lodges.Anna Nicole Smith &amp; <a href="https://s3.postimg.org/563hsz32b/45578u999.gif">HughHefner’s MK ULTRA Factory</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, Anna Nicole Smith, stripper of that absurd place in Texas called <strong>Mexia</strong>, started her so-called modeling career at Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Mansion. Out of all the beautiful women of HollyWeird and the World, Hugh Hefner sent Anna Nicole Smith a plane ticket out of town to join his stable of blood oath covenant guest playmates at the mansion. The Playboy Mansion is a state of the art CIA MK ULTRA Factory.</p>
<p>“The <a href="https://s8.postimg.org/ee55xu6s5/132465r6.gif">“White Rabbit”</a>in Disney’s primary MK Prog’mg film “Alice In Wonderland” reinforces MK Prog’mg (ALTERS) or mind files as does Playboy bunny logo for Hugh Hefner’s MK factory, Playboy Enterprises …”</p>
<p>Within a year, out of Hefner’s stable of women, it was Anna Nicole Smith of Mexia that rose to a high level ultra secret multiple personality disorder (MPD) mind controlled Presidential Model. In 1993, Hefner anointed her as the PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR.</p>
<p>In August 1994, Smith’s Playboy Mansion handlers married her off to wheelchair bound 89 year old Texas oil tycoon, <a href="https://s4.postimg.org/mpycqqku5/57688900.gif">J. Howard Marshall</a>, believed to worth $500 million. Marshall was described as a fascist oil tycoon and a Hitler devotee.</p>
<p>On September 7, 2006, Smith gave birth to Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern in Nassau, Bahamas. J. Howard Marshall died August 4, 1995. Smith died February 8, 2007. After the birth of Dannielynn and the death of Smith, Prince von Anhalt stepped forward to claim her as his natural child. He claimed to have had a secret ten-year sexual relationship with Smith.</p>

<p><strong>The Psychopathic Nature of European Royalty and family ties to Nazi regime</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>QUEEN VICTORIA\'S grandchildren all married each other, and many of her children were psychopaths. One of her favourite grandchildren was Prince Carl Eduard Coburg who attended Eton and was a British Prince who was a member of the Order of the Garter. He was sent to Germany and installed as a General in the armed forces, and he then set about conscripting the youngest and fittest of German society who he then commanded and killed on battlefields of the First World War. It was Prince Carl Eduard Coburg and his uncle, the Kaiser, who caused millions of people to be gassed and murdered between 1914-1918. On the other side of the first world war battlefields was his cousin - King George V - commanding the British troops and overseeing the first use of Chemical Weapons such as Mustard Gas and Chlorine bombs. Both these men were British Royals, educated at the British tax payers\' expense, both these men were directly related to Queen Victoria, they were both psychopaths… They were both members of the Order of the Garter. They were both raised at Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>Within just 19 years of the end of the first world war, the \'Third Reich\' had been invented, and a former victim of a mustard gas attack, Adolf Hitler, whose real family name is Schikelgruber, was employed by Prince Carl Eduard Coburg to be the front-man in the second world war. Heinrich Himmler was the 2nd in command, and the god-son of Prince Heinrich of Bavaria - but the main psychopath in charge of operations was Prince Carl Eduard Coburg. The Duke of Edinburgh\'s sisters married senior NAZI officers who were Princes and also descendants of Queen Victoria. This incestuous cabal of kings, princes and dukes then stage-managed and funded the NAZI party and are responsible for killing 45million+ people.</p>
<p>The sheer scale and audacity of this psychopathic masterplan shocked Hitler, who said &quot;Today I met the Antichrist - he was cruel and intrepid and he frightened me!&quot; following his meeting with the British Prince Carl Eduard Coburg. Much of what I have just written has been deliberately airbrushed from the history books. The E.U. undemocratic superstate government is the end-game in this masterplan, devised and funded by royal psychopaths. No wonder Buckingham Palace have not uttered a word about how British people\'s rights have been taken away bit-by-bit by the E.U. - the E.U. is their long-term plan - to grab and control the ancient nations of Europe, to mortally inflict high rates of VAT on all small businesses, and to engineer yet more wars where the brightest, youngest and fittest die on the battlefields.</p>

On the other side of the first world war battlefields was his cousin - King George V - commanding the British troops and overseeing the first use of Chemical Weapons such as Mustard Gas and Chlorine bombs. Both these men were British Royals, educated at the British tax payers' expense, both these men were directly related to Queen Victoria, they were both psychopaths… They were both members of the Order of the Garter. They were both raised at Buckingham Palace.
           </p>
           <p>
            Within just 19 years of the end of the first world war, the 'Third Reich' had been invented, and a former victim of a mustard gas attack, Adolf Hitler, whose real family name is Schikelgruber, was employed by Prince Carl Eduard Coburg to be the front-man in the second world war. Heinrich Himmler was the 2nd in command, and the god-son of Prince Heinrich of Bavaria - but the main psychopath in charge of operations was Prince Carl Eduard Coburg. The Duke of Edinburgh's sisters married senior NAZI officers who were Princes and also descendants of Queen Victoria. This incestuous cabal of kings, princes and dukes then stage-managed and funded the NAZI party and are responsible for killing 45million+ people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sheer scale and audacity of this psychopathic masterplan shocked Hitler, who said "Today I met the Antichrist - he was cruel and intrepid and he frightened me!" following his meeting with the British Prince Carl Eduard Coburg. Much of what I have just written has been deliberately airbrushed from the history books. The E.U. undemocratic superstate government is the end-game in this masterplan, devised and funded by royal psychopaths. No wonder Buckingham Palace have not uttered a word about how British people's rights have been taken away bit-by-bit by the E.U. - the E.U. is their long-term plan - to grab and control the ancient nations of Europe, to mortally inflict high rates of VAT on all small businesses, and to engineer yet more wars where the brightest, youngest and fittest die on the battlefields.

            Harry konnick Jr show with Jacob Cramer teen &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            &lt;br&gt;
 http:/www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/local_news/pepper-pike-teen-shows-love-for-the-elderly-on-tv/article_15adaad6-c220-11e6-acb1-8ffd8a3e8651.html&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In 2013, he began Love for the Elderly by writing letters to seniors from his Pepper Pike living room. This program became Letters of Love. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was not really watching the tv but noticed the show, a young boy exited about talking about seniors. That was a little strange he should be so excited talking about "Love for Seniors." What did that mean Right? So I filmed the tv. Kinda trippy what resulted, possibly code but probaby code triggers. The first scene is them sitting on a couch, 2 teen girls one teen boy, Harry on chair. The  teen girl to one side of the boy with  sexy legs and shoes the other teen girl kinda chubby, both brown skinned unlike the boy or Harry.&lt;br&gt;
            <a href="https://ibb.co/kaaDx5">
             https://ibb.co/kaaDx5
            </a>
            &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The screen fades to the letters that Jacobs been helping write to the old folks.
            <a href="https://ibb.co/gea2qQ">
             https://ibb.co/gea2qQ
            </a>
            &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then the screen goes back to them sitting. But what had happened during the fade from where they were sitting to the image of a pile of letters is that the two images combine to make a new scene which is too quick to percieve.
            <a href="https://ibb.co/hB8K4k">
             https://ibb.co/hB8K4k
            </a>
            &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They go back to talking scene shifts to letters again this time the fade out has the same perfect fit of the little drawings on the letters setting exactly on the people's bodies. Like SMILE in PURPLE on the sexy teen girls arm. On her feet it says YOU LO in green across chubby gito body it says SMILE around Harry Konnick Jr face the stars which are childishly drawn stars of David fit exactly over each eye. The heads of every person have a severe line thru them, which would be the edge of each envelope. There is a childish drswing of a house on an envope which looks to be a Tahitian house on stilts on a beach or in the Philippines. &lt;br&gt;
            <a href="https://ibb.co/hB8K4k">
             https://ibb.co/hB8K4k
            </a>
            &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you looked at this properly not from a cell phone off a tv, like me here, find out what they are talking about with the subliminal messages. Could it be harvesting old People? Out of old homes? &lt;br&gt;

            OMFG! I thought I was passed being shocked; I was wrong. I so well remember Anna Nicole and thinking just what I had apparently been brainwashed to think: drugs were behind how she presented. That regressed video absolutely clarifies and breaks my heart all at the same time.

            If I could upvoat this a thousand I would.  It has been made difficult and uncomfortable for those who voted to leave the EU to actually own up to the fact;, such has been the backlash. The latter video has made me proud that I did and affirmed I did it for the right reasons.  This is totally the most complete in depth analysis of the true history, operation and agenda of the EU that I have ever seen.  Had this gone mainstream in the UK pre-vote it would have been a fucking landslide. The dots joined and linked in this post and the openings for further research are almost overwhelming.  I also now know how to properly contribute to the change.  Thank you again, for this.   Stay well and strong people.  This constant diet of red pills can take its toll.

            Excellent post. I just watch a Dannie Lynn YouTube video, Anna's daughter, she was ten yrs old in the video and there are so many red flags, first off her dad is WIERD, odd, something not quite right. Apparently he stated Howard, the guy who shot the above DiD videos of Anna's clown face challenged paternity and when it was revealed it was Larry Birkhead who is the father, they both "joined forced and are raising her together" just not in the same house.  THATS A MAJOR RED FLAG. Howard completely took advantage of Anna in these videos and Larry knew that and often complained about it. So where did Larry come from? How did he come into Anna's life being she was so protected with handlers? What is his real background? Apparently he received no money from her estate but lives with Dannie Lynn in a giant home and works as an occasional photographer. I'm very concerned for this young girl. Dannie Lynn talks about butterflies reminding her of her mother and draws them constantly etc. She's a very pretty little kid and look so much like Anna at her age. I hate to say this but from everything we know, my gut instinct is leading me to Dannie being programmed by Howard and Larry as an accomplice and sent to elites for money. No doubt she would bring in a lot of money. I'm very scared for this girl. Anna's mother knew what was happening from birth and was in on this programming. No question Anna in the video is a four yr old child alter not drugs, drugs do NOT do that for extended periods of time. Howard is evil for taking the video and getting the other child to make fun of her. Notice Anna's eyes roll up into her head when she's answering questions this is common in DID child alters. I'm so saddened by this all.

            Another one who missed my connotation, the Zionist Jew's are the Nazi's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Ken Livingstone, the former London Mayor claimed Jews and Nazis 'collaborated' before the Second World War.
           </p>
           <p>
            He claimed...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Zionist movement” asked the Nazis to stop rabbis giving sermons in Yiddish, and “make them do it in Hebrew” and that Hitler “agreed to that”.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They passed a law that said only the Zionist flag and the swastika could be flown in Germany – there was an awful lot,” Mr Livingstone claimed.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They [the Nazis] started selling Mauser pistols to the underground Jewish army, so you had, right up to the start of the Second World War, real collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
             “And when, in July 1937, many senior Nazis gathered at their foreign office, saying ‘we should stop sending Jews to Palestine because it could &gt;
create a Jewish state’, in the middle of that meeting a directive comes specifically from Hitler saying ‘no, we will continue with this policy’.

            That is so sad. That is so cruel that he would take this video knowing that it would be worth money. I've always thought this video was because she was high. This makes so much sense now. I think she's on drugs too tho. The guy said something about mushrooms in the beginning. I don't know. I've never seen this whole video before. It's so sad that she was pregnant during all of this. :(

             She was high alright. Have you seen the pic of the bottle of methadone in her fridge? And that was just one of her "medications." Another was alcohol. Have you seen her autopsy photo? (Now I'm being morbid.)

              Oh I forgot to say that I could tell she was on drugs in that video by how her eyes wouldn't focus and would roll. But, maybe the mind control made it worse. I've never seen someone act like that.

               I know, I remember when it first came out. Really freaky stuff. Of course she was out of her mind when she did that award show thing and acted like Marilyn Monroe. She got famous after marrying an old oil tycoon (as you may know) who used to frequent the Houston strip club she worked at.

              I seen her autopsy photo if you're talking about the one of her just laying on the table. I think she was covered up. I would kill someone if they shared a photo of me dead! I didn't see the methadone. Yikes. But, that guy said she had no drugs in her system when she died. That's just strange. Something is up with that. It's weird how her son died and she did right after and so young. She had a sad life.
I remember someone had showed me her playboy picture and article before she ever even got famous. That's crazy because that's the only article I've ever read in that magazine and it happened to be her.

               John Lennon did a great interview there too. Yeah, that's the photo, on the table. You can see all you want at the site findadeath.com. All about the details behind the death of many celebs, w/ lots of photos. People cut deals w/ morticians to get photos. Happened w/ Elvis. "No drugs" in her system, got to be wrong. The whole thing is screwy, she was a tortured person, like Marilyn Monroe.

              Yes, but tell me, what makes the "Jews" so evil? Is it their genes, the bloodlines, the Khazar theory (which I don't buy).
             </p>
             <p>
              It would have to be a spiritual reason. And that reason is not as complex as everyone would make it.

             I think "Nephilim possessing reptilian human hybrids" is more of an appropriate term.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are NOT free to roam around and possess human beings, as the RCC and other churches suggest. The Nephilim aren't part of God's creation only Satan's. Nonetheless, they do contain an eternal spirit being the off spring of fallen angels and the daughters of man.  After being wiped out by god's flood, the aftermath of God protecting his children (man) from the dna manipulation of the Nephilim. The giants was left to roam the earth as disembodied spirits and became demons. Unable to reincarnate in human form (not part of natural creation), they instead seduced man with the forbidden knowledge of  DNA manipulation to create human/animal hybrids for the sole purposes of demonic possession, the very human reptilians your referring to.
            </p>
            <p>
             The idea that demons are the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim, is a storyline echoed by the writings of many early church fathers as well as the Jewish historian, Josephus. Further corroboration is found in the apocryphal books of Enoch, Jubilees, Jasher; The Testimony of the 12 Patriarchs, and The Book of Giants. Copies of these books were found in the Dead Sea scrolls, suggesting they predate Christ and probably represent the common teaching of his day, and though they are not our infallible canon, they are important historical records, through which we can better understand Scripture and the demon phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, Jude 1:6 7 is better understood in light of Enoch 16 &amp; Jubilees 4:22-5:7, which states that the Watchers defiled themselves with the daughters of men by taking wives, just like the children of men do, and from that union came forth the giants. This seduction also brought into the earth all manner of witchcraft and warfare, for which the Watchers were enchained and forced to watch their children destroy one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             "And now, the giants, produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling.… And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless hunger and thirst and cause offenses. … rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they had preceded from them." (Enoch 16)
            </p>
            <p>
             Many say this origin for the Nephilim is scripturally impossible, due to Mat 22:30; &amp; Mk 12:25, but those verses are in complete agreement with Enoch 15:4-5. Their judgment was great BECAUSE they weren’t created for marriage, and this IS the source of demon spirits. Jubilees ch 10 adds the troubles they caused Noah's children after the flood, how he prayed for God to remove them, and how God gave relief by removing 90% of them. However, 10 % were allowed to remain in order to test the hearts of men, while Noah was taught to understand how the demons work their seduction as well as the healing of human diseases with herbs, which was written into a book.

              Bad theology. Sons of God were simply the "righteous" during that time, they defiled themselves by marrying ungodly and unbelieving heathen. Possibly Canaanites. It' as simple as that. No need to go off the deep end.

               I have to disagree.
              </p>
              <p>
               The masses have been trained to call the Nephilim of Genesis chapter six by another new name, “aliens.” These so called “aliens” have been involved with mankind since day one. They are not from another planet, rather they are interdimensional beings and per the Bible, are the satanic offspring of Fallen Watcher Angels and humans.
              </p>
              <p>
               “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them.” Genesis 6:4
              </p>
              <p>
               “When men began to multiply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and took them wives of all which they chose.” Genesis 6:1-4
              </p>
              <p>
               These ‘Sons of God’ (Ben Elohim or fallen angels) were known as the Watchers. The title ‘Watcher’ simply means ‘one who watches’, ‘those who watch’, ‘those who are awake’ or ‘those who do not sleep’. These titles reflect the unique relationship between the Watchers and the human race since ancient times.
              </p>
              <p>
               These angelic beings were given the task by God to be earthly shepherds of humans. It was their job to watch over the human species and report back on their progress. However they were confined by the divine prime directive not to teach or become sexual active with humans. Regrettably, some of them, decided to ignore God’s command and eventually became known as the “Fallen Watcher Angels”.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most of the information we have about these mysterious Fallen Watchers and their activities comes from the apocryphal Book of Enoch.  But just who is Enoch? According to the Bible Enoch was a man who faithfully walked with God (Gen. 5:22). Enoch lived just prior to the flood of Noah and he did not keep silent about the corruption around him. The book of Jude says he prophesied about the evil on the earth:
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”
               </em>
               Jude 1:14-15.
              </p>
              <p>
               Enoch was a faithful man who trusted and obeyed God and because of that he did not see death, for God took him…
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                “…then he was no more, because God took him away.”
               </em>
               Genesis 5:24.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was during Enoch’s and Noah’s lifetime that the Fallen Watcher Angels were teaching, having sex, and corrupting men on the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to the Book of Enoch, two-hundred of the ‘fallen angels’ descended from the heavenly realm on to the summit of Mount Hermon and they were so smitten by the beauty of human women that they took the form of a human and had sex with them. Because of this sin, a race of half-angelic, half-human species sprang up (Genesis 6:4) in the land. An offspring so evil that they devoured the flesh of men and were giants on the land. A race known as the Nephilim.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fallen angels taught their wives and children a assortment of new technological skills, magical knowledge, and occult wisdom.
              </p>
              <p>
               Azazel the leader taught men how to make swords, shields, and breastplates and how to use metals. He also taught the women the art of jewelry making and make-up. Shemyaza, another fallen watcher angel, taught humans the use of root cuttings and the magical art of enchantment; Armaros taught the resolving of enchantments; Baraqijal taught astrology; Kokabiel taught  astronomy; Chazaqiel taught about clouds and the sky ; Shamsiel the sun; Sariel the courses of the moon; Penemuel instructed humans in the art of writing and reading; and Kashdejan taught the diagnosis and healing of diseases and the science of medicine.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a result of all this corruption, God sent a flood on the earth during the time of Noah and all of the Nephilim offspring were killed. According to the Book of Enoch the 200 fallen watcher angels were bound up for 70 generations.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since then, there has been a resurgence of fallen watcher angels—more rebellions— and the 70 generation time frame expired in the 1900′s. These fallen angels are once again wreaking havoc on the Earth and having sexual relations with women forming their evil offspring the Nephilim, who are no longer a race of giants, but over time they have managed to manipulate DNA and look similar to that of the Alien greys.
              </p>
              <p>
               Today they have infiltrated every branch of government and are calling the shots from behind closed doors; and although some deny their existence, their symbolism is very prevalent, and their name is very well known. No longer are the called the “fallen watcher angels”. But the hid under the TOP Ranks of the mysterious group known as the Illuminati!
              </p>
              <p>
               These infamous beings are also found in the book of Revelation:
              </p>
              <p>
               *“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. Then I saw
               <strong>
                three evil spirits that looked like frogs
               </strong>
               ; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. *
               <em>
                They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs
               </em>
               <em>
                , and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty… Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.”
               </em>
               Rev 16:12-19, 21
              </p>
              <p>
               In this chapter the Bible speaks of three evil spirits that look like frogs, who go forth deceiving not only the kings, but the whole world. Note that these beings are not frogs, but they do resemble them. Meaning they have an amphibian or reptilian appearance and it further describes them as unclean spirits or demons. Therefore, I do believe it’s possible that John was talking about Nephilim when he wrote the book of Revelation.

                Nephilim simply means giants. The book of Enoch is not included in the canon of the OT because it has too many problems. Nothing of this is touched on by Christ or any of the apostles nor anywhere else in the scriptures old and new. Just the book of Jude mentions Enoch (and states a prophecy). But it does not mention The Book of Enoch. You're being too imaginative and fanciful.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your sources are extremely limited and sketchy, mine are the thousands of Puritan and reformed commentaries from all over Europe and New England, which, though written over a span of two centuries at least, all jive. And, speaking of Enoch, these men indeed "walked with God." Do you know what "walked with God" means?

                 You need to understand that the Nephilim was never part of the plan of creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are Satan's tool to lead man astray.

                <p>
                 REMEMBER...
                </p>
                <p>
                 God announced to the angels that He was placing a new specie on earth. God created Adam, fashioning him from clay. He breathed the soul into Adam, taught him the names of all things, and created from the same soul his wife, Eve. God allowed them to dwell in Paradise with free will. God said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam” (They did so in a form of respect, not worship). Satan was present among the angels, though he was not one of them. He was of the jinn, a race of beings possessing free will that God created before Adam from a smokeless flame of fire. When God ordered the angels and those in their company to bow down to Adam, they all did so except Satan, who refused out of pride and arrogance, claiming to be better than Adam because he was created from fire, whereas Adam was created from clay. Indeed, Satan was the first
                 <strong>
                  RACIST
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Satan fell from God’s grace. God, The Reckoner, condemned him for his disobedience, but Satan, the accursed, asked God to give him respite until the Day of Judgment (resurrection), so he could make Adam and his descendants unworthy. Satan said, “Verily I will mislead them and surely I will arouse in them vain desires.” God granted him this respite as a trial for humanity. God knows what Satan knows not. It is important to note that there is no way Satan could ever “war” with God, because just like everything else, he is God’s creation. Satan exists only by God’s will; he is completely under God’s power. If God did not want Satan or his helpers to exist, they would not be able to remain in existence for even a moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Walking with God takes faith. It takes commitment. And it takes consistency.

                  : Thank you so much for your deep insightful comments. I have been addicted to following Pizzagate/Comey/SethRich topics for days, longing for justice to prevail. I was remembering this morning that in Genesis, after the fall of man, man's dominion over creation was given to Satan. I am beginning to understand that the justice I long for will not be fulfilled until Jesus is restored to his rightful place. To me, that has two parts:1)  the future reign of Jesus over the earth, and 2) the Lordship I can give to him as I accept his work on the Cross, his provision of making me a new creation, and walking in the Truth of who he says I am in Christ. Jesus told his followers in John 14:12 "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father." Jesus went to his Father and then sent his Holy Spirit to indwell believers and strengthen and guide them in walking with him. I am posting a link to a youtube preacher that has been such a blessing and encouragement in helping me to see what walking with Jesus is about:

                  </a>
                  <br/>
                  Thank you again for taking time to post about the spiritual battle we are engaged in. I appreciate the dedication of all of you researchers on voat. I think for those who claim to be followers of Christ, the best way to combat this evil is to allow Jesus to live through us and do his will.

                  Yeah I agree w/ a lot of what your're saying, as it is scriptural. I know Satan is under God's control. You're a bit off on some things though. Not as bad as your other stuff you posted.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What are your sources? You need several to be believable and make a case.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you have no sound theologians you're using you're going to err. And that's your problem.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You didn't answer what "walking with God" is, not sufficiently, yes, it is faith, but what is the practical outcome, or outworking of that faith? (Which is a heck of a lot more important than having a head full of knowledge.)  "Love edifies, but knowledge puffeth up."

               considering how much "good stuff" is out there, he probably can't help it. I will say there are specific posters who I question motive more than others. Following the money with Anna Nicole Smith there is definitely shady shit to be found, and MK Ultra, probably, but the nazi trail stuff detracts from it.

             It's terrifyingly obvious how dangerous a world leader could be under the influence of this type of mind control. The recent conspiracy talk of WW3 takes on a whole new meaning if numerous leaders are MK Ultra drones.

                It reminds me of the opening scene from the "Back to the Future" movie. A "stain" in plain sight.

                Personally, without traveling to far. I think the secret to understanding our beautiful created universe lies "In the wind" and "Nikola Tesla". Einstein was one once asked how it felt to be the smartest man alive. Einsteins reply was " I don't know, you'll have to ask Nikola Tesla."
               </p>
               <p>
                Are "Pylons" Tesla's secret invention?? If so... the nuclear factor is the biggest snake oil company EVER!
               </p>
               <p>
                Why after a electrical storm, do plants show unexplained, vigorous growth? The official explanation is the water but any gardener will flat out tell you that's a lie.
               </p>
               <p>
                Does the spider ACTUALLY use the "electrical charged atmosphere" to weave it's web?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why is it, there are only a few "electric lighting skyscrapes?". Could these be whats powering our Cities?

             I have wondered if the Wonderland Club was named after the Wonderland Murders of Laurel Canyon, involving John Holmes. Might be a stretch. Creepy stuff and people need to know about it. Reminds me of Manson murders. WARNING. The below video is the actual LE video of crime scene where four well-known Hollywood drug dealers (some of them guests) were bludgeoned to death w/ hammers in an apparent revenge killing in middle of night, though still unsolved. GRAPHIC. Don't watch if you have weak stomach, etc.

            I remember hearing in the news a few years ago that they thought there was a tunnel built from Hefner's Mansion to some of the stars, the only ones I remember are Warren Beatty and Kirk Douglas but there were others.  They tried to sweep  this story under the rug at the time.  I bet it still exists.  OH I found the article
            <strong>

            Sorry would not provide link correctly  It is a great article including Jack Nicholson by The Telegraph. OH!  There are plans included too.

               I was chatting up a lady in the store two years ago, she was nice-looking for her age. Said she had just gotten back from a bunny convention, they meet yearly, w/ her friend Barbi Benton. I told her that I wasn't flirting, just talking. She said, "Right! Now I gotta keep moving 'cause people know me around here." What could I say? I WAS flirting.

                 I thought the same thing today. I remember when all that came out, I thought that these women wanted their 15 minutes of fame and they annoyed me so much. I thought it was too fishy that everyone came forward years later. Now, I totally believe it. I view things so different Thant 6 months ago. That's for sure.

            That alleged photo of ANS as a young girl is not she.  ANS was BUTT-UGLY (big JEWISH nose, etc.) until her rich benefactor paid for a FORTUNE in plastic surgery.

             Before downvoating me, at the very least gave me a chance to reply to your comment. This demonstrates once again your up to your old troublemaker tactics... A saboteur who tries to infiltrate the passivity of viewers and to create impressions that are lasting with invalid points.

               The jew who originally posted this bullshit, "Northern_Soul", posts a thread in which all the people mentioned are jews, but he doesn't use the word "jew" even ONCE, yet he uses the word "German" 8 times.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously this "northern_soul" douchebag is a jew piece of shit disinfo agent. Hopefully this jew will be murdered in the street. Hopefully someone will come up behind him, and strike this filthy jew in the head with a blunt object, and kill it along with the rest of its jew family of inbred lying pedophile TRASH&gt; Hopefully someone will pour gasoline down this jew's snout and burn it.

             Oh thanks for including that. Can't figure out why it would not print.  They said in the article that it was closed up, but I don't believe it.  When they have a good thing going why would they stop their fun and money?  Also Heff is living to a ripe old age and I wonder how he is managing it, probably just like the Rothschilds and Kissingers.

            Prince Frederic Prinz Van Anhalt was married to Zza Zza  Gabor who just died.  He is living in her home now having inherited it and everything in it.   I never trusted him when they married.  It was rumored then that he just bought his title.  He also talked of having an affair with Anna Nicole but we just laughed.  The old fool.  Who knew.

             According to Wikipedia he was adopted as an adult: "In 1980, at the age of 36, Lichtenberg was adopted as an adult by Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt (1898–1983), whose first husband was Prince Joachim of Prussia, son of German Emperor Wilhelm II." He himself adopted several adult males (so they could use the title?) over the years. Very strange story all around. I always found Anna Nicole to be such a tragic figure. Her son's death also needs to be looked into given the above allegations.

              Oh thanks for reminding me about her son.  I had forgotten about him and I remember feeling so sad.  The whole thing was so bazaar from beginning to end.  I bet Heff shared her with Caan and Cosby.  Disgusting to even think about.  The sooner he leaves the better.  Probably another 100 yrs.

            Shit!  I totally forgot about that.  Fucking hell!  We really need to go back and look at all of these cases.  I am willing that history will look much different once we expose all of this fuckery.

             If I'm correct Marilyn Monroe was in the first playboy issue? Wasn't she an MK presidential model?
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: also a great number of women especially social media idolize Marilyn Monroe. She's almost like an idol. Have these women been programmed, is there also media programming through MSM and entertainment outlets to program people as sex alters or trigger narcissistic tendencies.

             I remember seeing some of the Anna Nicole footage back then and thinking she must be messed up on drugs of some sort, but now it REALLY does look like an alter at about age 4, possibly on some drugs as well...
