<p>John Wetteland, a one-time World Series MVP, has been indicted on child sex abuse charges in Texas, according to reports.
Wetteland was hit with three charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of 14 in Denton, Texas, on March 28, USA Today reported.</p>
<p>The former New York Yankee is accused of cajoling a relative into performing sex acts on him beginning in 2004 when the victim was four years old. The indictment claims Wetteland repeated the treatment of the child on three occasions over two years.</p>
<p>Wetteland won a World Series championship and was awarded MVP as a New York Yankee in 1996. He was a three-time All-Star and closed his career as the Texas Rangers’ all-time saves leader with 150. He was inducted into the Rangers hall of fame in 2005. Wetteland also played for Montreal and the Dodgers.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old was arrested in January on suspicion of child sex abuse and released on a $25,000 bond.</p>

             Bored with the country by the time he was an adolescent, John and older brother Mitchell would accompany their father on his nightly 80-mile drive south to San Francisco, where Ed Wetteland would make a living playing the piano at nightclubs.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Once in the city, the father would let the sons loose.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I thought it was good for them," said Ed, who today works with his wife Barbara, a singer, to form a touring duet known as Sweet N'Hot. "They were interested in what life was all about, and this was a good way to show them. They wanted to see what a gay person looked like. They wanted to see a street person. They found out. They were better for it."
             </p>
             <p>
              At the end of each night, the boys would find their way back to the club, where bedtime was never a simple ritual.

            I am sure his relatives are glad he made bond.  Sicko actors and sports people.

             <p>
              During the 1996 season, he led the American League in saves, totaling 43, and appeared in the All-Star Game. During the 1996 World Series, Wetteland recorded four saves and the Yankees won the World Series against the Atlanta Braves in six games. Wetteland won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award,[8] recording the maximum four saves possible during the Series, tying the record for the most saves in a single postseason series (Dennis Eckersley first did it in the 1988 ALCS; since then, Greg Holland matched it in the 2014 ALCS), and setting a record for saves in the full postseason, with 7 (since then, Robb Nen, Troy Percival, Brad Lidge, Koji Uehara, and Holland, share this record). He was awarded with the 1996 Rolaids Relief Man Award.

             <p>
              All those saves and MVP -  Pretty Big Deal
             </p>
             <p>
              Wetteland was awarded the Rolaids Reliever of the Decade after earning the most saves of any pitcher during the 1990s. He is also the Rangers all-time saves leader with 150. His final win/loss percentage was .516, with 48 wins and 45 losses.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2005, Wetteland was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.
             </p>
             <p>
              On May 18, 2007, Wetteland was introduced as an assistant baseball coach and Bible teacher at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas.

             </p>
             <p>
              When Wetteland returned to the high school several years ago after signing a lucrative contract with the Texas Rangers, he donated $100,000, Rutherford said. The money was used to build a weight room and the school has a plaque outside the room with the inscription “Wetteland Weight Room Equipment.”
             </p>
             <p>
              That plaque likely will be removed, Rutherford said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cardinal Newman administrators also will have to decide whether to leave professional baseball jerseys with his name on them and a photo of him in the school’s trophy case.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bartonville, Texas, Police Chief Bobby Dowell said in a prepared statement issued Tuesday that the case was referred to his agency by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services on Jan. 9. Five days later, Wetteland was arrested by the Denton County Sheriff’s Office.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wetteland was charged with continuous sexual abuse of a child under 14, a first-degree felony that carries a penalty of 25 to 99 years in prison. He was released Monday on $25,000 bail, Denton County jail records show.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               WOW
              </strong>
              25 to 99 Years.  That bail should have been higher.  It does not jive with the possible sentencing.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to a consolidated complaint and probable cause affidavit, Wetteland is accused of forcing a child relative to perform a sex act on him, beginning in 2004 when the child was 4. The accuser said it happened twice more during a two-year period, the Associated Press reported.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wetteland, a three-time All-Star, had 330 saves over a career that also included stints with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Montreal Expos. He also had a 48-45 career pitching record with a 2.93 ERA.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's a pretty good average  Earned Run Average of almost 3.0.  My husband who just recently passed away was my teacher when it came to Baseball Stats.  This guy was not Up at the Top but he was pretty darn good.  He screwed himself up ROYALLY.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now we have this info as well from the article:
             </p>
             <p>
              Wetteland taught Bible classes to 11th-grade boys at Liberty Christian School in Argyle, Texas, in the late 2000s and he was the school’s assistant baseball coach. He has no current connection to the school, the Dallas Morning News reported.
             </p>
             <p>
              So presently as far as we know he may have started sexually abusing a minor/s in 2004.  That's 14 years ago.  Do you think that he stopped with that Child?  We know better than that.  I am hoping that the Children of the Bible School come forward.  This guy is a real  Slime Ball of a Monster.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is so sad and sickening.  I know this would have turned my husband's stomach and then some.
