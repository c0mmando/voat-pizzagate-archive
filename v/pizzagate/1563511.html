            and I got the information from George Webb's slides in which people are helping with the investigation.  I copied the links from Diane Barton, a contributor.  Don't make up things that aren't true - with no facts to back them up.  I thought I was helping.  I am not a shill nor am I Steven Feinberg.  Don't accuse people who post of underhanded things.  Check it out first.

            Better watch out or the raging mod might remove this.  Dyncorp not related to pizzagate according to him.  Deleted my post/link about dyncorp.  Think im done here on this site.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mods dont care about the investigation,  they care about getting their rocks off while they randomly click the delete button.
            <br/>
            A deleting circle jerk.

            Check out his wiki page. Threatened to KILL any of his employees if their picture or picture of their home was posted online. Check out Cerberus website - no pics of management. George Webb said many mass shootings will probably include a dyncorp ex employee... dallas police shooting did at least. Worth looking into further over the past 10-20 years.

            Cerebus did not do that.  Corporations (and unions) are banned from donating money directly to candidates or national party committees.

            Cerebus donors gave more to Republicans than to Democrats by a more than 2 to 1 margin and at the presidential level also gave $40,000 to Republicans or almost as much as to Hillary.
