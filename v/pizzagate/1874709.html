            rofl. sorry man, I think you haven't a clue in regard to Martial Arts. Next you're going to talk about golf because the players use their "wood putter" to get their "balls" in a single hole....you may spread an "eagle" across your card...nice try but ,no.....I agree the logo may be a little interesting in appearance, but considering their last name is Gracie, yes with  a capital "G", I think it's not intentionally done to represent pizzagate but their namesake and legacy of their father's jujitsu.
I would like to hear their reasoning in the logo design though. I would also like to see proof of any objectional arrests or reports in regard to pedo activity for their family or organization.
Then I'd say you're on to something.

            I was waiting until Pizzagate would go full Gacie Jui-Jitsu (re: logo) and now you have! Can you believe that there are sports out there where men have to touch other men like wrestling and combat sports. And OMG they are touching each other to demonstrate athletic power and not just doing it out of violence and hate. Ewwww... Ban that :P
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are going to look into Gracie, remember that it is an organization run by a family of freak athletes* and it's a bit of a cult. You also have to consider that, while Brazil  is more macho than the U.S. in terms of culture, men are not as homophobic in Brazil sports and less engaged in the continuous protection of their manhood. What that gives you is men who are much nicer/cuddly to each other. Personally, I find this quite nice about South American men. But to North American men, it might come off as more intimate than it actually is.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Gracie family owns gyms around the world and their biggest patrons are the Royal families of the U.A.E. via fight sports in U.A.E and Dubai. There are many subgroups of franchises so make sure to look it up in the course of your research.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, outside of the general feeling in North America that Gracie schools function a bit like a cult, I have not seen concerning info. Jiu-Jitsu used to be mostly practiced by adults. Combat sports for kids is rather new. The jitz is great for self defense and general human competence :)

             I agree. Rolling around on the floor with another man, while wearing a shirt with a known FBI pedophile logo on it is fucking batshit insane. We really need to start systematically exterminating homosexuals. The Bible commands them to be put to death, and the reasons are obvious - they are psychotic pedophile trash, disease-spreading, mentally-ill cancer cells in a society. They shouldn't be allowed to metastisize. Especially jews, since their sick religion openly condones the rape of children. These inbred, geneticallly-mutated, circus-freak monsters need to be systematically purged from the planet.
