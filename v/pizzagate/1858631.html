Some things to look for:</p>
<p>From this link:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX227FaKMUo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX227FaKMUo</a>
1.	Look at the Art work on the Serial Box at 33 seconds in.  Does any of it look familiar?
2.	What about the Rabbit image on the can of food at :42, which the Rabbit Canimal falls in love with?  Doesn’t it look very similar to the generic “Pedobear” image, except its pink and has ears.</p>
<p>From this link:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTv5SFRqz_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTv5SFRqz_Y</a>
1.	What does the Rabbit look like he is doing at :55?
2.	Watch the Lizards eyes at 1:42 and 2:07.  Isn’t that a MK Ultra mind control image?  The lizards eyes do that over and over throughout the cartoons when ever he is sleeping or gets hurt?
3.	Look at all the hearts they use throughout the cartoon.
4.	Look at the images they use.
5.	It just all looks very suspicious to me.

             I'm honestly seriously annoyed at the posters dissing on people for their research and sharing what they find.  If you ask me, there are mountains of evidence that Hollywood is normalizing creepy/psychotic/pedo behavior and calling it "entertainment."  Please do not let these people discourage you!
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm finding a lot of disturbing behavior in the episodes you shared, and a lot of it is just the premise of the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             For me, why do they have animals living in cans that look like food?  That's already creepy, and there's an age old argument that giving animals human characteristics is disturbing at the onset.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the first episode, we have what are supposedly cute animals dealing with a romantic situation gone wrong.  Why are kids being shown a cheating situation?  Just look at the narrative.  Girl likes boy.  Boy sees pretty picture and is instantly brainwashed by her "beauty."  The cartoon even shows his ears popping up and makes a sound like he's getting a boner.  Why are kids already being shown that physical appearance is the most important aspect of "falling in love"?  Why the constant narrative that "men are cheaters"?  Why are kids being normalized to this behavior?
            </p>
            <p>
             And after he "falls" for the picture, instead of dropping him (like any girl should if she has any respect for herself), she gets angry and tries to "fight" for his affections.  She gets violent and drops pots and pans on him.  If you ask me, this should not be normalized as the appropriate reaction to cheating.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the end, the boy even looks like he's just orgasmed, and the last scene while the screen is blacking out into a circle, he looks like he's doing the gesture of oral sex on a woman.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like you said, this cartoon is being marketed towards
             <strong>
              CHILDREN
             </strong>
             , but the themes are extremely sexual and adult in nature.  Kids shouldn't be worried about this crap at the age of the target audience for this cartoon.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no idea why people don't think this was an important post.  I see nothing wrong with trying to expose pedo normalization.  It absolutely relates to PizzaGate, and I'm tired of the gatekeepers around here acting like this isn't a hugely important aspect of the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you again for sharing.  As a mother, I appreciate knowing that other people are just as concerned about what our children are watching as I am.  This shit needs to be exposed for what it is, normalization of sexual situations and behavior in young children..

            Sorry OP.. but in light of other recent flare-ups from basic symbols and extremely loose/non-existent evidence, this is probably going to get deleted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Searching for symbolism first and not supporting evidence has gotten us nowhere. If we start with evidence and THEN begin to see symbols, different story.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, yeah, like Glacier, this "feels" like disinfo. Whether or not it was intentional TBD.

            I don't see anything. I think you're trying to hard to see something. That black and white spinning swirl has been around for ages. Look at old Disney and Bugs Bunny cartoons. The black and white spinning swirl has been associated with hypnosis for ages. In WW2 the Germans painted those swirls on the propeller cones of their planes because they thought it would hypnotize allied pilots.
