<p>THE FBI RAID ON THE EUROPEAN ADOPTION CONSULTANTS AGENCY IN STRONGSVILLE, OH, OCCURRED A WEEK AFTER JAZMINE\'S ARREST. DID SHE GIVE THEM INFORMATION; WAS SHE CONNECTED IN SOME WAY? WHAT WAS SHE ARRESTED FOR????</p>
<p>Was Jazmine one of the 50 foster children?</p>
<p>P.S. This may sound peculiar, but when the NonFBIAnon\'s picture of the pink-shirted mayor of Columbus <a href="https://imgtc.com/lDkzpBU">https://imgtc.com/lDkzpBU</a> was making the rounds, the fact that one of the buttons on Andy\'s shirt was sewn on with black thread while the others had white thread was a tiny red flag that something was not right. Sure, one could always say that Andy or his wife was in a hurry and sewed the button on at the last minute as he was going out the door, but one can\'t help but wonder if it was a sign of deeper domestic trouble. That sounds really stupid, I know, but in a person of such prominence as the mayor, surely one expects little details like that to be taken care of in a very efficient and capable way? At any rate, Andy\'s statement @ the arrest of his father leads one to wonder if his family and home life might be more than a little hellish:</p>
