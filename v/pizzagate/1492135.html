            I am super angry and Megyn Kelly for not doing a proper job of looking at the mountain of weak circumstantial evidence that James Alefantis is running a pedo-sex operations.   I am not a shill.  I totally believe that this shit-ton of circumstantial evidence is true.    There is no one piece of evidence that you can point to.  It takes time to sort through it all.  Time that Megyn Kelly did not spend.
            <br/>
            On the other hand, Megyn Kelly is NOT A WHORE.  Stop fucking saying shit like that.   It is UNHELPFUL.
            <br/>
            I listened to her book,   #SettleForMore, read in her own voice.  She is not a shill.  But she lived most of her live as a lawyer.   She is non-partisan, but is trained to take a side and then fight to the death for that side like a pit bull.    The problem is that she spend a year with (supposed) Trump supporters threatening her family, and making her life hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe it was Correct the Record people doing it, or some other Scott Foval type operation.  But it really upset her.   She has young children, and she has had to deal with scary stalkers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am quite embarrassed that she ran with this story without due diligence.   She is wrong,  Comet Ping Pong is a sick place.  Evidenced by the mountain of pictures and comments from James Alefantis' instagram, and others.    Megyn Kelly is guilty of jumping to conclusions.   She bought the story of the 'gunman'.    Pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            But.  Do not call her a whore, and do not lump her in with the media members who are actually in on this pedo ring.   As smart as she is, in this case she is being played.  As a journalist, she should have seeked out the most reputable source that thought that Comet Pizza is mixed up in a pedo ring.  Instead, she cherry-picked a couple photos, and didn't even hold Alefantis accountable for his comments!
           </p>
           <p>
            But again, this does not mean it is ok to call her  a whore.   I really do not believe for one second that she is involved in the actual ring.

            Is it just me or does it seem that MSM is acting really stupidly about the so called 'fake news' problem. If I wanted to combat pizzagate,  I'd just leave it alone and hope it would go away like other so called conspiracy theories.  They are making it seem all the more obvious by giving forum to a supposedly poor pizzaria guy.

            Is there some reason she was wearing purple, just like Killary's been doing?  Is she signaling she's also part of Soros's color revolution?  That dress couldn't be any sexier and Me-again's makeup was put on with a shovel instead of a trowel this time.

            I look at it this way. If he's smart enough to know who Moloch is, and claim to worship Moloch and go to spirit cooking's with the Podesta's or what not, he's smart enough to know that what he was posting was Pedo in nature if not outright suggestive. Moloch (Molech) is not something that is common knowledge.

            Wow! She could have skewered him. Of course the soft ball questions were pre arranged,. The 1 photo discussed was the very one I knew it would be! How the hell could he explain the pic of an infants face that he captioned Hoe-Tard? The words of " Majestic Ape? " the degrading satanic art, in a family restaurant?  Portraying a wealthy powerful sicko as a victim? I will never watch her again.

            A couple of things,did anyone expect anything different and in a way this is good for us.He can try and explain till he's blue in the face about the Instagram but I'm sure most normal still think it's creepy as fuck also just the fact that it's on MSN makes it relevant to talk about around the water cooler,friends,family etc.Talk about it to anyone who will listen.Discuss it,be calm,just mention that you've seen his other Instagrams and how disturbing they are ,suggest the go on YouTube and watch  something on it.Dont push it too much you will lose them,people don't want to believe this ,hell we don't want to believe this .Keep up the great work y'all.

            It was in response to an earlier part of the thread. There are people showing up new everyday who need to know that this investigation includes people of all types...people who care. It is not somehow limited to the lunatic fringe or uneducated trolls who "get their news from the fake media." It was written for people who look at what we are doing with disdain (or at least come in with pre-conceived notions). I was not trying to brag but create convey the idea for the type of people I know (I have talked to some) who are educated and easily dismiss this out of an intellectual arrogance. I am NOT above anyone in this and did not write that as a point of arrogance. I sincerely meant well and intended to put that in for the reasons stated above.

            The artwork you describe was by Kim Noble (or one of her alternate personalities) and there's no evidence that it -- or anything else by her -- was ever in CPP.  What happened is people saw a piece of art on the front of a flyer for a CPP event with a band, and the poster art bore a resemblance to a painting by Noble.  They were then juxtaposed by someone for comparison.  People saw this and jumped to a false conclusion that the Noble image they were looking at was inside CPP.

            Your posting comes across as wide-eyed and ranting.  That's not helpful right now.  That's how
            <em>

            Please take your own advice and research more carefully.  There is a lot of rumor-hysteria and also a lot of disinfo-spreading taking place.  Accuracy is the road to success.

            Faux News is no different from any of the other msm outlets when it comes to touchy subjects that truly expose the corruption present on capitol hill and the white house.
           </p>
           <p>
            They lean a little further right only to catch a larger percentage of the population and appease the dumb-masses in to believing that the news we hear on tv is the gospel truth.

            Kudos to all here that are doing the work our fbi should be doing. But as we are well aware, our govmnt does not self investigate. The days of elected officials being held accountable are nearly gone. Only a limited few political law breakers get "picked" or "sacrificed"  on a small scale to appease the masses.
           </p>

            Pizzagate is a phenomenon unlike any I've ever witnessed. The Streisand effect is in high gear like never before and we see it for what it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're fully cognizant of what's happening here. I promise to continue my research and spreading the word as many of you here have.
           </p>
           <p>
            The big picture here is as simple and basic as black and white. It's good vs. evil on an incredible scale. Good luck to everyone on the good side out there! Hopefully the "dumb-masses" will catch on soon.

            Think about this...how many of you would NOT have sued Alex Jones for what Meghan Kelly played on her show last night?  I'm not sure when he said that because I haven't really watched him very much.  She has the means to sue him if she wants to and if it's NOT true,  why wouldn't she sue?  If someone called me straight out a child rapist and killer like he called her I would slap a lawsuit on them so fast even if I had to type the paperwork myself!
           </p>
           <p>
            Meghan doesn't know it , but she motivated us even more!  As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to print up T shirts and give them to everybody I know for Christmas!

            Thanks for another big streisand effect wave, Kelly! Now even more people have and can become curious and find out for themselves what lying, soulless pieces of shit you and the rest of the MSM are, and just how much you've all deliberately hidden and mocked while thousands of children are being trafficked, raped and murdered throughout western governments every year. Good job?

            Presstitutes is a much better term than "mainstream" media.  Labeling our enemy's controlled media "mainstream" implies

            You know what's the most pathetic thing about this? The granddaughter narrative. You want to ease peoples suspicions? Then why don't you put the fucking child on TV and show her that she is indeed your granddaughter? Don't you know how TV works? You bring on a child, show the photo and then PROVE that it's your granddaughter and yet, they keep saying this granddaughter narrative with 0 proof.

            What a pathetic clownshow. Kelly and Alefantis are both CIA assets, in my opinion.  The CIA seems to be dictating the narrative that all the cable channels spew.

            Rupert Murdoch is probably part of the ring. Oh, then I just found this:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The News of the World spiked an exclusive story exposing the science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke as a paedophile, according to a new book about life inside the newspaper whose closure was announced a year ago today.
In Hack, an account of his nerve-shredding days as a reporter on the News of the World and then the Sunday Mirror, Graham Johnson claims that although the NOTW prided itself on outing pederasts, editors made an exception for Mr Clarke because he was a friend of Rupert Murdoch."

            If Pizzagate is just some crazy conspiracy theory, why doesn't that fucking bitch try to de-bunk our claims?
           </p>
           <p>
            The MSM never addresses any of the facts brought up, they just talk about the "poor unfortunate victims" like Alefantis and they never address the instagram photos, the codewords in the emails, the creepy art, any of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            She brought up the picture of the girl taped to the table, and he said that it was an innocent picture of his niece. I know if I put a picture of my cousin's daughter taped to a table on my instagram then everyone in my family would think it was super creepy. Who does that?!

            It was. For sure. But you see that fuckers lip quiver at 3:53 after she mentions "pedophile" and "rabbit hole" you sure as fuck know she has been reading VOAT and the Tweets by RedGreen. Pedofantis is shaking as he knows he has to do this coverage but is nervous as fuck the truth might slip. .... My rage right now. I feel like breathing fire. FUCK THEM!

            How are you surprised? The TPTB IS the media. I guess because I've been into conspiracy for a while, I don't get shocked or upset by these things.

            A body was not discovered buried under anyone's residence, so that is how all of this is going to be written off by the concerned parties.  You don't always get Hulk Hogan leg dropping the evil doer.  The important thing will be to keep the facts handy and start connecting the dots with other information that comes out in the future.  And there will be more information.  If this "faithless elector" shit show commences in the next eighty hours, we will be up to our proverbial eyeballs in more leaks from Assange and Russia.

            You can attempt to subvert the will of the people.  You can be a bizarre pervert.  But you cannot be a bizarre pervert who attempts to subvert the will of the people without getting a direct blast from the shit hose.  Those days are over.   Everyone who eluded justice this time will continue being creatures of habit and step into a another bear trap further on down the line.  It happend to Gawker.  It happened to the DNC.  It will happen to these creeps.

            the fact that the MSM is covering it at all should be good news - that's a confirmation that there really is something to the story, else they wouldn't feel the need to do damage control

            Awesome... legacy media just keeps reaching for an ever increasing shovel size. Soon they will dig so deep that the hole will collapse in on them. I really don't understand how anyone still believes fake news. For fucks sakes people still think that children really died at Sandy Hook. These "people" are actors. They would sell out their own children for a shiny turd.

            Everyone needs to act on what they know about MSM and turn it off -- in fact, it would only help if we all pulled out of cable TV.

            Hi investigators.  This is my first post.  I'm not jumping to conclusions.  But the evidence you've collected about so many different people and organizations sure suggests a great deal.  But that's not why I registered and felt like I needed to say something.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wanted to explain something to all of you, assuming many of you may be under 40.   If you are, you probably don't remember the McMartin case.   Without too going into it too much, the link I'm leaving is the best place to start, it shaped the way people think about, and even conduct, ritual abuse investigations in the US more than any other case.   After the entire mainstream media began to say it was a witch hunt and the allegations were just kids saying things because they were tricked by experts, it shaped public opinion until today.
           </p>
           <p>
            The main fact used to debunk all the kids and physical evidence was that tunnels, mentioned by all the victims, did not exist.   Except they did, absolutely, exist:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://whale.to/b/stickel.html">
             http://whale.to/b/stickel.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So when you run up against older Americans who simply refuse to believe anything like this, the media coverage of the McMartin case and the incredible amount of literature and other media generated in its aftermath is the major reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, notice that this proof beyond any reasonable doubt tunnels did exist, discovered and reported many years ago, has not been reflected in recent literature.   So you can add that to the pile of evidence suggesting very powerful people are not interested in the facts, like Megyn Kelly.
           </p>
           <p>
            See, not even off topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just search McMartin case and you can see it's still used as an example of ritual abuse being something only religious fanatics think exists.

              You're welcome.  I found it linked at Last American Vagabond.  I don't think younger people can possibly grasp how much this changed everything in the US because you did not live through the media storm.

               riveting description.  I remember the case and thought I followed it.  I was in my 20's at the time. I don't think I remember the satanic abuse details.  And OMG - when digging to find the tunnels they found a plate with a couple of pentagrams on it that were drawn by hand...by an adult.  And the cauldrons...wtf. I wish I could UN-see that in my minds eye.  Thank you for this post!

               Yeah, I'm sub 40 myself and not even American so I didn't know that story, however I perfectly understand what you mean. I witnessed a similar case happening in my country. The official story:
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreau_trial">
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreau_trial
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               At the time, despite being already very aware of the existence of large pedo rings protected by the medias/politicians/etc., I didn't pay much attention to it, I was assuming that if the media were all screaming "fake!" on this particular story, then it was surely fake.
              </p>
              <p>
               I realized only years later that the whole thing was actually a massive psy-op which completely shaped the perception of the public, the media, the police and the justice towards pedophile rings. Mission accomplished.
              </p>
              <p>
               Needless to say, the craziest thing is that it was obviously a real pedophile ring, with real victims, murders, "mysterious powerful people wearing masks", etc., but now when a similar case breaks out, the pavlovian reaction from the media and, sadly, the public is to yell "remember Outreau!" and "the children must be lying!".

                McMartin was, in terms of media coverage, close to the OJ trial.  As for importance with regards to changing public perception, it was infinitely bigger than the OJ case.  At the beginning people believed the children and wanted convictions.  After it was over, people wanted to charge the very young victims, their parents, expert witnesses, everyone in favor of prosecution basically, with crimes for bringing it up.  After McMartin, people were scared to even suggest ritual abuse allegations could be true.
               </p>
               <p>
                And then, six years later in 1990, the dig proved the key element of the case missing previously.  And somehow, nobody noticed or cared.
               </p>
               <p>
                I did not know this dig had been conducted and found the tunnels until Pizzagate.  I have read quite a few people online  in the last couple weeks using McMartin to say Pizzagate is ridiculous.
               </p>
               <p>
                Two years ago, CBS article, nothing about tunnels:

               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                "Developed", thanks to a media lynch mob condemning children based on false analysis of the case.  The question is, false on purpose?  I could link hundreds or thousands of articles just like this, and books.

            It must be nice to be an average pizza store owner and get an interview on FOX when someone is picking on you! I'm sure all the Christian business owners sued by the LGBT mafia would've liked the same courtesy.

            What's funny is Alex Jones just covered a quote about Hillary Clinton where the media has been taking something out of context regarding him blaming her for "chopping up babies" (where the quote IN CONTEXT is actually about her support of Saudi Arabia which kills women and children), and Megyn Kelly quoted the exact same excerpt. That shows that Kelly gets her talking points from the same central Press Klux Klanquarters.

            Pointing a finger and saying, "Fake!" is not journalism. Nowhere does she say how the claims are discredited. This was either lazy as hell or deliberately orchestrated, and it feels like the latter.

            The 'shooter' must have been about 15 feet tall for the computer on the floor to be hit by a ((magic?) bullet (theory)) that hit the lock about 4 feet up and was fired from a handgun/rifle/shotgun which was pointed at an employee... er, the ground... er, the ceiling. This is classic. It should be completely evident to those in the know that the only reason why the MSM is covering this is because
            <strong>
             <em>
              they are forced.

            My main message to you all would be that it is fine to believe and say this but
            <strong>
             leave it
            </strong>
            at 'something is shady' until you have the proportional amount of evidence to make the very heavy and serous claim of pedophilia.  Can we all agree that we do not condone the death threats that alefantis, and I'm sure others, are getting daily?  And I understand that you are not responsible for the death threats and for that guy going into the pizzeria with a gun, but that guy was online reading what everyone was writing and basing his actions off of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look through this thread and ask yourself if it sounds like people are simply suspicious of alefantis and haven't made up their mind or do people seem sure of themselves?  And what is this based on? Do you really believe you've made the appropriate accusation based on the appropriate evidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I have been asking pizzagate people is this (
            <strong>
             and it's important so think about it!
            </strong>
            ): Is pizzagate falsifiable? What evidence could be shown that could exonerate those being insinuated as pedophiles?

             Of course it is falsifiable. All they needed to do was to explain all the evidence, and how come it was ALL just a coincidence, and how it had been wrongly interpreted. So far, Alefantis explained a couple of the instagram pictures and that's it. But when you look at ALL the connections and events and organisations and places and people that ALL happen to relate to child trafficking or paedophilia in some way, it becomes a statistical improbability that is pretty much indistinguishable from impossibility that these connections all relate to paedophilia only by chance and coincidence, and not because they are actually all connected through paedophilic activity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't you recognise that if these people had come out and addressed the concerns, and given a reasonable, coherent and innocent explanation for everything, then this investigation wouldn't have gone further, that it would have died down? There can only be one reason why no such explanation has been offered, and that's because there isn't one.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're being incredibly blind and suffering from massive cognitive dissonance. Which is understandable, because it's so horrific. I wonder if you have really looked at all the evidence that's been found, or if you've just scraped the surface with Comet ping pong and the instagram pictures. Those things are really not much compared to what else has been discovered. I suggest you go check it out, because you'll feel really awful and guilty in the end, about trying to defend these people when you hadn't really looked into it properly.

               Yeah some of the pictures could have innocent explanations and he could explain them away perhaps. He explains one picture there, but can you not see how it becomes harder and harder to give a plausible explanation for more and more pictures and comments? How many people have so many dubious photos and comments on their instagram, AS WELL as having weird emails between them and some of the most powerful people in the country, AS WELL as having two restaurants on a street of places that have paedophile symbols in their logos, AS WELL as one of your restaurants having a paedophile related name, and on and on it goes with more and more things that an innocent explanation has to be found for, and really to be plausible you need a single explanation or two that explains ALL of these things. And the only explanation there is at the moment is the paedophile ring/child trafficking operation explanation. They haven't offered another one. Giving an innocent explanation for one photograph out of ALL the other things is nowhere near enough.  And Alefantis and his instagram isn't even the most important stuff, that's just the stuff people happened upon at the beginning, if I understand the timeline correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
               You are the one who is ignoring all of the other things that have been found, you're ignoring how insanely unlikely it is for all of these links to paedophilia and child trafficking to just be coincidence and actually nothing to do with child trafficking or paedophilia. Look through all the evidence, forget about the pictures if you really believe they are innocent. Enter the investigation from a different place. I think you are either incredibly naive, haven't actually read through what people have discovered beyond the instagram stuff, or you're actually part of the effort to shut this down to protect those involved. Either way, you are not making good arguments, at all.

                Let me focus on Alefantis. The claim is that Alefantis is a pedophile who is apart of child sex trafficking ring.   In order for this to be true the very basic facts would have to be that
                <strong>
                 Alefantis has a sexual attraction to minors and has acted on that attraction
                </strong>
                .  Also my main point would be
                <strong>
                 what is the minimum amount of certainty you would need to accuse that person publicly of pedophilia and child abuse
                </strong>
                ?
               </p>
               <p>
                I think that it should be obvious enough that you can not prove that someone is
                <em>
                 not
                </em>
                a pedophile, since that's something that exists only in someone's mind.  You could technically make a case for anyone being a pedophile.  Someone could investigate you and note all the things that may signify that you might be a pedophile.  They could see that you seem to love Disney movies and frequently go to Disneyland, a place mainly for children.  Maybe they would notice that you are particular close to one of your younger cousins.  Maybe you have liked a few photos on facebook with young family members in swimsuits.  The case could be made for anyone, but for nearly every single person it would not be true and wouldn't be convincing either.  But there is nothing that you could show that would prove definitively, with no doubt, that you do not have a sexual attraction to minors.  So when is it appropriate to say that someone is a pedophile and a child abuser?

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 and on and on it goes with more and more things that an innocent explanation has to be found for, and really to be plausible you need a single explanation or two that explains ALL of these things

               </blockquote>
               <p>
                I agree generally with the method you say you're using, which is that enough coincidences can make something that is not the simplest explanation for one occurrence very likely given many coincidences.  Like if someone were to walk out with something in their pocket when they left the store and when they were caught they said it was a mistake, that would be very believable.  But if they continuously did it multiple times a month it would become very difficult to believe that each time there was a simple explanation that was not theft.  You could not come up with an explanation for each indivudual occurrence and have it be believable.  The most likely explanation would be theft, the individual explanations for each time would be very unlikely, and in the middle probability-wise would be something that ties all the events together like maybe dementia which would be unlikely but not unthinkable.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I would say that these things you mentioned are not coincidences relating to pedophilia.  [Although you and almost every pizzagater I've ever talked to has said that the instagram stuff is not the main evidence, the only evidence I've ever heard them bring up is that (also you list it first in the coincidences against him) so I'm going to talk about that.]  Here is the evidence related to the question:
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Does Alefantis have a sexual attraction to minors?:
                </strong>
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 Instagram profile picture is of antinous
                </li>
                <li>
                 "#Hotard"
                </li>
                <li>
                 "#Chickenlovers"
                </li>
                <li>
                 Photo of a child taped to a table
                </li>
                <li>
                 Restuarant he owns has pedophile slang in its name
                </li>
                <li>
                 Photo of baby chewing on money
                </li>
                <li>
                 Some pictures of children generally on his instagram
                </li>
                <li>
                 Mural of decapitated children? ← I’ve never seen proof ,and I’m skeptical, that this painting was ever actually in Comet but I’ll give you that one
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                The rest of the evidence isn’t directly related to Alefantis but I think still counts for something, possibly testament to his character:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 Some of the people who have commented on his intagram photos have posted sexual references to pizza and generally sexually subversive pictures
                </li>
                <li>
                 A singer at comet ping pong made a joke involving pedophilia
                </li>
                <li>
                 Three doors down from Comet is a pizzeria with a known pedophillia symbol in its logo shape ( I won’t include the other logo because that is ridiculous)
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                I was generous with the first list since the last three are only tangentially related to sexual attraction to minors.  And the other evidence I’ve seen mentioned is not related to the question “is alefantis a pedophile? “.  Also I forgot the second part of the question “Has he acted on that attraction?”. Here’s the evidence for that:
               </p>
               <p>
                NOTHING. NO accusations from victims, NO witness accusations, NO accusations from a second hand witness, NO accusations or evidence whatsoever.  Absolutely nothing.
               </p>
               <p>
                And that’s actually important to note because although it’s repulsive to any normal person
                <em>
                 it is not a crime to be sexually attracted to minors
                </em>
                .   When that woman overheard Jared Fogle talking about how he was sexually attracted to children he wasn’t immediately arrested, there was a very long investigation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now looking at the evidence for “is alefantis a pedophile” you’ll see that these are not instances of the same thing like the shoplifting example.  Only if these things are all connected could they all be explained by one thing: pedophilia.  But if he is a normal person then these things are not connected like my example of investigating you and making a case, those things aren’t connected unless you are a pedophile.
               </p>
               <p>
                IF he had multiple pictures of children taped to a table he could not say every time it was his goddaughter and sister playing, that would be odd there would need to be more explanation.  IF he consistently posted children in sexually provocative photos and made sexually provocative comments about children,
                <em>
                 that
                </em>
                would need an explanation. But does he?  I don’t know how old his instragram profile is but from the posts I’ve seen it is at least
                <strong>
                 4 years
                </strong>
                old and has
                <strong>
                 nearly 800 posts
                </strong>
                !   There are maybe 5 or 6 pictures that have been cited as questionable. If in one of those posts he explicitly stated he was a pedophile that would be enough. Or had a picture that was definitively cp that would be enough.  But that’s not what is there you just have to be honest with yourself and look at them individually and ask what is the likelihood that this was meant in a sexual way? And then look at them altogether as posts across many years and ask does it add up to proof.
               </p>
               <p>
                Let me offer what I think the most mundane/likely explanations are for the evidence:
               </p>
               <p>
                Antinous: Alefantis is gay, antinous is known as a “gay icon” according to the wiki page cited
               </p>
               <p>
                Hotard: The guy says hotard when he is already talking about alefantis and not the baby so he is probably talking about alefantis, then alefantis says it probably back at him. If they are referring to the baby then they are probably just assholes who don’t know where to draw the line. There are actually many plausible possibilities for this one that I've talked about before.
               </p>
               <p>
                Chickenlovers: The child might be eating chicken/likes chicken like most kids do.  Also chicken lover is an extremely easy phrase to put together without talking about pedophillia just google it and you’ll see. Also instagram chicken lover and look at how many results there are with kids.
               </p>
               <p>
                Photo of child taped:  His explanation is what most people assumed which is that it was a playful/jokey situation.  The girl is smiling and it is not shot in a sexual way.
               </p>
               <p>
                Restaurant has pedophile slang: It is a themed restaurant and the slang term is also a very common name that would fit the theme.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pictures of children generally: He is a middle aged man with friends who have children and he owns a restaurant which kids go to.
               </p>
               <p>
                Baby chewing on money: ? I was never sure why this one was important. Its just a baby and money.
               </p>
               <p>
                I never got to my last question which is “ what is the minimum amount of certainty you would need to accuse that person publicly of pedophilia and child abuse?” but you know how serious the accusation is and you have a certain responsibility when speaking publicly to not throw around the accusation because there are consequences as we’ve seen with the death threats and the gunman.
               </p>
               <p>
                Prove it to me: Can you show that alefantis is attracted to minors?  Then can you show that he has acted on it? Then can you show he is a part of a ring? Dont be fooled by the amount of evidence! That is a CLASSIC hallmark of conspiracy theories.  You need to be able to answer for specific claims.

                 I found your comment! Sorry I missed it before. It's a very good comment so I'm glad you told me about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do see your point, and there is no conclusive evidence/hard proof that Alefantis is attracted to minors or has engaged in any sexual activity with children. It annoys me that everyone talks about this evidence a well, I think it's because it was the first stuff that was really found and so it's been memed and infographiced and everyone knows it inside out by now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think your mistake though happens right at the beginning. You decide to focus on Alefantis and whether he is an active pedophile or not. But that's not the question. The question is: Is there a pedophile and/or child trafficking ring operating within and among the political elite in Washington DC/ the US?
                </p>
                <p>
                 So yes you can focus on Alefantis and go through everything and explain how it's innocent and how he's not a pedophile. But then there's everything else, all the people that are connected to him, to the Podestas, the emails between them, the continuing friendships with several known and convicted pedophiles, the connection with Haiti and the woman arrested for kidnapping 33 kids, who Hillary helped get released, the mine there that Hillary's brother owns, and that researcher Monica Peterson had said she thought was involved in human trafficking, shortly before she mysteriously died. There's the Clinton Foundation UK being registered to an address in London that convicted pedophile MP and accused pedophile Lord (did not go to trial due to him claiming dementia, but there were victims and witnesses) also have companies registered at. There's the fact that the Democrats have been in power in Hawaii for decades, and a building there owned by a trust that has Dem appointed trustees had drawn suspicion due to wifi signals coming from underground, plus off grid power lines apparently feeding an underground space, and where a business owned by a man is registered, that man being suspected of selling child porn through hard drives on eBay, who also happened to be linked with one of Hillary's staff and Comet pingpong. The discovery of the wifi signals and the suspicion of the man selling child porn happened months ago, and was not at all related to the Podesta emails, pizzagate, or any of that. It was later when looking into emails that the name of the man who owned the business in Hawaii popped up, and that building was discovered separately. Thens someone found the post on reddit from someone else who had posted way back about their concerns about how dodgy this place seemed. It's stuff like that which is not a case of people gathering up facts that suit their narrative. Completely independently, and apart in time, people came to similar conclusions through completely different routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, the pedophile symbols and the restaurant names. So Comet and Ping Pong are apparently sexually suggestive, but Buck's Fishing and Camping are apparently even more related to pedophilia, given that 'Buck' is a name for pedophiles, specifically older men who like young boys, and that camping is a known activity that pedophiles will do with kids as an excuse to prey on them. These facts were discovered in a documentary from the 90s about pedophiles.

                <p>
                 The logos - Besta pizza had the triangle spiral logo, and the restaurant across the street had the heart within a heart logo (on their menu underneath a picture of Hillary Clinton with the restaurant owners). The ping pong logo thing was clearly not at all like the one on the FBI list, but those two others look like the pedo symbols for sure.

                 I can't prove to you that Alefantis is attracted to minors, in fact, even if he's not at all attracted to minors, it makes no difference, because that isn't the question. If you ask me whether there's a pedophile ring operation among the political elite in DC then I would tell you to read through most of the stuff here, to read about the prevalence of this kind of operation among the political elites in countries the world over, and I would say that I know it's not definitive cast iron hard forensic DNA on the murder weapon caught in the act evidence, but it definitely screams out for someone with the experience, knowledge and resources to go get that cast iron evidence, because the statistical probability of it being there to be found is sky high.

                  Ok, great back and forth.  As I have said my main point has been that we should be careful about the accusations we make seeing as how this is done completely in the open.  After having read you talk a bit I think/hope I am preaching to the choir.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I felt focusing in on one claim was important because with these things the scope becomes so large that you may become caught up in the
                  <em>
                   amount
                  </em>
                  of evidence and forget that you are making many, many smaller claims and how much evidence do those things actually have?  If you do not know whether the larger overarching claim is true should you be making more specific claims about a person based on it?  Especially considering the accusation being made.  Again, maybe I'm talking to someone who already believes this.

               If the presstitutes -- and Alefantis -- were trying to get the truth out, they would deal with the evidence directly, instead of using straw men.

               <em>
                An argument has not been defeated until it has been refuted in its strongest form.
               </em>
               And that is plainly what Big Media is very, VERY energetically NOT doing.  So
               <em>
                you
               </em>
               need to ask
               <em>
                yourself
               </em>
               why that would be.  Megyn's tears are obviously fake, or she would address the
               <em>
                strongest
               </em>
               form of our "argument".

              <p>
               Every time they avoid the meat and focus on the parsley and the wilted lettuce AGAIN, it wakes more people up.  It's annoying to watch the fakery, but the red-pilling is, on net, a gain.

            It was a sad night to see the last bastion fall today with Fox pretty much falling in line with the rest. Even though I fully expected it, I am still sad for my country. One of the things we always could say is that there was always 2 sides to the story in the media.
            <br/>
            Saying this though, I won't give up. We are the new and unrealized majority. This is the last gasp of a dying entity. Let them shill. They have nothing left. We have won and they can't even see it.

            Hey, a message to investigative journalists...c'mon now. NOW IS THE TIME. Speak up, I know some are reading. I tell you this, I'm noting everyone and every network hiding it. I'll dump cable. The reporters that are hiding this, it will be remembered. You can go do the news in Turkey, or Iran...you know, the countries you love more than America, she and her people have HAD IT with the veil of secrecy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Journalists afraid, WHAT KINDA AMERICANS ARE YOU???? (Sorry for the small outburst, but this has grown beyond ridiculous)

            I like how it showed him in the kitchen slinging hash, as if he takes his greasy apron off and then skips off to cocktail parties with the D.C. power elite. Just a simple pizza man. With no basement.

            Just shows fox news is just one side of the same coin. They dont have the public's best interests at heart, they are just the only people not spinning the truth at the moment. Sacks of shit.

             This is spot on. As a lefty, I always hated FOX. During this election season, FOX was the best of the MSM. They had some very good pieces about the email scandal and played it fairly neutral after the establishment republicans dropped out. They are playing the game of appeasing their fans while shilling for the establishment. I think they found a decent balance to keep it believable to the dummies.

            You know, I've never been 100% sure about Alefantis' involvement in Pizzagate, so I watched with an open mind; but his behavior in this interview actually doesn't make him seem more innocent to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            What really gets me with interviews like this is how
            <strong>
             nobody acknowledges any reasonable suspicion about the evidence
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Like, sure. Maaaaayyybe someone would thoughtlessly upload a picture of a kid taped to a floor in some weird, playful context ("you had to be there"), but surely in retrospect, you can tell that this looks pretty damn sinister. There's no way you can just write it off as innocent, and dismiss concerns as total foolishness.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm saying, if I were innocent, the first thing I'd say is, "I can totally see why this looks weird, and now I regret posting it. The reason this happened is X, X and Y".
           </p>
           <p>
            Come to think of it, there's been a bizarre lack of transparency from Alefantis. If I were caught up in something like this, I would be answering the big questions, fast. I wouldn't be asking Fox News to bring their cameras to my restaurant; I'd use my own damn cameras and show the Internet I have nothing to hide.
           </p>

            Alefantis needs some acting lessons, this was terrible as was Kelly. He certainly doesn't come across as very articulate or intelligent, just a run of the mill pedophile pimp for the C.I.A. And all those houses he has near to Langley? Not a smart man though, struggling to find his well rehearsed words. Hell, maybe they filmed this on Monday, and it was so bad they needed to rehearse and film again. Actually funny if it wasn't so pathetic.

            start watching @ 1:05 into the video. Megyn makes a statement clarifying that he is a democrat and nothing is illegal about that, and that does not make you a pedo connected to a child sex traffic ring"  LOOK AT HIS BODY. He contorts and swallows hard. GUILTY according to his tell. His body language convicts him.

            They're all spiritcookers, including Kelly, I'm sure.  I understand that in govt., sports, media, celebrities, music, actors...everything -- in order to move up the ranks in fame and fortune, there are prices that need to be paid first.  Each time, you agree to sell a little more of your soul, or you stagnate ----- or they soft kill or hard kill you.  Soft kill is where they ruin your life, gang stalk you, end your career, end your relationships, take all your money, keep you mired in bogus lawsuits, make sure you can never work again, etc. Hard kill speaks for itself.

            Let corrupt journalists and tv personalities lie and cover up the affair. The more do the better. They are effectively committing career suicide. When the scandal breaks, they'll will all fall together.

            Their constant underestimating of the American people is the exact reason why we're ultimately going to win.

            did you see how disgusting the place looked? paint peeling off walls,everywhere, etc. almost like murals were recently taken off....and if he let the cameras in there, where's the shots of the horrible wall paintings by pedo-artists that I've seen in photos so often? I didn't see a single one....did anyone catch any art in cpp?

             Two things:
            </p>
            <p>
             (a) some of those pieces were never in CPP, and 
(b) those which were in CPP may have been painted over by now
            </p>
            <p>
             On (a), it's important to note that the infamous vulgar alien/masturbating man graffiti was not in CPP.  It was a photo Alefantis (or someone) took in another location.  It's also important to note that a lot of other art has been
             <em>
              linked
             </em>
             to Alefantis, but also was never in CPP.  People see stuff and make assumptions, and rumors start going around.

             We need to develop better ways of self-policing our info intake/outflow, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  The Mockingbird media is dishonest and cannot perform a truth-detector function for a free people, but somehow we do need to come up with something better than random postings by anonymous people.  (I'm all for random anon postings, mind you... just not without some kind of
             <strong>

            The only psych book written about these types is PEOPLE OF THE LIE. They always lie and work in groups. Every way is to prey on anything and destroy and take. The book gives necessary insight to counter back and investigate.

              Yes, same author of Road Less Travelled. He tried to get the EVIL label.in the psych DSM manual, as a BY conscious choice mental deranged, dangerous and criminal disorder.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look up the history of psychology and who is on psych boards and the DSM manual board; so many of them raised u healthy families, such as one enabled his son to torture animals as a youth; that then murdered his wife. Of course, cover-up, lies and excuses and he got away with murder.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are many surviving families that never got justice in violent crimes or cps. Would add a lot more population numbers to this cause, and inside perspectives that media never shows the public; nor the govt.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is, alot have had their American dream.destroyed and are left broken, often intimidated, as completely failed by the govt.
             </p>
             <p>
              So many voices unheard in America and elsewhere. Yet, ones able, have blogs, comments, court cases, complaints, foil requests to all types of govt entities,/ programs; all over the web or access Foil via mail or in person at govt programs/ entities and court/ city town halls.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's all a rat maze, costly and time consuming as kicked around. Ethical quality is not the trait that is hired in general. Rare to find one, as systemic habit is major organizational psychology failure.
             </p>
             <p>
              More info and resesrch by govt funded npos and universities; under the subjects of Organizational Psychology , Risk Assessment, welfare, public health law, Quality Control and more. A whole language of phrases and acronyms.

            They're all spiritcookers, including Kelly, I'm sure.  I understand that in govt., sports, media, celebrities, music, actors...everything -- in order to move up the ranks in fame and fortune, there are prices that need to be paid first.  Each time, you agree to sell a little more of your soul, or you stagnate ----- or they soft kill or hard kill you.  Soft kill is where they ruin your life, gang stalk you, end your career, end your relationships, take all your money, keep you mired in bogus lawsuits, make sure you can never work again, etc. Hard kill speaks for itself.

            James Alefantis comes off like so many other insider elite. Fake, arrogant, and weird. Almost polished, but I've seen it too many times and recognize it for what it is. Same delivery as so many other phony pundits who come on to dis-inform.

             Several DC policemen in here:

            <p>
             Using them as a trustworthy authority was one more major "tell".  We cannot blindly rely on police.  Too many of them are compromised.  Also, if MK really thought the DC police did such a good job of getting to the truth, where is their report explaining all of this?  She had a golden opportunity to pass along good info, but chose not to.  One must ask WHY.

            We do not even know from the pics who Caris James is, who the parents are. It is one of the major questions to ask: Where is #CarisJames. We should post this everywhere:

             Yes..where are parents and evidence the baby even alive,? I don't care what Aleftitus said, child safety is not about the adult being wined and dined, but the CHILD's well-being.
            </p>

             Legally, it is a cps case, since it's been reported many times. It does not matter if cps is violating law and not investigating each report. Legal fact, since reported, is a cps case. Media freaking knows the law, but expect public to NOT know or question the glaring fact that cps has not confirmed that any childrenposted are alive and safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's OK to label a baby Hotard on public that for rest of life is bullied? ( If alive) A rated xxx demeaning name on infant is OK with these folks!!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Even a child at school calling another child, Hotard would be in trouble? Are we supposed to be treated THIS stupid by the media, and called false as they are as false and legal fraud in all of this?

               I can't remember where I read it, but someone looked up her linkedin and they have relocated a state in the Pacific Northwest. I know the state and city but I don't want to say it because I think they were innocent in all this.

                I am not so sure if innocent. I followed their trail a bit, and I think it was Portland. If I recall, she seemed to connect to a shady restaurant/bar that had similar themes and connections, with more heavy pedo symbology. I dug a bit and saw the same kinds of things and then got back to the east coast. They also had some incriminating participation in the instagrams. I still don't know how we know #CarisJames referenced their child...and if so, if their child is still around and with them.

            The important part of that interview was that he didn't come off remotely shook up by the incident, he could have been reading a script about hand soap.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I ever thought there could be a chance it wasn't a false flag I don't now, if somebody ever really pulled a gun on that dude he'd not only shit his pants but be covered in sweat anytime he thought about it.

            His guilt is tangible. Honestly this interview makes him look pretty bad to law enforcement, let alone parents who have learned how to tell when their being lied to because lol kids.

            So now we know (as if we didn't before), that she and FOX are in on the cover up. I think the FOX execs and faux journalists should not be overlooked to see what alliances caused what decisions to be made.

            That's okay. They are forced to start taking on interviews. This is a sign that we matter. They tried to ignore us. They can't anymore. So now they are attacking us. All this will do is get #PizzaGate more publicity, and when people really learn about the facts, they'll trust the mainstream media even less. I expected this type of interview 100%, and it makes me wonder why the Fox News decision makers are trying to cover this up. I think #PizzaGate needs to do a better job of finding the Republicans that are likely involved in this as well.

              He's got "the look" if anything else. And while I ADORE Kentucky, he's not indicative of the folks I had pleasure to meet. He looks like someone most would stay away from. Probably grew up hearing "That boy, he just aint right yall" He looks like the holler pedo.

            The MSM will NEVER support this investigation. If victims come forward they will attack and discredit the victims just like the franklin cover up. Stop waiting for the media to acknowledge this it will never happen.

            Only thing I can think of is Fox is a fake news channel.......like the fake Republican Party.......they just give  us the illusion of being more right wing.  Because its easy to give us a little conservative talk but when it comes down to really important stuff....they just get in line and tell the lies.  We need some powerful true conservative to start a fucking national news channel  And not a Jew.......

             Oh dear Lord, anyone watch body language and can tell when people lie? Whenever he looks up...that indicates he's lying. He is "searching" for what to say. He blinks a lot. However, he's a nutcase, because I can see he believes what he says as well. He's lying about the gun...it wasn't an assault rifle.
            </p>
            <p>
             Watch how he looks to the side too, also an indication he's lying. I've studied this quite a bit, detectives, profilers...the information I'm talking about all comes from their studies. He's lying, LIARS, Thieves and people hurting defenseless people are scum. He is SCUM. This makes the drive even harder, my resolve is stronger. Thanks for posting that youtube vid..that small interview tells me plenty about this man.

               After speaking to a couple county officers, they've told me that any detective will tell you that if he were pressed, he'd break like a dam. They're trained to see those tell tale signs of lies too, in cases of domestic violence it became imperative to learn body language cues. One I'll quote "He is lying like a rug!" His segment was short, but not short enough to hide any of those indicators. Those are the easy ones to detect.

             It's sort of like he has a smirk on his face the whole time and his Instagram is creepy.  Megyn Kelly is fake news.

             Need to thumbsdown once it hits on the actual FOX youtube channel. Do not let this shit get posted without the true facts. Fuck Alefantis and Megyn Kelly. Alex Jones? So odd they are pinning it on him.

              I feel like he's playing an intentional role, here.  He is an actor.  His role could be the underdog Internet hero, getting everyone to rally around him as the free speech martyr-in-the-making, as Alefantis is the establishment untouchable golden boy with the smirk.

              Revealed in InfoWars yesterday; a secret court case is being prepared blaming InfoWars for "inciting insurrection". Whether they win or lose he case while in court they'll try to have InfoWars pulled from the airways until the court case is heard

            I love how every MSM "debunk" conveniently leaves out 99% of the reason why people are looking into him in the first place. If he and his buddies didn't go out of their way to stick pedophilic and disturbing imagery in every place they possibly could,  they wouldn't have much to worry about.

            It is intersting to see how the MSM is framing it.  I know Pizzagate well, I've seen the evidence.  I still can't say I'm certain one way or the other about anyhing.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I can say, though, is that the media is absolutely lying about what's been uncovered.  They are absolutely, unequivocally, misrepresenting  us.  They build up these colorful straw man then just set them on fire and piss all over us and make us seem like we're insane.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trouble is, I know I'm not crazy.  I'm just a normal, very well educated dude with a family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watching the MSM behave this way,, more than anything else I've seen, is the scariest thing about Pizzagate so far....and THAT is saying something.

             The MSM carries water for these disgusting people.  Just like they defended Clinton and did nothing but attack Trump the entire campaign (not making this political that is just an example)show how partisan they are and where their allegiances are.

             Seconded. Well educated person, here, with a degree or two and loving family... Something is up. The best way I can articulate it is... okay... maybe somehow all of this is a coincidence. Fine. But we are NOT crazy for seeing some patterns. They've been uncovering SO many people with famous and public lives that have been doing this for YEARS. It's like a new huge pedo ring every day. How do people not even care if this is a possibility? That, I think, disturbs me the most...

             The media and their OTT defence of PizzaGate is extremely bizarre and proves we are onto something very big. Certainly much bigger than just CPP
            </p>
            <p>
             Several bloggers have reported massive DDOS attacks, hack attempts, threats, etc. Where's all the money coming from for such a concerted online attack on PG investigators???? They'd never do this about any other subject except 9/11.

             Couldnt agree more im in the same boat, university educated, gamefully employed not some paranoid loner.  For a long time ive been aware that a small group of self intetested people have been shaping the world socially and economicallly to suit their agendas but i never subscribed to the idea of an organised new world order i always thought that was a bit paranoid and that if it seemed like it was the case it was probably because a lot of the time elite interests overlap.
            </p>
            <p>
             After seeing this im not so sure.  Ive been keeping my eye on this for over a month now and the actions of the media coupled with the massive amount of connections investigated  between the elites and the clintons have made this all seem like im watching the nwo operate in real time.    Symbols disappearing from websites, websites taken down, twitter censored, facebook censored, reddit censored etc. its not just mainstream news that are whitewashing this.

              Ha. We are all in this together, so it sometimes help to laugh...often at ourselves. We need to do an all-out outreach effort to bring more people into the fold. I launched a Twitter campaign yesterday, new to me as I had not tweeted in over four years, and it seemed to be very successful. I did what I could as I have almost no following (hitting tending posts and tags, hitting some key media accounts, including Megyn Kelly due to the interview, etc.). I could see the response. It drove traffic and signups here last night and this morning...but it was limited since my Twitter skills are limited, I am one person, and I am not in the Twitterverse. We need to really explode this. The idea is simple. Just go on all platforms (Twitter, FB, YouTube comments, anywhere you can post) and post this (or something similar; the key is the #SaveTheKids hashtag and link to VOAT, dodging the use of the censored "pizzagate" verbiage):

                The problem is when arguing with the blue pilled, is that you can spit out 10 document facts in an argument, and 1 slightly off detail, and the whole narrative will shift to the minor inaccuracy.

                 Youre right and its much nicer to be corrected anonymously online than in a room full of people so thanks again.

                 On that point though isnt it a blessing that james alefantis is such a fucking clown that he decided to post those creepy pictures.  Its hard for people to argue with you when you're holding a picture of a toddler taped to table in their face.

                  I'll be honest, the photo of the little girl taped to the table would never have turned my head, if it weren't for the other IG pics.  In fact, most of them, as stand alone, wouldn't be all that bad.  Or all that bad without the comments.  Context is everything.

                   None taken.  Again youre right on its on own it wouldnt be that bad but there is plenty of context and ive found when atop my soapbox that people are most responsive to that picture in particular so i tend to use that as one of my go to arguments.  My redpilling attempts go as follows: 1. Brief explanation of how pizzagate started 2. Show alefantis IG pics (emphasis on aforementioned) 3. Show the wikileaks email about the 3 kids in the pool.  4. (And most importantly because it shows confidence and certainty ) urge the person to read about it for themselves.  Works a treat!

             I wish more people on here would speak like this.  There is a reason that Alefantis and everyone being accused in this thing are getting death threats every day and it is because of the irresponsible way people are throwing around the pedophilia accusation.  Did you hear that audio of David Brock tearing up? There wasn't much sympathy for him on here and the way people are talking about alefantis in this and other threads is not living up to the pizzagate mantra that you're simply asking for there to be an investigation.  The pedophilia claim is thrown around wildly with no care for the weight of the accusation despite professing continuously to care about it deeply.
Pizzagate is a witch hunt don't be part of the problem.

              There's a kernel of truth in what you said: as always, caution is advised in forming conclusions, and any conclusion not directly resting on absolutely incontrovertible evidence should be revisited whenever a new idea is raised.  But your closing sentence went too far.

             The best evidence of the truth is behavior. Behavior is THE TELL when truth is in question. When you see someone like Megyn Kelly, who is a very capable interviewer, conduct that kind of soft-pedal interview about such a serious matter, that says a lot. When you see the media do a full-court press against a story involving hurting kids, actively misrepresenting what pizzagate is about and our findings, that is telling you where their interests lie. It reinforces the actual truth that this pedo thing involves people in high power and the media itself. When you witness first hand a false flag event, something you have heard about and always dismissed, involving a gunman...after you have seen them move the cameras pointing at CPP just prior to the event and you see them post the actual news stories online before the event has started, all of which is documented, any doubt is removed. When you observe CTR shills hitting this site hard, even downvoting an effort to spread the hashtag #SaveTheKids, you know they want this to remain hidden. I am well-educated and not a conspiracy person, but a friend asked me to look into this. If you investigate, what you find is horrible and incredibly hard to swallow. The evidence is broad and deep. And the behavior of those in the middle of all of this is some of the strongest proof if you are having trouble accepting the massive amount of evidence that we have found. This is going on...at the highest levels of society and government, throughout the world.

              Clearly dont want to let lid blow off on this because of its massive ramifications although anyone who has truly researched this matter realizes that this goes much deeper than alefantis' CPP or the podestas. This could lead to the outing and ultimately the undoing of a malignant blight on many of those affected directly or indirectly by such needless cruelties. This needs to fully understood by many citizen journalist in order that our children can be safe from these practices, and that this will not be tolerated to continue.

              Great comment. The term conspiracy theorist never had a negative connotation (it is a neutral descriptive). But the CIA weaponised it in 1967 - proven by documents released under FOIA - to attack and silence anyone who questioned JFKs death. The idea is to create a culture where we always believe that every negative outcome is either COINCIDENCE or INCOMPETENCE and never entertain a notion that it is CONSPIRACY. In fact they want to create an environment where questioning the official version of any event is 'tinfoil hat', and this is now a reflex response to any suggestion that powerful people have committing crimes. I wrote about it on my blog

               See:  Operation Mockingbird — scroll down to “History” — which was being written two years before the end of WWII.
See:  Operation Paperclip — Wiki’s figures are low — at the minimum 64,000+ which included families but more likely 200,000 according to Kay Griggs/YouTube.
See:  Operation Gladio — US program to keep right wing governments in place in the countries over which they had control after WWII — Germany, Japan, Italy.  In Italy, US actually resurrected the Mafia in order to ensure the plan would be carried out.

                I don't even know why she's still on the air. Nothing but an attention whore shit talking Trump on the one TV news channel I think has a shred of decency. Probably can't fire her at this point in fear of it being labelled a sexist move.

             Along with the irresponsible, Russian hacking propaganda.. "Putin did it!", "We will retaliate!" - its all a bunch of bullshit and they are doing nothing but planting the seeds to cover up the "big one" that could be released. Setting the stage if you will.. fuck everyone involved. I hope someone out there with intimate knowledge steps up and does the right thing; despite the massive risk. Time for real Martyrs.

              Right they invented "fake news" in an attempt to cover up the whole thing. Ain't none of them gonna actually say anything about it on the air. This is the stuff people die over. It seems even Alex Jones is too scared to take it on, now.

              That's fair enough.  Just another theory though, until someone important takes up the cause.

            Man, I have never seen such softball questions ever. I just don't know a solution for this unless VIDEOS of the act comes out or children involved are found and points them out. That's what needs to happen. I agree with all the investigation stuff but reality is we need a smoking gun. PERIOD

             Most interesting she showed the empty room but blurred out "killroom" and "murder" in the comments.  So covering up the critical inculpatory facts was actually literally done and visible on the screen.

            <p>
             You should watch it.  She did mention the evidence if only briefly and with intent to mislead her audience.

             I should be reading before I post, you noted it as well. No wonder his segment was so short. Nobody seemed to coach him on it, and boy am I glad. We aren't a nation of dolts...they gave us Internet and Discovery ID, along with TONS of documentaries about profilers. Candice DeLong is a favorite of mine and some more I can't think of because the cover up is just beyond disgusting. I have no words...none.

            Wow, it just goes to show that Alefantis is the 49th most powerful person in DC for a reason. He has the entire MSM doing his bidding. Why would this guy have so much power? That's the most elusive aspect of this whole investigation.

             Not only that, but even alex jones has been saying for a while that comet ping pong and alefantis are a diversion from the real scandal, and they haven't been covering pizzagate for weeks now. trump fired the guy from his transition team who tweeted on pizzagate. the establishment (democrats, republicans and media) will never cover pizzagate.

              The articles defend him but are really being pushed to defend those above. This goes to the highest levels which is why they are scrambling so much and fighting so hard to block the general public from seeing this news.

             YOU ALL ARE IN THE EXTREME MINORITY. I will never be able to convince you all but the reason there is no real investigative journalism into this is because everyone in journalism and the police have looked at the evidence and seen nothing but completely normal activity. Remember this is a bubble where you almost always hear people who agree with you but almost everyone else sees nothing and it's not a coverup.

              Being in the minority doesn't mean we are wrong. The top 1% smartest most knowledgeable humans are in the minority, they still know more than everyone else. And they're also the ones investigating this. :-)
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you need to actually look at some of what has been uncovered, maybe start with the sticky. Compare what this investigation is looking into with the blatant lies the media have been telling about it. Just that alone should tell you something is very wrong going on here.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know you don't  want to believe it, because it's so horrible, but try and be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you want to be on the side of protecting children and your fellow humans, or on the side of hideous mentally deformed monsters who would rape, torture and murder you and everyone you love just for fun if they knew they could get away with it?

              OK. So you are skeptical...or a CTR shill. Since you believe so much in rational analysis, are you willing to go through a Q&amp;A where I ask you specific questions about actual findings, and you can explain them? The media has made no effort to debunk as they have not even looked at the facts.

             Yep. Any not worried of those children and babies in the pictures has no ethics. Movies and such are rated for R and x rated for a reason. Twitter is a public site and on public settings; they posted all you me ruined and more that fully show; they are not safe/ healthy for children to be around. Clearly, sell pizza and any pedo will be called safe. How much research shows that pedo and rapists are often ones that know a child?
            </p>
            <p>
             As cps is the state fed agency that must investigate all cases reported; cps is never mentioned by the media. No compassion or concern that child safety is a pertinent Issue. ( In even general terms).
            </p>
            <p>
             Who posts back to media with cps law, the Obama bill allowing media propaganda, child psychology for EVEN in cps court cases; these are all required elements of a legal case.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not sure why more are not pointing out cps failure to investigate, mandate report failures, the children in pics, child psychology, and cps cases that destroyed citizens as comparative analysis are not being used to expose media elite as false and public pressure those kids/ infants are found.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yah, cps sucks, but that's not my point; the failure of the laws being used that ARE CERTAINLY, state and federal severe violations by cps and all whose jobs do require mandate reporting to cps.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or the fact, that cps is refusing to now take reports in many calls and intimidating to police; WHEN out of jurisdiction calls to report crimes cannot be done to dc cops, only cps.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knowing the laws, and anything not adhering is WHAT IS FALSE, and what even stands in a law abiding court room.

             It is common knowledge that tunnels run under dc, just like NYC. It is clear as day he is having major construction and not have a permit in a low level. It is clear as day, gay or not that they have severe sex addict, impulse control Issues that are pervasive, no boundaries and not family oriented but xxx rated.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's clear as day that many of them have high risk of harboring or history of venereal disease. ( Kind of a joke) but, I would starve then ever eat any food they touched.

            <p>
             It is clear as day that ones are so die hard for this pizza joint that this guy can do anything, and they would be oddly loyal.

             Some even take pics by comet with little kids and say they stand with comet. Sorry, that is not the kids voices, but as usual adults first, not children.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Facebook, the GoFundMe is posted by ones appearing against pedo; but ALOT are sexual oriented , actors in horror shows, on gay mags. Probable that b list actors are now hired.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aside, one of Soros own psychological sites, is called some conspiracy thing. His England psychology organizations do state the psych social economic studies to impact the populace. Yet, concerned citizens of kids are the false news?
            </p>
            <p>
             The shooter, sure has a very depressed, sex orientation brother.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's at the point that ssexual printed communities need to stand up and say they do not support any that pedo.or satanic. It's giving them a bad name. Not all are like that, and stay away from bar scenes and such that are creepy and demand attention on genitals; which is really low self esteem. OK, you like same gender, doesn't need to be an obsession daily for whole world to be brought into your personal biz and boundaries. While world does not want to see your crotch..
            </p>
            <p>
             And, any regular citizen caught on video sext texting, jacking off like Weiner would be having cps at their door. Canon now, read up on cps cases of intrusion, for absolutely nothing. Besides the inappropriate sexual, the child could have wandered off and been injured many times. That is also negligence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huma had enough money to hire a babysitter, or choose not to go to her next party hardy event. She dresses up so much, yet her kid looks like he just got out of bed. Looks like he is always just tagging along like extra baggage.

               Yes, and prior with Bush , etc, etc. All over the web are victim families, and many more unheard that do not have tech access as lives destroyed.
              </p>
              <p>
               The web, also has the Connecticut dad's that had more money and research skills that took.on cps in divorce/ custody proceedings. No matter how long they ran the rat maze, no justice, added state and federal violations, costs, burden, impacts.
              </p>
              <p>
               These dad's went from financial security to losing their homes and financial resources, and never got their children back.
              </p>
              <p>
               Canada, England, etc, same scenarios l;just different names and acronyms of programs and their own dead end, systemic rat maze.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dr. Phil has the CA, CPS director on his show slot. I think pressure on those two is warranted; for they both go out of their way to state how cps adhered to law and protects children. Or, are the drug addicted teens on the shows, also routed to dangers??? Makes me wonder.
              </p>
              <p>
               Everyday that cps in DC fails to.invesigate reports on each child/ baby in photos, reported IS additional felony violations that are included in child court cases if ever gets investigated.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not suprised at all that cps in DC is not adhering to law and investigating the welfare. Yet, every inform recorded call to cps recorded; is evidence of failure to adhere to their legal obligations to welfare check.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, some who call are being refused to report, given a hard time with mind games, saying theyust know names of the children, told to call cops or be transferred to the cops. That is all illegal , also, and is evidence. Who is having the call staff, violate? They also have to allow anonymous calls and give their two digit Id number.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not suprised that call staff would violate and be douche bags, for any call to any govt Corp program or entity is always a bitchslap of citizen exclusion; how dare you expect us to be public servants on your tax dollars and adhere to our job requirements, state fed law, govt Corp contract Integrity Reports that each have to be trained and sign the job contract.
              </p>
              <p>
               It would be a endless YouTube show of calls to govt entities, for its systemic habit to violate all, browbeat citizen/ beneficiary, rat maze, inaccurate documentation, destroy / alter.
              </p>
              <p>
               Govt unions didn't endorse Hillary for no reason. I called Obama Whitehouse slot, it was the same and quite snarky.
              </p>
              <p>
               And if ones calling cps are not in the DC jurisdiction, DC cops do not take case calls from ones out of jurisdiction. Ones have to report to cops in their jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
               I posted previously, a website of a very long list of court, cps, satanic ritual crimes that demonstrate that govt, courts, judges, drs, social workers and more are quite aware of the pervasive satanic crimes for decades. They also, all profit from cps cases.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm curious to who are the Fosters in the DC vicinity area that have a roach motel.of Fosters, abuse to.kids but not busted or on time to.save the kid. There are some good Fosters, but def ones that profit on system and abuse and kill kids that cps fails to protect.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also, recommend, reviewing the Justin Peltier case, the black.mom that refused to give her young girl the psychotropics, and the parents who let their two kids walk alone to the park.
              </p>
              <p>
               The comparative contrast of how regular citizens have been destroyed by cps that did no harm, vs the many times that cps failed to.protect kids from obvious horrid abuse that died or were severely injured from abuses, vs the absent in adhering to state/ fed CPS law in doing welfare checks on all the kids/ infants that the Alefontitus chose as an adult to post demeaningly on the public web.
              </p>
              <p>
               Quite, a contrast of treatment. And as Alefontitus initiated the series of events and IS fully accountable for posting those babies and allowing a family advertised pizza place be so queer kill Bill; quite odd that cps staff, top to bottom are bolding not adhering to law and welfare checking.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, any cps workers in nation, teachers, social workers, psychs, drs, attorneys and more that witness those photos and do not Mandate Report as their state or fed license requires; is also violating the law of Mandate Report. They are to fill out a specific form.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is all common knowledge in these fields and others. All I mentioned is easy to find these legal requirements on the web.
              </p>

               So, the false news is also all of their fraud violations vs adhere parallel to the law. Quite bold, their expected impunity to violate. Hence, more violations documented on tape, more solid the case for the kids.

               Getting animal advocates involved would be smart;for they really unite and get angry when hear of animal abuse. Satanic abuse will piss them off, and add a tidal wave to this case.

             Only time I've ever watched Megyn Kelly really prior to this was when she did the post-sexual abuse revelation interviews of the Duggars. Those were very underwhelming as well. Perhaps not a coincidence.

              Good point.

              Since October, I've been watching her, oreilly and hannity at least twice a week.  She would get under my skin with some anti trump pro Hillary stuff, and her low cut dresses annoyed me.  Cocktail party or a date? sure.  A Presidential debate and to report the nightly news? not so much.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, I was still able to respect her opinion while many other trumpkins could not.  But now, nope.  I've been wanting to watch tucker Carlson anyway.  I'll start dvring him instead.

             I boycotted her a while back when she jumped on the anti-Trump bandwagon with 98% of the rest of the media.  Fortunately, her days are numbered there and her ratings have been dropping like a rock.

             Puts a whole different perspective on her (recently softened) dominatrix look - likely a sadistic pedo herself.  I doubt this was the first time these two met.  Be on the lookout for photos of her with the Podesta/CPP crowd.  These people need to be picked up and held for serious interrogation - Patriot Act style.

              My grandma had one for us kids, but she didn't watch it. She called it the "Squawk box" and told me I musn't waste my time in front of it. Grandma is always right, always. I admit I do watch mine, but I restrict it to the true crime shows, there's a couple network shows, but mostly I'm into Netflix and the documentaries. ANYWHERE I can find interesting docs, I fall into a documentary wormhole. I think there's some good in tv, but it's like looking for a diamond in a pile of cow pies these days. I like to feed my brain, not dull it. I'm glad I didnt go falling victim to the crap shows they used to program people. That's the ONLY explanation I can come up with why people are lacking empathy. The celeb worship has ruined our country. They aint nothing but dust if that's what we pay them. Pay them dust, don't even watch out of morbid curiosity. The ratings WILL TALK.

              And when the truth is out, they better not even DARE try to get exclusives, and shove journalists that researched to bring it the spotlight it needs. The reporters ignoring and participating in the arm of cover up, enjoy your "career" while it lasts. I've blocked these channels. Nobody else in the house watches it, we just use netflix. I think I'm in contract with my cable company...there should be a way to break the tv part. If people do this en masse, the cable companies will freak out.

               When I was a teenager, back in th 90's, I only knew 1 family that didn't watch television. Now I know several. People are waking up :)
