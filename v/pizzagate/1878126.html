           <p>
            I know for certain that
            <strong>
             the Seth Rich case has scared the shit out of
            </strong>
            certain high ranking current and former Democratic Party officials.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the reason why they have backed away from impeachment talk.
            <strong>
             They know the smoking gun is out there
            </strong>
            , and they're terrified you will find it,
            <strong>
             because when you do
            </strong>
            it will bring down the entire DNC, along with a couple of very big name politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that certain DNC thugs were
            <strong>
             not thorough enough
            </strong>
            when it came time to
            <strong>
             cover their tracks
            </strong>
            . Podesta saying he wanted to
            <strong>
             "make an example of the leaker"
            </strong>
            is a
            <strong>
             huge smoking gun
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The behavior is
            <strong>
             near open panic
            </strong>
            . To even mention this name in D.C. circles will bring you under automatic scrutiny. To even admit that you have knowledge of this story puts you in immediate danger.

            I have
            <strong>
             strong reason to believe
            </strong>
            that the

             smoking gun in this case is out of the hands of the conspirators

            I doubt they are nervouse when the FBI, DOJ  and entire judicial system, is subverted. They are allowing and helping to trafick tens of thousands of chilren, nobody will be in trouble for them blowing away Seth Rich. Arrest are not imminent and they are not losing sleep. But continue exposing them until the citizens deicde they are ready to overthrow the beast and hunt these bastards down. The law is there to help them, not us.

            Charlie Warzel senior tech writer from BuzzFeed on NPR right now discussing "Seth Rich" story and how "the Right" is running with the newly alive "non-story" of Seth Rich. 
Discussing how "the right" is citing "anonymous leaks" and vague sources which are coming from "The Deep State," -  it is disparaging, dismissive- the whole lead in in to the segment was about fake news, they cited Alex Jones Roger Stone and Sean Hannity.  Also said that "their followers" are OK with these "vague sources."

            Sometimes you have to look to the past for information.
           </p>
           <p>
            I grabbed a few news stories that came out early on. Read through these and see if there is any new information there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the same official line rhetoric given in each story?  Are there discrepancies between the reports? Any new info?  For example, I learned SR worked with databases in one article.

            Seth rich was assassinated.
The DNC has covered its tracks or paid off the right people,  and the only thing we can do is pressure trump to have sessions open up an investigation. Amything short of that is a time drain. 
The rich/powerful dont get that way from being sloppy

            How quickly the tide can turn! Perhaps instead of trolling PG community in the WP along with his CPP Owner King of Creeps - Skippy should have covered his tracks! What did Killary tweet again the day Michael Flynn got fired  '...... What goes around, Comets around.....' It sure does, Killary &amp; Skippy... it sure does. Not in the mood for pizza are we?

            Honestly, out of all the HORRIBLE people we have investigated here, I am certainly happy with Podesta as the scapegoat. It's not enough, but it's a start.

            I believe Seth Rich went to Shawn Lucas with what he had on the DNC.
           </p>
           <p>
            On July 1st, Shawn served papers to the DNC and Debbie Wasserman , The lawsuit, filed in June 28, alleged “that Wasserman Schultz and the DNC were fraudulent, negligent and misrepresented their true motivations in the Democratic presidential primary
           </p>
           <p>
            July 10th, Seth was murdered
           </p>
           <p>
            July 22, WikiLeaks publishes e-mails
           </p>
           <p>
            Aug 2, Shawn Lucas found died, cause of death remained murky till Nov 1
           </p>
           <p>
            Oct 30, Podesta e-mail threat
           </p>
           <p>
            They had to have some evidence to file for a lawsuit. ,  The committee Shawn worked for had what Seth had, was Shawn the go between with the committee and WikiLeaks? How they got Seth's name not sure
           </p>
           <p>
            Both guys were huge Sander followers
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth was beat to find out what the committee had on Hillary's people and who all knew, not realizing it had been passed to WikiLeaks .
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Seth gave Shawn the info and he was the one gave it to WikiLeaks,  that's why they went after Shawn, after they beat the info out of Seth
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it coincidence that the DC Police Chief at the time, Cathy Lanier , announced on Aug, 16th, that she was retiring after 27 yrs, and has accepted a position as senior vice president of security for the NFL. She will begin work at the league's New York office next month

            I read in someone's article that the first cop on the scene who showed up in just 3 minutes is someone who knew Podesta the Molesta from school.  That could indeed prove problematic.  He was also apparently ALIVE when police arrived and the autopsy stated he had bruises on his face and hands and was shot twice in the back.  I know some people here probably already know this, but I sure didn't.  And let's not forget the awesome work of quantokitty who archived the business name and address of Podesta's cousin

            Gussifer LLC! I just joined a study group on this very subject which is where I learned of the relationship of Mr.Podesta and the DC Cop.  I hope they nail that bastard to the wall.  He wanted to teach him a lesson ?  Who the heck does that little twirp think he is?  I can not believe anyone actually takes orders from that little toad.

            Hi, thanks, that's what I thought.  What made me wonder is other day I upvoted a topic/had 4 upvotes, but when I upvoated the total suddenly registered over a hundred.  That has happened a few times I upvoted.  Is it just delayed tally of upvotes?

            PLEASE READ THIS. This is how the spirit realm works. I have witnessed it and it was crazy real. it says "our war is not against flesh and blood, but in spirit realms". these satanists are protected by the demonic realm and it is known they have done sacrifices to Molloch, and other pagan gods. etc. They may even have principality protecting them in the demonic realm and they have given them a spirit of invincebility...and a spirit of lawlessness. I once saw how this can be broken. Probably THEE most crazy thing I have ever witnessed. 100% true story and still is shocking to me, 6 years later. I had a good female friend, who had a 4 year old son. Her ex was a drug runner from mexico. He threatened to take their son to mexico and she would never see him again. She went to ICE and authorities and they could do nothing...this guy always got away with drug trafflcking and never caught. I told my friend I would pray for her and went to the wisest man I knew about spiritual things. He did not ask many questions and said "lets pray"...he began to pray and then looked up at me "does this guy ever get caught? is he invinceable? I said, YES! He then went back to praying. He said "I break the powers that protect this man and the demonic covering he has and break the spirit of invincibility...I also break the spirit of lawlessness and expose him now, in Jesus' name" We opened our eyes and my friend looked at me and said "it's over. This guy is naked and exposed, It's done and over for him" I was shocked...he said it again "he's naked and exposed, he has NO protection, we removed it"...the next week, my female friend said "oh my god, the FBI broke in his place at 4 am to apprehend him, but he was not there" they later got him! He was never caught before in YEARS. This TRUE story changed my life. Prayer works...our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but is spiritual realms! Its true. pray now, the same prayer to remove spirits of invinceability, lawlessness, and DECLARE _____ (name person) that they are now without demonic protection and naked and exposed (to the light) and that the BLOOD of Seth Rich cries from the ground for justice. (like Cain and Abel, "the voice of your brothers blood cries from the ground" add this in prayer) Blood is life giving and the KEY to so many things.

             This probably seriously explains the huge decline of spirituality in the western world in the recent centuries. The evil cabal knows that securing a spiritual protection amongst themselves is important, so taking away the population's knowledge and wisdom over that which is spiritual had to have helped them in securing and gaining power.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's just one thing that I've often pondered, and it's the rapid decline of spiritual beliefs in western society. I've always wondered how so much spirituality had declined so much in our societies. We've gotten so focused on the physical and material realm, that the idea of witches and wizards are considered fictional to the average person.

            Once shit hits the fan, Satan is just going to say fuck it anyways.  Once you don't love him no more, he'll manifest his real evil.  Satan wants you to believe in Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood and Sesame Street.  But once you find out you are really living in hell now, you will want Heaven in a heart beat.  But he knows that he has but a short time and because he is doomed for hell fire, he will try to bring you down with him.  People should be wanting to turn to righteousness.  Where there is no Jew, no Gentile, No Christian, No Muslim.  Just oneness under the creator of the heavens and the earth.  They are trying to maintain the JIG (make believe world), but the Jig is up.
           </p>
           <p>
            when I say He as in Satan, i mean a like minded group of wicked people.  I don't fixate on wanting this justice in pizzagate.  I want complete world wide justice for all.  It is on it's way and many are going to be sorry for the mind they had and have.

            Indeed, we first need to get over scepticism and atheism and remind: We have nothing to lose. We can only win.
           </p>
           <p>
            Try to visualize that the demonic forces of people like John Podesta and Hillary Clinton get broken, and visualize more strength for Donald Trump. He is on our side, he needs our energy. If enough people do it, it might work.

             If you truly aren't worried, and don't give a fuck, why do you come here so often? If it's not because you're worried, then you really don't have a life, do you? Then again, they pay you by the hour, don't they? And who spends money unless they have to?

               It's said that many families of the Old Guard have bought land in various non-extraditable countries around the world. I find that funny-- they seem to have made sure they're nowhere near each other. No matter. It won't protect them anyway.

            Hey thanks for this, I remember.  Isn't he implying that NSA have all her mails? (I know I'm being Capt. Obvious here, but he was making a point that her deleted emails were still accessible through key-score I believe, not saying that he had them personally).  That's how I read it?

            Who is going to arrest anyone? Clearly MCabe and Metro Police are complicit. I guess Trump will have to fire McCabe and just go down the line.

            "I have never, in my 20 years of working in D.C. seen such a panicked reaction from anyone."
           </p>
           <p>
            I hate to say it but I think things could get much much worse down there and people need to get ready for that just in case.

           <p>
            Please understand I know nothing, I have no evidence nor am I looking for any. I only have the best intentions with this post because I think my role in Pizzagate is to become some sort of online clergy. Why? Because I've seen this hell up close and personal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Religion is for people who don't want to go to Hell. Spirituality is for people who've been there.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're coming up to a point in this story that I pray doesn't happen but could given the highly charged emotion associated with it. People need to be aware of it because I've seen people do this in real life when they've gotten caught in the really deep stuff and they cant' take it anymore. When I've seen it happen it was in situations totally unrelated to this but the end result is just as tragic. It's the god damn saddest thing you can imagine. People with kids and the whole nine years and when you see it your hearts breaks into a thousand pieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I make this comment because if it helps just one person then it was worth it. One possibility here is some people guilty or innocent may go for the early check-out. People need to be prepared for what might happen. This whole story is like a powder keg and when it blows people go into shock. I've referenced the first link before but it gives an idea of what happens when people go into shock. They're whole system shuts down. It's like the opening to Saving Private Ryan but without all the gore. The emotions will be that overwhelming. People go into shock and
            <a href="https://youtu.be/mT3q8tba_lw?t=273">
             they're so overwhelmed they can't function.
            </a>
            Sometimes people stay like that for days.

           <p>
            I'm not saying it is going to happen but people just need to be aware of it. Things could get much worse down in DC before they get better. And it needs repeating I'm not saying the guns are coming out. God no. But this story is so raw their emotions are going to get just as raw as they'd be on Omaha Beach. Straight up, no shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully that pizzagatewhatever post can help introduce some of the ways to get people through the shock when it happens. There are no atheists in fox-holes and there's a reason they send clergy into battle along with the medics but just a little further back.

             Agree completely and feel we could be 36 hours or so from it being lit or exploded. Also had some thought about how unveiling those responsible for murder of Seth Rich--- will make pedogate the other shoe to fall so to speak. It might add to ability to consider the possibility of pedogate and at least a legitimate investigation. Hokey as it must sound-- Seth Rich and others murdered are with us

              "will make pedogate the other shoe to fall"
             </p>
             <p>
              I think many shoes will be dropping if you catch my drift. We're talking a centipede here not a biped. I only got my "Tin Foil Hat" card a few months ago when it was so obvious you couldn't come to any other conclusion. But before that for the past 16 years I took the party line hook, line and sinker.
             </p>
             <p>
              I fear there are things that are going to come out even I haven't heard of at this point and I've been researching this pretty much all the time for the past 6 months. There's stuff out there that will turn people's shit white for a month. I hope and pray Donald Trump is on top of that fact because waking up around 300,000,000 people ain't gonna be pretty.

              In the unlikely event anyone important is reading this here goes. One way to ease people into this is get rid of the non-disclosure agreements of people at the CIA and NSA. I'd say most over at those outfits are true American patriots. The fish rots from the head as they say. Most rank and file CIA/NSA have the credibility because they were on the front lines in the trenches taking orders no matter what. I'm sure they didn't like anymore than we did.

              This is hard to describe but the Truth needs to come out from both sides of the aisle. And it needs to come out full broadside, all 9 rifles(see my avatar). This fucker's got to be full throated so there's no doubt who's in charge. If it's just Donald Trump people won't believe it. We need a bi-partisan effort and the more with knowledge the merrier. With more people talking the country down there's more of a chance of closing the loop and getting the message across. More people up on the pulpit will greatly aid in the translation. No hesitation either, there's no turning back. There are no half measures when it comes to the Truth. Aaaaaaaaaaaaand maybe a few well thought out immunity deals couldn't hurt.

               I too have given this much thought. Re: the bipartisan effort, in addition we also need the people the masses worship to come forward and spill the truth. I'm talking the Mileys, Britneys, Lettermans, Swifts, Oprahs, etc. (Even the Pope.) Part of the peoples' waking process will be to realize that celebrities and other figures are not gods and nobody but the Creator should be worshipped. We need a divine spiritual awakening of global proportions. And if full disclosure occurs, and it must, it will be painful on some level for almost everyone on this planet. But no pain, no gain. And as we move through it, we will experience peace, love, and acceptance on a scale most of us never dreamed was possible, much less in our lifetime.

              I used to think that before but to be honest I think the pizzagate stuff is a bit of a side-show. Look at the Extortion 17 story. That has nothing to do with pizzagate but if true it could just as damming if not more so.

              Who knows though. This is like the San Andreas fault right before the big one. The forces building up are massive but you'd never suspect a thing. I bet the animals know though. They always figure out this shit way before us humans do with our "superior" brain and "higher intellect".

              I don't know you at all but I understand what you mean. And I don't know what your future brings. But we're all sinners in the eyes of God doubletake. You never know when you'll win "the lottery". You could go out tonight and get shitfaced drunk and take out a whole family after you picked the wrong on ramp. You think raping a child is bad imagine what it would it be like to accidentally kill a whole family.

                I see your point. I agree many of these people were more than willing participants. Some of these people are going to have some very long nights coming up as fantasy makes way for reality.

             Surely people [for want of a better word] who torture, rape and sacrifice babies are unlikely to be shocked by much - unless they think they are about to be caught.  My sympathy for them is severely limited.

             100% agree. And thank you for your willingness to be that level of support because you already know that that job ain't easy. I suspect many of us here will be in a similar position because so many of our loved ones (and strangers we come into contact with on a daily basis) are in a completely different reality than the one that's about to come crashing down on them. They're not bad people, far from it, it's just that for them, the Red Pill is going to be forced down their throat with not even a glass of water to help it go down. We need to exhibit compassion in those moments, and not be I told you so's.

              Don't say "I told you so." Say: "This is what I've been talking about." It leads them to further conversation and invokes a partnership in discussion.

               Agreed. Don't be arrogant nor destructive with your behavior about this if it comes to pass like we all hope it will. Some might need your help to get them through the uncertainty of what is ahead. Help them through it and you will have new developed friendships and allies that will create the unity of light needed to destroy the darkness.

             I brought this topic up a long time ago.  This "whole thing" is taking longer than I thought it would to at a minimum, see an arrest or two.  But it is taking much longer, probably because the problem of the "Deep State" is worse than many of us, much less Trump, ever imagined.

             If/when things do start to crack open, I think it is going to be like bringing a frog to a boil, versus dropping the frog in boiling water.

             The MSM refused to even give the story one second.  It was dumbfounding in a 1984 sort of way.  There is a good chunk of the population that won't believe any of this, even if Cooper, Guthrie, Lauer, and Whoopie delivered the story via an a capella.

             But some of them will, and the level of insanity and foam-at-the-mouth maniacal behavior will reach new heights.  And they will stop at nothing.  A dying beast is the most dangerous.  The fight has just begun.

              I always think back to what FBIanon said when he was talking about how this would/could even cause civil war if everything was dropped in one sitting. OUR trust as regular citizens, would be irrevocably broken if everything was revealed at once, realizing how many politicians have literally sold our country out and that we have foreign countries who have far too much power in our govt. I have a feeling that what HRC was referring to when she said "If we lose we all hang by nooses" was bc she had sold so much out and other countries were going to come calling for whatever payment was due along with the very real fear that someone like Russia or China would dump all of the evidence bc apparently they were two of the countries who had all of the emails ect.

              Don't forget that an investigation (operation) takes a long time. Years of corruption and cover-ups from the inside they (the good people) need time and patience to put the puzzle together. Also it's very difficult to collect the right and trusted people. This investigation is of unprecedented scope and it will shake the whole world..yes the world because there are many ties to other parts of the world. This could be the reasson why we didn't hear something. Now Comey is gone I have faith that there will be a domino day in several months.

               Perhaps Trump saw this comming and timed Comey's firing to perfection. He may also know that he can't bring pedo-gate directly so he went for the blind alley - Skippy never saw this one comming.

              Don't forget how maniacal they were about trying to flip the electoral college, it was panic then too. But this is worse for them, and now Comey, their protection layer, is gone.

             </p>
             <p>
              I thought this too initially. Some really don't like Trump but I'd argue a significant percentage are afraid of the Deep State and don't want to rock the boat.
             </p>
             <p>
              So that means when this thing finally breaks and arrests are imminent and the Deep State is down for the count the MSM will start chirping. Then as they feel safe they'll start screaming from the mountain tops how they saw this coming all along and helped out to win the war against the Deep State. And then this is all we'll hear for the next 2 years probably. It'll be nonstop.

               It's like taking all of our credit, all the research goats, autists, and t_d'ers have been doing since the name Clinton appeared again. I have tried to red pill those close to me as patiently as I could but they see me as crazy. "Why are you bringing up human trafficking" why the fk not? I'm going to literally shake and cry when pedosta gets the noose.

              This is what FBI anon said too, that meme magic is real, and I believe this whole Kek thing during the election is more than just coincidence or a joke:

              If the energy of many people, or a spiritually strong person, is aimed at something, it could perhaps really change reality. So if many people put energy in wanting John Podesta to be arrested, it might actually happen if the universe directs its' energy to that. This might explain why some famous sceptics and atheists mock spirituality in public, but believe in it in private, like dr. Radin explained in one of his videos. By making people atheistic and un-spiritual, you take away their potential energy to influence reality. Remember how people like Jared Kushner are said to be involved in heavy Kaballah and esoteric stuff etc.? And how Abramovic has her work filled with spirituality. Atheism might be, instead of rationalism and enlightment, be a way to make people numb so that people in charge with dark motives have more spiritual energy.

            I so hope this is true. It would be lovely if those that had been callously subjecting others to tyranny and blackmail find themselves in the same position.

            I think the beauty of this is that Seth Rich wasn't for Trump or a repub ... he was a true DEMOCRAT. He was raised in a democratic family and loved the party, so much so, that when he grew up, he worked for them! It means that true democrat saw the amount of corruption and was trying to get out the information and let others see what he was. That's what got him killed. If there is a smoking gun ... and I believe there is ... it'll be a victory for him. Not only will what he leaked get out, but the truth of the despicable warlords that have taken control of the party. I hope Pedosta and the Cannibal Queen are the first ones arrested.

             Can you imagine just how disillusioned he must of became to do what he did?
            </p>
            <p>
             The things he found out must've sickened him to the point that he felt compelled to do something.
            </p>
            <p>
             He must've felt that there was not anyone else he could trust to turn to.
            </p>
            <p>
             I feel sad for him, but by him doing it, it given us hope that maybe things can be revealed and changed.

              Yes, it's astonishing. If the rumors are true, quite a few of the workers were disgusted by what was going on, but he took effective action. I'm really shocked Sanders hasn't spoken out. Didn't he show up during the campaign with a bruise on his face? They must have something big on him, too.

                  Absolutely. It only makes sense that people like Seth would perhaps try to alert Sanders to what was going on ... it's never even been investigated that Sanders was the recipient of some of this stuff.

               I saw recently that at the same damn rally Bernie endorsed HRC (Portsmouth NH I believe), her remarks start off basically going out of her way not only to thank him, but his wife and one of his kids. AND she goes out of her way to bring Seth Rich up AT THE SAME RALLY. And mind you, this was two days after Seth's death. Seeing that video made me want to throw up. I won't be at all surprised if Skippy threatened the man's family, nor if he knows something about what happened to Seth and has to keep quiet about it for the same reasons he had to endorse the evil Queen.

            Upvoating you as usual. Can almost watch their panic on line as they attempt to shut down sites, edit Seth Rich Reddit posts &amp; place bogus stories in MSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stunning that at this point anyone would still try and edit or scrub info it is a direct inference of consciousness of guilt in law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many still do not realize how &amp; who is archiving and leaking. Upvoat for you.

             Thanks as always Jem, appreciate it. And exactly, it's all unbelievable isn't it?  I hope they try to scrub more and dig themselves even deeper.  It's a wonderful thing happening just now. I hope Seth Rich would be proud.

              Yes so true and stunning that citizens are investigating their own government in the US &amp; not only being murdered but then the murders are covered up.
             </p>
             <p>
              It shows the depravity of man at one end and the hope &amp; moral clarity on the other end. Where else could the citizens combine with the white hats in anonymous connections to reveal truth and save innocent children.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are many aspects to this depravity as everyone knows but what drove most everyone was the thought children were being harmed.

            Is it just me or are all y'all wishing you had a drone camera following around Podesta, Donna Brazile, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the Clintons, and the others so we could see and hear the panic?  I wish we could see them flipping out.  Sadly, I think the only way we'll know that they're panicking and strategizing is that more people will die.

            As for Kim Dot Com promising to make a statement on TUESDAY?  I'll believe it when I see it.  If he really has evidence then he is in grave danger.  Since he is in grave danger and apparently already has a legal team in place, there should be no need for him to wait until Monday to consult with legal counsel.  I'm not a lawyer but I know a lot of them and every single one said if they had a client in grave danger they would consult with him or her immediately, even on a weekend.  So I'm not so sure that Kim Dot Com has to wait until Tuesday to do any bloody thing.  Instead, given that Kim Dot Com has been full of crap in the past by promising things and then not delivering, I think Kim Dot Com is either:  (1) full of shit again; or (2) consulting with a really shitty legal team.

             Kim Dot Com lives in New Zealand in a literal compound due to being raided years ago. He speaks only when absolutely necessary. He would not make a statement without the evidence. It only adds though, the evidence is everywhere. It cannot be stopped.

             even if DotCom has nothing to say, he is bringing attention to Seth Rich and that is fine with me. And with the time difference, maybe the wait is not so long.

             Thanks for your comment. It could be tricky when he's a few countries legal systems to cover. Lets see tomorrow.  The world is waiting for him and he'll lose all cred if he doesn't deliver. BTW, when did Kim not deliver?

              .  This is a great thread.  As for KDC not delivering, that was back in the Fall of 2016, right before the election.  Back then he posted on Twitter a lot of stuff in which he threatened to post stuff that would put Hillary Clinton in jail.  He had everyone believing that he could have been the source of the hack and that he possessed incriminating videos and photos and other evidence.  He kept leading people on, and we all thought "THIS IS IT.   KIM DOT COM'S GONNA NAIL HER."  But then -- POOF! -- nothing at all got posted.  Nothing happened.  It was tremendously frustrating and disappointing and I have since written KDC off as just a wannabe.
             </p>
             <p>
              If he really has the goods he ought to just STFU and post the stuff.  The clock's ticking.  Children are dying.  People are being tortured.  So if this is as big a deal as it appears to be, I have no patience or understanding of people like Kim Dot Com who say they've got the goods but then fail to deliver.  And in light of what the lawyers I know have told me, there is no way in Hell that a competent attorney would make his or her client wait until Monday to move forward.  Especially because the most dangerous time for KDC (or any whistle-blower who's dumb enough to announce the time at which the whistle will be blown) is the period of time between the whistle-blower's announcement that the whistle is about to be blown and the time at which the whistle actually gets blown.  In other words, KDC is in the most danger now.  If he really has the goods his lawyers -- if they're any good -- would be helping him expose the truth ASAP.  The sooner the info's out there for all to see, the sooner the state of emergency for KDC will end.  Once the whistle's been blown, the whistle-blower won't be in danger.  That, in a long explanation, is why I'm frustrated with Kim Dot Com.  Yet again.

            Love it!  We have to find out who was permitted in his ICU room post op.  So far, we know for a fact that regarding medical staff, only the attending physician and "a few nurses" were permitted and that's it.  This is a HUGE giveaway, because there was absolutely no reason whatsoever for those restrictions to be made ESPECIALLY in an ICU setting.  We need names.

             I think you've got this all wrong.  My reading is that Seth was VIP'd and LE sealed off his room.  It sounds as if MD-anon thought the attending allowed him to die.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see no visiting VIP - unless the swarm of LE accompanied them in - but that's not what I took from it.

              I'll listen to the narrative again for the 3rd time, but my recollection is that the surgical resident did not know he was a "VIP" until after surgery was completed when Seth Rich was in ICU. Timing of all of this after Seth Rich arrived first to the ER, then to the OR. then to ICU post op is purely hypothetical at this point.  When a trauma case arrives to the ER, it doesn't matter if that person is God Almighty,  it's all hands on deck to do everything to stabilize the patient who is essentially John Doe at that point.  The restrictions regarding who could be in the room occurred post op when he left the OR and directly taken to a room in ICU.

             "We have to find out who was permitted in his ICU room post op." That's easy. His parents and/or brother need to request a copy of the medical records preferably through an attorney.

               The parents may have too low of an index of suspicion regarding their son's murder, trusting whatever the police told them and have no reason to think anything was amiss at the hospital. Now that the anon surgical resident has come forward (if verified) things have changed. I myself had no suspicions about the hospital until I read the anon post by the surgical resident. The complete medical records, if not falsified, might verify and corroborate the surgical resident's version of events. It would also point to all those on the medical team who needed to be questioned and deposed by their attorney.

                I am sure without a doubt that the parents were notified by phone towards the end of Seth Rich's surgery that it was successful and that he was expected to recover even though they were out of town at the time.   Not sure if an autopsy was done, but my guess it was not.  If it was not, that is even more suspicious. If it was, I would not trust the results either.  I believe any parent would certainly request an autopsy on their child after an unanticipated post-surgical death.  IMO, his family is involved, some way some how.  These medical records have been "well-polished," and will reveal nothing.  Witnesses are what is needed to 'fess-up and then get all the assistance they need to change their identities and get the hell out of this country until justice is served or a trial occurs.

                 It was a homicide and therefore the medical examiner should have been involved. If the medical examiner was not involved, that itself would be suspicious.

                  True, true, true.  I thought that was the case as well but uncertain if there was anything that could legitimately rule that out.  There never used to be, but I cannot keep up with all the changes these days.  Thanks for the info.

            So why is one ex CIA operative named George Webb allowed to run around DC making videos about Seth's final walk? This adds even more suspicion. The powers that be are leaving him alone, that to me means he is more than likely working for them (not against) as a distraction. Or, as a "school play", if you will.

             I'll probably always have my suspicions about Webb, BUT, if the walls are closing in on TPTB, and they know that they're being closely watched right now, they may be forced to lay back, dig in, and hope for the best. In other words, they may be on defensive mode for once, rather than on the offensive. I suspect we'll know either way, very soon.

              When one looks at all the discrepancies at once, rather than in singular instances like this, there is no way to trust him.

              Another red flag, he claimed Seth's brother wanted to come out with the truth, and that George was about to interview him. Based on his claim alone, a post here went viral, yet the interiew never happened and Geroge went running off on his next tangent - and NO ONE HERE questioned this. It's scary that no one questions him, when if one of us did something like this, we'd have our ass handed to us by fellow Voaters.

               I follow several forums including some of Webb's.  I would think Webb changed his mind to interview him after it many of Webb's followers brought it to his attention that the family appears to believe it was a plain vanilla murder, just a robbery gone bad type of thing and they aren't interested in any working theories.   Webb I believe is former FBI not CIA and someone mentioned once that in one of his earlier videos he said he made some thumb drive drops himself, so it's probably his insurance policy with a dead man's switch that would be released &amp; exposed if something happened to him.

                He shouldn't need people to make excuses for him all the time. IF we're gonna put this much faith in someone, it should be someone who answers these questions himself, rather than deleting them from his Facebook page vefore anyone notices them, and who deletes half his videos and all of his Twitter feed without explaining why. He's shady as fuck and I cannot believe that people think it's possible some savior is going to swoop into our investigation, and do our work for us, whilst entertaining us with multiple videos every day, that someone who claims to be a Zionist, and who likes Obama, and thinks the perps behind pedogate should NOT be punished... people believe THIS is the hero we've been waiting for?

                  People are frustrated from having seen the evidence all these months, and seeing that nothing is happening to the perps. They're downtrodden from having seen that every one of the TRUE pizzagate researchers who made themselves known (doing videos, etc) were silenced and/or 'discredited', attacked. The pain of knowing that innocent children are being horrifically abused, and seeing that our entire system supports this, makes us vulnerable to being infiltrated and lied to, and the deep state knows this better than anyone. so in comes a fast-talking distraction disinfo agent with a wide smile and all the time and resources in the world, seemingly. It's a relief to be able to think that finally someone's gonna make sure something is done.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Not sure if i read your ? correctly, but i think it's pretty understandable that people want (need) to have some hero in what has been such a frustrating experience of uncovering obvious malfeasance, true evil, and yet be shown that there is nothing we can do about it.

                   Maybe I see a different time - line; since I wanted to expose the corruption my whole life and  no one has ever cared; and I have myself been a pariah and attacked for what I investigate and care about
                  </p>

                   Also our 9/11 research group was destroyed over ten years ago, 3 members died of fast cancer, 2 went insane, some recanted, and some disappeared. It's nothing new. I've borne it for years now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, I feel good about the progress Webb made so far, since for so many years there really was a dead stop .
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And I think I'm repeating here
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Maybe he's a false hope, but I find him to be actual hope. I feel fine about him changing track all the time and feel nothing strange that he should be financed; especially as he worked as a salesman for Sun Computers.. Alex Jones is fucking financed too, though he pretends to be a shill for vitimins. and does much less and has been at his schtick to no avail for years already.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Webb has gotten much farther in only 200 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I can understand people being impatient and I think the criticism of Webb is good too. It's important to take points into consideration. I feel much of the dislike of him is emotional , about his style, rather than his substance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Everyone attacks me when I criticize "Jones." Whatever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If someone doesn't want to follow Webb, there's little necessity to do that. I really have more important things to do than to make it my business who follows Webb or not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When I say I feel it un - necessary to trust him, it's a just a policy I have. There should never be a necessity to trust anyone. That is your choice to do or not. People betray you or they don't
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   . I take what he does for what it is, it rings very true for me. As far as information goes, one has to prove something for one's self. Whatever he says I either take it and use it, reject it, think about it, consider it. It's food for thought. And he's working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   . It's a very little tiny subculture here and everyone does what they can in a world where the majority don't "give a damn" Some people like or love "Jones" work. That's fine. They get something from it. And I freely say what I think about him; because he did betray us, and you know people by their actions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And obviously others freely say what they think about Webb; which is a very good thing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I just found a few things - one, The Seth Rich family are obviously with 'duper's delight" ; which shocked me. And the narrative around Seth Rich's death is falling apart. Witnesses have attested he wasn't even at the bar. i think he could be in witness protection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, things are moving to break the story of Hillary and Podesta to the mainstream ; so we'll see what happens in the next few day.s

                    I have to admit, I do wonder if he's in witness protection too. Although I haven't seen much evidence that we have any agencies that are operating to protect citizens from harm from their own government. And I've seen no one stand up to the Clinton mafia. So to find out that somehow he was whisked away to safety by white hats would surprise me. Still there is no way to explain the behaviour of his family.

                   The elite are banking on the fact that people wont do their research and follow up on the claims made by anyone...I mean has anyone here actually reviewed the evidence that the emails and reddit accounts are ACTUALLY (((Seth Rich's)))?...or have they all just followed what ever an anonymous source said?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The public is so docile and easily swayed to believe anything and they dont have the time to check if the sources are really correct.  Who really has the time to wade through hundreds of Wikileaks emails?...people dont even have time to read through a handful or the will to do it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You can see that the original posters of the evidence that Seth Rich's "Panda4Bernie" account was wrong...

                    UPDATE- It appears some intel I received is Fake news, i am only one lone pede without resources or tech skills to verify every lead so I need you Pedes to keep digging to find the link between Panda4Progress and Pandas4Bernie. My source says that they rechecked the phone numbers for the gmail recovery match between Seth.c.rich and Panda4Progress do match but do not match Pandas4Bernie, the last two digits are flipped. Can a tech savvy pede investigate?

                   And all this evidence came from an anonymous source so MOST of it could be wrong...I would say that 99% of the posters in this thread have not verified ANYTHING about those Seth Rich Reddit accounts.  People should do their due diligence and go over all the evidence instead of listening to anonymous claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will save people some time...Seth Rich is a Jew...ergo he is "in on it"...or "was in on it"...which means he knows the political theater and the DNC is just a scam for the Goyim.  He knows there is no choice when you vote so of course he would be supporting both side of the same coin with Bernie and Hilary...he would also be supporting Donald Trump...which would be Hilarious if that evidence came out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So we have Jew(Seth Rich) that supposedly leaked information to Wikileaks and we have a Tranny(Bradly Manning) that leaked info to Wikileaks...and the Jews and Trannys are running the whole earth and are neck deep in Pizzagate...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   TLDR?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Do your fucking research people...verify everything...is Seth Rich a Jew?...well go look it up to see if that is correct...

                    The whole Jew=guilty thing is just too simplistic. It's a bit lazy to take this point of view, and it sure isn't supported by the facts. Remember when I told you about my step father? He is Jewish and practically a saint. It was my Catholic family members who abused me. He came in and brought innocence and safety to me and my family. He is one of the sweetest, most innocent, selfless people i've ever met. HE IS JEWISH

                 Apparently he also claimed that the Rich family is connected to the Finders cult - and as per usual offered ZERO evidence. He says shit like this and yet escapes legal action? This guy is a JOKE. High level CIA op, but still a joke. I cannot believe anyone takes this school play seriously, He's laughing in our faces while trying to get sexy pics from lonely housewives, which is his real goal. i've seen zero evidence that saving children is anywhere on his mind.

                You know the whole "hiding in plain sight" thing? Well, he told us the other day. Look up the Voat post about "school play". In his description of the CIA's "school play" (and how in the world does he know all this anyway??), he actually describes exactly what he is doing. He infiltrated our group, used the energy we had going that was focused on pizzagate, and - well just go listen to his definition and tell me what you think.
               </p>
               <p>
                He just deleted all of his twitter activity up to about 3 weeks ago, so get to that video quick because i think he's trying to make it hard for people to track his activities. He deletes stuff with regularity and will never give a straight answer as to way. I know why though. And he has screwed up enough times that it's time to make a post going over all of it, so people can see for themselves and make a decision.

                 In fact, you also explained why he tweets. Since an overwhelming number of responses to his tweets is always negative, many of us have wondered why he does it. You just explained it.

                  I hadn't noticed that - though i never look at his tweets. I did go looking the other day, which is how i realized he'd erased everything, for a completely gross photo op he did with the grieving mother of one of the Franklin scandal victims. It was just so gross. He did it for street cred, nothing else. He smiled huge as if nothing is amiss, while she could barely smile, pain etched in her face forever. why did he meet with her? All he got from her was: go watch the documentary about my son on Netflix. It was like, dude, everything is already known, why are you even here?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To exploit you, of course.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is why i call it gross. You don't do that to victim's parents. He showed no emotion, no acknowledgement of the delicate situation, sitting with this woman who has been through absolute hell. It was so disturbing. but alas, the picture is removed and i can only tell you about it with text.

                   You painted a great picture with your words though. He did it because he wanted a way to say he's not worried about anything. And because he's a narcissist he has no ability to feel empathy. But I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.

                   You're probably already doing this, but protect yourself. Energy-wise and... maybe other wise as well. Cornered rats bite. Even when they don't put in their false fangs.

                    OK. Thank you. It's possible the danger isn't worth the result - he has everyone's trust. On Twitter and the youtubers i follow, everyone is recommending him with  zero reservations. He's got thousands of followers. There is no way to stop this train. Someone trying to do so is in the crosshairs of a very dangerous organization.

                   I should clarify that in re: to the tweets, I was referring to Podesta. And that is certainly loosh farming. Webb may be loosh farming as well, and it wouldn't surprise me, but I think his speciality is more about doing a bait-and-switch with our attention. Webb's video here about the school play technique is interesting-- and insightful, and that's why it's hard to write him off completely, lol.

                   Edit: (And I agree, it's exactly what he did.)

                    Insightful? What if he's being fed this whole script? I don't see how knowing secret CIA operations makes him trustworthy. You mention that he is a narcissist. This explains my gut reaction to him, thank you. It's a trigger for me. So is government infiltration of truth movements, also: manipulation, lies and half truths.

                  I guess i'll have to try and remember what he said. A CIA "school play" is when they send an infiltrator in to a group that has a lot of energy focused on something the powers that be don't want focused on - and instead of trying to kill the energy, the operative uses that energy but diverts it to something they deem safe.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So in this case, Webb is running around DC taking videos of houses and making it sound all scary and mysterious, and his fans LOVE IT. "Stay safe, George, yourre our hero".

                  Meanwhile we find out no one has interviewed the bar staff where Seth was last seen, and no one has interviewed his girlfriend. Webb hasn't commented on the interview he had promised with Seth's brother... and i don't even watch his stuff, so imagine how much other BS is taking place - for instance someone commented to me in another post that Webb has claimed Seth's family is tied to the Finders cult! No evidence given. Major slander, but he's not worried about being taken to court? Hmmmm. Next i hear that he claims to have had something to do with getting the info to Wikileaks, and that he dissed Kim DotCom! I'm not even trying to collect dirt on him, this is from replies to comments i've made here.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Since i don't watch him, I'm not the best one to do a Webb-outing post, but it needs to be done. I was hoping to have help, and for people to comment with more info that can be added. I have made a couple posts questioning things in the past, and the replies were golden, so i was planning to dig back through those and use info from the replies as fodder for the post.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Thank you so much for your encouragement.

                   You do a great job of questioning everything, so it's easy to offer you encouragement. It's all too convenient for us not to question people/motives/news sources, or to choose idols, particularly in times like these when we find out that so many of the people we looked up to aren't the people we thought they are.

                   I've never had hard evidence against Webb, and some of his stuff I like, but for the most part I've stopped watching his videos because my gut is telling me he has ulterior motives that don't sync with mine. On the surface he seems like one of the good guys, so that's why I like to read your analysis. True investigators always ask questions. And it shouldn't matter who the source of a news piece is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What makes it worse is that we've collectively forgotten to Question Authority. It's what has gotten us into so much trouble.

            I believe they can, and possibly have, through many comments. WL are also connected with KimDotCom, who has said he'll testify that Seth was the leaker. So maybe WL won't have to.  KDCom says he's releasing a statement on Tuesday (t'morrow), after taking legal advice. Kim doesn't BS and doesn't talk unless he has something important to say, afaik. Lets see tomorrow : )

             Or get a camera and laser microphone on Pedosta's house. Has anyone done anything like that?

                I posted what I did due to the lack of 9/11 Pentagon videotapes and how the alphabet soups confiscated everything from local security cameras within minutes.  Obviously if you owned a business it would be the smartest to have several backups of security camera footage; however, this costs money and how many small business owners have extra money to spare?  Where I work the owner is constantly watching the security cameras (calls employees out) but the tape only records 2 hours before overlapping.  Think about it, if there is a robbery or the alarm system goes off the owner makes sure it wakes him up.  He would give police access to the cameras and what happened 2 hours previous is irrelevant if the intruders are still inside.  Why would he need more than 2 hours?  He does not care if someone is killed at 4 a.m. where his cameras are pointing outside his business.

              I am probably wrong but I thought that kind of evidence wouldn't be used by courts. Not that I would assume it would be given to the courts before passed around on the nets to cause outrage.

Tell me, what specifically do you know about Podesta, his security, or even security in general. Have you so much as read a single book on home or personal security?

                Indeed, there are things worth fighting and dying for, and taking down the demonarchy is certainly one of them.  But I live a thousand miles from DC.  What would you have me do, quit my job, burn through what little savings I have, and camp out near the demon's lair in the hope of uncovering something?  I am doing what I can.  I am educating everyone I know.  As a practicing pagan, I am conducting ... I guess you could call it "spiritual research", for lack of a better term ... to see if I can develop a clearer picture of how to proceed.

            I wonder if Podesta and crew can feel the noose tightening on their own necks right about now.  They need to start saving money for the commissary so they can trade cigs for favors. Oh wait, is that a form of "pay to play?"

             Justice would be Podesta getting sent to prison and into the general population. He won't even need to drop a bar of soap in order for karmic justice to work its magic.

            It's obvious they wanted to "make an example of him" shooting him in the back 4 times and NOT taking anything was intentional.

             He was only shot twice. Had on that created an exit wound so it appeared to be three. (According to anon Doc on /pol/) Take it for what it's worth. Not sure if it was a LARPer. What's strange is how sloooy this hit was. Seems to have been done by the typical thugs hired by these types. Illegal aliens or Somalian refugees who aren't CIA level hit people. Hence the need to cleanup in the hospital and finish the job.

             This is why both Seth and Shawn Lucas' deaths were timed to make it obvious that they were related to their anti-DNC actions. It would have been a waste just to murder them, the real meat is in the WARNING it sends. DNC/Clintons/Podesta/Soros = MAFIA

             Yep, and his former colleague Andrew Therriault (the asshole who tweeted about an 'embarrassment' of pandas after he died) intimated as such: "We’ve lost one hell of a friend, brother, colleague, teammate, and patriot, but I hope his legacy will serve as an example to others who might step in to take his place."

            I think the Anons lately, like the 4chan nurse, etc.  are trying to change the narrative.  Notice the new posts contradicting what was said by others not believing the 'reports about the first findings of the Seth Rich shootings and the SpotShot?  I think they are watching and they will keep trying to CTR.  That is what they are up to. Keep watch and you will see it too.

              Every comment you've made since you joined has been to urge people here that the ONLY way to combat this is to do shit like this. Risking the lives of people here by encouraging them to surveill dangerous monsters. With footage that won't be admissible in court? What's your agenda dude? Is that your website you constantly link to? Nice analytics. Why don't you encourage the FBI to do it's damn job instead of obsessively trying to get people here to do this stuff?

               The point is forcing the cops to investigate, and forcing the judge not to protect them. Right now you have a justice system that protects them, and they will NEVER be arrested, no matter how much circumstantial evidence you have.

              Contact rank &amp; file cops - you will know them by instinct, form a group. There are plenty out there. Redpill them with everything we know. These sickos must be outed once and for all!

              , 
Noticed the tactic right now on twitter is going after to Fox5dc.com who printed the update on #SethRichMurder story. They are on twitter threatening the brace reporter first name of Maria M.???   and the local DCfox telling everyone Russia is using her reporting and asking that all ads be pulled.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe this should be its own thread but this is how we turn the Deep State media. Everyone should be offering support to this reporter &amp; fox5dc! Flip the tables on the media right now.

               Hey Jem, thanks for this news. What a surprise. Hopefully with all hands on deck just now on twitter, re SR, she'll be getting support and the crew will be pushing back. I just got back so I'll go take a look. Thanks.

             Then get off your ass and start running stake outs with laser microphones. Get cameras on these places. It's not like the media or corrupt cops will be able to do anything if someone gets a video of someone abusing children and anonymously leaks it everywhere (with proper procedures to ensure they can't track you).

             I'm suspicious about anons too. Nobody who is high up in the DNC is ever going to jail, not Podesta, never a Clinton the swamp is that corrupt.  All we can do is get the truth out and redpill the masses.

              The alleged Clinton body count hasn't brought pitchforks and torches onto the streets.  Is one more death going to make a difference this time?  Any assassin who has been Monarched will suicide [one way or another] before he sings.  We saw the Godfather.

                   No, shit for brains. I have a very good idea what happened to him. He was killed in the hospital when they didn't get him on the street.  You think VIP's just fucking drop dead without a CODE BLUE, you fucking retard ?  Change your fucking name, you're a disgrace to it.

                      Dude I never said it never happened, in fact I believe the DNC was behind it just like you do. ALL WE ARE SAYING IS THAT TRUSTING ANONYMOUS SOURCES IS STUPID.

                       This is going down exactly how it should.  The anon source has been following closely and has been frightened to come forward.  The other anon talked about the mood at the hospital being full of fear.  Now that the momentum of the investigation appears to be with the good guys, the anons are leaking crucial information that begs for further scrutiny, and likely potential protection.  The other anon also said something to the effect of 'they can find out who I am'.  These people are scared shitless.  It's a hail Mary and I for one, am praying for them. The comment was fucking stupid and the 'trust of anons' takes a back seat.. way in the back.. to the importance of the anon's statement.

                I don't see him as a murder witness, that's not what he claimed - anon is just saying that DNC are running around like headless chickens in a panic, because of Seth Rich.  Did I miss something else?
