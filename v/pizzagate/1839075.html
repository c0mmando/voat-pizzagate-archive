As part of that approach, one person from AF/PD suggested

              reaching out to FIFA

             Doug Band Joins USA Bid committee for FIFA World Cup
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             NEW YORK (April 8, 2010) – Counselor to President Bill Clinton, Douglas Band, has formally accepted an invitation to join the Board of Directors for the USA Bid Committee in its effort to bring the FIFA World Cup™ to the United States in 2018 or 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
             Band has worked alongside President Clinton for more than 14 years, serving a variety of roles dating back to Clinton’s time in the White House. He has served as President Clinton's chief adviser since 2002, counseling him and serving as the key architect of Clinton's post-Presidency. He created and built the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) that to date has raised $57 billion for 1,700 philanthropic initiatives around the world spanning climate change, global health, citizen service, education and the empowerment of women and girls, which in total impacts more than 200 million people in 170 countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Doug has spent most of his professional career working with President Clinton on topics that range from international and domestic policy to global philanthropic and environmental issues,” said Sunil Gulati, the Chairman of the USA Bid Committee and President of U.S. Soccer. “His vast experience and multi-national contacts, along with his passion for the game of soccer will be key assets to the bid as he travels the world alongside President Clinton in the months to come.”

             FIFA Hires Former Clinton Aide’s Firm Amid Scandals

            Enter Doug Band.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Teneo Holdings, a corporate advisory firm co-founded by former Bill Clinton confidant Doug Band, signed on this week to offer strategic advice to FIFA, the BBC reported Thursday. The move comes as the international governing body of soccer is weaving its way through massive corruption investigations in the United States and Switzerland.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report follows the July 9 announcement that Teneo had purchased Blue Rubicon, a London-based strategic communications firm that for years has worked closely with Qatar’s effort to host the 2022 World Cup, which has been plagued by allegations of human rights abuses and corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
             Band, a close aide to Bill Clinton during his presidency and afterward, was the director of the United States’ 2022 World Cup bid that lost out to Qatar. He co-founded Teneo in 2011, shortly after he helped the former first family launch the Clinton Global Initiative, and he now serves as Teneo’s president. Bill Clinton was once a paid adviser to the firm, but he stepped down in 2012. Band stepped away from his role at the Clinton Foundation in June, just before Hillary Clinton launched her 2016 presidential campaign, the New York Post reported.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The fast-moving FIFA bribery scandal now has a Clinton connection, after news that the nation of Qatar and its 2022 World Cup organizing committee - and even FIFA itself - donated between $1.3 million and $5.55 million to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The scandal-hit football world authority is listed by the foundation as having handed over at least $50,001 and as much as $100,000 to the Clinton's controversial organization in a direct cash injection at some point before 2014.
There were also far larger donations from the Qatari committee which won the Middle Eastern nation its position as host of the 2022 World Cup, and Qatar's government.
            </p>
            <p>
             The committee is listed on the foundation's website as having donated between $250,001 and $500,000, while the government of Qatar gave at least $1,000,000 and potentially as much as $5,000,000.

             It's shocking how deep this shit goes!  There's 70+ years of swamp to drain and who knows how many nations' of swamps that are not even involved with the UN that are in need to be drained. How can we pull the plug on 70 yrs of collusion in 8 years?  FIFA was put on the DL for years. No one cared until this election cycle. Ignore the MSM and search for true news &amp; we'll put the Clinton's, FIFA's, FBI, State Dept., etc. online.  MSM is not to be trusted unless you want good recipes.  Find your facts.
