            From the posted article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Alvin Rex Smith, 32, was found guilty of three counts of sex trafficking, nine counts of child prostitution, four counts of sexual conduct with a minor and three counts of using minors in drug offenses following a jury trial in October.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, Smith acted as a pimp for three girls between the ages of 13 and 16, during a three-month period between 2014 and 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            …
           </p>
           <p>
            According to prosecutors, Smith was listed as a contact for the teenage girl on Backpage.com ads, and also rented a motel for them. He reportedly required the girls to hand over all of their earnings from prostitution, conducted strip searches to make sure they weren’t hiding money, and assaulted the girls as punishment for breaking rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two of the victims also said Smith had sex with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Smith is one in a number of convicted sex traffickers to receive a sentence that would outlast a natural life: in January 2017, Jawon Smith was sentenced to 102 years for sex trafficking and prostitution; Andre Adams was sentenced to 330 years for 10 counts of child prostitution in May 2016; and Leon Daniels was sentenced to 196 years for 17 counts related to sex trafficking in July 2016.

            PHOENIX — Today Jawon  Smith  (D.O.B.  11/27/1989)  was  sentenced  to 102  years in the  Department  of Corrections  for one  count  of  Sex  Trafficking,  four  counts of  Child Prostitution  and  one  count  of  Disorderly Conduct.
           </p>
           <p>
            “This defendant preyed on a young and vulnerable victim for his own gain through the most insidious means,” said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery. “This conviction  was  the  result  of the  dedicated  efforts  of our   prosecutors   and   law   enforcement   partners   to   aggressively   identify   sex   traffickers   and   hold them accountable.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The victim a then 15-year-old female, said she was recruited by Smith to work for him as a prostitute starting in April  of  2013.  The  victim  said she was forced by Smith to walk the street and solicit “car dates” where she would  perform  sexual  acts  for  payment. She  was  then  required  to  give  all  the  money  to  Smith, who  told  the victim she would be killed if she tried to leave.
           </p>
           <p>
            In December of 2014 the victim was rescued after an investigation by the Phoenix Police Department identified her as a sex trafficking victim. Ashort time later investigators took Smith into custody.

            PHOENIX – Judge Pamela Gates today sentenced Andre Antonio Adams (D.O.B. 3/8/1983) to a term of 330.75 years in the Arizona Department of Corrections for causing two 15-year-old girls to engage in prostitution and for providing them with drugs. A jury found Adams guilty last March on ten counts of child prostitution and two counts of transferring or selling drugs to a minor. He also has prior convictions for aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit sale of Marijuana and possession of Marijuana.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The severity of today’s sentence is proportionate to the insidiousness and depravity that surrounds the sexual exploitation of children,” said Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery. “This case also exemplifies the commitment of my Office to work diligently with our law enforcement partners to aggressively prosecute sex traffickers and protect the community from the harm they cause.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Detectives assigned to the Greater Phoenix Area Human Trafficking Task Force became aware of the two female victims in the case through advertisements posed on Backpage.com, a website frequently used to facilitate prostitution. After contacting the girls, investigators learned the two were 15 years old and listed as runaways. When interviewed, the girls stated they were working as prostitutes for a pimp known as “Chicago,” who knew both of their ages because they had told him. They related that “Chicago” would rent a hotel room for them to have sex with adult men and that he promised to protect them and provide them with money and marijuana.

            "Leon Jerome Daniels was found guilty on 17 counts related to the trafficking of three females--two adults and one minor--for sex. The alleged crimes happened around the time of the 2015 Super Bowl in Phoenix.
           </p>
           <p>
            …
           </p>
           <p>
            On January 30, 2015, the defendant reportedly brought three girls from California to Arizona to engage in prostitution. According to police, he told them that the trip would be a way make a lot of money since the Super Bowl was going to be held in the Valley at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police say he would drive the girls to prostitution "dates," take their earnings, post advertisements for them on www.Backpage.com and had strict "rules" to follow. He made them check in with him during their dates with the "Johns," told them how much to charge, and controlled who they talked to. He also had sexual intercourse with the 17-year-old minor victim and was verbally and physically abusive with an adult victim with whom he had a child in common.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to police, Daniels did everything in his power to dissuade his victims from coming to court or testifying against him. He represented himself through much of the trial and allegedly cross-examined the victims himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was after all the victims appeared and identified him in court that Daniels requested to have an attorney represent him. The State presented recordings of his calls from jail at trial in which the defendant talked about getting the victims not to appear for court or convincing them to not identify him if they did appear in court.”
