            And this is a reminder to all Agents, Assets, Politicians and Mk's that THINK they still have no choice:
           </p>
           <p>
            You still have a choice and there is still room for forgiveness. You were a precious child, a vessel, of purity - you were once clean. You can become clean again, in THIS lifetime. There ARE people out here that understand that you have become a product of your environment. There are people out here that understand that there are parts of you that you cannot control and things just happen, and have happened, according to your programming. Yes, you did something wrong, very wrong, and there is a penance to pay through your suffering, but there is compassion, empathy, and forgiveness.  It is not through God, or Jesus Christ, it is through people that understand that you were molded into a creature that has taken control over what better parts of you existed before the torture began.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many here that only see you for the monster you have become, and you are afraid of the mob justice that will come if you are ever discovered. That fear is palpable, it is strong, and stinks with a fervor that could only dictate one ending. I do not want that ending for you. I want people to KNOW that you were a preconditioned cog from the beginning and the forces that were inculcated into you by the pain and suffering they invoked upon you was not by your choice to begin with, you have never wanted to be part of this, and now that you are and have done so many terrible things you do not see forgiveness on the horizon, so why not just go on with the show? They would lynch me if they ever found out. No. Please. Noone who understands the human condition, and what they have done to you, would ever advocate death for you, I think this is one reason the founding fathers of America thought it was so important for a fair trial and the right to speak for yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            The revelations that have come out of the Mk-Ultra experiments, themselves having been a conglomeration of processes gleaned from the secret societies of the ancients, buddhism and the asthetic 'mysteries' of being human, combined with the Frankfurt model Rockefeller funded school model and the hollywood 'entertainment' machine there IS NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON ON THIS PLANET that is not effected by some form of MK-ULTRA programming. WE ARE ALL FUCKED UP. The sooner the world realizes this and struggles to push past their conditioning nothing in this world is going to change.
           </p>
           <p>
            Taking it back to the roots, we must judge, some will not be forgiven according to mans law, but with enough perseverance to the Golden Rule I personally will spearhead an effort so that any Agent, Asset, Politician or MK who wants to come clean and get back on the right side is treated with firmness yet fairly,  just and with empathy, as well as a proposal for a fully funded think tank on civil and just ways to deal with the disease that this world has been handed.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all Love, God Bless and God Speed.
