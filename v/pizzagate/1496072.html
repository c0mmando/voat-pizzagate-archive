<p>It\'s not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish.  It\'s not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily  comprised of Jews.  Judaism permits paedophilia.  It\'s no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses.  Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham.  The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I\'m making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of their religion.  
</p>
<p>Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism.  Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism.  Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community.  If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community.   Political correctness has no place in an investigation.  
</p>
<p>The Finders Cult </p>
<p>Pizzagate is nothing new.  There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children.  The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here\'s some information I\'ve compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new. </p>

<p>I\'ve identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who\'s behind them.  The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.  
</p>
<p>Here\'s the first Satanic band called Coven.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.</p>
<p><a href="http://sli.mg/senxlZ">http://sli.mg/senxlZ</a></p>
<p>Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.</p>
<p>Bill Traut Jewish
<a href="http://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut">http://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut</a></p>
<p>Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.</p>
<p>&quot;The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as &quot;the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio&quot;).&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.</p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.</p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.</p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.</p>
<p>&quot; You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm</a></p>
<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.</p>
<p><a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</a></p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at their lyrics now. What they\'re describing is Jewish blood libel.  Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don\'t forget these lyrics are written by a Jew. </p>
<p>Jewish Blood Libel 
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel</a></p>
<p>&quot; Infants\' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. &quot;</p>
<p>Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.</p>

<p>&quot;  In the book of Gideon I have read
That the hoarde of evil is not dead
In this place where Satan is said to dwell
He leads his legions through the depths of Hell&quot;</p>
<p>Gideon was the son of Joash,  leader of the Israelites, he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 \'valiant\' men.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon</a></p>
<p>&quot; 
Beelzebub, the prince, is second in line
Astaroth, the duke, is drunk with wine
Lucifer, the prime minister, handles affairs
General Satanachia firmly stares&quot;</p>
<p>All those demons are from the Hebrew bible. </p>
<p>This whole song describes Jewish Satanism.  Remember, this was written by a Jew. </p>

            Thats not even close to blame shifting. Blame shifting been going on in the schools teaching people the opposite of the truth. The slave trade for profit was Jewish and Islam started after Islam conquered Arabia. and went on to attack India, North Africa and Europe. All about 1300 years ago, that is when the slave trade began. Europeans, Indians fought it. Islamic Spain and France went on to conquer the south Americas and central and competed against the British for the north. Britsh became controlled by Jewish interests and allowed slave trade but fortunately not in all colonies. But the Jewish slave ships started hauling millions of Irish and other European slaves around to America, China, Africa etc.. European resistance to slavery is why American colonies fought for Independence and eventually slave trade only existed in the southern states, Europeans kept fighting on the political end but it was futile against the banks and slave trade. Eventually US had the civil war to end it and British parliament was duped by the anti-slavery members and won the vote due to lack of presence of the pro slavery elites.
           </p>
           <p>
            We won against the slave trade as did India, but the slave traded never ended in territories controlled by Islam. Today Sudanese Africans live in fear and face death everyday as the Islamist go rounding them up for slavery. Until Islam is stopped, this will continue.

            That's also not how you create assassins. They already have MKUltra.  The CIA can hire or train professionals that will indiscriminately without having to raise them Universal Soldier style.  This isn't how you'd do it.  If anything rogue Jewish elements within the CIA were working with them.  They were also heavily present in Russia.  They could have also been  spying on the Russians  for CIA protection.

            Everybody take note. This is a prime example of how shills try to invert reality. I've been investigating this stuff since long before Pizzagate and the timestamps on my Finders link proves it.  I'm trying to investigate these people and you're claiming that I'm defending them. Nice attempt at inverting reality.

            Even if you are correct, this does quite little to identify those involved. It only serves as a great potential soundbyte for the MSM waterworks about "fake news". "Oh, look, those awful Pizzagaters are anti-Semitic too! Look at the horrible stuff they're saying about Jews!"

            In my research of the Finders I haven't seen anywhere them being tied to Judaism... Seems pretty shill-like to all of the sudden tie them with some sort of anti-semitism - which is exactly the type of thing that discredits investigations such as these.

              I saw that post already.
             </p>
             <p>
              Still begs the question:
             </p>
             <p>
              Where in the links you mentioned have any of the names you provided? Ive been reading on peopleshistory.net and there's a lot of good information there... I never saw a link to any of the members of the Finders. It became a "CIA internal matter". It'd be kind of sloppy to have it suddenly be taken over by upper-echelon government and yet still have names of the active members published? I wanna see the exact link and how you came to the conclusion that they were all Jewish.  I'm not against new information - but when you're wording it like every other anti-semitic troll running around blaming the Jews for everything it gets hard to jump on board.

               For all you know I'm an orthodox Jew.  You really want to call me antisemitic?

              <p>
               I've already compiled their names.  All the links are there.  It was a CIA internal matter because the Finders were linked to communist Russia and they probably had plants spying on the Russians.
              </p>
              <p>
               Their fucking names were published in newspapers.

                "never even graduated high school".....You should have stayed. Your "Judaism is Satanism" argument is a well known Logical Fallacy called the "Association Fallacy". In other words you can't impugn an entire group of people based on what only a few believe. ;-)
 
1. Premise A is a B
2. Premise A is also a C
3. Conclusion Therefore, all Bs are Cs

             Essentially its how AIPAC came to power, how AIPAC controls the USA GOV, and yes dear its 100% about pedophilia orchestrated from Israel (MOSSAD/CIA). Nothing Jewish, its 100% Satanic.

                  These pedo crimes, including the FINDERS and all other pedo rings are religion, culture, geography, and partisan -friendly. I guarantee you it is not only Jews committing these crimes. To promote that sort of bullshit is misleading, noise and lazy. When you prioritize myopic Jew ranting devoid of rational though over THE CHILDREN WHO ARE DYING by plastering that crap all over this forum, it's clear to everyone else that your purpose here only to proselytize your Jew-hate. No one gives a fuck and you're contributing absolutely nothing towards our very difficult investigation. Take that shit elsewhere.
