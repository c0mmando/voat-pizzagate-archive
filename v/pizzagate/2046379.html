            I literally remember my elementary school making a HUGE deal out of showing (terrorizing and programming) Fantasia to us in kindergarten, bribed with cookies and milk, what I remember from that dimly lit room with the old style projector reels and rickety camera would leave such a lasting impression it's one of the strongest memories of my youngest experiences at school. I can still feel the aura of the room and the reaction from me and my classmates to the film.

            Paul Joseph Goebbels once said if you tell a lie long enough it will eventually become the truth, meaning, it doesn't matter if you believe the lie initially, if enough people start saying it and repeating it it will eventually be believed. The same works with a human, the ONLY way most times anyone is ever good at anything is because of repetition, memorization and learning by rote. Do something long enough you'll be a master of it. This, however, is also a human trait that is exploited by Hollywood and ALL media.

            If you really think about how influential music, movies and tv really are you will finally start seeing how deeply wrapped up in this matrix of their design you really are. They've known for a long time that if you want to begin splitting a person's mind and personality you have to traumatize them  as a child severely from 1 to 7, in their formative years. What early to late 70's and 80's children got for role models and teachers was Andy griffith, magnum pi, Gilligan, happy days, the hulk, a-team, mash, three's company, family ties, star wars, star trek, gi joe the list goes on and on...
           </p>

            Each and every one of them had programming elements in them, embedded, repeated over and over again to create markers...   for triggers, later on and throughout your life,

            Since the revelations of the nazi/hollywood collaboration film studio/military base hidden in the Hollywood hills called lookout mountain laboratory was revealed that produced over 19000 military test reels and mk-ultra themed test reels sent to various doctors all around the country and canada, the infiltration of  project paperclip nazi's in every american social, economic,  science, governmental and entertainment  field after WWII means those that financed their rape of  germany could come home to roost and start the subversive technique all over again on america, this time, because of the size of the country it has taken 70 years to subvert america compared to 20 years for the much smaller germany. The first two world wars were manufactured as a ritual formula and a magick alchemical spell to create the state of israel. Hitler and his top khazar/ashkenazi/sabbatean cabalist baal worshipers raped germany as hired mercenaries to kill ordinarily religious Sephardic jews as a blood sacrifice for the temple yet to be built, it only needs one more sacrifice to make israel the financial and religious center of the world, WWIII. (under baal, satan, lucifer, enki, what ever entity we call evil incarnate of anunnaki scum).

            Combine this with the Frankfurt model Rockefeller/Carnegie funded public schools were the bright, emotional and sensitive get sorted and culled into artists, teachers, the dumber are shuffled toward factory and military, and the dickheads are culled for cops and government.

            Satanic symbolism and sigil magick all around us, right in front of us, sometimes as simple as Hegelian dialectic, pitting two opposites to achieve a synthesis (capitalism vs. communism = 'democratic' socialism (that quickly escalates back into fascist dictatorship.) But, the kids and most adults are programmed to BE somewhere or somethin, someone else, but people are conned by harry potter type magic and superhero powers so long into their adult life their dysfunctional as hell.

            This statement and it's implication are 100% accurate. Like Hugh Hefner's Playboy as a honeypot, extortion ring and desensitization tool for the masses Disney is worldwide ambient MK-ULTRA programming machine, and a huge one. From indoctrinating children in kindergarten to occult and magic(k) with Fantasia to the prince and princess programming, every story they prostitute are occult 'masterpieces'. In fact, Disney's remake of Alice in Wonderland with Johnny depp is, along with the original, a veritable template on how to split the personality into multiples.
