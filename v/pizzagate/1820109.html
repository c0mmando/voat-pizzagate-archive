<p>John Perkins (born January 28, 1945) is an American author. His best known book is Confessions of an Economic Hit Man (2004), in which Perkins claims to have played a role in an alleged process of economic colonization of Third World countries on behalf of what he portrays as a cabal of corporations, banks, and the United States government. This book spent more than 70 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has been published in at least 32 languages, and is used in many college and university programs.[citation needed]</p>
<p><strong>Economic hit men</strong> (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. They funnel money from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign &quot;aid&quot; organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet’s natural resources. Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization. I should know; I was an EHM.&quot;</p>

            From Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             As Chief Economist at Chas. T. Main, Perkins and his staff advised the World Bank, United Nations, IMF, U.S. Treasury Department, Fortune 500 corporations, and countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. He worked directly with heads of state and CEOs of major companies. Perkins's time at Chas T. Main provides the basis for his subsequent published claims that, as an "economic hit man", he was charged with inducing developing countries to borrow large amounts of money, designated to pay for questionable infrastructure investments, but ultimately with a view to making the debt-laden countries more dependent, economically and politically, upon the West.
In the 1980s Perkins left Main and founded and directed an independent energy company. In the book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, Perkins claims that
             <strong>
              his company was successful due to 'coincidences' orchestrated by those appreciative of his silence about the work he says he did
             </strong>
             as an economic hit man
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein has done incredibly well with his 'businesses' and I've no doubt that he's been successful for the same reasons.

            Does someone know a way of filtering out the echo? I'm a Dutch speaker and might want to attempt to transcribe what he says because it's extremely interesting. I've only heard a bit of the beginning and he also speaks of the psychopathic side of the story (e.g. people prepared to loose their children to gain more and more). The sound is of really poor quality though and it's exhausting to listen to for 75 min. I sometimes don't even understand certain words. Don't have much time though so it could take many weeks before I'm done. Just saying...

            Great work.  We need to learn everything we can about Ronald Bernard and the people he associated with.  With enough research and a little luck we'll be able to identify a couple of the Luciferians he discusses in his interview.  Remember he said most of the people he knew then are dead now.  He could have been speaking metaphorically, that their soul and conscience is "dead", but let's just assume he meant actually dead.  Keep an eye out for Dutch &amp; European finance specialists who died within the last 10 years.

             The time frame should be much bigger than that. In one of the other interviews with him (possibly the one from OP's last link), I believe he mentions 1995 and I believe (really not sure) that's when he broke down. The memory is very blurry though, I should watch everything over again. But the year 1995 stayed with me.

             I think he was referring to most of his colleagues who'd taken the drugs/alcohol route of dealing with what they were doing.  I've watched it again and I don't think he's referring to his "clients" (clients?  Almost sanitises the evil within, doesn't it?). I can think of better descriptions.

              Yes, correct, his colleagues who took the substance abuse route ... but I wouldn't doubt at all that Bernard knows much more than he is telling. (Including info on the banker "suicides.")

              Some of these "suicides" (like the one for Monte Paschi in Italy) were more likely murders to cover financial wrongdoings IMHO...

              This! I wondered why so many of these bankers committed suicide in the last few years and there are around 23 of them. They are also not suicides when you read all the details of them.

               This is very good (clip below) ... although my favorite is the banker who committed suicide with a nail gun. (Search bar on Zero Hedge.)

                Mind control murder, murder or suicide. Could be a combo of all three. MK victims have code words that dictate to them what they are supposed to do. IIRC Dr Green can be used as a reference when telling a mind control subject to kill themselves.
