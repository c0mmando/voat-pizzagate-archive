            I found this rabbit hole a few years ago and it's one of those things like cp being overwhelming on Twitter. You wouldn't expect it to be so prevalent but somehow it is there and doesn't get taken down. But "hate speech" on the other hand gets censored the same day sometimes
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a trick that was found, I don't remember exactly but if you search for a date and the word webcam or some exact phrase that specific webcams use in the saved filename ie: " august 13 2018 webcam"  it brings back hideous results that are too well populated with just little girls dancing candidly in front of the cam with obvious pedo closeups , wierd framing and just dancing videos. I will see if i can find any of those old threads but iirc it was much before pg

            Sick. Instagram is FULL of this stuff too. Little girls who dance and model. They all have thousands of followers too. Virtually all pedos. One in particular a blonde haired blue eyed American girl about ten years old has her own mother taking all the photos and videos of her in sexually suggestive poses. Incredibly sad. She was on the Instagram live feed and all grown men were on there posting questions and talking to her as she filmed her little daughter in their backyard jumping on a trampoline and the deadbeat mother was telling the girl to say thank you to these perverts giving her compliments. Then the question was asked why she was filming her young daughter in this way online for pedos and she cut the video right there. She knows. Incredibly horrible parents do this to their kids. Childhood doesn’t last long and these kids grow to be adults and that cash flow will end and the relationship will never be repaired.

              Diana's resting place is a mausoleum on an island in a private estate. The water surrounding her has Black Swans floating around it - perhaps an indicator of why she was killed?

            Eastern Europe definitely has a Satanic underbelly going on there with the massive sex trafficking that occurs there. The origin of the word "slave" comes from Slav. Massive amounts of Jews settled through this region due to Khazaria's collapse. There is definitely some demented stuff occurring among the Eastern European elites.

              Wow wtf indeed. I considered checking out those links but thought they might be much worse than the YouTube videos. Perhaps I will look further. Thanks for taking that step.
