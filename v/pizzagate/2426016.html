            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/wincraft71">
             @wincraft71
            </a>
            , thank you for your submission. A special thanks for the transcription of the first video. Appreciated.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you to add some info in the headline about what 'Worldcorpo' is, why it is relevant for pizzagate, and why we should take another look at their website. Thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please add two or three sentences at the top of your post explaining in more detail what 'Worldcorpo' is and why it is relevant for pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please edit this description of the second video you linked: 'What do you think of the original fatherhood video?' and add some info as to what the video is about, you might want to mention that we already discussed the video here on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            and might want to link to a previous post. (The latter is only a suggestion.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, headlines can't be edited on Voat, therefore I would like to ask you to self-delete, edit, and repost. Please do so within the next 24 hours.

            The video depicts an enraged male yelling at a child through a shower door, with only the shadow of the child being visible. He hits the shower door with a broom repeatedly to scare the child. Again there appears to some sort of electrical flashing and crackling behind the door.

            <strong>
             For those of you who don't want to watch the first video listed, I have a description I wrote in a thread when it first came out
            </strong>
            :
           </p>
           <p>
            The video depicts a young child (I would guess like elementary age) in a shower similar to the one that we saw from the other video but this time there's a flashlight shining on him and at least two guys standing there. Throughout the video there seems to be an electrical flashing and crackling noise coming from the floor of the shower. Also, it seems that there is some sort of bag over the child's head, and they are wearing pajama pants with no shirt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Approximately transcribed audio:

            The last one where he is screaming and yelling at the child, that is already abusive.  Unfortunately people think of abuse as severe abuse, but screaming and yelling at a child over and over is very abusive to a child's psyche.  Ad  the abusive language and words and you have just doubled the abuse.  I think there is much more going on there as well.  Someone that loses their control like that can always go over that boundary.  I remember when we discussed this before some said it was not his voice because his voice is lower than in the video.   I think not.  I think when a person becomes so enraged their voice goes up not down.  Also, I have always seen JP as a very high strung person and someone that could crack easily.  You know those people, everything is alright until somethings goes wrong, or someone tells them NO.

             Thanks for checking it out

             . Exactly, this is mentally and psychologically abusive and confining somebody through coercion in that small space and yelling at them and who knows what else is terribly damaging to a kid's mind. It can cause fractures and dissociation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before there was a guy allegedly from Boston who claimed it couldn't be Podesta because he "doesn't have a Boston accent". I argued with him but he insisted that somehow the whole thing must be fake just because the accent. Regardless who it is, it's still real child abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Secondly there was a guy on here that said the whole site was fake or a 4chan troll because they "hotlinked" videos. And he tried to make other people feel dumb for thinking it's real and implied that they don't know how the internet works or how technology works. But I think that was an attempt to discredit the evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Going back to what you're saying about rage and emotions, I agree that when people are in a different state of mind their voice can change. For all we know it could be a psychological break or a different personality, because the abuser might have lots of issues or gone through abuse themselves.

              I agree with everything you have said.  The ones that disagreed seem very much like shills to me.  I really don't think that JP has that heavy of an accent.  He was born and raised in Chicago. He took on a little bit of variance in speech but nothing like the Kennedys. My Lord. Yes, my heart goes out to the boy.
