             According to the South China Morning Post, Huaxing Capital’s valuation of Naked Hub was $1 billion in July 2017. Over the next six months, its valuation shrunk by nearly half. Last year, Naked Hub completed a $33 million Series B financing led by Hong Kong-based Gaw Capital. Previously, its operation funds were from the parent company Naked Brand Group.

             <strong>
              Naked Brand Group, Inc.

             Strauss and his partners are the masterminds behind some of the most successful nightclub and restaurant brands to open in the past decade, including Marquee, TAO, Avenue and LAVO. They currently operate six of the top 16 highest grossing nightlife venues in the country according to Nightclub &amp; Bar’s 2015 Top 100 list.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1997 Jason Strauss and Noah Tepperberg founded Strategic Group, offering consumers a premium nightlife experience with their various events and venues.  Former hot spots include include: Southampton staples Conscious Point (1999), Jet East (2002), and Dune (2007) as well as Manhattan boîtes, Luahn (2000) and Suite 16 (2001).

             Mehmet Cengiz Öz (Turkish: [mehˈmet dʒenˈɟiz øz]; born June 11, 1960),[1] known professionally as Dr. Oz, is a Turkish American[2][3][4] television personality, cardiothoracic surgeon,
             <strong>
              Columbia University professor
             </strong>
             , pseudoscience promoter,[5] and author.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oz came to general prominence with appearances on The Oprah Winfrey Show beginning in 2004, and later on Larry King Live and other TV programs. In 2009, The Dr. Oz Show, a daily television program focusing on medical issues and personal health, was launched by Winfrey's Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures.

             He is a proponent of alternative medicine, and has been criticized by physicians, government officials, and publications, including Popular Science and The New Yorker, for giving non-scientific advice and promoting pseudoscience. In a Senate hearing on weight loss scams, Senator Claire McCaskill chided Oz, saying: "The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of the three products you call miracles".[8] In 2014 the British Medical Journal examined over 400 medical or health recommendations from 40 episodes of his program and found that only 46% of his claims were supported by reputable research, while 15% of his claims contradicted medical research and the remainder of Oz's advice were either vague banalities or unsupported by research.

              There is a Pizza place hidden in the Cosmo hotel which is not directly advertised anywhere. It is known simply as "secret pizza." I've been there before and as far as I can tell there is no child-raping going on, it's just a pizza place that's kind of hidden away. The Cosmo is set up a little differently from other casinos, rather than being spread out, it's got a casino on the first floor and then 4 or 5 floors above it of restaurants, shops and the Marquee nightclub. It's also a five-star hotel that may not want a low-brow slice bar for the commoners, so it's easy to hide on one of the higher floors and the fact that it doesn't fit with the rest of the ambiance explains why it's hidden (along with some reverse-psychology marketing).

                 I bet he'd believe your username, eh? ;-)   We should do an end of year thank you thread for all the spouses, friends, parents etc. who make it possible for us all to invest so much time here. I know a number of early heavy contributors have had to bow out because their personal lives couldn't support the time investment.

                  I'm almost sure that I've seen (or heard) a more recent interview where she changes that and says it's not but I don't remember where I saw that.  :-(

               The pontiff apparently is interested in discussing how the church is perceived by Western media influencers and ways to improve its portrayal in entertainment. The Vatican, which is said to be working with the nonprofit Varkey Foundation, came up with a list of Hollywood players to invite to a summit of sorts. Film and television producer Brian Grazer, OWN mogul Oprah Winfrey, actor Matt Damon and semiretired supermogul David Geffen also scored invites, according to sources.

               WME declined to comment on whether Emanuel, the brother of Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and the inspiration for Entourage's Ari Gold, would accept the invitation to break bread with the Catholic Church leader.
              </p>
              <p>
               "The Varkey Foundation has been in discussions with representatives of the Vatican about a potential meeting examining the role of media on the values of young people throughout the world," a foundation spokesperson stated. "Recent media speculation about the purpose and possible participants of such a meeting is inaccurate and premature. The meeting under consideration is emphatically not a discussion about the reputation of the Catholic Church and never has been."

             in the increasingly competitive shared office market is its appeal to productivity-minded business professionals. Kitchens and lounge areas are provided in the centres, but there is no mention on Gravity’s corporate website of either
             <strong>
              ping-pong tables or beer on tap

             I would however add that ping pong, beer and food are standard office perks in the tech world. I know several guys who had to ditch Foosball in their offices because it gave them tendonitis; ping pong doesn't cause as many repetitive strain injuries that making coding hell.

              <p>
               And in 2015, almost two years since that first tour, a 200,000-square-foot WeWork will be the anchor tenant of the $300 million redevelopment co-owned by
               <strong>
                Boston Properties in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
               </strong>
               Plans are afoot for another partnership in San Francisco and perhaps Boston down the road.

              <p>
               WeWork's founders have been content to stay quiet about their story until now, swearing investors to secrecy. No longer. Over the next 12 months the company expects to triple its membership from 14,000 to 46,000 and expand to 60 locations from 21 today and 9 just a year ago. WeWork's first location four years ago was just 3,000 square feet in SoHo with creaky floorboards and walls power-washed by its founders. Now WeWork is the fastest-growing lessee of new office space in New York and next year will become the fastest-growing lessee of new space in America as it spreads to cities such as Austin and Chicago, not to mention London, Amsterdam and Tel Aviv.

               My mind is now starting to think crazy thoughts (based on what I currently know about context of Pizzagate)! What is going on in the ground floor of 1644 North Capital currently?!?! Remember, there was the General Contractor (AG Consulting Services) who ALSO is a MINING EQUIPMENT wholesaler. It again makes me think about the possibility of tunnels!

              Using that key I've translated the headline on the page of the left, and the top half of the page nearest. The headline reads "
              <strong>
               Queer Magic
              </strong>
              ". The first part of the page nearest reads: "
              <strong>
               Magic is a tool of the subverted and oppressed for personal growth and confidence. It is a beautiful tragic necessity, the maintenance of an _________ soul
              </strong>
              ".

              Now, I know that there are a few characters close to these guys that are actual witches and they admit it so themselves. It looks like we have at least one more here as well.

               lol reminiscent of shit I've seen from outlets in (of course) Portland Seattle etc. where witches cast protective 'hexes' for 'trans youth', I guess when the bathroom issue was topical.  additionally they do it for e.g. against Kavanaugh.

              So, listening to Jimmy Church's radio show on youtube from 9th Jan I was struck when Jimmy &amp; Brad talked for a while about the tunnel system in California that parts predated the building of the city, and other parts were built to connect mansions and clubs together, including the Playboy mansion and The California Club. I haven't started digging into this yet, but there could well be serious correlation with the

              I deduced all of that over a year ago and went into some of the LA tunnels but failed to enter the California Club.  I will give you some stuff, but only because you're not a total cunt like the others here.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Okay, I did a little research... Chris Crocker (born Christopher Darren Cunningham) did the "Leave Brittney alone" youtube video, got famous and then did a gay porn for Chi Chi La Rue, there was a documentary was made about him by Chris Moukarbel called Me @ the Zoo. Chris and Alefantis are producers that work together on films, Alefantis is the art scene connection and Moukarbel did a film about a viral street graffiti artist that was a graffiti criminal that was not identified, his art was being sold at a high price. Now we are seeing this stuff pop up... this site
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KUIwEy5gS6dE3imFyFUTw">
              https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KUIwEy5gS6dE3imFyFUTw
             </a>
             does youtube vids on human trafficking condemning capitalism as the root cause, including stuff by Bree Olsen ex girlfriend of Charlie Sheen that complains about the stigma against sex workers and that stuff was everywhere for a while Bree making the rounds making sure everybody knew how unfair it was she can't get a job working with kids just because she did porn etc. Moukarbel also did a lot of work on a series about sex. All that can be found out through IMDB. Chris Moukarbel was born in New Haven, CT and lived between Washington DC and NYC.
             <strong>
              Moukarbel's partner since 2004 is Jake Shears, frontman of the rock band Scissor Sisters
             </strong>
             a lewd gay band.
             <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissor_Sisters">
              https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissor_Sisters
             </a>
             performed with Gaga and did worked with Elton John. etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             So here's my theory. As part of a campaign to "end human trafficking" which the left will blame on patriarchy and capitalism so that they can bring in more socialism under the guise of protecting children the left is employing artists and youtube stars, gay porn stars, etc. to produce films about the subject for internet release and those youtube vids I just linked to is part of it. The money might be funneled through NEA and anti-trafficking divisions, etc. Which is why we are seeing people from those groups all around the pizzagate story. And so I theorize that's what the meeting was about. They are coordinating the campaign and getting it all together. Either that or they are running prostitutes to the politicians, which I figure is just as likely considering the previous scandal during the George W. Bush admin. Those are probably the best case scenarios that I can come up with. I know another overnight guest at the WH during Clinton admin. was Saban Haim/Haim Saban connected to Sea to Sky Entertainment, Thunderbird Entertainment, which connects back to Cory Feldman and Cory Haim through Clinton connected people like David Geffen and a child actor's award show/event, but that's another subject, but a very very very very important one that ties this all back to Hollywood and a pool party/fundraiser that involves Clinton. So my theory of a media campaign like I said is the best case scenario, but it would make some sense of all this.

              Okay, my patience is really running thin here now. I know the answer to most (definitely not all) of those questions. In addition, I have a tech background so I'm fully aware of the involvement of the tech industry.

              If you genuinely have anything of value to add, spit it out.  If you're here to divert people, I'm happy to say 'you're wasting your time'. I suggest you make better use of it.
