            just want to ad:  DuPont: Influence / Lobbying
           </p>

            Links with government
           </p>
           <p>
            Not surprisingly DuPont has strong links with government in the US. In  2002, DuPont CEO and Chairman, Charles Holliday Jr. was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.Another of the company’s directors, Richard H. Brown, is a member of the President's Advisory Committee on Trade and Policy Negotiations and of the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. Also among DuPont’s directors is William K Reilly, formerly administrator of the United Stated Environmental Protection Agency.Another of DuPont’s directors, Charles M. Vest is a member of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology
The company also has links with government in other parts of the world. Another of DuPont’s board members is Masahisa Naitoh, 
At the UN level, another DuPont director, Göran Lindahl

            DuPont has been criticised for its ‘greenwashing’ in schools. For example it produced a poster for schools titled "Less is More -- Learning About Source Reduction," but neglected to mention its own dumping problem.  they still have not paid their fine to epa, or cleaned up their act-------polluting the lake in wisconsin
 The company has also taken to sponsoring museum exhibitions, such as a recent exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in the US.

If someone on here could have use "MUH ULTRA ELITE HAXXOR POWERZ" to bring down one of these fucks, don't you think they would have done it already?

            How in the holy name of fuck would ANYONE here have personal names, dates, and communication records for high-ranking elites? I'm tired of this "where's the evidence" shit, people like you acted the same way with James Alefantis, "he's innocent until proven otherwise; pictures on his Instagram don't prove a thing." We could spend all day making a list of actors/directors/producers and films that they've starred in/created that have pedo overtones, FBI pedo symbols everywhere, strange pizza references, etc., and ALL of it would amount to "that's not real evidence" to you. Yet the kind of evidence that you seek is unattainable by people of our stature, unless some high-ranking official browses Voat (and isn't a shill). So what you're saying is this:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I require evidence that I know you cannot obtain, therefore I will never be satisfied with anything you put forth, and therefore I consider all of these people completely innocent until someone actually has photographic evidence of them performing a Satanic ritual with a child and killing them afterwards. THEN I will believe it."
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck off with that shit, pickle-licker.

            Pardon me for clearly not possessing the vast amount of intellect that you do. I'm sorry for getting mad when I think about Masons and Rabbis raping children, and laughing at all of us while doing it, knowing that even if people do start asking questions, dumbasses like you will be on the front line to shout: "NOT ALL JEWS! ANTI-SEMITE! ITS ANNODAH SHOAH!!"

            I'm not going to lose one wink of sleep just because you think I'm an internet meanie who says naughty words about Jews. If you think you're getting some kind of a rise out of me, you're wrong, friend. You're the one ranting like a lunatic and acting like Judaism has NO PLACE in PizzaGate, no relevance whatsoever. You're wrong, and everyone knows you're wrong.

            Saville and Sandusky were part of pedophile rings, which involve Masons, which involve the teachings of Crowley, which includes the Babylonian Talmud. THAT'S how religion ties into everything. The "fake Jews," whatever you want to refer to them as, they are at the top of the pyramid. Families like the Rothschilds, the Rockfellers, etc. They are all part of this "Jewish" cabal. But no, we definitely shouldn't look into that connection whatsoever.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people are all part of secret societies that promote/teach pedophilia, and the practices they teach come straight from Kaballah and from the Talmud. And YOU'RE too stupid to see THAT.

            Just answer one question for me. Why does the Talmud exist, and why is it considered a holy book of Judaism? Why does it contain verses about Rabbis being able to fuck gentile children as long as they are three years old? Why does it say that Jesus Christ is in Hell, boiling in human shit? Why does it say that Jews should LIE TO NON-JEWS about their true beliefs? Why does it say that the Goyim would rise up and kill all the Jews if they revealed the truth to them?
           </p>
           <p>
            My question is simple. Why does the Talmud exist, and why is it a Holy Book of the Jewish faith, when it is such a vile piece of filth?

            You must stop looking towards the courts to realistically sentence these pedos for their crimes. Wanna know why? It's simple.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Invalidity of gentile courts (he:ערכאות של גויים) is a talmudic rule regarding gentile courts in Judaism. ... Jewish law requires disputes to be settled by a Jewish court (beth din) under the laws of the torah. It is forbidden to settle disputes in a court ruled by gentile laws.

            You know what makes my blood boil? When I hear stories like this, and I try to spread the information around to coworkers, friends, family, etc., the common response I get is disgust, followed by an "oh well I hope he gets some help" sort of attitude. I've noticed that NO ONE seems to get really, really mad about this and say "Hang him," or "That guy should be put to death." Is this part of the normalization? Making people view pedophilia (even as low as fucking a THREE YEAR OLD) as a sickness like AIDS or the flu, rather than seeing it as a deformity of a person's soul.
           </p>
           <p>
            People's reactions to these types of stories sometimes sickens me even more than the actual crime itself. I can't understand how anyone could NOT be boiling over with rage after hearing something like this. Anyone else have this experience when discussing these things with normies?

             Yes, exactly. The "hope" is that they can make these people control their urges, because they know they cannot get rid of them completely. Which is why I advocate for killing pedos via gassing.

             LUCIFER &gt; ALEISTER CROWLEY'S TEACHINGS AND OTHER ESOTERIC WRITINGS &gt; SECRET SOCIETIES
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to be a politician, musician, or anyone with fame/power/influence, you must join a secret society. Within, you will learn about Crowley's teachings, Blavatsky, Anton LaVey, all that good shit, and once you've put in your time and paid your dues you'll be asked to do "something" to go higher in the organization. This will mean a sacrifice or a ritual of some kind. Rinse, repeat. These people live to do rituals to propel them into the next level of the power structure. Like I said, complex, but easy to understand. The complex thing is how there are SO MANY secret societies, and finding direct connections between them can be hard, but they all teach the same Aleister Crowley, esoteric garbage.

            A DYNASTY OF SATANIC ROYALTY
           </p>
           <p>
            "John Dale wrote a book The Prince and The Paranormal which goes into the secret occult activities of the British royal family, especially Prince Charles, but also many other royal family members too. Besides the secret occult activities of the British Monarch, they have been openly leaders of Freemasonry ( see the Appendix of Be Wise As Serpents for a detailed chart on this.) The du Ponts are similar to these families in that they too are a dynasty, they too have a very public image, and they too have a totally hidden life. In fact, the du Ponts have better control over the press's coverage of them than the British Royal Family.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the clues that the family is a top Satanic family are the frequency of marriages between relatives of the du Pont descendants. Few people are aware of the immense importance bloodlines play in the upper levels of Satanism. Blood is believed to carry the occult power. Unless a person has the correct blood he or she will not rise to the highest levels of Satanism. The du Ponts have intermarried with the Balls and the Gardners. These other families are known to be involved with the Illuminati and Satanism."

            We have the proof of the cover-up just here:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The lawsuit provides in-depth details about a child rape case that Delaware authorities never disclosed publicly and did not receive media attention

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Since when are criminal lawsuits not public? Does Delaware has special statuses that allow legally the court to classify a court case as confidential? Under which specific circumstances is that supposed to happen?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if Delaware has this kind of statuses, I would assume this is meant to protect the reputation of the defendent until he is found guilty. In that case though, the crime is odious, and the defendent pleaded guilty. I don't see any reasonable reason that this court case shouldn't be made public other than as a way to cover up.

             I do not know the answers to your questions, but I do know that it is common knowledge among residents in the State of Delaware that the entire state is "owned by the DuPont family."   And while I do not understand exactly how or why the tax structure is different there, I do know that property taxes are very low, there is no state sales tax, and that many  people retire there, and credit card companies are based there, for these low-or-no-tax reasons.

             In addition, there is a Monarch mind control/SRA survivor from Arden, Delaware who speaks of, and against, the Pedo Satanic rings of that area:

             One thing I never understood was why Beau had to die when he paid his dues by giving this rapist a pass.  Was there something I missed?  Or is that what his father had to give up to be our next President.  Because if you have not heard, he was forming an exploratory PAC.

               I meant to ask that as a question not a statement for I do not have proof.  We all have read many reports regarding of what our govt. is able to do.  Of course I have no proof.  That was meant as a supposition.

              I don't know, Beau's death was the reason Biden gave for not running. Maybe HRC killed Beau when she found out about the PAC, because you know, it was her turn.

               Could be.  Because he is forming one now.  Now that her turn has come and gone.  He will run against Bernie Sanders.  Another repeat of the last election.  They plan on winning this time.  We have to make sure Biden does not win.  If Trump pans out to help kill the swamp then I will be satisfied either way, but I believe Sanders to be a better candidate for the people.  I was just happy she did not win.  I fought tooth and nail for Bernie because I hated her so.  Still do for what she has done against our country's children.  It is nothing we discovered here through some magical divine intervention.  It is all on the internet and all we have to do is talk to the very poor of this country.

                I'm with you. Biden is an ass. He promoted Clarence Thomas to SCOTUS and all those videos of him groping children, Ick. He's got baggage with the other son, isn't Hunter running some Ukrainian Oil company? and obviously Beau letting off this Dupont sleazebag. Like the rest, he needs to go home and stay there.

                 On  my list to watch is the take down of Anita Hill by Biden, Kerry and Ted Kennedy.  They paved the way for Thomas and his appt. to the Supreme Court.  Yes, Biden needs to be sent to a home alright.

                  seriously spend your time doing something happy.  it will just make you sad and angry, and you already know the result. TK is dead and JK is pretty much out and Biden is the next to go. CT is mostly comatose so hopefully dead soon.
