<p>A cover for this <strong>pedophilia-alchemical-spirit-cooking-like message</strong> is on their  <a href="http://archive.is/NTei0#selection-715.0-715.22">Values</a> page; the average AP owner is 26.  Who, by the way, are surely not all involved in Pedogate, if any even are.</p>

<li><strong>Social Media and Baby Pizza Makers Course:</strong></li>

<p>This month one AP is running a “baby pizza makers” course for ages 3-12.</p>
<p><strong>An alarming message came up when I machine translated a post:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even today sold out at the courses of &quot;Tutti Pazzi per la Pizza&quot; at Alice Pizza . <strong>And see how</strong> 😊 😊 <strong>pizza spread their first pizza</strong>😊</p>

<p>But when I put it into archive.is, then translated, I saw this:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://kek.gg/i/766Ggv.png">this food blogger’s tweet</a> is what led me to the AP baby pizza makers course. </p>

<p>I am appalled that a takeout pizza place named Alice Pizza  – “The True Name of Pizza” – was founded just steps away from the “sacred” Vatican’s police station and their jail!!  Fortunately for us, they are going to bury themselves with all their showing off.</p>

           The A appears to be a symbol.  Maybe it is a stylized version of a masonic mark, which they claim are benign, seen around the world including at

           I am appalled that a takeout pizza place named Alice Pizza  – “The True Name of Pizza” – was founded just steps away from the “sacred” Vatican’s police station and their jail!!  Fortunately for us, they are going to bury themselves with all their showing off.

            There was a show several years ago on food network I believe called Man vs. Food. The host would visit different restaurants and then participate in a challenge regarding eating the food. That's what I thought of when I saw the Man vs. Pizza. Hopefully that is inncoently just about food and not about a filthy pedo.

             You're funny, no you actually made me smile.  True, a single anchovy is alice in Italian.  But why would anyone name their pizza company "Me &amp; Anchovy"?

             As the company's name is "Me &amp; Alice" :

              Does it matter?   You've built a whole theory based on nothing.  You don't know or why they chose they name, but you are acting like you.  This is another country, another language, you have no clue of what connotations the name has in Italy.

              “Raped and Freezin'” has been called a “hilarious and gorgeously catchy” take on the idea of sexual harassment by PopMatters's Jason Thompson.[9] "Unfinished Sweet" is about visiting a dentist with sound effects recorded by Gerry Lyon.[9] The title track was co-written by Reggie Vinson (credited on original pressings of the album as “R. Reggie,” i.e., “Rockin' Reggie Vinson”), who had played guitar on and performed vocals for School's Out (1972).[10] Donovan described the song as a "horror story song".[11] The album's closing track, “I Love the Dead”, is a tongue-in-cheek song about necrophilia.

              I am letting this out slowly to the community so as not to keep awake. Alice in chains. What does that mean in pedo code? New Alice in Chains book reveals Courtney Love's suspicion that Kurt Cobain did not commit suicide. She had him killed. Mentors was a sick Satanic band and she contracted them.They were extremely disposable to the Satanists because they had very few album sales. Dead behind the railroad tracks.

            You mean a clerical serviced apartment in the middle of rome right? Cos they dont send priests to jail. They recall them, hide them, then give them 'diplomatic immunity' when demanded for extradition despite by law having no diplomatic service or department of foreign affairs.

             That's exactly what I meant!  Forgot to say that, thanks.  I have no idea how they would do it, but I don't think Capella will serve any time in what has been described as a small jail.  I think someone even sued the Vatican over the conditions in that jail.   In my humble opinion, either they remodeled it for him to live in luxury, and he will leave in a disguise whenever he wants to, or, some poor guy who resembles him will take his place, maybe with the former "diplomat" showing up when there's an interview scheduled, and then he'll return to a luxury Catholic clergy and staff retreat.  I seem to remember Laura Silsby Gayler rented a hotel in the Dominican Republic to hold the kidnapped children that served as a Catholic staff and clerical retreat.

             Not that all Catholic priests/other staff are evil, obviously.

              olph-retreat.org Fishing buddies told me they heard children screaming there. They have since changed their website to not include that they take in troubled children from around the world. Google map it. It is surrounded by a mostly natural moat in alligator infested water. Front gate is a not so friendly piece. Isolated for that part of the USA.

                The first link came out as some politician from Wisconsin? Anyways, the second link looks picturesque, but completely surrounding that picture is some real Florida swamp. The original website also said they brought in troubled families. I would imagine that to be pedo priests with as many children as can be carried on boat or plane.

                 That place looks beyond creepy. I was checking out the website and everything just seems too strange. They sure want donations though. It would be great to sign up for the three day retreat and stake the place out with a buddy.

                  I have always been creeped out by that place before I knew what it was. The gate did not fit into the whole area. I always saw high end blacked out vehicles driving in. You really have to see it from ground level to understand that you would not want to walk around out there in daylight much less at night.

                    For the children  to heal was what the old website used to say. I just bet that the surrounding landowners are a part of this( top left). That is dry season. Wet season, and that is a real swamp. Easy to move kids by boat when someone crashes the party though. They just putt to the next property, or up/down river. They made their own little canal system to cut time. Mabey de's bones in that brown dead lake. There is a visible trail leading to it across from the point of interest.

            Been to Alice Pizza in Rome. It was so terrible I threw it out after one bite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wonder if Alice has a connection to the word Slice. I hear these people emphasize Slice sometimes.

              Alice also has the numerology of 33, the freemason’s favorite number. The pizza chain is probably a freemason operation and the tagline probably refers to them too. “33 the real name of the pizza”. Don’t forget that “cunt” in slovak translates to “piča”.

               they claim a source for pizza history is a fairy tale book from the 1600's called "The Cunto de li Cunti," which contains the story of "The Two Little Pizzas" or "Le due pizzelle."

               I read through it and got quite a shock when I looked up the 1500's celebrity pope chef Bartolomeo Scappi they mention.  His very short Wikipedia page manages to fit in this long quote:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                and noted that "the liver of [a] domestic goose raised by the Jews is of extreme size and weighs [between] two and three pounds",[5] indicating that Jews of the time were practising the overfeeding needed to produce foie gras.
                <a href="http://archive.is/o3BmK#selection-181.1-191.2">
                 http://archive.is/o3BmK#selection-181.1-191.2

               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               It freaks me out, because, in "The Two Little Pizzas," the girl who was favored, was largely because she "fed," or in other versions "greased," the geese with either pasta or "real pasta" to overfeed them.  "Real" pasta?  Little boys?

            to English, maybe someone signed in will get a different translation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the words paste differently from what is copied:
           </p>

            When I go to

             https://www.facebook.com/alicegiolitticuneo/
            </a>
            then copy the words, from the post marked June 23 at 12:30 PM, then paste them into for example Word, they paste differently from what I copied.  It pastes the translation shown on archive.is, in which the children are referred to as budding pizza chefs, not pizza.

             On their Instagram, there are black children or dark skinned children, that I find odd in Italy.  There is no one with those children.  No one is pictured with them is what I mean.  Are they possibly for sale?  The other children are with an adult in various pictures.  Do not see anyone with the others.  In the past many thought pictures were posted of children to be seen as "for sale".  Are they possibly "the pizza"?

              Also Cuneo is an 'elite' city (56K pop.)

               from what I can tell,

              and it gives me a strange feeling, too.  I get a cult vibe from it.  The AP Cuneo page had some "related pages" in Cuneo linked by FB.

               Wow.  Well, I think that pretty much frosts the cake.  There is def something going on in that area at least.  The guy with his daughters, what a perv. The pic with them laying in their undies is beyond disturbing.  Sick.  and why would you put that on Instagram for everyone to see?  Unless...............
