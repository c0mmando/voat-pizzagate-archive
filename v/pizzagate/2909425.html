<p>SouthFront reports…</p>
<p>Group of Israelis are suspected of running a child sex trafficking network in Colombia. According to a report by the Times of Israel the number of suspects is 14, while Haaretz claims it is 12.</p>
<p>The office of Colombia’s attorney general said eight of the suspects have been arrested, including six Israelis.</p>
<p>The alleged sex trafficking ring provided Israeli tourists with “tourism packages” which included prostitutes, some of whom were minors, who received between 200,000 pesos ($63) to 400,000 pesos ($126) in return for sexual services.</p>
<p>Colombian authorities said that Israeli tourists would stay at hotels and take yacht trips and go to private parties with drugs and alcohol, in which women and minors were offered as “sex slaves.”</p>
<p>The members of the trafficking ring will be charged with murder, conspiracy, human trafficking, trafficking in minors, drug manufacturing, providing prostitution services and money laundering. All of the suspects were wanted by international police agency Interpol on suspicion of pimping and soliciting minors for prostitution.</p>

<p>Authorities raided a number of properties including a spa in Santa Marta, a hostel in Bogota, and a building known as “Casa Medellin.” The suspects were arrested in a number of locations around the country, and property worth around $45,000 was seized as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>The Colombian Attorney General posted a video on Twitter claiming that it showed properties owned by the trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Colombian media reported that the leader of the ring is an Israeli named Mor Zohar, while one of the arrested is a Colombian police officer.</p>
<p>The attorney general’s office said 150 billion pesos ($47.3 million) of property has been seized during the investigation, including hotels, hostels and other tourism related businesses.</p>
<p>The investigation into the trafficking ring has been happening since June 2016, when an Israeli citizen – Shai Azran was murdered in Medellin. The prime suspect of the murder was Assi Ben-Mosh, a 44-yaer-old Israeli who has operated in Colombia since 2009. He was arrested in the Netherlands in 2003 on suspicions of leading an international drug trafficking network.</p>
<p>Authorities tracked Ben-Mosh’s activities in Colombia and found that he was the owner of a hotel in Santa Marta, Hotel Benjamin, that offered the “tourism packages.” He together with Zohar also allegedly organized parties at which drugs and sex services were sold.</p>
<p>Police in Colombia arrested 18 people in a raid on Hotel Benjamin hostel in Cartagena in July. The suspects are accused of running a sex ring, recruiting young girls from Colombia and Venezuela and forcing them to work as sex slaves.</p>
<p>The network is suspected of operating in a number of cities in Colombia, including the capital Bogota, Medellin, Cartagena and Santa Marta.</p>

USNS Spearhead was sitting off the coast of Guatemala again when it happened. The shelter is inland, but accessible by helicopter.

             Pierre Falcone was born in Algeria in 1954. When he was aged eight, Falcone’s parents moved to France, following Algeria’s declaration of independence. In his early twenties Falcone moved to Brazil, where he started his business life as an agricultural entrepreneur. Together with his Bolivian wife, Falcone established himself as a signifi cant socialite in the US in the 1990s.
In 2009 Falcone was convicted of various crimes relating to Angolagate, receiving a six year sentence. He had attempted to claim diplomatic immunity as he was then the Angolan ambassador to UNESCO – a position that confirmed his closeness to the Angolan political elite. Some of his convictions were overturned and his sentence was reduced on appeal in 2011. He remains active in Angola.

            U.S. Ties Israeli Billionaire With Chinese Intelligence -
            <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/1.5091133">
             https://www.haaretz.com/1.5091133
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Admiralty complex is one of the trademarks of Hong Kong's urban landscape. Overlooking the port, the complex used to house the soldiers of the British army and the headquarters of the Royal Navy in the region. Today it is part of the city's business center. One building there houses a group of companies nicknamed the 88 Queensway Group (the address of the building), which the U.S. administration suspects is nothing more than a cover for activity conducted by the People's Republic of China's foreign intelligence. Wu Yang, one of the group's senior directors, provided the Registrar of Companies in Hong Kong with an address that matches the address of Chinese foreign intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
             The suspicions were spelled out in a report recently compiled by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which was established by Congress in 2000 in order to "monitor, investigate and submit to Congress an annual report on the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and to provide recommendations, where appropriate, to Congress for legislative and administrative action." The report noted, among other things, that the group of Chinese corporations has business ties with Israeli businessman and diamond magnate Lev Leviev.
            </p>
            <p>
             Using the group, Chinese intelligence acquires oil and energy companies and other important assets in countries in Africa, Latin American, Southeast Asia, as well as in the United States. In this way it promotes Chinese national interests, increases its influence and guarantees the supply of raw materials - first and foremost oil - necessary for its economy.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Chinese companies are assisted in some of their international activities by the Angolan government, a rising economic power in Africa, and particularly its national oil company Sonangol. The report mentions three international businessmen connected to the Angolan-Chinese cooperation, with the help of a company called China-Sonangol, which is registered in Hong Kong. China-Sonangol is part of the 88 Queensway Group.
            </p>
            <p>
             One is Helder Battaglia, a Portuguese businessman with close ties to Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, as well as Chavez and Kirchner. Battaglia has varied investments in Angola, Congo and Latin America.
             <strong>
              The second is Pierre Falcone, a French businessman who was Arcadi Gaydamak's partner
             </strong>
             , and together with Gaydamak was involved in supplying arms to the tune of about $800 million to Angola in the 1990s. Falcone, Gaydamak and others were recently convicted in a French court for illegal arms trade conducted in the '90s. In recent years, Falcone moved the main center of his business to Beijing, and has become the person who opens Angola's doors to China (for huge fees). Gaydamak is not mentioned at all in the report; it is known that he is at odds with Falcone and the two are embroiled in legal proceedings over the profits of the arms deal.
            </p>
            <p>
             The third businessman mentioned in the American report is Lev Leviev, who was Gaydamak's partner and who according to the report continues to have a strong standing in Angola, where he has mines, diamond polishing plants and a diamond trade company.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Situated in a bay in the Caribbean Sea, Cartagena has the most extensive fortifications in South America. A system of zones divides the city into three neighbourhoods: San Pedro, with the cathedral and many Andalusian-style palaces; San Diego, where merchants and the middle class lived; and Gethsemani, the 'popular quarter'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cartagena was for several centuries a focal point of confrontation among the principal European powers vying for control of the “New World.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Cartagena is an eminent example of the military architecture of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the most extensive of the New World and one of the most complete. Cartagena, together with Havana and San Juan, Puerto Rico (already inscribed in the World Heritage List), was an essential link in the route of the West Indies. The property fits within the general theme of world exploration and the great commercial maritime routes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ownership of the Port, Fortresses and Group of Monuments, Cartagena, is shared among private individuals, institutions, the Roman Catholic Church and national and local government authorities.

            </p>
            <p>
             Rockwell currently serves as Chair Emeritus of the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS (DIFFA) and as a board member of the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, Citymeals-on-Wheels, and New York Restoration Project.[4] Rockwell also conceived and developed Imagination Playground pro-bono, a play space designed to encourage children to work together to create their own worlds of play. After five years of research on children and play, the first site-specific location opened in collaboration with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation at Burling Slip in Manhattan in 2010. Rockwell Group developed portable, scalable models that can transform smaller, unused areas into play spaces.

            <p>
             A child prostitution ring where more than 250 underage girls were branded with tattoos by their 'owners' has been broken up after dramatic raids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police arrested 18 people after the girls were lured into coming the Colombian resort of Cartagena under the pretence of working as models there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among those detained was the alleged 'Madame' of the operation - Liliana del Carmen Campos Puello - and several unnamed Israelis who are believed to be the network's ringleaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             They allegedly raped and tattooed all their victims, who were aged between 14 and 17.
            </p>
            <p>
             Campos Puello was allegedly responsible for finding the girls from the poor neighbourhoods in Colombia and Venezuela.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              They were allegedly showcased in catalogues and forced to attend sex parties on luxury yachts and hotels.

             Who is the Israeli expelled from the country for national security
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In his country he had a file for the crimes of trafficking in persons and drug trafficking . Assi Moosh or Ben Mush was expelled this Sunday from Colombia because his stay in the country, according to a Migration Colombia document, represented a danger to national security.
            </p>
            <p>
             The inquiries relate Assi Moosh to an organization that offered Israeli citizens sex tourism in Colombia . Several of his clients, says the file, were ex-military men who had just been compensated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
            </p>
            <p>
             In hotels and lodgings run by this man in Cartagena, Medellín and Bogotá, only nationals of that country were lodged, who first had to submit to the filling of a form in a page of Internet. And all customers had to be recommended by a previous client.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              According to the investigation, Assi Moosh is involved with a foundation
             </strong>
             that recruited low-income youths under the promise of aid and studies, but ended up being subjected to prostitution . With the support of this foundation, the network managed to shield for almost 10 years to false social clubs that, in addition, they did the remove to the restrictions of schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
             This organization, dedicated to sex tourism in Colombia, has in the sector of La Candelaria, Bogota, two hostels, a hotel in Medellin, another in Cartagena and the main headquarters - called the 'bunker' - in Santa Marta.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two hotels on the Costa have the same name: El Benjamín, located in Bocagrande, Cartagena, and Taganga, Santa Marta.

            I had to use Google translator, but it looks like Assi Moosh even used his own 3 children in the ring:

            It takes a special kind of Jew to make coupons for child rape. It's that keen business sense.
