<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected, center-right government in Macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist George Soros, records obtained by Judicial Watch show. Barack Obama’s U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, Jess L. Baily, has worked behind the scenes with Soros’ Open Society Foundation to funnel large sums of American dollars for the cause, constituting an interference of the U.S. Ambassador in domestic political affairs in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.</p>
<p>The cash flows through the State Department and the famously corrupt U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID), which is charged with providing global economic, development and humanitarian assistance. USAID has allocated about $5 million to leftwing Soros groups in Macedonia since 2012, documents show, and at least $9.5 million has been earmarked by the agency to intervene in the Balkan nation’s governmental affairs for 2016-2011. State Department figures have been tougher to come by and Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the numbers. Judicial Watch also fired off a public records request to USAID because the preliminary figures, obtained through various sources in both the U.S. and Macedonia, appear to be incomplete.</p>
<p>Here’s how the clandestine operation functions, according to high-level sources in Macedonia and the U.S. that have provided Judicial Watch with records as part of an ongoing investigation. The Open Society Foundation has established and funded dozens of leftwing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Macedonia to overthrow the conservative government. One Macedonian government official interviewed by Judicial Watch in Washington D.C. recently, calls it the “Soros infantry.” The groups organize youth movements, create influential media outlets and organize violent protests to undermine the institutions and policies implemented by the government. One of the Soros’ groups funded the translation and publication of Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” into Macedonian. The book is a tactical manual of subversion, provides direct advice for radical street protests and proclaims Lucifer to be the first radical. Thanks to Obama’s ambassador, who has not been replaced by President Trump, Uncle Sam keeps the money flowing so the groups can continue operating and recruiting, sources in Macedonia and the U.S. confirm.</p>
<p>With a population of about 2 million, Macedonia has one of the more conservative governments in Europe. This includes the lowest flat tax in Europe, close ties with Israel and pro-life policies. The country recently built a border fence to crackdown on an illegal immigration crisis that overwhelmed law enforcement agencies. Between 10,000 and 12,000 illegal aliens were crossing the Greek-Macedonian border daily at the peak of the European migration crisis, a Macedonian official told Judicial Watch, and the impact was devastating. This is likely of big interest to Soros, a renowned open borders advocate who pushes international governance, diminished U.S. global power and an increase in Muslim immigration. Soros spent tens of millions of dollars to support Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Just this month Hungary’s prime minister lashed out against Soros for funding groups to secretly influence the country’s politics. “Large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters,” said Viktor Orban in his annual state of the nation speech. “This is the trans-border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery.”</p>
<p>This appears to be the case in Macedonia with the help of American financing. There have been a number of violent protests in recent months that have been coordinated by Soros’ Open Society Foundation through its U.S.-funded NGOs, sources tell Judicial Watch. Some U.S. members of Congress have expressed interest in the issue and have demanded answers from Ambassador Baily, USAID and the State Department. In typical fashion, the State Department has stonewalled the inquiries and USAID hasn’t been much more forthcoming. Last month Utah Senator Mike Lee sent Ambassador Baily a letter asking questions involving the U.S. Mission to Macedonia’s involvement in the political process and its connections to the Open Society Foundation. It’s unlikely that Americans will receive answers, especially since Baily is probably on his way out. The fact remains however, that millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have already been spent on this illicit operation and the government agencies need to be held accountable.</p>

             Trump plans to propose budget cuts to the State Department and the USAID

            1 Mar 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA) said Tuesday he is “very concerned” by reports that President Donald Trump plans to propose budget cuts to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
“I am very concerned by reports of deep cuts that could damage efforts to combat terrorism, save lives, and create opportunities for American workers,” Royce said in a statement. “The committee will thoroughly review the administration’s foreign affairs budget request when it’s made available to Congress.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The State Department and USAID have a combined budget of just over $50 billion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Trump administration’s proposed 37% cut to the State Department budget came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to Bloomberg Politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle, President Trump stated, “I want to increase our military spending significantly. We have to. Our military is depleted. Our equipment is old and tired and we’re going to have the finest military that the United States has ever had by far.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “President Donald Trump is developing a federal budget that officials said would add more than $50 billion to the base defense budget,” reported the Wall Street Journal. “The increase would be made possible by significant cuts elsewhere, officials said on Monday, particularly to the State Department and its foreign aid division.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The Journal added, “People familiar with the deliberations said the Trump administration is examining the growth in spending by the State Department during the Obama administration, including that caused by the addition of special envoys, though they said that would not cover the proposed cuts. One U.S. official said that the State Department is looking at development assistance to other countries as a significant source for the cuts.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) reportedly declared President Trump’s budget proposal would be “dead on arrival” because of the State Department cuts.

             Good for Trump, if he can't arrest these fuckers it seems he is doing the next best thing and cutting off their funding. those who object should be on our radar.

            The US has a history of upending democratically elected governments and countries that don't bow down to them.  And good old George is most times in there with them. Disgusting.  I wish Macedonia would put Soros on a 'Wanted' list like Russia has.

             the post is about Soros using the US State department during HRC's tenure to destabilize a region using US taxpayer money, it is within the parameters of pizzagate, the jew comments are not mine.

            Sorry, but this stream of bile is just as bad as they are. Humanity is getting nowhere fast by generalizing millions of people and writing them off as 'bad'. We need every able bodied human of good morals united and working together. Its the only way we win. The majority of Jewish people are in the same boat as we are and are just struggling to survive just as we are.
