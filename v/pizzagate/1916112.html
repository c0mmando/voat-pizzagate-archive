<p>However, to my knowledge, no one has been able to actually prove Brad Bauman is connected to the foundation, aside from the fact that he shares the name of the foundation. If anyone has proof, please share.</p>
<p>Looking further into Brad Bauman, I was able to find links to Podesta, Clinton, SEIU, and Comet Ping Pong. Which has me wondering...why in the world would Bauman of all people, be assigned as spokesman to the Seth Rich family!?</p>
<p>Brad Bauman runs The Pastorum group with Partners Josh Cohen, Tory Brown, and Michelle Coyle. <a href="http://archive.is/xvSDD">http://archive.is/xvSDD</a></p>
<p>Looking at Tory Brown, she can be found in the Podesta emails several times. This particular wikileaks email sent to David Brock and John Podesta show her as a staffer being paid about $4,000 per month. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31406">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31406</a> She is also the director of outreach for David Brock\'s Media Matters. <a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/profile/tory-brown/">http://www.netrootsnation.org/profile/tory-brown/</a></p>
<p>Another one of his partners of the Pastorum Group is Josh Cohen. He has previously worked for SEIU. <a href="https://www.unionfacts.com/employee/Service_Employees/JOSHUA/COHEN">https://www.unionfacts.com/employee/Service_Employees/JOSHUA/COHEN</a>. This might be important since an Anon claimed that Podesta was using SEIU to do his dirty work.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bgbpx/insider_anon_claims_pedosta_used_seiu_people_to/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bgbpx/insider_anon_claims_pedosta_used_seiu_people_to/</a>
He is also or was a director at the globalist organization the Atlantic Council, whose board members include trilateral and bilderberg members such as Kissinger, Allbright, Petreus, Panetta, Rice, etc. <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/board-of-directors">http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/board-of-directors</a></p>
<p>Brad Bauman is friends with Erick Sanchez. <a href="http://archive.is/Q3Nbc">http://archive.is/Q3Nbc</a> who started the &quot;Stand with Comet Ping Pong&quot; gathering at comet, which had over 2k attendees. <a href="http://archive.is/Wg6eF">http://archive.is/Wg6eF</a></p>
<p>Erick Sanchez\' own FB profile <a href="http://archive.is/w3Bml">http://archive.is/w3Bml</a> says he is best friends with Chef Jose Andres who, like Alefantis, is listed as one of the most powerful people in Washington. <a href="https://dc.eater.com/2012/1/18/6621675/gq-names-jose-andres-james-alefantis-among-most-powerful-people-in">https://dc.eater.com/2012/1/18/6621675/gq-names-jose-andres-james-alefantis-among-most-powerful-people-in</a>  He also seems to give Podesta some cooking tips <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/785952089675485185?lang=en">https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/785952089675485185?lang=en</a></p>
<p>Even more interesting about Erick Sanchez FB page I just linked, is his own words stating that he is a &quot;Well Established Turophile&quot;. Turo is greek for &quot;Cheese&quot; and phile is term for lover. So this comet ping pong defender actually claims he is a cheese lover. Hmmm...i wonder if by cheese lover he means cheddar or children. <a href="http://wordinfo.info/unit/2208/ip:10/il:T">http://wordinfo.info/unit/2208/ip:10/il:T</a></p>
<p>Another friend of Bauman is Adam Conner. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BIToW-HDDRj/?taken-by=theadamconner">https://www.instagram.com/p/BIToW-HDDRj/?taken-by=theadamconner</a> (Brad pictured on the left) Here is a wikileaks email of Conner setting up a dinner for attendees that include John Podesta <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29700">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/29700</a> and he like Erick Sanchez, seems to be a big supporter of Comet Ping Pong and Bucks Fishing and Camping. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNyCiQTj0cc/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BNyCiQTj0cc/</a></p>
<p>And here is a youtube video from Fox news of Brad Bauman backing John Podestas push for an investigation into Russian Hacking, before the electoral college vote.  Starts at about 50 seconds in. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CCQjJUNo-s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CCQjJUNo-s</a></p>
<p>So Brad Bauman\'s business partner Tory Brown has ties to Podesta and was a Director for David Brock at Media Matters. His cheese loving friend and another friend who invited Podesta to a dinner gathering are supporters of a Pizza place that was reported to have ties to pedophilia, which was only discovered thanks to leaked emails of none other than...John Podesta. Of course, Brad Bauman then is assigned to the family of Seth Rich, who is now looking more and more as the leaker of the Podesta and the DNC emails. Anyone else see a conflict of interest here in hiring Bauman to be spokesman for the family who\'s son just released damning information against someone tied to several of his partners and buddies?</p>
<p>Also its pretty interesting to see Bauman...pushing the narrative and backing podesta on Fox saying that Russians hacked the U.S....when in actuality the victim of the family he is spokesman for...was the actual person who leaked the documents and not Russia. Does the Rich family know of this pretty huge conflict of interest? If Bauman is the man keeping the Rich family in the dark about the truth...then maybe our strategy needs to find a way to further prove Bauman is a massive conflict of interest towards finding justice for Seth. Surely if the Rich family have any common sense and aren\'t being threatened in any way...they would speak up on this conflict of interest and either reject the need for a spokesman or at the very least, be ask to be assigned someone who isn\'t connected to the very people impacted by the Seth Rich leaks.</p>',

            It's interesting that their choice of names is often reflected in crypto symbolism or double entendre.  The etymology of the word pastor, as in Pastorum group, is very interesting in this context.  They certainly have been leaders, but where the hell their leading I'm not interested in following.

            This will be ignored because Bauman is pushing the version that it was a botched robbery. Its not as if hes being a hypocrite by saying one thing happened when referring to Seth Rich and another thing happened when referring to the hack. Its frustrating but I can't see anything happen when hes being consistent with his opinion. Even though hes talking rubbish.
           </p>
           <p>
            For pizzagate though and as an idea of the sort of lowlife Bauman is, him being friends with self confessed cheese lover and Comet party host Erick Sanchez just proves to us hes involved in these crimes and isn't someone to be overlooked.

            <p>
             Independent political consultant, managing principal at The Pastorum Group and chief operating officer of Women Get It Done, Edwards is a regular on the political conference circuit. She travels about twice a month to engage with clients and collaborate with colleagues. Frequent stops for the campaign operative include Austin, Las Vegas, New York and San Francisco. Most recently she found herself in route to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center’s annual conference, a liberal-leaning organization that focuses on ballot measures for progressive policy change.
            </p>
            <p>
             Though the 2016 election cycle is Edwards’ current professional focus, her career in politics and media dates back years. She has served on campaign staff for various political candidates, including Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and interned more than a decade ago for Clinton-affiliated HILLPAC. Edwards’ big-name clients are numerous and include the likes of the Democratic National Committee, the Sierra Club and the Victory Fund. For her political messaging successes in television, web video, animation and other forms of online media, Edwards has received seven Pollie awards.

            Fantastic research. This info needs to be delivered to the lawyer who is representing the Rich family against the Metro Police Dept. He will better understand the conflict of interest better than Seth's parents. And it needs to be presented in a manner that doesn't scare off the recipient with conspiracy theory vibes.

            Oooh.  I just noticed that Bauman and Conner were in Philly in that pic. Celebrating or planning Bernie's demise.  But my payoff was that she had the biggest let down of her life.  Let's give her an even bigger one.

            And rich didn't leak the podesta emails wtf is this revisionism, isn't the email chain verifiable where the IT guy accidentally wrote legitimate email not illegitimate?.  It is so LAME to need heros and martyrs, much less a fucking soicalist Jew!  Do you think I would lament any DNC operatives premature demise?  They just passed a law in Canada where the govt can take your kid if he's transgender and you don't let him

            Actually that sounds like something they just might exactly do.  They are strange birds, those Clintons, especially Skippy.  How macabre that would be.  I can just bet you that the Rich family is being threatened.  I believe on the night of the Convention in Philly (I was in town) we were lying on our rental floor looking at our phones, checking for news when up popped a picture on my phone of Bernie with a couple of bruises on his face.  I nearly lost it.  I showed it to my friends and by the time I walked across the room it was gone.  Of course some denied it was bogus.  I believe it was real.  The story we heard is that he was roughed up in his room, either at the door or inside.  Philly is a tough town with lots of SEIIU guys and so is DC. Knowing how the Podesta/Clinton crowd works, I would bet on their being threats.  You should also look up why Nina Turner did not show up to a press conference when she was denied to present Bernie at the Convention at the last minute.These people don't fool around.

             I saw one Facebook post in a Florida Bernir group about that and it is preserved for all time now because I believe it too.  Bernie Sanders gave an interview on TV and I was barely paying attention so I don't recall the network.  Some guy was holding one arm around him while shaking his hand with the other and the guy was smiling and asking him routine post election questions and when the interview ended, Bernie pushed the guy away as if he knew him and really did not like this man.  He was a young guy with an accent from East Coast and he had dark hair and looked like a Soprano.  I was always wanting to ask here if anybody recalls seeing that interview in Philly and if anyone knows who that guy is?  He looked very suspect.  Bernie Sanders is always warm and friendly and his reaction to this guy told a different story.  I want to investigate that thug.

              Wow. Thanks for revealing that.  I am not on Facebook.  When I was in Philly and watching just about anything I could, I did not see that either.  Do you remember if the interview was during the Convention or before or after?  I am going to try to look into it.  If you have that Facebook post I would like to see it.
