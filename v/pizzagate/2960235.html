            Just listened to this disgusting radio interview - a follow up to the R.Kelly Brother interview you posted. 
 These people need to be locked up and the keys thrown away!  Filth beyond filth! R. Kelly (16 Year Old Ex) REVEALS "MALELOVERS", &amp; Rob Loves "KIDS" to Put OBJECTS up His A$$. ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlOvHUhLEKo -  never even knew who R.Kelly was but it sounds like another cookie cut 'elite' exposed here on pizzagate - THANK GOD for a boring normal life!

            The cycle is starting to end, and it took us long enough, but I’m proud Black folks are getting pissed. Even the ones who don’t think he deserves all this prove their point by going on about the cabal practices, which helps pedogate move along, if anything is gonna actually happen to the pedos...
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, let the wheat separate from the chaff. This is showing us all the niggas we need to stay away from. My family is all unfriending folks when they see someone supporting him. What a year so far! (Not to mention all the space crafts...)

            Oh, and prep for a long power outage sometime this year. All these tranformer explosions and fires are beta test. The worst that can happen is you’re prepared for any natural or unnatural event

             Yes, but even on voat, there is no shortage of civnats and nigger enablers. It's pathetic but that's what you get from weak boomers and other degenerates. Pizzagate is real but there is this stupid US vs THEM mentality where we are all supposed to throw aside the nigger rapes, murders, etc. and band together with "all races, no color, BS, BS, yada yada" and fight the evil pedos, but don't call them jews!
            </p>
            <p>
             LOL, just got to laugh at this sub man. Most of these people really are just losers. It's good they do research but has it gone anywhere? No, and that's boomers in a nutshell. Whether it's voting R or other shit, they never follow through or really change the world. It's a perfect parallel for their existence really.
            </p>
            <p>
             You could add that excuse to "every fucking nigger, jew, non-white, and 99% of women". If God is real, he could definitely exterminate most of "humanity" and it would be for the best. Even in "truth" subs you have miscreants defending niggers, jews, and every other POS that walks on two legs.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's absolutely pathetic but that's because the "people" writing this shit are all losers in life.

             Nah. This nigga never gets to play the victim. I’m wide awake, where there is no color, but on this planet, my God does not let me look away from the synagogue of Satan. You keep the nigger shit to yourself, dumb fuck. You’re so afraid and intrigued by us all at once. Get over it or get into it, but we are truly the key to harmony on this planet. And I’m doing the work for US to see it. We don’t even have to exist to you. Focus that judgment elsewhere

              “The key to harmony” hahahahahaa holy fucking delusions of grandure. 
Niggers are the most worthless form of cheap entertainment to exist. 
Without “ball” to bet on, you’d be wiped of the planet. No legit race cares about you, and the only people to care less are other niggers.
You’re nothing more than a toy. To be used with when convenient and tossed out with the other trash when we get bored.

              There is color you stupid nigger and you're the color of shit. Ironic that worthless niggers call themselves "colored people" when they aren't any other colors than brown and black and they sure as shit are not people like the rest of us. You niggers are worthless, stupid, and could all die off tomorrow and the world would be a better place.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nobody is afraid of you niggers and we could exterminate you all in one week if we weren't hamstrung by jews who force you subhumans into our country, tv, etc. You're nothing but a biological weapon used by the jews to destroy civilization. No race likes you niggers and yet you think you're the "key to harmony on this planet?" HAHAHAHAHHA! That's fucking gold nigger! You think you niggers fucking matter? Of course you do! Because you're a useless evil nigger.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's such poetic justice that the Clintons and other Democrats are raping and murdering niggers in Haiti - the same island that dedicated it's eradication of the french and mulattoes in 1804 to the demons that helped them. Ah, yes, the niggers are getting the judgement and justice they deserve - that being rape and murder - something niggers love more than life itself. You niggers are good for nothing and to this day, you subhumans are roaming around, killing, raping, and eating each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              But please chimp, go on about how you're a "woke nigga". It's fucking hilarious watching you dumb niggers try any way you can to justify your worse than worthless existence. You can't even fucking write in English properly and yet you think you're smart.
             </p>
             <p>
              Niggers are not the key to harmony on the planet. Rather, they are the key to dysfunction, chaos, and destruction. Regardless of whatever the boomers and other simps on voat or elsewhere think, you can guarantee that there are hundreds of thousands of whites out there who will get power and are working to eradicating your worthless race. Don't think that just because the Clintons, Podestas, etc. are the enemy of all that you niggers are our friends. You niggers are the color of shit for a reason and you need to be flushed away permanently from the planet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Die nigger scum.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: The fucking Chinks will probably kill you niggers off before we whites get to it. You stupid fucking subhumans are going to get owned by a bunch of 5 foot tall slant eyes in Africa LMAO.

            "Sexual Abuse is cyclical. "
           </p>
           <p>
            In some cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was a little girl I was raped by both a 15 y/o boy and his 12 y/o sister.
           </p>
           <p>
            A couple years later I was molested by my much older half-sister (who turned to a life of sexual promiscuity due to her own fucked up childhood).
           </p>
           <p>
            I made damn sure their evilness never turned me into a deviant like they are (were).
           </p>
           <p>
            Though.... I had a Christian upbringing, unlike my half-sister that molested me, and the nasty brother/sister retarded duo, so perhaps I was fortunate because we were taught about, and against committing acts of sexual immorality and the likes..... and I know that, at least in the case of my elder half sisters, they were not raised that way by their mum.
           </p>
           <p>
            So yeah, it can be cyclical.  And it fucking definitely is in the case of the Kelly family (and my half sister).

             in some cases is the key. It's a sad fallacy to saddle all abuse victims with "the cycle." Most victims do not become abusers, if they did  it would only be a few generations before everyone was an abuser.

             Maybe and highly probable. Not safe to determine without evidence or testimony. Some start through porn, psychopathy etc.

               Heard on news this morning that Common distanced himself from RK and said many Blacks are to blame too because they loved his music too much. Lady G also pulled her duo she did with him. They showed it and it smacked of racism to me. Kelly being Black and as a President and GaGa playing M Monroe with bleach blond hair. Sick.  I hope this is the beginning of the end and leads to the rest of the ring. Two more women have come foreward. Have to stop now. Very tired.

                 They know what goes on behind the scenes but their fans seem to not care. There were only a few protesters on the news. People just don’t want to face the dirty facts about their idols. A sad comment on where we are. I hope the roar grows louder each day.
