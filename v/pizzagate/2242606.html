<p>EDIT: For those who don\'t know about QAnon, here\'s a brief summary MF gave a couple days ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[–]Millennial_Falcon 7 points (+7|-0) 1.7 days ago </p>
<p>Someone very close to Trump, with a top-level &quot;Q&quot; security clearance (i.e. access to ALL Top-Secret government files), is saying that some top generals actually asked Trump to run for President, so they could work with him to take down the evil and corruption, severing the tentacles of the handful of elite families that practically control the world. Q-anon is using a Socratic method (asking questions) to help us build a map of what is happening, without broadcasting their plans or spoon-feeding info (which would be illegal and could also be framed by media as Russian propaganda or something). They haven\'t made mass-arrests yet, so now is the &quot;calm before the storm&quot; (CBTS).</p>

<p>He <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/147146601/#q147173287">mentions child trafficking </a>in Haiti</p>

             Nevertheless, look how much back-and-forth this thread has generated. The goal is to get people thinking and engaged to make their own decisions. Sometimes the best way to do that is to take a position people will throw darts at.

            Vindicator pushing this psyop should be all you need to know. We know the cult wants to sell us civil war so they can then respond by slapping down draconian laws and gun confiscation. What better way than to convince you that Trump is trying to stop them, but they will make a move on him! You must fight those opposing Trump! ......Trump is one of them and you are being had. They want this fabricated civil war they need to look plausable. It will be staged, you will buy it, they will move in for the kill. Problem, reaction solution. Problem-Civil War, Reaction-we need to put a stop to this. Solution- confiscate guns, emergency laws and major arrest of "supporters" of the defeated cause. There are no good spooks, get that out of your head.

             That’s the exact opposite of what they want. They know they can’t win a civil war–and every war-game scenario they have ever run ends with us winning and every single jew in both the US and Israel dead–which is why they haven’t done one yet. They operate through demographic replacement, not civil war.

            Trump is blackmailed he can't do anything there are videos of him raping young girls with Jeffrey Epstein. 12 and 13 year old girls. All on video that is the problem with Trump when he was younger he palled around with Epstein went to parties with Epstein parties where young girls and boys were on the menu. Trump only fucked the young girls never the boys and the videos are being used against Trump. He is severely limited in what he can do and at some point he will be forced to resign to avoid a worse fate. Not impeachment Assassination. Trump is a loose cannon. Pence is the guy they can control very easily.

            ALL OF THIS Q MEME STUFF LINKS DIRECTLY TO A CIA MIND CONTROL PROGRAM. THAT’S HOW THE KIDS FIT INTO IT. THE MEMES ARE LITERAL RED PILLS (PERHAPS FOR SOME OF YOU ALSO).
           </p>
           <p>
            +++ THE LINK HAS AN INDEX WITH INFORMATION AT THE TOP WHICH SUGGESTS YOU SHOULDN’T READ THE INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE BEEN UNDER HYPNOSIS OR PROGRAMMING. AND THE THING IS, YOU WON’T KNOW IF YOU HAVE. I THINK A NON-AMERICAN SHOULD BE CHECKING IT TO CONFIRM. CERTAINLY NO MILITARY OR POLICE GUYS. NO JUDGES, ETC. YOU CAN GET TRIGGERED BY MUSIC AND REPETITIVE SOUNDS, AND YOU GUYS PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM ALL OF THE TIME, SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING LINKED TO THAT (PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE IN CLASSROOMS, ETC.). +++
           </p>
           <p>
            NON-US FOLKS (BRITS SHOULD ALSO BE CAUTIOUS; NSA AND MI6 BOTH APPARENTLY LINKED TO THIS STUFF, AS WELL AS CIA) SEARCH FOR THE FOLLOWING TERMS:
           </p>
           <p>
            ALICE AND WONDERLAND
WHITE RABBIT
ROBERT BYRD
DISNEY
           </p>
           <p>
            THESE ARE THINGS Q HAS QUESTIONED; INCLUDING “PATRIOTS DON’T SLEEP” - WHICH TIES IN WITH SLAVE SOLDIERS NOT SLEEPING PROPERLY UNDER MIND CONTROL AND BEING WEAPONISED. MAYBE THE THING ABOUT HOSPITALS TOO; AND POSSIBLY THE WORD ‘CONTROL’ - WHICH IS PREVELENT IN HIS MAP AT THE END.
           </p>
           <p>
            I DON’T KNOW IF THIS SHOULD BE POSTED, BUT IF TRUMP IS MAKING A SPEECH TO AMERICA AND CAN TAKE CONTROL OF ALL THE PEOPLE, THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. ONE IS VERY BAD (ESP. WITH THE RUSSIA/CHINA/SAUDI ARABIA CONNECTION). I FEEL IF I AT LEAST MENTION IT SOME AMERICANS DON’T HAVE TO WATCH THE SPEECH (JUST IN CASE IT’S THE WORST TIMELINE WE ARE ON).
           </p>
           <p>
            IF Q IS AROUND. I THINK YOU NEED TO CLARIFY.
           </p>
           <p>
            AGAIN. NO AMERICANS SHOULD BE CLICKING THE LINK. THIS GUIDE SAYS PEOPLE DON’T EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAVE BEEN PUT UNDER MIND CONTROL. PLENTY OF OTHERS CAN CHECK IT OUT UNTIL Q CONFIRMS. SOMEONE SHOULD ASK HIM IF THEY FIND HIM.
           </p>
           <p>
            I REALLY THINK THIS IS IT. THE MEMES SPREAD THE MESSAGE SUBLIMINALLY VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. Q USED THE RED PILL REFERENCE TO PUT YOU ON THE MATRIX TERMINOLOGY PATHWAY, WHICH LEADS TO THE WHITE RABBIT. WHITE RABBIT IS A TERM RELATED TO THE SLAVE MASTER. THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES. IF USED IT MAY GIVE CONTROL. ON THE LINKED PAGE ARE SEVERAL KEY WORDS TO ACTIVATE SLAVE PROGRAMMING. ANY OF THEM COULD BE LACED INTO A SPEECH. THIS WORKS OVER A PHONE CALL, THROUGH COLOURS, SMELLS; ALL KINDS OF WAYS.

           <p>
            PERHAPS THIS IS THE KEYSTONE. FINGERS CROSSED TRUMP ISN’T THE NEW HITLER; HE ALREADY HAS MENGELE’S WORK COMPLETED VIA THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES (NSA WERE ALSO LISTED ALONGSIDE CIA ON PAGE 2 OR 3; AS WERE MI6). I DON’T GET A GOOD GUT REACTION ON THIS ONE; IF ANYONE IS CONTROLLABLE, YOU COULD HAVE THEM SAY OR DO ANYTHING, INCLUDING PEOPLE BEING ARRESTED NOW, ETC. AND BEING VERY CYNICAL/IMPARTIAL, TRUMP COULD HAVE STAGED THIS WHOLE THING FROM THE START; HE IS POTUS. THAT’S THE BIG PICTURE.
           </p>
           <p>
            TAU-9 - ALSO A POSSIBLE LINK TO THE HUMAN-TRAFFICKING; MIGHT BE LINKED TO ONE OF THE CODES Q POSTED, ALSO.

             ALSO RE: PODESTA. CARDS. DOMINOS.
            </p>
            <p>
             It links to mind control techniques of the Illuminati. They use these techniques like they would use Tarot cards. Pizza and Pasta would then be gender codes (as already guessed).
            </p>
            <p>
             I think this is what they were doing; abuse young kids, make them compliant; or acquire kids already controlled and swap with others (hence menus, etc.). They didn’t get any heat for it because it was a government programme (as far as I have read).
            </p>
            <p>
             “Card Codes
Regular playing cards have developed from the occult Tarot cards. The four suits correspond to magick, the spades mean the power from the spear of destruction, the diamond means is a double pyramid or demonic power of wealth, and the club is a clover meaning fortune and fate, and the heart means devotion and loyalty. The four suits work well in programming because anything that is broken down in 4’s or a multiple of 4 can be coded with cards. Anything that can be broken down into 12’s or 13’s can be given cards too. Since clocks work off of 12’s, card codes work well with clocks. The suits can denote seasons. With Jokers one gets 13 cards per suit with four suits gives 365 unique symbols to denote the days of the year. Dominos can also be used on a base 13 code system. The blank will equal 13.”

            Below is a link to images for Diplomatic cars Q-VA009 and Q-VA026.
As I stated earlier, the Q-xxxx series of plates has been used in China for all diplomatic visitors (not just USA) for over a decade. Sorry folks, you are looking to hard and just seeing something that's not really there. You are looking for something to prove what you want to believe to be true... but sadly its not.

             This thread makes me want to cry. Is it a very bad joke? 
I think "Q" the anon is pointing people to look at some interesting things, real insider, or LARP'er. I hope he's real, but think it's thought-provoking stuff either way.
             <br/>
             This, however, is utter and complete bullshit. Posted by a mod, no less! Fucking dumb, I'm embarrassed.

            OMG! VA008 is a flight plan coming out of Los Angeles -

            Now look at the comment that was left for us back in 2011... Mike Brewer...Brewer... Brewing up a Storm! The Storm is coming Q is real!
           </p>
           <p>
            OK now being serious; The number plate "Q-VAxxx series" is special security plates used in China and are assigned to diplomatic vehicles (not just for US visitors). Some are the same make &amp; color as the one pictured Q-VA008 (for example: Q-VA018 is the exact same make and color) pictured here:
            <a href="https://club.m.autohome.com.cn/bbs/thread-a-100002-42581636-1.html?type=None">
             https://club.m.autohome.com.cn/bbs/thread-a-100002-42581636-1.html?type=None
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As you can see the Q plates have been around for at least a decade so those people connecting this to someone posting and calling themselves "Q" and the fact that the letters VA008 looks kind of like "Vault 8" if you use your imagination is really clutching at straws...

            The body of your post should have information pertaining to the significance of what this means to the investigation.

              Thanks. I'm glad you laughed at it. It's hard for that to make it through in text sometimes.

              It just seems a bit of a reach is all, Q was supposed to be the man's clearance level, not something from a license plate. There's far better ways to signal to us than hidden messages in an automotive registration.

            I have to say that impressed me. For it to focus in like that on the license plate gave me a little more hope. I took a screenshot where it shows it really clear. It doesn't say Vault8 exactly. It says Q-VA008. That's still impressive to me.
           </p>

            I made that post today showing the conversation between Assange and Trump Jr where the link was a website about Seth Rich. Then Assange made a post to Trump today. THIS video ties in Q and Wikileaks in my opinion. I hope something good is coming.

            Everyone is reading too much into everything they see &amp; read because we are actively looking for something we want to find.
So many couch potatoes playing a scavenger hunt game online, feeling excited because we think we are "discovering" something, feeling smart because we think we are solving puzzles... Meanwhile we are wasting time, nothing is being done to change the fundamental problems for American citizens with a rigged political system... The next election cycle is getting closer and have we got anything organized or are we just going to vote in the fake Red or Blue choice again? Do we have a peoples party yet? Do we have reps planted in each and every state and are communicating to the millions of dissatisfied people how to vote? No.

             Sorry brother, but this kind of comment really bothers me. First, you're implying that we're all couch potatoes - I'm not. I work my ass of to take care of a family and try to help make my community better. I can't save the world on my own, but the injustice we're all pretty confident is happening on our dime sickens me - especially where it has to do with innocent kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further, you say we're wasting our time with this - as if this community would be doing something else so incredibly productive otherwise. You sound like a shill trying to discourage folks who hope things aren't so broken they can't be fixed. Why would it offend you that we hope the world's worst will face justice?
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope Q is an honest person trying to - through us - prepare our people to accept some crazy doses of reality. I hope we're not getting played. But even if we are, I think this has done some real good. I see large communities of people imagining what a better world would be like - and that's the first step to getting us there - to no longer tolerating the massive corruption. Too much sacred blood has been spilled to buy us our freedom to see it stolen from us by a handful of wicked douchebags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just because we're here, interested and hopeful, doesn't mean we're couch potatoes who don't do everything within the law to make our country better.

              Just curious...are you speaking of the blood spilled when this country was taken over?
             </p>
             <p>
              That would be then the sacred blood of the native americans...if that is your reference.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you are talking about the previous wars like WW1 or 2...those were all psy ops started via false flags, as was the Ame Revolution etc.  We are always and have been always cannon fodder.  We have never had freedom/just the illusion of such.

               Talking about the revolution and the miraculous victory that bought our freedom - and that in a short two centuries has brought more wealth and quality of life to the citizens of the world than ever in our recorded history. There are spots in our history that are imperfect for sure - we're human. But rewind a few hundred years and tell the average citizens of that time that their descendants could come and live and work in this beautiful land and own a piece of it... you'd blow their minds.
              </p>
              <p>
               You're right, the world's not perfect yet, but we'll never get there if we can't imagine it first. And it feels like that's starting to happen. That was the gist of my original comment.

               I see large communities of people imagining what a better world would be like - and that's the first step to getting us there - to no longer tolerating the massive corruption. Too much sacred blood has been spilled to buy us our freedom to see it stolen from us by a handful of wicked douchebags.

             Hi. “Couch potato” here. I hear what you’re saying and all, but fuck. As small as our group of followers is, at least we aren’t deciding to watch Netflix and pretend this isn’t happening.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there is one thing that we
             <em>
              do
             </em>
             have , it’s a unique perspective. Everyone still has their opinions though - and at least they have one. There are no answers. We’re all in the same fucking boat, and we are all doing the best we can given the circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s exciting. It’s the ultimate reality show. It comes with a price though, AND WE ARE ALL PAYING.
            </p>
            <p>
             This time we live in is like no other in history - and we have a perspective like no other in history.
            </p>
            <p>
             This shit can’t break us. We all want the same thing.

              I completely understand - please don't get me wrong. I'm not being critical because I have been participating in much of this jig saw puzzle exercise as well. I am only trying to point out that at some point we have to be willing and able to hit the streets. We cannot sit back and hope that a super hero will appear from the sky to save us all. We have to roll up our sleeves band together and go drain the swamp ourselves. They will try to divide us, so black, white, yellow, red it matters not. Left, Right, Middle, Up or Down who cares. We just need to back the one goal - keep our eyes on what is truly the right thing to do for the kids and get the job done. I'll be there.

               I spoke to four normie friends today about the whole thing, mainly that Trump and friends are running a giant rope-a-dope on the Clinton Cabal and MSM, and they were intrigued. One was an engineer. One was a 21-year-old construction worker. One was a philosophy teacher. One was a Sr. Vice Pres at an IT company.

            The vast trillions spent on wars and housing the largest prison population (think free slave labor) could fix the very problems we have in this country.

             The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.

             Very important for people to keep this possibility in mind

             The Eugenics and depopulation agenda hasn't been stopped,but accelerated.

            <p>
             Why's that ?

               I would think : why doesn't Trump close down the Eugenics department first ?
              </p>
              <p>
               it will give him more grassroots support in case things turn ugly..

               for me the depopulation/Eugenics agenda is the litmustest.

                trump is simply following instructions/the cabal he works for is also into eugenics and depopulation/just not into satanic worship.  Also not into a one NWO thing/prefers cultural divisions etc...the 'lesser of two evils' scenario.  That cabal plays the world like a monopoly game (I got this from a young man I dated who was born into a 'family').  The other cabal doesn't want to play games/they want the whole fucking board and eliminate everyone else.
               </p>
               <p>
                So there is a lot going on at those levels where everyone is duking it out.  We can feel the tension in the air, sleep is disturbed etc.  Reason it is so important to do whatever works for 'you' to keep centered.

                 the satanic pedo system is their control grid,Brownstoning.

                 it's a way to control the ones that control the masses.

                 the lesser evil will simply use technology,psychology and biology to continue the slow kill Holocaust.

                 i'm more and more convinced that my feeling 6 years ago ,that Rockefeller is trying to go for the top spot, might be correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                 the 'swords'and 'words' I'm finding point to Rockefeller involvement,as a reaction to the original Sword in Jerusalem build by Rothschild.

              With one payer you can force vaccinations and when you are done with someone put them on 'the pathway' like they have in UK where they decided when it's time for you to kick the bucket.

              Disappointed only in that I had 'hoped' that at his age trump might have had an epiphany and actually wanted to leave a positive legacy.  Obviously he doesn't give a shit about that.  My tragic flaw has always been I tend to trust ppl until proven otherwise.  It's a tragic flaw I'm okay with bc it beats the hell out of going around paranoid

             Something is "Happening" for sure.  But is it the Bad guys vs. the Good guys or is this simply a power struggle b/w two evil parties?    Maybe the Clinton/Soros/Rothschild group goes down, but what about the Rockefeller family?  What about the other evil elites (maybe they aren't the pedophiles, but evil nonetheless)?
            </p>

             I'm A.OK. with Trump's current agenda.  Take 'em down, I'll support that.   And maybe draining the swamp won't end there.  But, I'll be watching.

             One of the largest crisis affecting America is that of vaccine-injured children.  1 in 2 kids has a chronic illness.
             <em>
              At least
             </em>
             1 in 25 have autism (and not just super smart, quirky autism, but non-verbal, head banging, never potty-trained autism).  There will be no one left to defend the country.  Trump has played to the autism-community and developed faithful followers through his vaccine comments and meeting w/ Robert F Kennedy; Only to lose them this week with the placement of Alex Azar of Eli Lilly (inventors of Thimerasol) as HHS secretary?!  And what about the shit happening at the EPA going on under his administration? Poisoning us all....

              Was just having this discussion with another member on another thread/pg whatever.  Yes, 2 cabals/one that wants one world homogeneous satan worshiping population/the other that wants to preserve cultural differences etc/both about eugenics and depopulation but obviously one much worse than the other.  trump would be part of the less evil cabal/my hit on it anyways/I just can't see him into blood drinking etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              So you knock out one stone at a time, which buys us 'time', and continue to red pill everyone you can possibly do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, vaccine damage at epic proportions.  However parents are being mobilized more by the day.  That is a force the cabal of trump's flavor will have to deal with.  Shit, didn't even know about Azar appointment.  Well, these kinds of shenanigans will not go unnoticed by all the angry parents and others that have eyes to see.  trump keeps going back on his promises and more are beginning to see this.  The thing to keep eyes on is the brain chip being inserted into mass minds.  So far naturally not many are going for it.  But what if the chip could control those behaviors you listed...

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              With the ultimate promise of some day we can cure it all together with this wonderful little chip but for now...
             </p>
             <p>
              Which also puts into parents head um, control behavior???  That might even get some of the fundy religious zealots on-board/just speculating.
             </p>
             <p>
              And Alzheimer...our chip can 'modify'...grams can recognize us now/isn't that great?
             </p>
             <p>
              Or dementia...another great fear of the largest population of baby boomers now seniors.  The thought of winding up in a nursing home bc you might leave the burner on and burn down the house.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lots of ways to get the brain chip accepted/and I just bet trumps pharma friends are chomping at the bit.

              EPA...well no surprise there/trump made it perfectly clear where he stood on that.  I had no illusions.
             </p>
             <p>
              trump campaigned on several cornerstones, fix infrastructure, make the cities safe again and no more wars of aggression.  Well, with all the money he is blowing on the military and more wars there is no money for the infrastructure (big surprise) and w/o a solid infrastructure including non poisoned water the safety factor in the cities is exacerbated.  Then of course cutting food programs for hungry children/that will only create more violence/not less.  Add to that increasing visa's for foreign workers (Mar la Go perfect example)...less job opportunities which again exacerbates the violence issue.  Dump on top of that all these fucking false flags.  Was listening to one commentator, the sane progressive (Debbie) that didn't even know about her till mentioned on a thread here/responding to the question why use crisis actors when it's just as easy (if not easier) to just kill ppl.  She said, and it made soooooooooo much sense, with real ppl you have family and friends that will not let the issue go.  9/11 sixteen years later and families etc are holding strong.  With crisis actors false flag complete/move along/and now a word from our sponsors.
             </p>
             <p>
              However those of us that see more and more of what is going on/not jumping on the Q train or anything else, can continue to see more ourselves/my viewpoint is constantly expanding/knowing that more of us that expand create an electrical charge which enables others to start seeing.  Few years ago all you could buy at the farmers co op was gmo corn.  I would mention it was lethal and ppl would say oh no, it's a good thing and give the pat answers why.  Then animals started getting sick, failure to thrive or being sterile and now the coop sells non gmo in addition and anyone you talk to sees that gmo is very harmful (to put it mildly).

              Yes, eyes wide open.  We need to let go of our fav fantasies, our favorite alternative news sources if they prove to be limited hangouts.  Just today my eyes were open to the limited hangout of the Corbett report.  I would catch him from time to time/nothing regular/thought he was a straight up kinda guy.  Had no idea he floated the 'a plane really hit the pentagon'...whelp that did it for me/just like I wanted to believe Julian was legit but 9/11 is just a conspiracy, come on.  I tried every which way to justify that oversight but alas in the end, there is no justification for that kind of blatant stupidity.  Yet for 5 months it was all about Julian, where is he ya da.  I was even part of that till I let myself finally 'see'.  I toss disinfo agents much faster now

              trump as potus is a good thing bc it is shaking ppl up in ways I'm not so sure the cabal wanted.  He was not elected/he was selected.  Ppl put a lot of hope in him (self included) and his betrayal is not going to go away unnoticed/imho anyway.  The chaos and infighting of the two cabals is good bc that infighting weakens them both.  Add to that ppl are being beaten down more...a fine situation for major red pilling.
             </p>
             <p>
              We just have to keep pointing out the obvious and like you said keeping eyes wide open.

             Do not fret...we must remember Trump is not God..this is our problem.....unity will mend the holes that Trump can not fix...its our job to be diligent. Never let someone that needs a hand up go without, its always ok to question the scenario. Never be afraid to be kind...but cautious. Together we have to power to force out the dark energy if we continue to passing the positive or light energy on...Just always be ready to do battle at any given notice!   Its our duty

               Preach 4_InquiringMinds!  All too many people follow their leaders blindly instead of thinking for themselves.  I sincerely hope Trump isn't one of ((them)), but I fear he is.  We need to take our liberty back ourselves.  It cannot be handed to us; we must earn it.

                Not lead us all to the fire, but the false prophet will help to usher in the antichrist. Let us not forget that while the antichrist rules and reins on the earth for a short while, it's doesn't end well for him or the fools who follow him

                 I was paraphrasing, of course. I believe the actual language is this false prophet "performs great signs" ...you know, HUGE. The best signs. "He even makes fire come down from heaven to earth in the presence of men." I'd say that's pretty powerful.

                 If Trump succeeds in bringing the evil to their knees...I'd wager there are many people who will worship him. [I'm not saying he's the Beast of the Bible...just having fun with the idea that idolizing anyone on Earth is something most of us have been warned to avoid...]

                We are created in the image of the creator right?  Would not the creator be one of love, compassion, caring for each other as our brothers and sisters?

                That has been programmed out of a large part of 'humanity' and my hope is in that being restored bc in the end light triumphs over darkness.

                What the cannibal cartel fears most is that we discover who we are in truth.  We have been conditioned to live in fear which feeds their matrix.  We are the batteries/the Matrix movie was in many respects spot on.  Where it deviates is more conditioning that it will take a savior.  From the stories of childhood, the handsome prince, the righteous king etc we are programmed to look outside of ourselves...the hidden knowledge.
               </p>
               <p>
                My hope is in seeing more ppl are awakening first to they have been asleep (the red pill).  Next will come the searching for the hidden knowledge of who we are in truth which is so much more than is commonly understood.

                 I agree with everything you've said.  Unfortunately I don't see human beings waking up any time soon.  It takes a lot of work to reach enlightenment and most of us are lazy.

                  Ah, but see, that is part of the programming

                   wink
                  </em>
                  .  To reach enlightenment we simply have to see the 'spell' we have been under/we keep thinking we have some road to travel to get to enlightenment when in truth we have always been 'enlightened' we just fell asleep and thought we were not/hence the savior myth which is so popular.  That knowledge is what has been hidden along with the true power we are individually.  We have the power to change this simply by our awakening.  The cabal cannot exist in the vibration of light.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yes it may take 'time' (which is an illusion, a construct to perceive this density) and yes, it might take some earth upheavals to rattle the cages of our minds...but whatever it takes is whatever it takes.  Time and time again I see the best in ppl surface when confronted with 'natural disasters'.  This is an area where the cabal really screws up/by making 'natural' disasters it actually puts ppl more in touch with their innate humanity.  We only need a slight majority to reach the tipping point/then others who have not even asked these questions will be carried along by the new current (this is an electrical and magnetic universe).

             Many valid points there, but, maybe there's even a glimmer of hope for a lot of that to change too... Can't force your perspective there, must admit that I myself am running partially on faith there... but... shit, paint me crazy and institutionalize me, if it turns out to be the same old bullshit over again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Try to relax, there's plenty here who share your concerns and won't stop the fight at just taking down the global pedo/trafficking network... some of us are in it for the long haul ;)

              calls it until trump started bombing Yemen, which of course followed more bombing of innocents.  This deal with SA and mega arms sales is not a sigh of hopium to moi.  Any idea what SA is doing to Yemen?  Blocking the port so millions are facing eminent starvation (including millions of children).  Yemen imports 95 percent of food and water.  SA is involved in genocide/but where are the cries for the children?

              While we here are more concerned with our own survival not realizing we are all connected.  Oh right, just little camel jockeys...move along, nothing to see here :(  Not saying that is how you feel please understand/just the lack of awareness of what is happening on the war front.  And that is just one war the US is involved in.

              Yemen is a tragedy of monumental proportions.  Children are dying either from starvation or cholera.  SA won't even allow in the chlorine tablets that could take care of that.  Look at the vids on site about the dying children.  Then tell me our potus who supports bombing, who also supports Israel kicking out peaceful villagers for settlement expansion is a 'good guy'.  Two small villages just last week given 9 days to vacate bc the land has been confiscated for new settlements (which btw is against the law).  Yet now lawmakers have to sign some promise to never go against israel...ever.

                Yemen will open your eyes to something of such horrific proportions/be prepared.  Beyond even what is happening to the Palestinians.  Some ppl don't like the Palestinians but ya know what...there are Palestinian children suffering immeasurably.

                Everywhere the US has gone children are suffering whether via trafficking (our military is big on that one) or just plain coating them with depleted uranium, phosphorus etc...or horrible disease outbreaks or starvation/or watching their entire families tortured, raped and murdered.

           </p>
           <p>
            At first I thought that arial pic was the confirmation, not the limo tags. Maybe both?

             Unlikely, that shot went by too quickly. In charge of Trump's social media is Dan Scavino, I think he's in his early forties, ex golf caddy for Trump, if he's "Q" as has been speculated, and if this is proof of Q, then he probably shot the video. That is quite an obvious zoom on the license plate. Weird. He tweets for Trump and screwed up once sending duplicates, one thru his own account, accidentally, and one for the pres.

            I think the evidence suggests Q is legit, but that license plate clearly says Q-VA008, not "Q vault 8."

             Could they make up the story after the fact; that it was in China for 10 years? Don't Chinese plates have Chinese characters? Is there proof they've been around for 10 years? Is VA Virginia? 008 / one digit above 007 - plus intel loves 8 - it's represents two threes, with one spun . "Q" is famous in 007 movie. -

             It's pretty close, it says VA ... but when did Q identify w/ Vault 8? I haven't been following it enough. What is the specific relationship between QAnon and Vault 8 according to the threads?

            The Presidential limo is the Cadillac. No "Q" or eight on that licensce plate. Now if "Q" is someone close to Trump I suppose he could be in that first vehicle that does have the "Q" and eight on it. I want all of this to be true as much as the next person, but keep a level head and don't claim evidence where there may be none.

                  In the film Goldfinger, M is unhappy with the way Bond is doing things and suggests replacing him with 008. Later in the movie, Bond tells Auric Goldfinger that if he fails to report, it is likely 008 will replace him to complete the mission. Goldfinger is not impressed and responds, 'I trust he will be more successful'.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  008 is also almost recalled from Hong Kong to relieve 007 in The Living Daylights, as he is more inclined to follow orders than Bond.

                 <p>
                  According to the novel, Moonraker, 008 is currently on Recuperative Leave after returning from a mission behind the Iron Curtain.
