               The word "pizza" is known to have been used by CIA agents in an operation in Lebanon that went awry, when they got identified by the code word and kidnapped by Hezbollah:

              SocGen used the codewords 'Pizza,' 'Zorro,' and 'the Men in Black' to hide corruption, Libyan fund alleges
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Libyan Investment Authority asked a London court to require the lender to reveal the meaning of words such as "cooking," "pizza" and the "Men in Black," which feature in documents disclosed by SocGen.
             </p>
             <p>
              The LIA is suing SocGen for $2 billion, claiming the bank intimidated and bribed Libyan officials to carry out five trades between 2007 and 2009.  The fund said the bank paid around $58 million in bribes to Libyan officials, via a Panamanian business called Leinada, to obtain the deals. The bank denies the claims.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mohammed Layas, the executive director of the LIA at the time, was referred to as the "Baker," former investment chief Mustafa Zarti was called "Zorro" and Saif Gaddafi was known as "the Prince," the LIA said.
             </p>
             <p>
              The "Men in Black" were members of Libya's secret police who were "procured" to intimidate officials from Libya's central bank to buy financial products from the SocGen division where Jebali worked, according to the LIA....
             </p>
             <p>
              Jebali is quoted in an exchange with a superior at SocGen as describing meetings with Libyan fund officials using code, such as: "I say to him: 'Well, to buy the pizza, I'm going to tell you ‚Ä¶ its not a case of cooking as we normally do it, it's a case perhaps of helping them to buy ‚Ä¶ the pizzas," according to the LIA's documents.
             </p>
             <p>
              SocGen's lawyers denied the existence of a code, calling the claims "overblown."

Burma does not have the reputation for prostitution that
Thailand has.  But several Burmese friends told me that the sex
"industry" was becoming a major problem because there were
so few other opportunities for poor women to find decent
employment.  The sexual habits of cross - country truck drivers
are especially important since, if they acquire the AIDS virus,
they can transmit it to sexual partners in widely disbursed areas
of the country, to say nothing of infecting their wives or
girlfriends at home.  The promiscuity of Indian long distance
truck drivers has given that country one of Asia's worst and
fastest-growing AIDS epidemics.

              I still don't get what you are on about....?    The Novotel hotel on Mandalay Hill in Mandalay Burma has got nothing to do with The Mandalay Hotel in Las Vegas its just a name. For example Vegas also has a copy of the Effel Tower but its nothing to do with Paris. Understand that Accor is a franchise - anyone who has a hotel building that qualifies can join up with Accor and allow them to brand and manage the hotel. Burma is/ was very strict on allowing foreign ownership likely the actual Mandalay hotel building is owned by a rich Burmese with military connections.

              I don't dispute that a lot of heroin has passed through that region, but I believe that the elite who run that business saw fit to open/ reopen up a more reliable source and that was Afghanistan.

               Boris Johnson recited a Kipling poem about Mandalay while he was in Myanmar. That was the day before the shooting at Mandalay Hotel in Las  Vegas. And somehow that was all over the British newspapers the night before the shooting.  I  pay attention when things like that happen because I don't really believe in coincidences.  Many of my posts (particularly pizzagatewhatever are about news stories from the British newspapers as it is obvious that the deep state in Britain uses the papers as a tool to communicate.  (That's a tactic they have used since WW2.)
              </p>
              <p>
               On looking into the background of the poem I found that it harkens to pedophilia and that article that I quoted which is mentioning the little children of Burma also singled out that particular hotel.  Wondering if that has any significance I found that it belongs to a group of hotels that we mention in a number of pizzagate hotels.  We write a lot about the hospitality industry and trafficking on this forum.  AccorHotels is related to the Saudis and the royal family (Harry and Sparkles) seem to have connections there. Coincidence?

                 - If what we know about Bush is true, then Mark Lagon, must be involved some way, if Bush appointed him to overseer human trafficking for him. Mark Lagon is also listed on the CFR Roster, which can be no good either.

                 - Interestingly enough, he is actually on the Board of Advisors for an organization called ECPAT, which has been "at the forefront of the fight to end the commercial sexual exploitation of children."

                OK, so now you have actually explained what you meant - so Boris may have been acting clever and giving us a hint of his foreknowledge, like Big Mike (Michelle Obama) having the burning Notre Dame reflected in her wine glass as she sails down the Seine in Paris..  And a ton of other times the Elites Muppets have acted smart with their foreknowledge/ predictive programming.

                But do consider that in Mandalay, Burma there are about only 2 hotels where dignitaries can stay and the Mandaly Hill is the most secure + those quoted passages are often quoted as there is little written about the place in modern times except by a very small number of writers.

                  Kipling never visited Mandalay - that why its called the Road to Mandalay. 
Its just a whole nostalgia/ back in time/ British empire thing. 
Until very recently stepping of the plane in Burma was like stepping back hundreds of years and that was one of the charms of the place. But I've never heard it mentioned as a Pedo destination because its a police state.

                    "From 2006 to August 2013, there were 120 confirmed cases of human trafficking in Mandalay Region" I doubt that would keep Jeffry Epstein busy for a month  :-)

                   <p>
                    Bear in mind that often what NGO's call "trafficking" is just some person getting on a bus or a plane and travelling to a neighbouring country to work for more money i.e. actually an economic migrant.
