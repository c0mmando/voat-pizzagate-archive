<p>There is a big name out there. A very big name. He can take down a whole lot of people with him. He is a writer and producer and we call him BC. Along with an already shamed A list actor, he was the first to force this A list director to have sex with him for a future in Hollywood.</p>
<p>BC passed that same trait on to the director. BC has several production partners. Each of them are a little piece to the puzzle. Each of them owns a company which is directly involved with other companies that all are mixed and matched with BC and his two partners. One of those projects is a boys club. An actual club similar to a boys and girls club. One where for some reason, girls are not allowed. They only want to help &quot;boys.&quot; The partner of BC who started this was groomed and shaped by the A list director who is a very frequent guest to the club and a very frequent viewer of the footage from the cameras installed everywhere in the club.</p>
<p>There are estimates that maybe a hundred boys have been molested by this group and their business partners. It could be more. There is another secret player behind all of this and that is an offspring of one of the partners who is also a lawyer. They pay her a lot of money which she spends on partying and she handles all the shell games with the companies.&gt;</p>

<p>ETA Seems that CDAN folks think the whole blind is about Giustra, best friend of the Clintons and someone who would be part of the Uranium One investigation/money laundering - in addition to apparently being a pedo perv who groomed and trained Bryan Singer AND who probably has thousands of hours of blackmail videos.  Wow people.</p>',

             The way it's worded, one of the partners is a lawyer and then they mention a daughter who has a hand in running things.  Initially I read it as the daughter being a lawyer too but that might not be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you read it that the partner is a lawyer then John Podesta and Megan Rouse fits the scenario exactly.  Podesta and Rouse both have business associations with FG.

              True. I have a source near Frank Giustra who tells me a lot about the corruption in Vancouver Canada and if the daughter is not Podesta, I may have a good idea who you are looking for.

            the origins of one company called Lionsgate were in 1995. Out of Vancouver Canada with venture capitalists money. from people in the V.S.E. The Vanvcouver Stock Exchange was still in existence .Since he had to shut down due to it being the MOST corrupt stock exchange in the world. Stephen Shellen and John A Hardy were starting a production company in 1995. John A Hardy was a lawyer and Shellen was an actor writer. Hardy was adamant that the company be called Lionsgate. Hardy was an insurance lawyer and specialized in logging and mining companies. He was living in Vancouver. Shellen was blacklisted and had all paperwork on his participation in that company stolen. Is it the same company? Same business plan, same idea for distribution, same city, same name!! Plus, someone went way out of their way to destroy Shellen

             Yes. Yorkton is Guistra:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In the early 1980s,
              <strong>
               Giustra left Merrill Lynch to create
              </strong>
              a resources-financing group in Europe for the new firm
              <strong>
               Yorkton Securities
              </strong>
              . He is said to have "transformed Yorkton into a major force in the world of international mining finance."[6] In 1990, he became president of the company and, in 1995, was appointed chairman and CEO.

             DUDE I'm shaking,  just a reminder.... Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elizabeth married to fucking Matthew Freud, the son of Clement, the Local Pedo of Madeleine McCann fame, he had a villa in the little town in Portugal where she went missing and he got chummy with the parents.  FULL CIRCLE.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another "coincidence"?  Another guest in the same little town in Portugal at the same time was Mr Philips Edmonds (Philip Martin Edmonds is the nephew of Margaret Hodge. Margaret Hodge (Oppenheimer) is the UK politician who has been accused of covering-up the Islington child sex abuse scandal.)
            </p>
            <p>
             AND guess what business the Oppenheimers are in?  Steel and Mining.  Just like Frank.

               "Minister for Children"
              </strong>
              (excuse me while I just take some valium) in the UK in 2003!!!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              But she RESIGNED SHORTLY AFTER BECAUSE:
              <em>
               "In 2003, following Hodge's appointment as Minister for Children, Panton went public with his allegations that he had been the subject of abuse in Islington Council care and that although he had repeatedly raised the matter he had been ignored. He identified Hodge's complacency as being ultimately responsible for the abuse that he alleged he had suffered. Liz Davies simultaneously went public regarding the concerns she had previously raised while working for the Council.[28] Following a media campaign by several national newspapers calling for Hodge to resign from her new post, she wrote to Panton, apologising for referring to him as "an extremely disturbed person" in an earlier letter to the BBC Chairman Gavyn Davies, which had been broadcast on Radio 4's Today programme.[28] A formal apology to Panton was made in the High Court on 19 November 2003 by Lady Hodge's barrister together with a financial settlement of £30,000.

               Phillips Edmonds seems like the shadiest character at Praia de Luz, it's always in my memory banks.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                “Philip Edwards married Reina Hazenberg and they have three boys, all of whom were out with Philip in Praia da Luz for the week the McCanns were there.
“But not his wife Reina, so it seems.
“We also know from the Portuguese Police files that he mysteriously jetted off to Switzerland, where he lives, early on Friday morning (4 May 2011), apparently cutting short his holiday just as news was surfacing that a child had been abducted from Praia da Luz.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Why Philip Edmonds should choose Praia da Luz as his choice of holiday venue for the week 28 April to 5 May 2007 is not known.
“And there is no explanation as to why Edmonds and his three sons jetted away from Praia da Luz on the morning of Friday 4 May 2007, just as the British public were tuning in to the news and learning that a British girl had been mysteriously abducted.”
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Phillips Edmonds admits having pictures of Maddy!  This is his response to one of the investigators.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                “Therefore, I can confirm that whatever information I had (including some photos of my sons taken on the day Madeleine disappeared, which showed her in the background) was passed both to the police and to the McCanns at the time.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I did a ton of research on the Oppenheimers company Stemcor back in the day and how their interests (at the time) were aligned with Frank G.

            Whoa, someone at CDAN just called out that this entire blind is about Frank, and he's the one who first forced Singer onto the casting couch.  This is huge pizzagate news people.  Just wow.

            Thanks to Uknown over yonder:  BC is Frank Giustra. Residence in British Columbia. (BC) Owns Lionsgate and Thunderbird Films 
And a slew of other billion dollar entities. Connected to Clinton and Epstein As for the writing part; “Recently, Giustra started Fiore Music, and Westsonic Music, and spends much of his time writing lyrics. He is also a guest blogger on the Huffington Post, under Dear Rich People.” The other 2. Are obviously spacey and Bryan Singer He started the " boys club network" (BC)

            Wow.  Amazing guys.  I can't believe the serendipity happening right now people.  The dailymail article is overloading CDANS network servers and I'll bet you donuts to dollars there is someone from voat or 4chan that hopped on CDAN to complete this blind,  linking it not only to pizzagate through guistra but right back in the ballpark of our favorite lubavitcher Jeffrey Epstein.

            This is just an amazing,  astounding and phenomenal occurrence. Something truly all of us should be celebrating.

            Seems like bigger and bigger names are becoming the new ‘low hanging fruit’. It will be real when justice starts happening. Spacey an Weinstein mean nothing. Hollywood punishing itself means nothing until pedos start going to prison. Nice to see that it is getting harder for Singer to cover up stuff, though.
