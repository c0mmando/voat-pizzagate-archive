            You guys need to stop circle jerking over the staged political theatrics and scripted partisan soap opera. This stuff is literally all fake, the politicians and high level representatives are all bought, paid for, and working together.

             Agreed, a lot of smoke screens and nonsense in the mix - but the outcome of said theatrics is very real. This stuff is important. It's easy to say we "need to stop circle jerking" over it, but it is related. I should* say that it could be related. My OP is a perfect example of how these two paths may cross. Involvement w/ Russian adoption could also bridge the gap.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can't focus solely on one underground investigation in which it is nearly impossible (and likely illegal) to obtain any new primary evidence, and then totally ignore a huge political/legal event on the other hand. Why can't you ignore it? Because there is plenty of overlap with
             <strong>
              at least the people involved
             </strong>
             on both sides of these investigations.
            </p>
            <p>
             The more information that comes out around the people/organizations involved in one investigation - could (and has) shed light on the other investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hypothetical example: What if we found out that Fusion GPS was involved in the media orchestration of Comet Ping Pong and how the news was handled re: the shooter?
            </p>
            <p>
             Hypothetical example #2: What if we found out that the Awan's/DWS involvement in a spy ring/DNC activities was also using doped/hidden phones to communicate and orchestrate child trafficking?
            </p>
            <p>
             My OP is an ACTUAL example of how these stories cross paths. The more intel we can gather on the bad actors - regardless of the investigation that uncovers the information, the better.

              Absolutely. We don't need hypotheticals. It's mainstream knowledge that Steven Paddock and his brother were into child porn. Paddock was compromised, working for the Deep State, illegal arms deals, child trafficking perhaps? PG overlaps every conspiracy it seems.

           <p>
            Pizzagate was amplified by Russian social media accounts from the very beginning.  Proven Russian troll accounts were pushing the spirit cooking nonsense.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Whew... if Mueller knew or didn't know, it doesn't even matter. A key witness in the Trump/Russia investigation has a legal history and charges, 10 counts of pedophilia.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's not really unusual for witness in a criminal investigation to have a legal history, especially if they become cooperating witnesses.   We have several in this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Poppadopolous plead guilty and is cooperating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gen Michael Flynn plead guilty and is cooperating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rick Gates plead guilty and is cooperating.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the Sacramento Bee article you posted, you saw the description of how he became a witness for Mueller?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Nader was caught in Mueller's web a few days before the anniversary of Trump's inauguration. He was transiting through Dulles International Airport outside Washington, on his way to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, when his plans changed — abruptly and involuntarily.
Mueller's investigators stopped him, people familiar with the case said. His electronics were seized and he was then allowed to go see his lawyer. Nader later agreed to cooperate with Mueller's investigation, said the people with knowledge of the case as it pertains to Nader. They weren't authorized to speak publicly on the case and demanded anonymity.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is a description of an arrest.  This sounds very much like Nader was arrested in January and since then has taken a plea deal and will plead guilty to other crimes and that Mueller was keeping that under wraps, just like he did with Poppadopoluos.   Why would he plea guilty?  Probably because Mueller presented him with overwhelming evidence of his criminal actions.   We don't know what these are yet, because this Nader story leaked before Mueller filed any court papers.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is connected with Pizzagate in another way as well.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Nader helped organize, and attended, that curious Seychelles meeting on January 11, 2017, shortly before Trump’s inauguration. The meeting brought together Erik Prince, Trump donor and founder of the private security company Blackwater, with Kirill Dmitriev, who manages a Russian sovereign wealth fund and is thought to be close to Vladimir Putin.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If Nader is telling the truth, Erik Prince lied under oath to Congress.  Erik Prince, of course, was one of disinformationists behind the hoax story about what the NYPD found on [ Anthony Wiener's laptop.] 
(
            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/">
             http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/
            </a>
            ).  This hoax is still believed by many pizzagaters today. The problem with this hoax is the laptop was never seized by the NYPD, the FBI were the ones who seized it because it was seized under a federal subpoena, not a local subpoena. Prince also claimed Wiener and Huma were cooperating for the government.  Also part of this hoax is the truepundit website you link to.  This story was also told on infowars, by Doug Hagmann of the Hagmann report.  Hagmann slipped up and mentioned that Rudy Guiliani was his source.  As soon as he mentioned Giuliani, Alex Jones changed topics immediately.  They were apparently supposed to keep Giuliani's name out of it.  At the time Erik Prince gave his fake story, it was not known that he was working behind the scenes for Trump.   This is why Rudy Giuliani never got to be part of the Trump Administration and why he is keeping such a low profile, he started bragging about this before the Comey letter.  He would have faced questions about what he knew about this.

So many details/descriptions/reported "quotes" from the NYPD it did seem* real awhile back, but, none of those apparent promises made by the NYPD were ever kept in terms of leaking the material - so, it seems limited to hearsay and HTML based text. I gave up on that angle awhile ago.

             Agreed... but you seem quick to discount the details of the crime itself. Given his relationships, past and the kind of information we're focused on looking into on Voat/PG - that intel seems very relevant.

              "it did seem real."   I read once that one tip to determining if something is fake news is if the article excites/outrages you.  That might mean it's written, not to lay out the facts, but to play to people's hopes/resentments.   The article will then read as something you want to be true.  The other reason this seemed real is Erik Prince, TruePundit were deliberately lying.  I don't believe they even had any NYPD sources.  The NYPD has never said anything on the record about this.

              The NYPD Weiner laptop hoax seems to me to be deliberate political hoax from folks very close to the Trump campaign.

              I didn't really say anything one way or the other about his crimes.  There was another case where he was arrested but the charges dropped. in the US I believe.  Yeah, here it is,

              And the reason I didn't is because, I find it interesting that his crimes are being used to discredit "Mueller's witness"  as opposed to say "Trump intermediary."  Nader had his hand in a lot of political pies and was pretty bipartisan and not just bipartisan, but he seemed to be able to talk to both Israel and Arab countries and Sunni and Shiite countries.  But he he was also close to this White House and that seems relevant for the current investigation.

              <p>
               First it was them hacking the emails/leaks,
Then, it was hacking the election itself,
Next, the more vague "dirt on Hillary" (Fusion GPS) meeting,
Downgrades to mere "influence" via Pokemon Go, some double-sided Facebook ads and "fake news"
Downgrades even further to vague spies and a last ditch attempt to justify the dossier
Ignores FISA abuse, continues forth with vague nothing-nesses about general relationships w/ Russians and meetings, yet, no evidence of actual election tampering

                I don't know what you mean by very pointed.  But you are acting like the news made this up.  That Kushner and Flynn did not meet with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.  That US intel did not pick up Kislyak informing his superiors that Kushner asked to use Russian equipment for secure communication with Russia.  That shortly after this meeting a meeting was set up in the Seychelles islands where Erik Prince met with emissaries of the Russian goverment on behalf of the Trump team.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you agree that this events happened and if so, they should be investigated to answer your question of why did they do this?  You seem to want to dismiss this evidence.

                This is of course, untrue.   There are many specific accusations and some indictments, but you seem to be taking a very narrow view of what constitutes election interference and dismisses all the specific accusations you laid out.

                In April 2016, George Papadopoulos was told by a contact that Russia had dirt on HIllary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.   He went back and reported this to the campaign.
               </p>
               <p>
                In June 2016, Don Jr was told by a family friend "The Crown prosecutor of Russia ...offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."
               </p>
               <p>
                Don Jr then sets up a meeting to get this dirt on Hillary Clinton.  When this becomes public he lies about it for several days.  We later learn the president was involved crafted those lies.

                 No, I'm not dismissing it. I'm questioning it based on other accounts of what happened. Prince never dismissed or argued this, he simply claimed he wasn't doing it on behalf of Trump's org. I mean, in a large volume of these instances of Russian communications - it seems to be ignored that Russia is a superpower, and that communicating w/ Russia is something that must happen. The mere communication of anyone w/ anyone from Russia is somehow an immediate sign of guilt?

                 You mean the Veselnitskaya meeting? That entire thing has so many holes in it, it's crazy to put much faith into it. Paired with the fact that Don Jr released all of this own comms leading up to this meeting... and the involvement w/ Fusion GPS and how the Russian contacts even made it into the states via expedited VISA's that were apparently not supposed to be approved.
                </p>

                 So, just to be clear, you are stating that the leaks re: DNC and Podesta were orchestrated by Russia? And that Trump's org had advanced knowledge of this and worked directly w/ Assange?

                 Let me ask you this final question: [Hypothetical] What happens to the entire Russian collusion narrative if it turns out to be that these emails were actually domestic leaks and were not hacked by Russia/hacking groups connected to Russia?

I'm not discounting anything, merely stating which side of this argument I am personally leaning towards believing. Knowing full well I could be wrong.

                  Prince's story doesn't make much sense.   He travels to the Seychelle Islands to meet folks from the UAE?  He doesn't meet them in Dubai?  And guess what, Kirill Dmitriev just happens to be at the same resort?  He also claimed Nader wasn't there.  If Nader was there and Mueller has already had him testify to the grand jury, then Prince is lying.   Prince claimed not be working on behalf of Trump, but his unqualified sister is now secretary of Education which looks very much like a quid pro quo.

                  This just isn't true.  It wasn't true for previous administrations and it's illegal to talk policy until after Jan 20th.   When Kushner asks for Russian communication gear, that is not setting up a proper back channel which is often a legitimate diplomatic thing.  Instead this is attempting to talk to a foreign power without the US government knowing about it.   The Seychelles meeting appears to be the same.  And of course, there was all the lying about these communcations, Flynn, Kushner, Sessions, and others all lied about these contacts afterwards.

                  He only released them after he got caught lying over and over over about this meeting.  And just because he released them, does not mean, they won't be a prime piece of evidence against him.  His lawyers already had to turn over any documentation to Mueller, so he knew they knew this as well.  Veselnitskaya was the point person trying to get US sanctions on Russia removed, again, if that was discussed, that's illegal.

                  Russia was certainly behind the hacking of the DNC and the spearfishing of Podesta and many, many other lesser know cases.  The DCCC was hacked. Several former generals were hacked alongside 130 Democratic Party workers beyond Podesta, Voter registration rolls were attacked in like 20 states,  Right before the election, voting software supplier was hacked the same spear-phishing emails that got Podesta were sent to over 100 local election officials just days before the November 8 election.  The RNC was also hacked, but nothing was leaked from that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't think the Trump org had advanced knowledge of this before the hacking occurred.  But once Papadopolous met with his source in London, he reported back to the campaign that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails, they had knowledge the Russians had something.   The Trump Tower meeting emails show us that the Goverment of Russia was providing "support for Mr. Trump" and that this support had been discussed previously with Don Jr.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Do I think the Trump campaign worked with Wikileaks. I don't know how direct this was, but it's been shown that Assange communicated directly with Don Jr and that Roger Stone communicated with Assange through an intermediary, a radio host named Randy Credico.  Assange was also shown to reach out to Fox News to offer damaging info on senators involved in this investigation. It's pretty clear that the Trump campaign thought that Russia might have Clinton's deleted personal emails as Trump called on them publically to release them.   There was also an effort by a Republican operative to try to reach out to hackers to buy Clinton's emails.  The operative claimed to be working with Flynn, Bannon and Conaway on this.

                  Your hypothetical almost amounts to, if what happened in 2016 was totally different, what happens to your story?   The technical evidence is overwhelming, that APT 28 and 29 were involved in the DNC hack and then we got word that Dutch Intel was watching this live.  They had previously helped US fight off cyber attacks on the State Department and the White House as they were happening.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And the DNC hack still seems to be way too narrow a frame.  The Russian interference in the election goes way beyond the DNC emails.  There was a broad based hacking/spearfishing campaign, there was the social media campaigns or support for Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein.  The hacked info from the DCCC ended up in campaign commercials in multiple states.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The other piece to all this added up, is we still don't know everything Mueller knows.  We just learned he had a witness from the Seychelles meeting. He didn't reveal that. He probably has much, much more.  People are saying that they are going to try to flip as many witnesses as they can so that they can use witness testimony and not counter-intelligence signals collections.  Many of these foreign nationals are under routine surveillance by us and by other countries.  A lot of this evidence is still not public yet.

               I get it... he is totally counter on 100% of what we say, regardless of what we provide. He also aligns 100% to the MSM narrative, despite it having been false in later months.

              <p>
               But you've got to give him credit, the method used and the details provided are at least intelligent and well-sourced. I'm not saying I believe it, but I'm also not going to dismiss it just because it goes against what I tend to believe. That's the CNN-method. We're better than CNN.
              </p>
              <p>
               We WANT people to poke holes in this narrative. Because it helps us identify areas of weakness. The items that cannot be weakened become the foundation, and new information/insights/news is layered on top of that to solidify the case.
