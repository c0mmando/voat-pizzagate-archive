<p>There are now two major claims involving this. One is that Clinton knew Silsby for a long time and only looked out for her based on this personal involvement, rather that as part of her responsibilities as Secretary of State.  Two is that Alefantis is somehow connected to Silsby.</p>
<p>I\'ve also found a massive bit of evidence I haven\'t seen before that I\'ll discuss later.</p>
<h1>Claim 1:  Clinton knew Silsby for a long time</h1>
<p>Here\'s the post that kicked it all off on Reddit.  I think this guy was deliberately lying.
<a href="https://archive.is/CZP2F">https://archive.is/CZP2F</a></p>
<p>Why do I think  he must be lying.  One is he points to a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776">document that is not an email and claims it\'s an email.</a>  Secondly the document clearly talks about the Haitian Earthquake of 2010 and yet this guy claims it\'s from 2001.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2054204/10138899">From earlier tonight.</a></p>
<p>Literally the 3rd and 4th sentences of the Reddit Post that started this is completely false</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura\'s NGO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It absolutely false that Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Silsby. </p>
<p>It is absolutely false this document is an email. </p>
<p>It is absolutely false this document dates back to 2001.</p>
<p>Reddit\'s TheDonald fans couldn\'t have cared less if this was true, but it\'s mind boggingly that anyone else believed it. For one thing WIKILEAKS DOES NOT HAVE CLINTON\'S EMAILS FROM 2001! For another thing, the document is about the Haitian Earthquake. WHICH TOOK PLACE IN 2010!</p>
<p>How did people miss this? Hillary\'s emails are from her time as secretary of state which began in 2009. And the her clintonemail.com account did not even exist in 2001. Look at the document, it clearly is talking about January 2010.......<em>.The Urgent Need: The number of Haitian orphans is estimated to have increased by 300% as a result of the catastrophic earthquake this past week.</em></p>
<p>One reason that people missed this, is that Wikileaks has this wrong in their system and they have it wrong to this day. (The Millennial_Falcon summary evidence is also an absolute mess on Silsby.)<a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776"> Wikileaks identifies this as an email &quot;emailid/3776&quot;</a></p>
<p>Yet, when you look at the email 3776, you see it\'s not an email. How can you have an email with no sender and no recipient. Even if you write a draft, the from is filled out. And we know the date is completely wrong. My guess is Jan 1, 2001 is a default.</p>

<p>It was an attachment to an email and it was downloaded AFTER Silsby\'s group was arrested.

<p>There\'s a couple of other things hugely important in that email thread.  One is this whole thing is not coming from Clinton.  It\'s coming from Consular Affairs in Haiti.  <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/emergencies/arrest.html">Consular Affairs is part of the State Department\'s mission</a>.  It involves helping Americans arrested overseas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrest or Detention of a U.S. Citizen Abroad</p>
<p>One of the highest priorities of the Department of State and U.S. embassies and consulates abroad is to provide assistance to U.S. citizens incarcerated abroad. The Department of State is committed to ensuring fair and humane treatment for U.S. citizens imprisoned overseas. We stand ready to assist incarcerated citizens and their families within the limits of our authority in accordance with international law, domestic and foreign law. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second hugely important thing to note is nobody at the State Department knows who these people are.  They are identified at 10 AMCIT or American Citizens.  The only way the guy found the attachment is by googling the name of the group arrested in Haiti.  You can go to the State Department\'s website and see all the emails chronologically from this email and see Silsby and these other Baptists from Idaho were unknowns.  In fact, there\'s no evidence whatsoever that Hillary Clinton or anyone else in Washington DC, had any idea at all about who Laura Silsby and this group of Baptists from Idaho were before they got arrested in Haiti and that includes Alefantis and MacComby.</p>
<h1>Claim 2:  You can connect Alefantis to Silsby.</h1>
<p>See here for this claim.  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2057950">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2057950</a></p>
<p>Alefantis knows Max Maccoby. </p>
<p>Maccoby worked for Friends of the Orphans. </p>
<p>Friends of the Orphans raised money for Nuestro Pequenos Hermanos.</p>
<p>Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos runs an orphanage in Haiti.</p>
<p>Silsby got the kids from the Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos orphanage.</p>
<p>The problem with this is the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35507224/ns/world_news-haiti/t/parents-all-haitian-orphans-had-relatives/#.WZATX1GGM2w">AP tracked where Silsby got everyone of the 33 children</a> (13 from Citron and 20 from Callabas) she was arrested with.  None were orphans  She basically convinced their parents she would give them a better life in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reporter\'s visit Saturday to the rubble-strewn Citron slum, where 13 of the children lived, led to their parents, all of whom said they turned their youngsters over to the missionary group voluntarily in hopes of getting them to safety.
Similar explanations were given by parents in the mountain town of Callabas, outside Port-au-Prince, who told the AP on Feb. 3 that desperation and blind faith led them to hand over 20 children to the Baptist group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Waxdino commented </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The theory here is that Silsby got away with 100 kids from Friend of the Orphans. She was caught with 33 kids she gathered up off the street, but her &quot;lawyer&quot; Jorge Puello claimed she got kids from an orphanage that crumbled in the earthquake and called for help. Perhaps the sex-trafficker posing as a lawyer for a child trafficker slipped up and wasn\'t supposed to divulge that info.** Perhaps he pulled it completely from his ass,** but, that would be a strange coincidence given that the director of that orphanage has ties to Alefantis and Brock.
Friends of the Orphans indeed had a building that collapsed (or was it demolished?), but they claimed no children were in it at the time. However they reported that 100 fewer children were in their care post-earthquake.
I think that\'s enough strange coincidences to warrant a real investigation. Friends of the Orphans was never even questioned after Puello asserted that they were involved with Silsby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Waxdino recognizes this is a theory and the Puello is completely known liar.   Also in that thread, I have researched and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2057950/10153922">laid out what facilities Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos had in Haiti in 2010.</a>  I got this info from the NPH annual reports for 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p><a href="https://issuu.com/nphi/docs/nph-haiti-country-report-2008">https://issuu.com/nphi/docs/nph-haiti-country-report-2008</a> <a href="https://www.nph.org/intranet/reports/docs/6/2009%20NPHI%20Annual%20Report.pdf">https://www.nph.org/intranet/reports/docs/6/2009%20NPHI%20Annual%20Report.pdf</a></p>
<p>I always dismissed the Maccoby story based on two things.   One is that &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot; is the name of a US group and wouldn\'t be the name used in Haiti.  Two is Puello is just a crazy known liar.</p>
<p>Looking into <a href="https://voat.co/user/waxdino">@waxdino</a>\'s claim I found that NPH did have a building collapse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends of the Orphans indeed had a building that collapsed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it was not the orphanage. It was the offices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kay Pere Wasson (Father Wasson Center) located in PÃ©tionville, Port Au Prince This five-story building, formerly St. Damien Hospital, is the administrative hub of NPFS</p>

           I always dismissed the Maccoby story based on two things.   One is that "Friends of the Orphans" is the name of a US group and wouldn't be the name used in Haiti.  Two is Puello is just a crazy known liar.

            You are disinfo....but not just a typical shill. You are a paid insider or "blackhat".   You know what that is. Where does your conscience go when defending the market if using children for sex trafficking. Where is your moral clarity?
           </p>
           <p>
            For the Love of God....even NBC news has now reported Hillary Clinton covered up child sex trafficking in the US State Department.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are either an attorney trying to influence a jury or have a guilty conscience about something regarding child sex trafficking. Time to come clean it go into hiding and lawyer up yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Call Jorge Puello, maybe he will offer his services for legal defense as he did Laura Silsby while wanted in several other countries for child trafficking.

              Because you refuse to be reasonable when discussing these issues. There's actually a formal expectation in Law that people are "reasonable". Without reason the system breaks down:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person
              </a>
              . When people refuse to reason there are legal consequences.
             </p>

              For example you refuse to answer simple questions that may make you look bad. You don't have that option.

               Because he's thinks he wants to dumb down actual ethics standards to make "schmoozing" look unethical which is a ludicrous idea and as a policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, he has partisan reasons and is not a disinterested observer.  The success of the Clinton Foundation is that they wanted to take the Davos model, where people travel to Davos to look like a big macher and hobnob and schmooze and use it to do good in the world.  If people want to donate money to charity because they think it will get them in the same room with Bono, well more power to them and we'll use their money to save the lives of AIDS patients.  It's a simple attack their strength, political tactic.
              </p>
              <p>
               and none of that has anything to do with being a paid insider as you yourself do it all the time.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also I wonder if you are aware that Jeffrey Sachs has done his own work African development. That he essentially is a competitor to the Clinton Foundation for fundraising and prestige.   Are you aware of his experimental program in Africa and the response of his critics?  Do you think it would stand up to politically motivated scrutiny?  I think Bill Gates's review of Sachs strengths and weaknesses are a good one.  Ironically, one of the places Sachs failed is specifically an area that the Clinton Foundation has tried to work in, making sure farmers have access to markets.

               <p>
                I already know your answer: "Because there was a Charity Audit.". But AreWeSure a charity audit is less rigorous than a Financial Audit which has to go to ground with all the money. A Charity Audit doesn't pierce the veil of a limited partnership. If you want to keep all the money people gave Bono to help AIDS patients for yourself just create a limited partnership to hide a theft. Call it "Bono's Limited Partnership for AIDS Relief." Then keep the money and try not to laugh when the charity auditor comes around.
               </p>

                </p>

                 Charity auditor: "Ok, that's good enough for me. Thanks for your time."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bono to CFO at the Limited Partnership: "How much of the money I raised went to AIDS relief?"
                </p>
                <p>
                 CFO at the Limited Partnership really struggling now to hold back an uncontrollable urge to laugh hysterically: "All of it."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bono: "Great. Thanks for your time."
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                And done. You now have stolen 98% of the money meant for
                <s>
                 Haitian Earthquake victims
                </s>
                AIDS patients.
               </p>
               <p>
                AreWeSure the problem is you didn't know there are different types of audits. Well Columbia Economics Professor Jeffrey Sachs DOES know there are different types of audits. So does retired banker Charles Ortel and author Peter Schweitzer who wrote "Clinton Cash".
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you see what's going on? At this point if you are a "Reasonable Person" you will concede this point. You will say "You know what I don't know if the money actually went to AIDS patients or Haitian Earthquake victims. I'm going to finally watch Clinton Cash to see if there is any other evidence."
               </p>
               <p>
                But you won't do that AreWeSure because you aren't a "Reasonable Person" in the eyes of the law.

                 Don't forget that CharityNavigator.org, the preeminent site for rating non-profit orgs, "delisted" CF/CGI because "it didn't fit their model for assessing non-profits".  Translated, CF/CGI was so bad, and they received heat not to report, they just disappeared CF/CGI right off their site.

                  Blacksmith, all of what you say is wrong.  They were not delisted because they were "so bad."  Charity Navigator didn't rate them, because couldn't assess them due to a reorganization at the CF. At the time they said this
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Why isnât this organization rated?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We had previously evaluated this organization, but have since determined that this charityâs atypical business model can not be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What does it mean that this organization isnât rated?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It simply means that the organization doesnât meet our criteria. A lack of a rating does not indicate a positive or negative assessment by Charity Navigator.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Charity Navigator does rate the CF and it gives the Clinton Foundation it's highest score: four stars,  rating it a 93.91 of 100.  It's gotten a 4 star review, two years in a row.  As a point of comparison, the American Red Cross gets a 83.33 and City of Hope gets a 90.13.

                  As pointed out above the this claim by you is completely false.

                 <p>
                  The Clinton Foundation changed its corporate makeup so Charity Navigator couldn't do an apples to apples comparison.  They address this in their FAQ.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Why hasnât Charity Navigator published a rating of the Clinton Foundation for the last few years?
For each charity, our rating system evaluates numerous financial and accounting metrics, including a comparison of how these metrics change from one year to the next.  In 2013, the Clinton Foundation merged with one of its affiliates, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). This merger made it difficult to compare financial information of the combined entities with financial information from the Clinton Foundation before the merger.  In situations like this with any charity, we will reevaluate if the charity provides consolidated financial data that will allow us to perform an accurate year-over-year comparison.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   How is it that Charity Navigator is now able to provide a rating of the Clinton Foundation?
At our request, the Clinton Foundation provided pro forma consolidated financial information (in particular, a pro-forma Form 990). This information allowed us to conduct the analysis necessary for us to issue a rating.
                  </p>

              In their view they likely believe they are helping this community by providing a skeptical question in the notions presented here.  Don't discredit this goat's efforts here as he does provide constructs to his positions, most of the time, not always.    They sometimes make logical sense, other times they are an obvious stretch.  Who knows what they don't know?.....

               What exactly is being exposed here?  What happens here that has any effect?
If folks here want to drop their nonsense conspiracy theorizing and actually focus on helping children, they could have some sort of impact, but they don't. They simply won't do it.  They want to stick their conspiracism because on its intrinsic to their constructed identities.

               I'm not fighting the exposure of child trafficking, I'm fighting witch-hunting and irrationality.  I'm fighting evidence free conclusions.  I fighting the lunacy that sees every instance of pizza or a spiral as de facto evidence of pedophilia. Do you not see the madness that is upvoated on this site every single day?  I'm fighting a complete lack of proportion, an inability to shades of gray and people who can understand jokes and metaphors.  I trying to get people to understand that we now know a lot about the quirks of the human brains that often make us believe things that are not true.
              </p>
              <p>
               There a dozens of logical fallacies we fall prone too.  There's other cognitive glitches we fall prone to.   Here's an example.  It's called the availability heuristic. If you can easily think of an example, human beings vastly overestimate the possibility of that happening.
Think of the obsession with tunnels on this site.  People are always mapping tunnels. Tunnels under Comet Ping Pong, Tunnels by Clinton's headquarters.  Why?  Is there any actual evidence involving tunnels?
              </p>
              <p>
               Human beings are simply far less rational than we think we are.  You have actually train yourself to check your thinking on things.  Let's say you had three wheels with three different events on each.   If you spun each wheel, so that random combinations were formed, our brains could create a story where the first wheel caused the outcome of the third wheel.  There would be no truth to it, but that's how our brains work.  We love connections and stories.  When someone is researching say Comet Pizza and then keep making connection after connection, I understand exactly what is going on there and why it feels important.   It's because making patterns and connections is one of the ways we survived through the millennia, our brain actually releases dopamine when our brain makes connections.  It actually gives up happy chemicals.  (I also know what happens cognitively, when someone like me types up a post like this. )

           <p>
            Hillary Clinton was sent email updates on the prosecution of Laura Silsby, who was caught trafficking children in Haiti. Laura Silsby was got off the hook by Jorge Puello, who was later convicted of sex trafficking, and was wanted on charges of sex trafficking in four countries. Additional source. Izette Folger, a close friend of James Alefantis, gave a statement in support of Silsby. Folger is the daughter of Michael Maccoby, who coaches leaders of Nuestros PequeÃ±os Hermanos, or NPH, a large organization that runs orphanages all over the world. His son, Max Maccoby, is on the Boards of Directors of an NPH orphanage called Friends of the Orphans, which is one of 760 orphanages operating in Haiti, and happens to be the orphanage from which Silsby was caught trafficking children. Max Maccoby gave an emphatic and lengthy statement of support for Comet during a contentious neighborhood commission meeting. The relevant portion of the audio file starts at 31:40.

             Possible Disinfo?   That's hilarious.   I think have debunked charge number 1.  I certainty debunked the evidence used to assert charge #1.    That's a valid bit of info for this investigation.
Disinfo should be used when someone is actively lying and not just incorrect, right?

             Yes or No?  Did the state dept have the silsby document when they rescued her from Haiti?
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't answer yes or no to this, because the State Department did not rescue her.  She was convicted of a crime in Haiti and sentenced.  She left Haiti after the Haitian Justice system was done with her.

            <p>
             Yes.  Of course she was.  Because she is the Secretary of State of the United States and ensuring that American citizens have their rights seen to is part of the State Department's mission.  And this was a high profile case.  Clinton's involvement in this case is NOT because of Laura Silsby who she didn't know.  Clinton's involvement is because of her job, She was the secretary of State when this occurred.  As I point out, the State Department got involved because it was 10 AMCIT arrested or 10 American Citizens.  The State Department would have gotten involved if it was a different set of 10 American Citizens or if the crime was different.  See
             <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/amanda-knox-monitored-by-state-dept-from-the-start/2011/10/03/gIQAJaCIJL_blog.html?utm_term=.6df6b302ef19">

             In fact, the State Department was criticized for being slow to react in that murder case and Knox ended up deciding not to get a lawyer and wound up being falsely convicted.

             This has nothing to do with Clinton.  And Silsby was not got off the hook, she was convicted of a lesser crime after a trial. Puello was not her lawyer at trial. This is another thing your summary seems to not understand.  Puello was exposed and

             Check your summary.  You provide no link for the "Statement in support of Silsby."  So I can evaluate that one way or another, can't see if she was just responding to what was in the news or something more material.

             You do provide a link for the claim that the NPH orphanage

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              VAN SUSTEREN: Where did they find these 33 children? How did they get these children?
PUELLO: There was an orphanage that collapsed in Haiti. It was called friends of the orphans of Haiti. And there was somebody over there that told them that the orphans had no place, no room to place them.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The context make clear, Puello makes this claim about the 33 children she was arrested with.  So the theory mentioned by Waxdino, that I quote doesn't apply.   (100 kids from Friend of the Orphans)
            </p>
            <p>
             The same 33 children where the AP traced to Citron and 20 from Callabas.  NPH operates no facilities there.
            </p>
            <p>
             The NPH orphanage is in Kenscoff which is up in the mountains.  As I said in the original post, the NPH bulding that collapsed was in Petitionville and

               Yes or No? Did the state dept have the silsby document when they rescued her from Haiti?
I can't answer yes or no to this, because the State Department did not rescue her. She was convicted of a crime in Haiti and sentenced. She left Haiti after the Haitian Justice system was done with her.

                 <strong>
                  10 AMCITS ARRESTED WITH 33 CHILDREN, HEADED TO DR. NOW UNDER ARREST IN PORT AU PRINCE

                 ?  If you haven't read that email then you don't know about the Silsby case and the State Department.  It's that simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It starts with a call to the embassy duty officer (literally the person who answers the phone in the middle of the night when you call an embassy)  in the US Embassy in Haiti who emails/calls consular affairs and it goes up the chain.

                 It was not the person that caused the response. The response was because it involved American citizens.  That's what consular services is about.   It moved all the way up the chain because it was a  high profile case.   10 Baptist Missionaries from Idaho arrested with orphans in Haiti after the Earthquake?   That's a story that going to AND DID get tons of news all over the world.  It was going an international incident, the missionaries were denounced by the Haitian Justice Minister, the Haitian Chief of National Police and the Haitian Prime Minister. Three former presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention appealed to President Obama on their behalf.  It made headlines all over the world.

              Oh look you forgot to address my issues:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Silsby lied and said the kids were orphans when they weren't.
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Silsby was repeatedly told not to take the kids out of Haiti without government permission. She was told that by both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. She ignored both their warnings and she was arrested for child trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              3) A child's organs are worth over $1,000,000 and provide a compelling financial incentive for any child trafficker. At the time of her arrest Laura Silsby's business was struggling and finally went bankrupt.
             </p>
             <p>
              4) Children are also used in Brownstone Operations. Jeffrey Epstein and Mossad ran a Brownstone Operation on a Carribean island close by called Little St. James. Mossad used underage children to gather sexual blackmail evidence which is often used to control politicians. Dennis Hastert is a prime example of how TPTB put compromised politicians in positions of power so they can control them better.

               Your issues are irrelevant.  The state department's consular services are available to any American, guilty or innocent.  And you have zero proof that 3 and 4 apply at all to Silsby.

                That's true but organized crime is built on plausible deniability. That's just how it's done. Lucky Luciano imported Mediterranean and South American "fruits". For every organized crime there is often a legitimate cover.

                Laura Silsby's crime is highly relevant because it suggests a legitimate front(Christian missionaries) for child trafficking. Laura Silsby even worked for Alert Sense which could, ding ding ding, give Silsby a veil of legitimacy de rigueur for any organized criminal and her WASP Mafia capo.

           <p>
            Please disregard AreWeSure. He or she is on a mission to "Resist!" any and all criticism of Killary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            If AreWeSure was truly objective they'd concede some of the massive pile of evidence pointing to the Clinton Foundation committing charity fraud on a scale never before seen in the History of Western Civilization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even prominent Ivy League economists will tell you straight up the evidence of fraud is
            <a href="https://youtu.be/JbS3MGzr0AI?t=6">
             overwhelming.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But AreWeSure has NEVER conceded a single piece of evidence pointing to a crime. That's extremely odd if one is here to objectively investigate a potential crime. I've been wrong on MANY occasions like my totally misreading George Webb as legitimate. He's not. He's another CIA limited hangout like all the rest, FBIAnon, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange etc etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rational and objective people admit their mistakes. AreWeSure has never admitted a single mistake which makes he or she either the smartest person in the world or a mindless Hill-bot.
           </p>
           <p>
            So take his or her accusation of our "blind hatred of Hillary Clinton" with a grain of salt. The evidence Hillary &amp; Co may be involved in child trafficking down in Haiti is substantial and can't be dismissed. If anyone's curious for the most damming evidence let me know. The worst is Laura Silsby lied and said the children were orphans. None of them were orphans, they all had at least one live parent. Silsby was also told not to take them out of Haiti without government permission. Both the Domincan Republic and Haitian government told her that and she ignored them.
           </p>
           <p>
            (For context a child's organs are worth around one million dollars and provide an enormous incentive for a child trafficker to kidnap them. They're also useful in Brownstone Operations at the least the cute ones.)

             CIA disinfo has a purpose and that's to distract from evidence of real crimes. If there were no real crimes why would they go through all that effort to set up CPP and James Alefantis?
