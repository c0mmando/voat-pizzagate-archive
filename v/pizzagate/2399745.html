<blockquote>
<p>Two men were convicted of child sex trafficking related charges in early 2018, and both were missionaries to Haiti and worked with child orphans during the time Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Both men received lengthy sentences and will most likely die in prison.</p>
<p>James Daniel Arbaugh, a missionary from 2008-2017, pleaded guilty to raping and molesting more than 21 boys while in Haiti. Arbaugh was arrested on November 15, 2017 after admitting to a psychologist that he had committed the crimes. Arbaugh created a blog where he frequently posted pictures of himself in the company of children. He professed evangelical Christian beliefs and described himself as a “nomad” and “homeless”. Sickeningly, Arbaugh wrote a blog post about the crisis of child trafficking and child slavery in the West’s poorest country.</p>
<p>A second man was prosecuted by the feds for sexual abuse of minors. Daniel John Pye ran an orphanage in Haiti from 2006-2012 according to his blog. He was sentenced in January 2018 to 40 years in prison after it was revealed he engaged in “child sex tourism” and child trafficking while in Haiti. Records of his conduct are so horrific that we can’t describe them in this article; the abuse spanned several years while he and his wife were missionaries in a rural area of the country.</p>
<p>Daniel Pye also penned a sickening blog post in 2009 where he discussed abuse that the girls of his orphanage had faced.</p>

             Sorry. I thought it was funny. I don’t think that makes me a hypocrite tho. Don’t you think you’re taking this a bit far? I don’t want to disregard your feelings. But you don’t seem like yourself right now. Maybe you’re going thru a hard time.

              U too a dear soul I value your hard work, but your hipocysy or however it's spelled is as yet unclear to u. Dracula is vampire. Dracula Haunts me to death and wants to bite my neck. I am getting some silver in the mail soon. Am happy about that. I wish I we're going too far, you know it's a meaningful story. But, It's me that's telling YOU. 
I DONT THINK SO I THINK YOU KNOE THE WHOLE TIME.  that Dracula is the name of a fictional character BASED ON nonfictional events. BASED ON vampirism.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am sorry to be that person. I want to protect everyone. I am having a hard time.

               What? You’re accusing me of knowing something? Then lying about it? I don’t believe in vampires. Sorry! I believe there are blood drinking Satanic evil people. Sorry that what I said triggered you. That wasn’t my intent. Maybe you should see a therapist.

               <p>
                and you probably have read the qposts lately probably about the FLORIDA SHOOTER in which he asks how many shooters have received therapy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you still trying to be funny? And kind ? Or are you a contemptuous sadist. Or both? Or neither?
               </p>
               <p>
                THERAPY.  if you haven't kept up with Q  that's one thing but many of us HAVE DONE
 and THOSe of us who  have lost children to the Family court, we KNOW ALL ABOUT THERAPY.
 SO ITS very very VERY rude the way you speak to me authoritatively on therapy. It's liberal and it's SICK. just saying. You should be paying me this ADVICE also.
               </p>
               <p>
                furthermore I'll add to that I am not and never did  take any medication. In fact in my county thru my mental health services I am not eligible for PTSD disability UNLESS I take meds. Is that SICK?
               </p>
               <p>
                Though did u read my posts?
               </p>
               <p>
                You are smart but very very ignorant and it can come accross as insulting. Personally as attacking my  intelligence just to put it lightly. Recommending me for THERAPY OK? 
But I'm not going to trip out ok. I'm like this all the time.
               </p>
               <p>
                I wAs ORDERED into therapy at my own expense. Thru the court all of whom are farmed selectively, APPLE FAMILY WORKS, circle family fuck all kinds a buuuuuulllllshiiiit ok? At my own expense, ALL AT A LOSS TO ME.
               </p>
               <p>
                so my dear your words are so hurtful but you have never probably looked into corruption or yet made that therapy corruption/ child vulnerability weakness connection.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's only in retrospect that I strongly see now that I was able to hold on to my sweet child, MY CUSTODY,  I CANT DESCRIBE what hard time I had trying to fight the court, they seemed predecided, even when I was showing porn sites and horrible horrible shit to the court that the other parent owned....
               </p>
               <p>
                I was in disbelief the whole time anyway now I know it's only because I was raised being told THERAPY IS GREAT! so by the time I had reached 20'S I always had a PhD I could talk to especially thru my thirties I had my own shrink, this I had no idea would become crucial!!!!!
               </p>
               <p>
                I was oblivious and had me and my kid seeing shrinks cause THERAPY IS GREAT! where I come from right? So sick. But i was able to ward off many blows at our custody like I said I kept her till she was 11 because we had had a psychiatrist always for THARAPY. I was able to prove consistently that we were FINE mentally.
 THEY KEPT ATTACKING. THEN THEY GOT ONE OF THEIRS In THERE.
 TRACY BRADY that's part of how I lost my girl. When I tried to take her out of seeing Tracy. Brady, just an intern. Evil person. Any way my kid she was 11..
 But till then I always had a PhD go  OH you SAY my patient is batshit nuts and a bad caregiver? And it would be like no. Here's a clean bill of health thank you very much now fuck off.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I'm gonna try to not be insulted by your insensitivity.
               </p>
               <p>
                PLEASE LEARN.  just realize you know you anf the rest of em.  but it's your post . you called

                Dracula. If people are calling people vampires it's CREEPY. OK? WHY DONT YOU WANNA SEE THAT.  I could go to therapy to talk about silver bullets but that's for werewolves...i geuss I need a wood stake. Just entirely creepy. ALL I HEAR is that MF is a great researchers. Oh well. A loss?
               </p>
               <p>
                I think my issue was that I came hear and he was gone. There was no discussion as usual. I don't really remember but I think that's who deleted the majority of my deleted posts. Still it's hard to deal with having some person stripped away for me.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's my prob. I've lost people in my life it seems like I never get a say. It's just they are gone.

                 When I responded, I didn’t realize everything you’re going thru. I read it from another comment. I feel bad for you. I’m sorry you’re hurting.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I stand by my laughing at a Dracula comment as being no big deal. Have you not seen the awful names people get called here? I think it’s rude to say I’m ignorant because I don’t agree with you about this. I don’t believe in vampires like I said. Maybe you’re superstitious or that brings up memories. If so, then I’m sorry. But please see that sometimes something that may be a big deal to you is not to others.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You’ve now accused me of lying, being a hypocrite and ignorant. The word “Ignorant” is a trigger for me and reminds me of my childhood. But I realize that to you, it doesn’t affect you the same way. I have remained calm with you. Only because I feel that you are hurting and just lashing out. But I would appreciate it if you don’t push me. I really don’t want to be a bitch to you.

                  Be a bitch! You need a little little push. Name calling is fine.  My point is you know the difference between evil satanic blood drinkers and Dracula it's in the realm of zero difference. Your anger is indignant and aggressive not rooted. My anger is and has been directed. We both agree these things are bad, though bc Dracula is just a story in a book that represents the exact same thing the community abhors it's ok you call it to the guy who is now shunned (?) Fired(?) But the same person yesterday was among us today gone. 
I just don't know what happened.

I'd rather walk over Legos trend Will Frerell"  trending " having just said on SNL dick Cheney's HEART IS MADE OF LEGOS NOW.   im THINKING HEART PROGRESS or Heart replacement /s ($) organ harvest.

                      Srazie I haven't back since our thing! thank you! 
I m so glad your not mad at me, it's so scary and im totally crazy mad. Like insane, but sane. So any way DUDE!  it's gotten so real, I just told my friend actually my good frenemy her dogs probably being abused... That's been hard they're not talking to me... But the person's not saying im wrong! Animals! A whole other layer to this pizzagate. O m G
The honeybee had mentioned it and I googled warning signs in animals....they get really sick...it's another known thing, vets know.. it's legal in ALOT OF STATES. 
Other than that I've been on Twitter and am working on deciding the trends. It's getting really obvious. If I could just pin down what that IT IS but I swear to GOD I think it's about pizzagate to say the least. I think it's desperate secret messaging for people not only into Pedophilia bestiality but cannibalism. And ritual. Like right now Twitter trending ldratherwalkaccrosslegos ok wtf? That's children that's pain that's colors that's alot messaging right there but then you look into the corresponding supposed trends that's answer or at a minimum support each other like...dickssportinggoods ok hunting who cares about guns &amp;nra the message is hunting . IDK like I said I wanna pin it down but we have Pizzahut we have capital Hill... So just saying it's like a daily excersize. I hope your good... I will come back when I post again.

                       Awww no I’m not mad at you. I think animal abuse, beastiality, child rape, etc go hand in hand. It takes people that have no souls to do these things. So dark that they have no compassion or the capability to love. These freaks have no limit and are extremely dangerous. Mix that with Satanism, power and money and put them in groups of people like them and it is absolutely terrifying.

             @srazie

            this is a good Sgt article and abt confirmation bias and Mr. Go fuckyorself

           </p>
           <p>
            the clintons did have those emails about silsby, the clintons did act, in some capacity to protect Silsby
           </p>
           <p>
            Further... I think this article alone would be enough factual info to make a petition against Silsby holding a position to do with children at all her place of work at Alertsense ...
That something productive we could do, we would need to be on the street and actually get signatures I beleive. I suppose online signatures can be valid too. I would like summon an army of signatories. People would have to be willing to write their names. I have collected signatures for .ca voter ballots and it's not the first thing people want to do. But Silsby needs to be removed  and probably her employer von Hansen too. Why would von hansen CEO of Alertsense promote the kidnapper Silsby. Must follow money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly I am greatly saddened by the whole false EMERGENCY that seemed to just draw out the WORST in this community.

            we are going after, ok. That's delusional hurtful words that disrupt and create malice division, it's so ungrateful, it's behaviour that gloats in the demise, artificial demise,....fake emergemergency and SELF GLORIFICATION.
           </p>

            It's not progressive. No millenialfalcon comments even have a place on this thread where we are literally  focused on MONSTERS.  You muddy everything and break everything by going after falcon this way. Am a mod. Do have to moderate this? Really? Ok then
Daniel oye and his buddy and silsbSilsby are the vampires. Nobody here should talk shot about another person on voat without HYPER  specifically SAYING EXACTLY WHAT THAT PERSON DID WRONG. Because it creates a toxic environment.

             I’m a little confused. Who called someone a vampire? Are you standing up for

              @are_we__sure

             or telling him to go fuck himself? If you think I’m being mean to him, it’s because I don’t like him.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am normally a very sweet person and am nice to everyone as long as they are nice people. But I don’t like assholes. I don’t like shills. I don’t like disrespectful jerks. I am a bitch to people I don’t like.
            </p>
            <p>
             Voat forces you to harden so you don’t get hurt. I used to cry in the beginning too. I wasn’t used to people being so mean. Donkey is who really helped me become tough here. It’s actually become therapeutic to stand up for myself.

             wants to dish it out, he must suffer the consequences. He has banned good researchers. I’ve seen screenshots where his reason was “Because I can.” He has been so rude. I’ve never stooped and called a mod a pedo. That’s too far. I don’t remember calling anyone a vampire. That doesn’t sound like me. But I would call him a faggot.
            </p>

             I agree Laura Silsby needs to go down. I always sign petitions. I have no problem with it. I’m not really sure what you are telling me. Are you upset with me or something? I’ve always gotten along with you. Let me know what it is that I did that bugged you.

              If someone did something bad here, we know how to screenshot. That's what we do. We can all screenshot.
Don't be confused. I am a very sad person who doesn't give a fuck u know. I'm just being honest today. I can tell  I'm having a hard time.

               Yeah I’m always taking screenshots. Are you saying I’m hiding it? I haven’t deleted shit. I don’t know if you had some horrible experience that makes you sensitive to “vampires”. If so, I’m sorry if that insulted you. But, maybe you need to realize that Dracula is a fictional character and not a big deal for many other people. Replying to someone and calling them a hypocrite is not the way to handle it. It’s way too far.
              </p>
              <p>
               I remained calm. I apologized. I felt maybe you were having a bad day. I’ve never treated you bad. I never deleted anything so you can take all the screenshots you want. But I’m not kissing your ass. If you don’t give a fuck, then I DON’T GIVE A FUCK.

              . I started out fine but the thing about calling me a liberal was after he commented about me saying people weren't being nice he responded people are not nice. And that's wrong too people are nice. I am nice. I try to be ok. But im not ok. Im worried. Im sad. I do cry. More than reasonable.. I have a broken phone its been 3 years since the family court stripped me of parental rights and haven't seen my own child in too long. So when I say garbage. My life is garbage not yours. In sorry if I hurt your feelings

              It seemed like you had none...as after after you asked what upset me, and after I explained and called you a punk and thug...didnt really hear back there. I felt cannibalized. In easy to top over mentally, I wish I had video of me in court cause I did not go down easy. They did not take me out of my child's life this horrible way without the fight the fight of my life and in exhausted and I miss my kid so bad and I don't know If she's being mkultrad be cause she's being guarded by bad people. It's killing me it's killing me inside. I don't have anything to lose to do searched on Google to find the hidden porn links...or to report foster parents who rape people to the fbi, to post the Moloch landmarks and stupid brave shit like that I do to say fuck you to the lycifluciferian.  In just crazy out my mind missing my kid.

            What a ridiculous headline.      Also isn't Daniel Pye getting counting twice?    He was the last one, who else could they be referring too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now back to the ridiculous headline.   Is everyone familiar with the logical term
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic)">
             Non Sequitur
            </a>
            ?  It's one sentence is not logically connected to the previous, it means it does not follow.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's the second half of the headline have to do with the first.  You could just as easily rewrite is as
           </p>
           <p>
            2 More Haiti Missionaries Convicted of Child Sex Trafficking; Both Were In Haiti When Hillary was a Senator from New York.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 More Haiti Missionaries Convicted of Child Sex Trafficking; Both Were In Haiti When Condi Rice was Secretary of State.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 More Haiti Missionaries Convicted of Child Sex Trafficking; Both Were In Haiti When Eli Manning won the Super Bowl.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no connection between the two pieces of information, both were missionaries before Clinton was Secretary of State.  It only serves to activate people's confirmation bias.

            Upvoat.  Thanks for reminding us that it is still going on in Haiti.  Even though there have been many arrests, more than before, the Big Fish have not as of yet been Fried.  She Takes A Village.

            Arbaugh, a missionary, reminds me of a story about a priest that was so in love with a boy that he actually believed he was doing the boy a favor by sexually abusing him.  These pedophiles not only Groom their Victims and the Parents, but they Groom themselves.  They so convincingly Brainwash themselves that even though they are trying to spread the word of God, it is all OK.  He professed Christian beliefs, but also believes his own Pedophile Religion. Abusing Children is OK as long as it gets him through the day, in order to spread the Word of the Lord.  These people are really sick.  I think the laws in Haiti are pretty stiff, remember that even though the Clintons tried to keep Silsby out of jail, she still spent time in jail.  Let's hope the cell is their coffin.

            That's horrible. Any funds from these organizations and from the Clinton Foundation should be seized and given to the victims and people of Haiti. What they have done there is unforgivable.

                Ah! Now I understand, lol. Sorry, am a bit slow today - the overall excitement. Will suggest this to Vindicator and get back to you. He's the senior here. ;-)
