<p><strong>Notes on first interview:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Artem Reshetnyak (Ukrainian) introduces himself. He’s lives in Argentina and is engaged to a known escort named Lucilla, who is originally from Uruguay. They’ve been together for 3 years.</p>
<p>He ran a blog from Summer 2013 – Fall 2017 where he publicly denounced the pedophilic and sex trafficking network led by Gustavo Vera. He conducted his own investigation for these posts</p>
<p>He says an official came to his home (where he lived with Lucilla) and gave a warning: his girlfriend had to stop promoting herself (as a prostitute) – Gustavo’s orders – and if he didn’t stop talking about Gustavo online they would kill him. He doesn’t share the name of this officer.</p>
<p>He wrote an article about how the <strong>media gives a false impression on the nature of human trafficking, focusing on the adult female victims and not mentioning the children and male victims. Says homosexual and pedophilic sex slavery is more common.</strong></p>
<p>He agrees with Jaitt when she says that La Alameda promises to help victims working in poor conditions in illegal sweatshops, but instead takes advantage of them. He was <strong>contacted by an informant (who he wants to keep confidential) who divulged information on the criminal activities of the organization: sex trafficking, pedophilia, blackmail.</strong></p>
<p>He started working with Martes Rojos, a Latino organization dedicated to ending sex trafficking in the most vulnerable neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Natacha says everything he’s reporting confirms what she’s been working on – <strong>La Alameda subjugates the very people they’re claiming to liberate. Artem agrees and says that Gustavo Vera manages this network, he’s directly involved in its operation.</strong> The video cuts off as he is talking about sharing data against Vera.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Notes on second interview:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Sources of income that fund Gustavo Vera: Bergoglio and also extorting sweatshops</strong> using illegal hiring practices (Gustavo’s mafia gets paid to not alert authorities to the crimes of these businesses)</p>
<p>Another source of funds is selling drugs. Uses the organization to gain an advantage over local gangs, just like La Alameda is used to shut down brothel competition. They selectively target areas and then install their own network. This network is not like the local gang culture, which abides by a traditional code of conduct, e.g. <strong>the La Alameda mafia sells drugs to school children, because once they are hooked on drugs they are easier for La Alameda manipulate.</strong></p>
<p>Lucia Perez, the victim of abuse and ultimately murder at the hand of Gustavo’s mafia.</p>
<p><strong>Children are kidnapped (one group that does the kidnapping – the Stolen Childhood Network, which claims to be a group to help children)</strong> from the poorer neighborhoods and are victims of the pedophile network which also brings in a lot of income.</p>
<p>Natasha repeats the idea that these children are targeted because they have no resources, no power, the judicial system is not concerned with maintaining their safety or upholding the law in their case. She equates it to the prostitution and pedophilia networks run in the soccer leagues. Artem agrees with everything she’s saying.</p>
<p><strong>The headquarters of the human trafficking operation is the in the Northern part of the country but the network has an international reach: Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, Spain, Italy, including Rome. There’s a big demand for blonde European children.</strong></p>
<p>There are many other important people involved in addition to Gustavo Vera – <strong>Juan Carr (runs The Solidarity Network) whose organization pretends to look for missing children but actually kidnaps children.</strong> They give false hope to families who have missing children, when they find the child they keep the child as a sex slave.</p>
<p><strong>Bergoglio provides funding and protection for La Alameda and allows the Catholic elite in Rome to have access to the children. Creating centers for disadvantaged children makes the children dependent on them, because they have no resources other than the Church.</strong>&quot;</p>

            I keep seeing things saying he is going to be replaced or is being indicted, but nothing happens. Hopefully that changes soon because every Catholic I know personally still believes he is so great.  Kind of scary to see it because of what we all know. But you try to tell someone this stuff and it triggers them hard!!! The truth needs to start coming out.

            Take  Artem Reshetnyak with a grain of salt:
           </p>
           <p>
            He wants to recreate an old Babylonian religion based on the cult of the  goddess Ishtar
            <a href="https://artem-reshetnyak.blogspot.com/2015/07/el-culto-la-diosa-ishtar-una-religion.html">
             http://artem-reshetnyak.blogspot.com/2015/07/el-culto-la-diosa-ishtar-una-religion.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Si, para vencer a todos estos enemigos de la Libertad, yo Artem Reshetnyak busco crear una nueva religión que unirá y representara a todos los hombres y mujeres libres en nuestra guerra por recuperar lo que es nuestro. Y mas que crear la desde cero, lo que realmente busco es recrear una muy antigua religión de origen babilonio del culto a la Diosa Ishtar, que anteriormente en Sumeria también era conocida con el nombre de Inanna.
           </p>
           <p>
            (partial translation of the following: " Ishtar ...was the goddess of fertility, of the Earth, of the sexual liberty and the war.... Ishtar was featured as the sacred courtesan of the gods and also the patron of the Babylonian prostitutes that practiced in the temple the rite of Sacred Prostitution"
La Ishtar en la religión babilonia figuraba como la Reina del Cielo y la Señora de la Tierra y era la Diosa de la Fertilidad, de la Tierra, de la Libertad Sexual y de la Guerra. Aunque su mayor merito y representación iba a dirigido a la sexualidad humana donde Ishtar se destacaba por ser la cortesana sagrada de los Dioses, como así también, fue la patrona de todas las prostitutas de Babilonia que ejercían en los templos el rito de la Prostitución Sagrada. Ishtar era una Diosa muy temida, valorada y respeta no solo por los humanos, sino por el resto de los Diosas. Y por un lado simbolizaba el amor y la belleza femenina(la griega Afrodita tan solo es una de las interpretaciones de la Ishtar) y por el otro era muy belicista y guerrera.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also wants to create a new republic in Patagonia :

            He and his girlfriend are starting a prostitution business that will cover the country in 10 years and is named "Goddesses of Pleasure"

             Nice find.  I guess that's why the writer of the OP article inserted this note at the beginning:
            </p>
            <p>
             [Once again, this whistleblower isn’t anyone’s ideal.  But what do you expect?  And, let me be the first to point out, this guy, along with Natacha Jaitt is literally risking his life in talking about this stuff. Bergoglio, Vera, et. al. are satanic murderers.  More to come in this space. Please lift up the Argentine translator/sleuths providing this content in English in prayer. -AB]
            </p>
            <p>
             We'll see what else emerges to corroborate or disprove his claims.

            Natasha Jaitt would have more credibility if she left her clothes on or quit wearing reptile masks. She has a distinct Kardashian flavor.

            Thank you! Thank You!  Thank You!  I could feel it in my bones that he was involved in some type of sex trafficking of Our Children.  This monster is sitting in the Holiest Chair of the Roman Catholic Church and instead he is a perverted pedophile.  I knew it all along, because of his total disregard of all the sexual abuse and raping done by his appointed and evil disciples.  I am sorry to say, but I believe the devil himself is living in the Vatican, the House of God.  May he go to the Hell he says does not exist and burn forever there.

            If you will permit me some patience in this. About two weeks ago Francis preached the tactic of "silence" in the face of all the homosexual and pederasty revelations in his church. It was, to say the least, shocking. But in looking deeper we find it is nothing new. That is his pattern. This is from 2012 or so.

             In Argentina, he was a deadly silencer of opposition.  That's no doubt what has prompted whistleblower Archbishop Vigano to issue a dead man's switch:

            <p>
             What's reallly odd about Bergoglio is his apparent switch from conservative in Argentina to progressive now that he's pope.  You have to wonder whether he's an actor in a larger plan.

              I'm not convinced he was a conservative in fact. Argentina, in is known for a particular sort of theology, Liberation Theology. We know it best in the form of Jeremiah Wright. Recognize that name? If you don't, think Obama's pastor in Chicago. That's the sort of theology he had. It could be that Francis was still "silent" even in that, meaning he didn't parade it about.
             </p>
             <p>
              Recall that photo from Q 1953?
             </p>
             <p>
              Evo Morales gave that cross as a gift to Francis on his first trip back to South America. Francis wasn’t pleased with it. You can read about it in the article I've linked. But here’s the deal.
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               Morales had to have felt comfortable in giving that gift to him. There was something in Francis that permitted him to do this. Something that allowed him to say, “This is right for this man.” You don't just give that sort of a gift to a pope unless you
               <em>
                know
               </em>
               you can. You don't want to make the Pope mad. Morales thought he was safe to do it.
              </li>
              <li>
               Francis was a priest in South America for many years before he was a Pope visiting from Italy.
              </li>
              <li>
               That means Morales would likely have heard him once or several times as a priest, bishop, or cardinal.
              </li>
              <li>
               When Francis the Pope rejected the gift he was recognizing what should be according to Roman Catholic tradition. The cross was not right with that.
              </li>
              <li>
               However, how a man speaks and what he does
               <em>
                as
               </em>
               a priest toward his people speaks more loudly as to what he really believes.
              </li>
              <li>
               Morales gave him that sort of cross because Francis spoke that sort of theology. He acted like a Communist with the government. He was a Communist.
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              The new Pope was “outed” in that picture. Not by what he rejected, but by what one of his former parishioners gave him as a gift. He is a Communist. An infidel.
             </p>
             <p>

             </p>
             <p>
              See, that picture is mirroring. Evo Morales is reflecting back to Francis who he truly is.

               Bergoglio turned liberation theologists over to the military junta.  You're saying that was for show--that he was pretending to be conservative?  Could be.

                "Bergoglio turned liberation theologists over to the military junta." I wouldn't put it that way. His theological form is classified as Liberation Theology. That is important to understand how he sees his place in the world regarding politics. Liberation Theology is more at home with Socialism, which is the forerunner to Communism. That's what has him by the willies right now. His Liberation Theology is what makes him say thing like, "Who am I to condemn?" about gays. Then it leads him to think he must be silent in the face of overwhelming evidence of pedo- and priest- pederasty abuse. His silence
                <em>
                 was
                </em>
                a condemnation in the past. This is what he needs to face. It is now a condemnation of sorts to many who recognize it for what it is, failure to speak for the innocent. That is his pattern. Liberation Theology is the Obama "Lead from Behind" sort of stuff. Sometimes people need to be called out for what they have done wrong.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think what this is doing is leading up to something sinister. Softening people to accepting a gay priesthood, and eventually pedophilia. After all, if they cannot be cured, if they are "born that way," if they cannot be condemned, then they must be accepted. An now Francis has called his critic the devil. Is this not a familiar patter over all?

                 Obviously true.  Doesn't look like it's going to pan out for Bergo, though.  People are beginning to come to their senses.

               Fascism is more connected to pedophelia than communism. Not much difference in the two extremes......govt. owns everything in communism....oligarchs own everything in fascism...BUT pedophelia is a hallmark of fascism. as well as ..hatred for women and children.Big "tell" as they say in poker.

                That is true. What I was pointing out was Francis's historical use of
                <em>
                 silence
                </em>
                to the cover nefarious deeds around him. In that the two systems operate the same way. Whether a fascist concentration camp, or Communist gulag, silence is the means--and anonymity. He's a bad actor from a long way back. His appeal to silence is how he maintains order in his "realms." Here is the other side of his silence to think about--which relates to what you speak to. He is sending messages with it, and not good ones. The lesson he doesn't seem to get is: Silence speaks louder than words, and sometimes it is ugly.

            Thanks for posting this! I saw it earlier today. A lot to process, and many new areas to research. We're getting closer to knocking this impostor off the throne of Peter, God willing.

             Gilderoy, this is what we have been waiting for.  But now it must hit the MSM.  This is beginning but there is so much that must go forward before we are of rid him forever.  I am hoping that there are plans in place to capture or trap him in some way.  He surely will stay in the Vatican and not go into Rome or elsewhere.  He knows there are many now that wish for his demise.  We must whip up those Italian Mamas that have been supporting and adoring this devil. They must be told the truth.  This news must make it's way to Italy.

             Yes, the pressure is building against him.  If he leaves before the crimes are completely revealed, though, the public might become complacent, believing a new pope will make things right and turning attention to other things.
