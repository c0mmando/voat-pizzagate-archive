            This is an amazing story. The detective, who is Catholic, tried to take this guy down twice and he was acquitted. Then he got a 17 year old whose friend had committed suicide because of this guy to wear a wire. The audio recordings are one of the sickest, most evil things you'll ever hear. I'm giving this an NSFW tag because they might be a bit rough for survivors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listening to the kid respond to this guy's evil instructions knowing he is wearing a wire is pretty amazing. True courage.
           </p>
           <p>
            The detective was fired for no reason after the conviction, too.
