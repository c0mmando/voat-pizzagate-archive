            So why did you slip off of the MOD-LIST on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            ?? We needed you on the site, you were like the only person there that isn't following the REDDIT narrative.

            says you quit and they have asked you back, but it appears they dropped you, what the fuck is going on?

            I made a post linking voat to reddit through ycombinator with a bit of a sensationalist headline kevdude kneejerk dropped me from the modlist in response thinking I was going rogue due to an attack unrelated to pizzagate. We had a discussion and came to an understanding. I asked not to be remodded for now. I will most likely be back next week as I said but for right now I have to focus on getting ready for school again. I think we have enough people on the mod team that me being gone for another couple of days isn't going to be that big of a deal I just hope millenial doesn't try to stay up all night like I usually do. Also link to the brandy comment as he's not entirely wrong.

             According to how it was explained to me (I did not verify as I don't really care) there was an amalek attack or some crap going on across the site regarding Jews and Thiel or some bs like that. The whole point of my post was to illustrate the relation between reddit and voat and the company that funded both of them. (still no verification of whether or not the funding to voat was a grant) That was it. I will be coming back to a mod position over at
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             here soon I am as far as I'm aware amicable with all of the mods as of now. I just took the opportunity of not being a mod for a minute to go take care of some IRL stuff I needed to. kevdude basically reoffered me the mod position back immediately and I told him not to remod me for now.
