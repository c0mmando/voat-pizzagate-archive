            All incoming officials hold meetings with other nations officials, including Obama's. His ambassador made a trip to Russia before he was inaugurated.  There has been no proof of anything illegal. They cannot try Trump for treason for getting his men in place to make contact with foreign countries. This is part of the job. This was a criminal act to leak classified information to the press. I think we need to seriously investigate the intel community. Who authorized this wiretap. Was it really on Flynn or the Russian ambassador. I wouldn't trust anything these guys say since they committed a criminal act in releasing the contents of the call to the press. Flynn had not done anything illegal, so it has nothing to do with being a whistleblower.

            Flynn may or may not have lied to Pence. I really don't care at this point. Why didn't Pence just read the transcript to find out. It looks like a setup to me.

             Obviously HRC is involved or she wouldn't have opened her big, evil yap about it.  Seems pointless trying to figure out how/why it happened. And who knows, maybe this was Trump's plan to bait the witch. Anything's possible.

             Cool catch! I realized the error too for taking out what was misleading but never saw this about the account's authenticity. This may mean that no one related to Michael Flynn is specifically an actual Pizzagate hero, which means that the whole hero statement in our context may need to be revisited for further validation.

            Are you joking or just shilling for David? After the elections Obama tried to provoke the Russians into fucking war. Probably only because of general Flynn's phone call Putin decided not to react accordingly but instead wait for the new administration to come into the White house. Which part of that don't you understand? Obama might have hoped to catch Trump himself calling Moscow as they had bugged the lines beforehand. The media is shilling hard to make Michael Flynn look bad, but if you have any fucking clue on what's really going on you know that MICHAEL FLYNN IS A HERO.

             I'm not joking. I know he is a hero. If not for the cool head of our new administration and Russia... I don't even want to think about what HRC would've dragged us into.

             Putin is smart enough to not fall for it. He knows exactly what is going on.

            <p>
             Unfortunately, he would be a liability in that sense no matter what. Donald Trump didn't want to risk even the appearance of impropriety.
