De Niro used Polanski\'s house to have orgies and invited young girls there. Both Polanski and De Niro would ply them with alcohol, get them drunk and then rape/have sex with them.  The day he was caught, Polanski was not at his own home because de Niro was using it for an orgy.  That is why Polanski still blames him.</p>

<p>This permanent A+ list mostly movie actor who is an Academy Award winner/nominee has a secret. No, not the one where he cheated on his long suffering wife with a large number of women who seemingly decreased in age each year. The wife was finally kicked to the curb for one of them. So, not, not that secret. Instead, he has a much bigger one that happened way back in the day when he was just getting that big break. That one movie people still quote today. On the set for that movie were multiple tweens and young teens. Our actor would invite them out and then over to his new friend\'s house. The friend is a foreign born former A list mostly movie director who is a multiple Academy Award winner/nominee. There, the two of them would get the tweens and teens wasted and have sex with them before giving them cab fare home. Our A list director was busted for one of those teens. The reason the director was at the home of someone else was because our actor was using the director\'s house for a little orgy of tweens and teens. Our director felt he would never have been busted if he had been at his own home with the girl surrounded by others her age. Our actor agreed and has been sending money to the director and has paid for almost of all the legal bills for the director over the last four decades. Not Jack Nicholson.</p>

            Remember Weinstein would meet with young starlets in DeNiro's restaurant and then use an office above the venue to force them into sleeping with him. All the staff have been quoted about how disgusting and abusive Weinstein was while IN DeNiro's restaurant. I'm guessing because he knew those staff would be fired rather than him being banned.

            It's Haiti all over again, with Gaston Browne as the corrupt official, and general malfeasance director. I am just hoping that Packer is not just really a Packard because that would sully the name of a great car. Certainly would explain why De Nero would be so vociferous about getting Trump impeached for anything, (the wall is bad for the sex slave business).

            This explains why he has been so vocal at blasting our POTUS!  These reprobates are finally getting caught and they don't like it!  Once again, Q is right --Those who are loudest...  &amp;  There will be a time when they cannot walk down the street (my paraphrase).

             Oh give it up with Trump and Q. Before you Trump tards entered the reality movement, everybody knew that left vs right was a false paradigm, they were both working for the same masters. Now it is back to square one with all this white hat and invisible behind the scenes fight for justice. There are no white hats, you are just too big a coward to accept that you have to fight your own fights in life. Nobody is going to rescue you. There is no PG investigation, it was covered up. And no arrest were made. 2019 in progress and all the blather has been proven to be bullshit. Have some shame and stop pushing the goal post back.

            Look, I don’t think DeNiro is above being a creep. 90% of Hollweird are creeps, pagans, Luciferians and general degenerates. I take issue with the source here. This is catty, salacious, page 6 -style gossip with no substance.

            Look at Deniro's two big movies - Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Both deal with underage girls.

            I mean ... I get why y'all are drooling over this, but CDAN is a gossip site and has a disclaimer stating that everything posted is a work of fiction.  (Even if it's based on real events).  I don't think this counts as a reliable source.

             I agree. However....This site is meant to tell you they know something you don't know, and have you figure it out yourself based on clues. And often, after doing research.  you find out things you didn't know about those you find out they were talking about. But...you are still correct. I think the fiction part is to cover there ass legally. Doesn't seem they are making things up.

             'Yes...two words, Kevin Spacey..........you didn't read about him on the other sites or  MSM......but he went down. Our media is "state" or in other words, controlled....Bob Graham , former senator from Fl., had information he wanted to get out to the general public about 9/11..he wrote a non fiction book and released some of it that way........then a fiction so he could reveal more.....(not sold on Amazon) Have noticed that some books with real information on our current US sorry state of affairs sell on Amazon but for like 2 or 300 dollars. For a reason.

              I read a comment or something once regarding Enty that took me by surprise. They referred to Enty as a woman. Then I recalled how often Enty talks about being good friends with female celebrities and it made a lot of sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if the big fat man image is just a persona and it really is a woman. It would make sense because women are seen as trusting, someone you feel more comfortable revealing secrets to.

             Well, for one thing, snottywood is evil and most of the top directors, actors, etc have jointed satan's club.
Deneero is one of the top actors whom they drag out every once in a while to keep the contract intact. (Like Bad Grampa, a must watch (NOT) 
In the music industry, it's Bob Dylan,  putting out nothing but trash, but keeping his end of the bargain!

           <p>
            <strong>
             A high court has suspended all construction work on a controversial airport development on the unspoilt Caribbean island of Barbuda that residents say will devastate its fragile ecosystem.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Antigua and Barbuda high court of justice granted an interim injunction to prevent building work on the airport from continuing during a legal challenge against the territory’s government over the international airport development.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Barbudans who brought the case, John Mussington, a school principal and marine biologist, and Jacklyn Frank, a social worker, welcomed the court’s decision. They are being represented by Leslie Thomas QC, a London-based lawyer at Garden Court chambers, who also represents some of the survivors and bereaved relatives at the Grenfell inquiry.
           </p>
           <p>
            The injunction was granted after the case was lodged outlining concerns about environmental damage that Mussington and Frank believe the project will cause. Internal documents used by their legal team revealed that the authorities had been warned about ecological as well as archaeological risks....
           </p>
           <p>
            The islanders complain that the work to bulldoze forests in preparation for the construction work got under way when residents were evacuated from the island during Hurricane Irma.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are formidable interests hoping to do business on the island if the challenge fails. The Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has a stake in a company, Paradise Found Nobu Resort, that plans to build a large luxury tourist resort there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas argued that Barbuda’s extraordinary habitat – turquoise sea, white sand and magnificent coral reefs as well as fallow deer, red-footed tortoises and many rare birds – would be at risk of significant damage if the development goes ahead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mussington says Barbudans have been careful custodians of the island’s fragile ecosystem for generations. They have made a living from sustainable fishing and export of lobster along with low-key tourism. Until now the island has escaped over-development and has been regarded as the ideal destination for travellers seeking quietness and tranquillity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Development has been curbed to sustainable levels by rare legislation giving the islanders – descendants of slaves – communal ownership of land. But the law has recently been amended making it easier for speculators to purchase some of this unspoilt territory.
           </p>
           <p>
            The $250m (£192m) De Niro resort has the backing of the Antigua and Barbuda government, but local organisations have already voiced their anger at the prospective construction.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the face of that opposition, Antigua and Barbuda’s prime minister, Gaston Browne, hit out at “economic terrorists” who he said wanted to “block investment … and keep our people unemployed”. “They would have to face the full extent of the law for any infractions whatsoever,” he added.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asked by CNN this year about the planned development, De Niro said the goal was to help the island get back up and running after Hurricane Irma. “The most important thing [is putting] the people first and then the hotel. Those things can be done simultaneously, but it’s a big endeavour,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Irma, a category-five storm, hit the island last September along with many others in the Caribbean, causing enormous damage including to most of its buildings. The repair bill is estimated to be $150m and recovery has been slow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Barbudans were evacuated to neighbouring Antigua after the hurricane struck. When they started returning, they discovered that earth-clearing work had begun, bulldozing forest in preparation for the building of the airport.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             “People on the island were shocked and devastated. They broke down crying when they saw that thousands of feet of pristine forest had been torn apart to make way for the new airstrip,” said Mussington.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Fears over the impact were compounded by the fact that the initial area bulldozed was abandoned after it was discovered that caves lay underneath the proposed airstrip.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The legal challenge cited a review of the airport plan by the country’s Department of Environment dated 4 December 2017, which warned that “many of the negative environmental impacts have already occurred in the absence of an environmental management or mitigation plan”.
           </p>
           <p>
            It stated that although an environmental impact assessment was conducted, critical aspects of the geology, biodiversity and archaeology were not captured within it. It also said ground-penetrating radar analysis, hydro-geological study and prehistoric site assessments were not carried out. It added that the supporting documents were just two annotated Google Earth photos.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The work on the Barbuda airstrip was well advanced prior to the DoE having an opportunity for review of the application,” the report stated. “The development work conducted up to this point has not therefore benefited from appropriate environmental guidance. This has resulted in environmental damage which will be difficult to recover from.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas said: “Significant damage has already been done to Barbuda this year. Development of the airport must stop immediately until proper assessments can be made and procedures followed.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Mussington said what was happening on Barbuda was being replicated in different places around the world, leading to a rise in CO2 levels and permanent destruction of a climate compatible with human survival.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We suffered one disaster with Hurricane Irma but that was followed by a worse disaster – disaster capitalism,” he said. “Until now we have been able to sustain our livelihoods on the island without jeopardising the future of our children and grandchildren. But now wealthy individuals are putting that world in danger
           </p>
           <p>
            The planet's sickest individuals seem to have the most money.
