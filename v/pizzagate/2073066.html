            I am a Bowiefan and of course I think I have to defend my favourite rockstar here - although I also did not know him personally - and I know he was not a "virgin" and probably has his dark secrets. 
But, let's have a look at the things written in that Dailyfail-article. There is a lot of gossip taken out of context. And rumours which were never proven. We should be careful with what we believe and always look for the source. 
The quoted Wendy Leigh was wellknown for writing gossip-books, not only about Bowie, just before she fell out of a window (well, which makes it fishy again :p) . The Lori Maddox case is well documented. She  and  a girl called Sable Starr have been "professional groupies" on the hunt for rockstars. She later boasted about that story. Although it's still  not right to have sex with girls as young, you cannot compare this to pedophile hunters like Savile, who were abusing and traumatizing young people. 
Dana Gillespie says she was his girlfriend at the age of 13? Oh, wow, she's born 1949. So Bowie was 15 then? Very pedo. 
Bowie never was known for being "a nonce", but I guess he took advantage when it was offered to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let's have a look at his "Dark Secrets":
            <br/>
            Yes, Bowie had  some "dark secrets", I am pretty sure, especially in the beginning of his career. We know he was interested in Crowley and Kabalah (like so many rockstars then), but also in Buddhism and even planned to become a buddhist monk. He was a "searcher". 
And  yes, he was  sexually very active in his early days, he was never faithful, as all of his (girl- and boy-) friends said. But when you look at his "favourites", they were usually grown up, tall women,  not little kids.  And the "Nazi-Fascination"? He explained that later in several interviews.
And, yes,  he used his "sexual attraction" to get what he wanted. I  guess, when he found out, that old gay music-biz-guys drooled over him, he might have "played" with them...
            <br/>
            And, yes, we know, he was involved in some occult crap when he was in L.A. in the early 70ties. We know he probably got involved with OTO.  And, also interesting,  his infamous Manager of these days, Tony DeFries, had ties to the Ministry of Defence. 
Bowie also  was heavy  on drugs at that time. There is a story that he once was convinced that there were ghosts in his swimming pool. He did some crazy things like collecting his pee  in the fridge. That's crazy and weird and he probably did even more crazy and weird things then.. and he also was suffering from  paranoia, as you also can see in the movie "cracked actor" - and always was afraid to end up like his brother Terry or other crazy family members.
           </p>
           <p>
            My personal opinion is,  "they" tried to groom him for their illuminati club, and maybe he was interested - as he always was interested in new experience, and because they might have helped his career.  So he maybe  got involved with them.  But  - I think -  when he ran away from L.A., kicked DeFries in the ass and moved to Berlin, he wanted to get rid of these things and tried to normalize his life and bring up his son Duncan in a decent way - who is a nice guy today.  And have at look at his last years he spent with wife Iman and daugher in NYC. Can't see something evil here anymore. But I sometimes think he knew  more than enough about these evil things. 
Yes, maybe that story is right, that they offered him that "warm body" (source?), but if he declined, it just shows that he was not totally rotten (maybe they hoped he was).
           </p>
           <p>
            "OUTSIDE"
            <br/>
            That is my private "obsession". You know his album "Outside" from the nineties he made with Brian Eno?  It's a superb album, but also very confusing and disturbing. It's about "the ritual murder of 15years old girl Baby Grace". It's called "art crime". 
The history tells, that Bowie and Eno wrote the plot in a short time, but that Bowie used some diary he wrote in the seventies. When I read the lyrics 20 years ago, I just was confused and thought, Bowie is just jumping on the "Hannibal Lecter"-Bandwagon  of the mid-nineties. TV was full of psycho-killers then. Today, after getting into all this ritual killer abuse-stuff, I read the lyrics in a different way.  Or after reading about  that "spirit cooking"... who knows what is called "art crime"?

             I agree that its important not to judge prematurely without investigating further. I also disagree with portrayals of Lori Maddox as  professional seasoned groupie out forn sex with rock stars. She was absolutely a victim. Only 13 years old, and there is proof members of Led Zepplin kept her locked up in their hotel rooms and raped her.

             I can believe Bowie (your last paragraph) was just trying to be artsy and edgy, shock rock was popular, look at Alice Cooper, chopping up babies onstage (song Dead Babies) for the shock appeal, and the most he ever did offstage was drink beer, play golf, and probably some groupies. His whole shtick was to keep you guessing what he was all about, when indeed, all he was really about was showmanship, he was playing golf on the side even in those crazy early days and still is, after a few bouts of alcohol rehab, alcohol nearly killed him, his onstage dancer performer became his wife and she helped save him, they're still happily married. However, Bowie probably was a bit of a heathen ... Cooper just acted the part. Being "androgynous" was a big part of Bowie's "appeal," the main thing about Bowie, that kept everybody guessing, and provided fodder for the media.

            because this is the norm in elite circles ?  .........  Bowie's bodyguard answered a knock on the door and called for David who went to the door and returned a few minutes later, 'white as a sheet'. 
'He was visibly shocked. Someone had just turned up and offered him a warm, dead body for David to have sex with.'
That was the perception of David Bowie and Ziggy, the alter ego he created and wrote about in song lyrics. 
'He obviously looked like such a freak that some sick people thought he might be into necrophilia.'

              Thanks. I liked him kind of from the fringes, but, obviously not enough to watch documentaries on him. I did see his  wife in LAX, the last time through there. Kind of funny to see her wearing a full length fur coat in LA.

              I truly believe there are a lot of stars that have lived this type of life, but I also agree these people should be slandered while alive.  I think it so very unfair that they can be attacked this way after death.  Think how many lives would have been spared if Saville had been outed. What a horrible life those victims have had.  And the poor little poor children thrown over the side of the boat. Horrid.

             These satanic freaks love to mock and troll the world. Fake deaths are a big thing among these clowns.

               I mean that that man being interviewed in the video is David Bowie. It's rather obvious.

                Dude I'm a flat earther so I'm pretty fucking open minded and I don't see it. Been following Bowie for 20 years. Yeah there's a slight semblance but this is reaching.

                 That is David Bowie. You can find a video of the "real" (might just be a character too) of Jack Steven being interviewed. Obviously he acts and looks much like to Bowie in the Sky News interview. They wouldn't have chosen this identity otherwise. However, the real Jack Steven has a pretty big gap in his teeth and looks ever so slightly different from the Sky News "Jack Steven". Unless the real Jack Steven got his teeth fixed and had plastic surgery to look like Bowie, the person in the Sky News is no other than Bowie. I've never even been a fan of Bowie's, but I still recognize him, even under disguise (wig, contact lenses, some minor prosthetics for the nose, makeup etc). I instinctively know that is him, not Jack Steven, when I compare the interviews of both. That smile in the beginning is Bowie's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Watch the whole interview. They keep making alluding to Bowie's career as an actor and "Jack Steven" keeps making snarky comments like, "I feel like a piece of me died yesterday...", or "If I were Bowie...". The whole thing is a scam. This is common for these satanist freaks. Trust me, so many of iconic celebrity deaths are faked. These people are brazen psychopaths who get a kick out of deceiving others.

            Bowie was worshiped at (DJ) Rodney Bingenheimer's (sp?) Sunset Strip disco that catered to underage only (no alcohol), the kids would dress up as him, I saw them. Rodney got the underage girl group The Runaways their start. Below is Rodney w/ Bowie. Rodney was the biggest Bowie worshiper of them all. I never got the whole Bowie thing, even in my pagan youth days.

              Glad I'm not the only one ... you're probably right. There was one main kid (guy) in the club who dressed and looked and acted just like Bowie. Dancing around like an idiot. Punk rock. The whole thing creeped me out, I was 19 maybe and these kids in there made me feel like an old man, they were tweens some of them. Rodney was big buds w/ Bowie, why would he open this club for teens only? Struck me as a little weird, though I saw no drugs, drinking, and Rodney was nice, but that's just his natural personality. He's about 5' 2" tall and actually shy!
