<p>Here\'s a few paragraphs ..
By Michael Swift, &quot;Gay Revolutionary.&quot; Reprinted from The Congressional Record of the United States Congress. First printed in Gay Community News, February 15-21 1987
“We shall sodomize your sons, emblems of your feeble masculinity, of your shallow dreams and vulgar lies. We shall seduce them in your schools, in your dormitories, in your gymnasiums, in your locker rooms, in your sports arenas, in your seminaries, in your youth groups, in your movie theater bathrooms, in your army bunkhouses, in your truck stops, in your all male clubs, in your houses of Congress, wherever men are with men together. Your sons shall become our minions and do our bidding. They will be recast in our image. They will come to crave and adore us.
“Women, you cry for freedom. You say you are no longer satisfied with men; they make you unhappy. We, connoisseurs of the masculine face, the masculine physique, shall take your men from you then. We will amuse them; we will instruct them; we will embrace them when they weep. Women, you say you wish to live with each other instead of with men. Then go and be with each other. We shall give your men pleasures they have never known because we are foremost men too, and only one man knows how to truly please another man; only one man can understand the depth and feeling, the mind and body of another man.....</p>
<p>So what do you all think? Is this satire ? Why is it recognized in the records of congress?</p>',

            : This post would be a lot more compelling if you provided a link proving it is actually in the Congressional Record, as well as a description of why and how it came to be there. If you're saying that's the source, not linking to the source seems...not totally on the up and up. Not saying that's the case, just that that is the impression it gives.

            On top of the toxic chemical assault on our food, gender fluidity, propaganda targeted towards children to make them question their gender identity and the like....
           </p>
           <p>
            what about....
                 vaccines?
           </p>
           <p>
            What does  27  vaccines, given before the age of 2,   do to a developing brain?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then add a flu shot yearly starting at 6 1/2 months old to get in that 25mcg's of thimerosal (mercury).
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes some violent, but mostly, it makes them either a) sick  b) autistic &amp; non social   c) zoned out with a lack of personality (most).
           </p>
           <p>
            Would a predominantly autistic and sick society engage in an uprising?   Probably not.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have probably already heard but please listen again, at the current rates of diagnosis (autism), by 2032,   ONE IN TWO children will be autistic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Project that out 15 years and by 2047, the universities will have to convert to Adult Autism care centers.    With 24 hr care, what percentage of our work force will it take to care for these people?
           </p>
           <p>
            Today, I was reading a congressional hearing on autism that took place in the year 2000.  Then, autism was diagnosed at a rate of  1 in 500.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, only 17 years later, it is 1 in 68  but this number is deceiving because the CDC doesn't count autism until after 8 years old.    New Jersey, who has their own system of counting at the time of diagnosis says that   1 in 27  of their little white boys are autistic.
           </p>
           <p>
            1 in 27 little white boys are autistic
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what is going on
           </p>
           <p>
            Why isn't congress doing anything?  Because the plan is:   1 in 2    and out of that, they hope that some of those decide they are really women.
           </p>
           <p>
            What then?     No men.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is coming soon.
           </p>

            That was 1987. Now they are the status quo instead of people agitating for revolution.

            Sounds like it was written by Stephen Colbert's favorite poet and top NAMBLA representative Allen Ginsburg. I recognize the prose.

            1987?
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems the globalist's agenda is well underway
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you see the recent youtube video of the 300lb man, dressed as a woman and leading a preschool class in a rendition of  "shake those transvestite hips".
           </p>
           <p>
            It is called  gender fluidity and now encouraged at the tenderest of ages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do the Globalists want to feminize men?
           </p>
           <p>
            No men  =  No fight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides propaganda, rape, etc.  our food supply is being saturated with chemicals that feminize frogs.
           </p>
           <p>
            They know what they are doing when they spread / spray them by the hundreds of tons onto the land where it ends up in detectable levels in food and groundwater.

           <p>
            Here is another point:
Am reading the book:  Germany, From the Earliest Period by Wolfgang Menzel.  No date but my copy has a handwritten "1908" in the front.
           </p>
           <p>
            [A copy of this particular volume has been scanned into Archive.org.   If you look it up, make sure to read page 1072 which starts a graphic description of the Catholic's "Society of Jesus" or Jesuit Order.  The current Pope is a Jesuit. They are an evil bunch.]
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout history, uprisings and wars were fought by men.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn't the women.  It was the men.
           </p>
           <p>
            Historically, when men are removed from a population, complete control of the area is assured.
           </p>
           <p>
            [And, No, I'm not going to apologize to the LGBT community for saying that.   Are you really that stupid?? ]
           </p>
           <p>
            By the end of the thirty - year war (Catholic vs everyone else), the population in Germany was halved.  Estimates go up to two-third of the population was killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In Franconia, which, owing to her central position, had been traversed by every party during the way, the misery and depopulation had reached to such a pitch that the Franconian Estates, with the assent of the ecclesiastical princes, abolished, in 1650, the celibacy of the Catholic clergy, and permitted each man to marry two wives, on account of the numerical superiority of the women over the men."
           </p>
           <p>
            What was the additional result of this?
           </p>
           <p>
            "The last remains of political liberty had, during the war, been snatched from the people; each of the Estates had been deprived of the whole of its material power. The nobility were compelled by necessity to enter the service of the princes, the citizens were impoverished and powerless, the peasantry had been utterly demoralized by military rule and reduced to servitude.     ... Germany had lost all save her hopes for the future."

                Done, seems to be reader related (possible bugs on the add-ons to open the file). I don't allow javascript so the "PDF phone-home capability" should be out of the question in my case. In overall, doesn't seem to be any more dangerous than other types of files (they all are, I guess)

            , because the headline of the document says "Chapter 13: Documentation of the Homosexual Agenda", and the paragraphs you cited are citations, probably to put some things in this documentation into context. Having said this, it would have been much better if you had given a short summary of what this PDF consists of (and maybe have done a little research to find out why it was created). You can edit your post!

            Interesting observation. Are the records of congress a library of historical information?
