<p>But this is Los Angeles, where on Thursday model Kelly Fisher filed a lawsuit, flashed a glittering sapphire and diamond engagement ring, and dabbed at teary eyes while her lawyer, Gloria Allred, told the international media that her client’s prince was instead “a frog in prince’s clothing.”</p>
<p>The woman scorned even offered, in a statement prepared by Allred, to meet “anywhere in the world on a confidential basis” with the other woman--Britain’s Princess Diana.</p>
<p>Her client’s wish, Allred said, was to set the princess straight on her experiences with the man she claims persuaded her to abandon a successful modeling career, then figuratively left her at the marriage altar. At a crowded news conference, where the British accents were as thick as the London fog, Allred announced Fisher’s breach of contract suit against millionaire playboy Dodi al Fayed, who recently was featured on the covers of European tabloids supposedly kissing--or snogging as the British say--with Di on a yacht off the south of France.</p>

<p>Keep the above in mind, Allred\'s proximity to Princess Diana/Dodi Fayed and their deaths, when reminding yourself of Prince Andrew\'s proximity to Epstein.</p>

            Gloria Allred and her daughter Lisa Bloom are part of the Clinton Cartel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allred was a
            <strong>
             DELEGATE
            </strong>
            for Hillary Clinton in the last election.

           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/10/14/gloria-allred-hillary-clinton-delegate-democratic-convention/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Her ties to the Clinton Cartel run VERY, VERY DEEP.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is the cartels figurehead for getting all sides and wrapping things very tight. No loose ends.
           </p>
           <p>
            Case in point, Epstein victims now being represented by her. She will make sure nothing potentially dangerous makes it out into the mainstream. (We haven't heard the half of it; if you think Epstein was just sex trafficking, you are in for a rude awakening). The cartel has profited of the blackmailing of high profile persons for decades and now that Epstein is dead Allred will wrap things up tight as possible, while also suing Epsteins estate on part of the sexual abuse victims. All sides of the deal, nice huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            As others have said, victims will either flock to her due to name recognition and national media coverage (she is a certified media whore), or she will poach the victims when they are brought to the forefront of the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            She went after her neighbor Bill Cosby with a vengeance after he stopped paying protection money. Cosby was able to carry on for all these years because he paid millions to the right people including Allred.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without saying too much... Gloria Allred is as bad as they get. We're talking an Epstein level criminal here. Her gang gets blackmail on targets using prostitutes and insiders, and then waits for the perfect opportunity to swoop in. There are also many murders involving those in her orbit, but unfortunately cannot go into detail here.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl dr; Allred and Bloom work for the cartel. Cartel makes money from blackmailing all this time, also makes money having Allred sue on behalfs of victims. Attorneys keep a large percentage of lawsuit winnings. Allred does not keep her criminal enterprise relegated to the court room however, her gang is known to murder when the stakes are too high.
           </p>
           <p>
            Write down Gloria Rachel Allred's name in big letters folks, this bitch is as deep and dirty as it gets.

            Thanks for the ping. After doing some research, it appears that Allred has made a reputation for herself as representing victims in high-profile rape cases. Because of this, it could be that the victims just know her name and history of handling these cases. However, I see that: 1. one Epstein victim dropped her as their lawyer for whatever reason, 2. Summer Zervos (one of Trump's sexual assault accusers) had some pretty shitty things to say about her and also fired her, and 3. Allred's law firm has pretty bad reviews, with people saying they were talked down to and treated poorly when they called to see about representation. It seems like she only takes cases that will bring her more fame, and then pushes her clients into press conferences and confidential settlements. She could be a double agent, working for the other team and acting to push a narrative to keep certain information quiet. Another possibility in reference to the Epstein victims specifically is that they could be fake in order to discredit the other real victims. Sorry if I'm rambling, I'm still getting my thoughts together on this.

             No worries. All prior... situations... aside which might otherwise have us at odds with each other, you brought up a completely valid concern which deserved to be expanded upon.

             Totally understand your comment too, not as much a ramble as you might think lol. I'd no idea that Zervos ended up firing her, so that's news to me.

              At the end of the day, it's not about what we don't agree on. It's about helping to end the abuse of children that's currently taking place by the same people who are supposed to be protecting us. That has always been my end goal, all drama aside.

              I've had a lot going on IRL, but I'll keep an eye out for anything else that looks fishy in the Epstein stuff.

            If she has ever worked with the "Stein" then she is legally not allowed to represent them.  I'm not sure how that would work if her family has worked for the stein though.

             Just as a follow up, that's why it's important to point these connections out in more public domains such as twitter, potentially 'up the line' and into the feeds/discussions of the accusers themselves. If we can reach them with a warning such as this, perhaps they can break free or seek further assistance before the worst might happen.

               Not a chance unfortunately. I figure it should work like a grape-vine effect though. Hell maybe they lurk here, who knows. Point being I would think they'd like ot know this tid-bit of information, all things considered.

             Gotta remember that we look at things from an 'outside' (broader) perspective. The victims may not know about or connect the dots regarding their legal rep in this particular angle – all they'd know is that she's high profile and has a penchant for representing cases relating sexual (mis)conduct.

              This is a great point. I was disturbed when I heard Allred was representing one of the victims. I did not realize she was representing all of them via proxy through her daughter anyway. Reminds me of this excerpt from Senator John DeCamp's book about the Franklin scandal:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Judge Enbody looked at me. Slowly, his voice shaking, he began to talk.
              </p>
              <p>
               "I am just a man. I am not a god. I wish I were. I have no choice in what I have done. I am just a man, just a man, not a god. I am doing what I must do with the evidence before me," Judge Enbody concluded. He appeared even more shaken and upset than I was.
              </p>
              <p>
               I shook my head. "I don’t understand. I just don’t understand," I kept repeating. "Everybody knows what is happening, but nobody is willing to do anything about it. Why? Why?!!" Judge Enbody looked at me and said, very slowly, "If you want to understand the entire Franklin case, I can help you. Go read ’Billy Budd.’ Read ’Billy Budd.’ If you will do that, John, and if you understand the book, then you will understand the what and why of Franklin, and why it can be no other way. I do not say you will like it. I do not say you will agree with it. But at least you will understand it. That, I promise you. Go read ’Billy Budd’."
              </p>
              <p>
               Those were the last words I spoke with the Judge on the case. I left his chambers, burnt out, but angry. And I forgot all about Billy Budd, until the night I happened upon the movie. The story of Billy Budd is set in the British Navy near the end of the eighteenth century. Billy was a young sailor, who, although impressed into the British Navy, bore no ill will to the authorities for having dragooned him; indeed, he was the very picture of innocence and good-will, and was almost universally loved aboard his war-ship. One officer, however, developed an insane jealousy of Billy, and set out to frame him up for allegedly inciting mutiny. Since there had been several notorious mutinies in the British fleet at the time, the mere whisper of "mutiny" was enough to spread panic among the ship’s officers.
              </p>
              <p>
               To make a long story short, because of certain incriminating appearances in the case, the captain and his senior officers, although they knew Billy was innocent of all charges, nonetheless sentenced him to hang, a necessity - as they viewed it - to "save the system," not just on their own ship, but in the British fleet as a whole.
