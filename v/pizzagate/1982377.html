            I think may-be these numbers are fudged/adjusted or deliberately obfuscated. Seems to be a clear demarcation between "lured into sex trafficking and other exploitation" and then  "in the rarest of circumstance...115 victims taken by a stranger". Implying imo another sub-set and completely different numbers/victims. Also Do these numbers include children 'taken' from state care/institutions - as the 2nd article relates that the mother became aware her child did not even appear on any missing list website. There is a massive disconnect with this whole feel of the article, cause since Pizzagate esp, I have noticed multiple press release articles where various Law enforcement describe 'human/child trafficking as one of the fastest growing/most rampant crimes' in their respective states... Oh yeah and the tweets and call outs from Drumpf and co.

             This is where trust in the FBI evaporates..  They pretend like these kids run away, or got in fight with their parents and ended up sleeping at a friends house for a night or two... blah blah blah blah
            </p>
            <p>
             Rationalizing a nearly half a million cases down to 115 victims of child trafficking is statistically ridiculous.

              What are you basing that on?  What statistics?
             </p>
             <p>
              As a parent, I can tell you anecdotally that it is extremely common for kids to go missing and for parents to report them as missing children....both in the form of kids just being little shits and wandering off, running away, one friend i have had to file a report because the little shit was playing hide and go seek and wouldnt answer anybody for hours
             </p>
             <p>
              Another very common scenario is custody related things....ex husband takes child out of state on a vacation his mom didnt want him to go on, mom reports kid missing out of spite or in a bout of erratic knee jerking, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, if you're saying those extremely common scenarios dont account for as much of it as what the FBI is claiming then I'd at least want to see some kind of hard numbers to back your claim up...not that I trust the FBI, but I do trust evidence.

                  You can't prove a negative, you'd have to not be a "stupid cunt" to realize that, though.  I think you and your pizzagate flunkies have the market cornered on the stupid cunt business.

            465,000 is a deceptive number if you don't understand what's it's measuring.  This is all reports of a kid missing.  It's not 465,000 abductions or active cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vast majority of all of this 465,000 are kids that were missing for a brief time, like a couple of hours and return home safely.  Researchers call this "missing benign explanation."  This occurs when
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a child’s whereabouts are unknown to the child’s caretaker and this causes the caretaker to be alarmed, try to locate the child, and contact law enforcement about the episode for any reason, as long as the child
was not lost, injured, abducted, victimized, or classified as runaway/thrownaway.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The next biggest number is kids who were ran away or were kicked out of their house. Each time a kid runs away would be counted separately.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of actual abductions of kids, the nightmare most people have when they think of missing kids, this is a fairly small number and it's about 6 times more likely than a child is abducted by a family member than a stranger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actual kidnappings by strangers are very rare and tend to get a lot of publicity.  Particularly with the Amber Alert system.

             In order for anyone to take your comment seriously, they would have to believe (agree with you, I suppose) that Amber Alert system, CPS, and government agencies in general are not corrupt and their reporting is accurate.
