            It seems that those are from a separate documentary by Bill Bowen (died 2010). How ever these document the same very things that Nancy and others were so concerned about within the CPS. Of note, it mentions Bill and a senator Witiz (sp???) taking a massive amount of 'corrected' testimony/court transcripts to a sitting Judge (who simply refuted the validity and refused the information). Wondering if this senator is still around and amenable to supporting further.

            Poking around can't find it but did find this comment from 2012
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             By the way, Wilky Fain knows more than he's saying! He was living in Nancy's house. He had access to her Security Cameras. Where was he that day and why does the GBI claim to not know who he is? Why was Wilky trying to peddle the documentary right after her death, even before she was buried? Why was he so freaked out when he found out Nancy had prepaid phones? Why did he threaten me? Why did he go on Alex Jones show to try to convince everyone Bear was the shooter? He claims to have seen the "suicide letters"...how could he have seen them unless he was there? Those letters were written when Bruce was sick with Prostate Cancer before he had surgery. Who found them and staged the scene? Why didn't the documentary ever come out? Wilky PROMISED Bruce and Nancy paid Wilky. So why was he talking to CPS folks? Oh yeah, and who's the attorney that's associated with CPS that Wilky introduced Nancy to right before her death? Gee is it a "coincidence" that Wilky just happens to be good friends with the head of the GBI who covered up the murder? Why was all of the evidence destroyed? THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS HERE. BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THOSE AFFILIATED WITH CPS AND POSSIBLY EVEN POLITICIANS WER EINVOLVED WITH NANCY &amp; BRUCE'S MURDER. No one shoots their wife in the back while they sleep and then sits down and writes 7 suicide letters for TWO hours before he commits suicide by shooting himself in the STOMACHE. It didn't happen that way! Bruce did NOT kill Nancy. Even the night before he was telling people he was going to be in a Golf Tournament. Nancy was going to be a speaker in front of the White house. She was writing a book. THE DOCUMENTARY WAS COMING OUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK. THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNEW THIS WAS WILKY FAIN. Nancy was going to run for Governor the following month, so she had to be killed. She was going to cut off the Federal funds thats causing the corruption and someone didn't want to lose their extravant lifestyle. We need to look at all the people who were PROFITING and who had a lot to lose if she pulled the plug. She was going to expose a high level pedophile ring involving Politicans. Is it a coincidence that Wilky Fain is friends with a Porn Producer? Hummmm.. I wonder where that Documentary went.

            Did it even get released?  I seem to remember seeing a video that said the director working with her on the docu has the docu but never published it after she passed.  But don't quote me on this.

            always seemed a little suspect how the filmmaker, Fain, lived with them purportedly to produce a documentary, then the bizarre deaths at the conclusion and the film not really released.  perhaps he was learning info about the direction of her work, their habits, etc and feeding it to others.   that story line has come up in other suspicious deaths/events (someone gets real close purportedly workign with them or helping them and it appears more likely they were working against them).  maybe looking into Fain is in order
