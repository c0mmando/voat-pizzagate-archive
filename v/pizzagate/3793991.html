            I've always wondered why chris brown was still getting promoted in mainstream, still getting collabs after he beat Rhianna.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was at one of Cornell's last few concerts and there was some sort of really off key and strange solo. I'm not a musician though, but it was confusing, maybe it was brilliant. Or maybe he was back on drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            His wife is suing Cornell's former doctor.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it doesn't mean he wasn't murdered. Drugs would be a plausible reason on why he'd invite someone into his hotel room without his security being there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chris Cornell was very concerned with the fate of the kids who had been through the Armenian Genocide.
           </p>
           <p>
            He and his wife had the Chris and Vicky Cornell foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It gets a bit weirder: The band has sued his wife for misusing the funds from a charity show they performed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you looked also into Chester Bennington's death?
           </p>
           <p>
            Cornell and Bennington were friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chrster Bennington was open about being molested as a child, but not by who. His drug addiction was speculated to be fueled by that trauma.
           </p>
           <p>
            He died the same way as Cornell, by hanging, on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bennington looked stunningly like John Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also info about The Clinton Foundation giving a large donation to Linkin Park's Charity that was operating in Haiti.
           </p>

            ...

           <p>
            Thanks for your post you inspired some really interesting digging.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had a bunch of links in this post but I cannot add them them until I have more CCP. If you can please look into these things as well as I think they're very related.

            I have studied this and there is more to it than meets the eye. If you watch the video in slow motion there are some other weird things too. A demon, Chris' very real looking head and arm in a jar, an unnamed backup dancer who looks suspiciously like Chris Cornell in costume. Left me feeling that I was looking at a ritual killing. Other investigators have concluded that "Gavid Deffin" is involved, and I believe some of those featured artists are on the interscope roster. Chris may have met some of them through his one time record producer Timbaland. The whole video has an off, satanic vibe to me and ultimately made me feel really sorry for Chris Brown. It makes me feel better that you noticed this too. Only other person I have seen talking about it is Randy Cody from the metal den.

              Sigil magic is the formal practice of creating sigils (or intention-charged symbols) to change your reality. Those who practice sigil magic incorporate self-reflection, creativity, willpower, and ritual to manifest their desires.

            <p>
             Can be complex magical working, or as simple as a gang tag, these are both examples of evolutions of sigil magick. It seems to all come down to energy. A gang sign tagged in an area will help promote that gangs 'energy' in that place.  A pedo spiral may communicate safe haven for other predators, but the symbols origins have to do with THE FLOW OF ENERGY. Think Loosh.

              The Spiral:
             </p>
             <p>
              The spiral is a very ancient symbol associated with dance energy in the magical world. If drawn deosil (see picture) or clock-wise it serves to bring things or magical energy,  (power) to you or into being?
             </p>
             <p>
              If drawn widdershin or anti-clockwise the spiral helps to banish or send away any negative energy etc. The deosil spiral also symbolises our spiritual path and growth as we descend into ourselves or spiral into the centre of our being.

             Likely sacred geometry/ type magic as well, with the intent to draw energy in a certain direction, or illicit certain mental states.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example a Hypnotic Spiral draws you in in. A church built by freemason masters creates the energy of awe, and makes those within it FEEL and then act as if they are in a HIGHER place. Pyramids focus 'energy' from the base towards its capstone point.
            </p>
            <p>
             This particular symbol looks to me like an iteration of a Norse/Pagan Valkut.

             <p>
              The Valknut's three interlocking shapes and nine points suggest rebirth, pregnancy, and cycles of reincarnation. The nine points are also suggestive of the Nine Worlds (and the nine fates) of Norse mythology. Their
              <strong>
               interwoven shape suggests the belief of the interrelatedness of the three realms of earth, hel, and the heavens,
              </strong>
              and the nine domains they encompass. The Valknut is also an important symbol to many followers of the Odinist faith, who often wear it as a symbol of the faith.

            <p>
             When dealing with these occult coded realms I think we are less likely to identify one obvious dominant singular symbol like the pyramid, pizza or a triangular spiral, but instead a myriad of variations of a language and ritual, that has evolved and will continue to. We should instead familiarize ourselves with symbolism as a whole, and then better know what they use it for.

               No problem. Thank you for your eye. Feel free to copy pasta any into your original post so we get some more information alongside these demons, about WHY they show us so much symbolism, and its potential meanings and effects.
