            Sry for the delay, I could not find your reply after my phone died. Yes let's collaborate. I think you have a great idea. I think it is a great way to bring focus and awareness on this issue in a positive way that will raise hopes and recruit support. Please give me a few days. I want to post a follow up. And then we need to start taking action!!!

           <p>
            Pgategirl --
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, yes ... the therapists are continuing on despite the threats from what I've read.
And they also continue to work on systems for recovery -- evidently there are guidelines for recovery 
but usually in the hands of the abusers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I note you speak about a doctor finding evidence of your sexual abuse and of course it's
been a long and difficult road to even have those laws passed in hopes of stopping the 
sexual abuse of children ... and the work was often done by wives who came to realize
that their child/children were being sexually abused by the father. 
Also creating some help in public schools where children who are sexually abused
might be noticed by teachers who can move the child to some help.
Of course, with so much corruption among police and organizations allegedly created
to help children, that cannot always be trusted and we need major change there, as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also note that you mention a military base.  Don't know if you're familiar with Kay Griggs/YouTube
interview about corruption of our military also using beatings and sexual abuse.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Griggs%2C+military+wife%2C+interview+on+corruption+of+military">
             https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Griggs%2C+military+wife%2C+interview+on+corruption+of+military
            </a>
            Don't want to open you to more trauma, but Part 1 pretty much tells most of the story. 
Military also clearly seems to be involved in protecting this sex trafficking as related by
Detective Rothstein/NYPD (Also on YouTube in interview with Jim Fetzer) at very end
of the video  ...  and he relates that there have been 50 major investigations by NYPD 
which also works internationally of human/child trafficking which have been stopped each 
time that the names of higher up's became known.
Rothstein also says that "Watergate" also involved prostitution/child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the major hang up for therapists -- and of course all of society -- was recognizing that 
these aren't isolated events -- or rare.  But rather that these are organized activities put in 
play by our own government ... as in MKULTRA.  That is the hardest thing to comprehend.
Once you see MKULTRA (and most of those records have been destroyed) it is undeniable reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trusting that you are on safer ground now.
And I feel that really you could be any of our own daughters.

            You are so important to this cause. You make this cause credible. I dream to see monuments erected in parks, playgrounds, museums, schools honoring the victims. The pedos will be shamed and the victims will be honored as heros! I mean this from my heart:

            OP, You sound like a very strong person, and a blessing to bring the reality to light. Your bravery may save a child/children.  I am praying that more people in positions to help these kids can learn from survivors like you. Not every child who is/will be victimized has the internal strength to survive it.  I am glad you did.

            MK Ultra uses colors as part of its breaking down and programing of dissociative identities.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had a therad about this while looking at Elsagate, which we are certain is an attempt at mass remote MK Ultra programming of children.

            Very sad that this happened to you ... but clearly you are a very wise person and very much hope
that you will find you way through to the means of recovery.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you tell us how you were able to free yourself from your traffickers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was also very interested in your comments about "therapy" and that not enough of these
doctors are prepared to deal with the survivors of trafficking.
In fact, I've read that as they have gained more knowledge and realized that this is "organized"
trafficking and linked to MKULTRA -- and as they have sought more help from their peers on finding
ways to help survivors - they, themselves have been threatened.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for anything more you can tell us.

            I feel for ya! Childhood trauma is something we never get past, really. My mom was a hardcore junkie so lots of neglect and abandonment here. Was it your parents who put you "out there?"

            I feel for you Pgategirl.  I believe if that would have happened to me there would be several fewer traffickers on the earth.  I hope you're getting help and support.
