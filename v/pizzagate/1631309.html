Though I have zero evidence, aside from circumstantial, it is my strong suspicion that James has taken ownership of her with the blessing of her parents. they may have done this for monetary reasons or personal ones or both. I believe it is very possible that he has been grooming her since an infant. (The innuendos by his parents on his Instagram and his linking his own name to hers to me implies ownership.)

If you follow voat threads on pizzagate I am sure you are already aware. If not, I will shortly list them all. My sole purpose here this evening is in the lucky chance that JA is reading this. (I know he followed voat before) .That he please surrender her . Mr. Alefantis, no one has to know that you took possession of her. I am a CSA victim myself (SRA) and am a hot mess. I do not want this little girl to suffer the same fate. No pictures of her have appeared on social media since 2015. This is strange. I do not believe Mr. Alefantis would ever surrender her to a stranger because I feel he is very close to her. If I am wrong. I sincerely apologize. I know I can be sued for defamation but saving this little girls mind and life would be worth it. Aside from all this, I 100% believe piizagate is real. I was personally a victim of SRA at the hands of a powerful Secret Society in Hollywood, Ca. If I screwed up on this thread Mods, or broke some rules, i also apologize. Thank you all for your time this evening.</p>',
