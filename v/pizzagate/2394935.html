            We are lucky that you found this stuff. There used to be photos of the cave torture room and ritual antechamber, with the bathroom secret door. Once, I found recent interviews with adult victims, one in denial, two standing by their story, despite serious adversity. Can’t find now.

            Bravo. This just came up with me, and I mentioned the facts in a retort to AWS (I think?). It is nice to have this silver bullet to lay that “satanic panic” meme to rest. Vindication for the victims future and past (who are STILL standing by their story to this day, BTW). GOOD JOB.

            Jobew1, thanks a ton for finding a link to the actual archeologists report! Didn't have time to search the internet for it, thats a really important find. The specifics do match up with the basics of what Roland Summit described, thanks very much!!

            OP, here's the actual report of the archaelogist:
            <a href="http://tesserae.org/tess/prose/tunnels2.html">
             http://tesserae.org/tess/prose/tunnels2.html
            </a>
            <br/>
            I'd say it's pretty convincing especially when the main "reports" that came out to contradict it were from "doctors" of psychology (or related fields- u know the type that are always found in 'false memory syndrome' organizations) as opposed to an archaeologist.
An especially compelling part is seeing how unconvincing the original 1984/1985 tunnel investigation were (they used a scanning type test from above ground which apparently wasn't that great cuz of the buidlings's foundation) and because they were looking for tunnels in only one area which was different from the area in the more thorough 1990 test

             Thank you for that link. I lived thru that time and the events got so glossed over that nobody paid any attention. It was a real victory for satanists, especially in the court of public opinion. The derisive “snort” and chortle of pedo enablers continues to this day with the slogan “satanic panic”. Still, here on voat, folks will try to debunk the McMartins case (and I believe one or two will others from the same era), specifically with judicial decision rendered in this case. All of this DESPITE the fact that the video crimes are
             <em>
              still
             </em>
             speaking out from time to time, and well reputed experts diagnosing signs of extreme abuse In surviving kids. SRA was labeled a fairy tale, and we had to wait 30+ more years to expose the pizzagate elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m saving this silver bullet in pdf. Vindication for SRA victims, better late than never, IMO!

              glad it was helpful.  i was a little too young to have paid much attention in 84/85 but i can recall reading up on it bout 15 years ago and a little again after p/g happened.  it is important.  i can't believe a mod here was in this thread pushing the msm narrative (with little backing support)

               That appears to be his MO. It’s good to see ideas stand up to a healthy challenge, I figure. Might as well get it over with here. If something survives the pummeling from all of the hard hitters and trolls/shills here, then it’s a tough cookie, ready to red pill the zeitgeist.

            One other point: I don't want to sound elitist or anything, but the McMartin case is one of the very few cases where we actually have a highly-trained mental health professional (Dr. Summit) who has spent decades studying child sexual abuse, who did actually spend extensive time with the parents and children allegedly victimized by this cult (and not just the one woman who initially came out with the allegations either). Especially for a forum like this, isn't it worth it to at least hear out what he has to say?...

             The publication in this obscure journal ("Journal of Psychohistory") doesn't exactly lead me to think he's some paragon in the field.  Do you have a source showing he spoke to the kids?  How do you explain one of the kids sending an apology to the LA Times years later? Those kids felt pressured into saying they were abused.  That's why the jury acquitted when they saw video of the interview process.  The kids made up completely fantastical and ridiculous stories to please the detectives.

              AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD THEM
             </p>
             <p>
              At least one child had a voice in the archaeological project. Time was running out before the bulldozers would obliterate the site and there seemed to be no trace of the children’s secret room. Joanie (11) 12 years old, was visiting her old preschool with her mother. Dr. Stickel asked her,”Can you tell us where it was that you entered the tunnels and which way you turned?” Joanie gave a meticulous description of every step along the way. Starting from the parents’ dig in the northeast corner of classroom #3, she described being lifted down a hole, turning right, going straight past the roots that brushed your face, turning right again where you were hurried through the long tunnel. “I liked to stop where the pipe was and swing on it. There was a little boy who couldn’t reach the pipe, and sometimes I’d lift him up so he could touch it. But right after that you had to duck down so you wouldn’t hit your head on the cement, then you had to run again to get to the secret room.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Part of the course Joanie described corresponded to twin anomalies which had been detected earlier by ground penetrating radar. Corresponding openings had been cut in the concrete (Unit 1, classroom 3 and Unit 2, classroom 4, see Figure 1) but nothing unusual had been found. Encouraged now by Joanie’s explicit directions, the archaeologist extended the dimensions of the Unit 1 dig and discovered an interface of contrasting soil. The concrete cutout had matched the side walls of the tunnel so perfectly that the earlier dig had passed right through the filled-in tunnel without ever distinguishing its margins. Now that the profile of contrasting soil was defined the tunnel could be reopened with precision. It proceeded westward beneath a cast iron waste pipe, just as Joanie had described, and then passed under the deep concrete foundation of the wall separating classrooms #3 and #4. At the point where the tunnel passed under the foundation, and only at that point, the concrete had been arched upward and worn smooth, in contrast to the adjacent ragged contours and texture assumed by concrete poured into an earthbottomed trench. Under the classroom to the west the tunnel proceeded into a wide, room-like potential space of contrasting earth fill bearing remnants of timber, plywood and tar paper which appeared to have shored up the ceiling of a “secret” room. All this had been implied for years by numerous children and anticipated on the spot by Joanie.

               One alleged victim worked with Dr. Stickel in the dig. She described very specific details of the tunnels beneath the school. When Dr. Stickel actually dug beneath the school, her details matched, repeatedly, with what was physically found. The full article goes into much more detail about all of this.

              Well he definitely is a real Professor of Psychiatry, and clearly from the article he spent extensive time with a number of the alleged McMartin victims, as well as bear witness to the details of the archeological dig beneath the school (

              )  Also the Journal of Psychohistory is definitely not mainstream, but it is published by Psychohistorian LLoyd DeMause. DeMause is an interesting resource himself, he has studied and written about cult abuse quite a bit, and is a believer. Just posted an article by him that I think is worth reading.

               He doesn't even show us a geologic survey image, let alone any actual tunnels.  Again, if there are tunnels under there, why haven't they been physically located?  Why don't we have photos of them?  Does he have documentation to even prove this girl explained the layout of the tunnels?  The complete lack of anything verifiable is a huge, glaring red flag.

            The McMartin case is disinfo, which is why it is pushed by disinfo agent Ted Gunderson, who was an associate of Temple of Set founder Michael Aquino.  The McMartin case is a well-known case of false allegations. The mother who made the initial allegations was crazy. She based it all on her son having disrupted bowel movements. The jury exonerated the accused because video showed the interviewers basically coercing the toddlers into saying they were abused, using leading questions that violated California guidelines at the time. One of the kids sent an apology to the LA times as an adult. That case was the real case of "false memories" that spawned the whole concept.

             The subversión of the victims through browbeating and the over publication of the “satanic panic” meme made this case a victory for satanists. It was literally a beacon call for pedo breeders to open day care centers. A day care center to normies became a potential porn production plant for the enemy.
            </p>
            <p>
             This case as it stands now, is something we need to keep handy. We need to erase their old victory with truth. There are more reports, photos and event cages and torture stuff and ritual paraphernalia’s a, just as the kids said. This case is exactly the opposite of what you say here:
            </p>
            <p>
             “..imagine the average normie seeing the McMartin case promoted here, going to look into it, and finding it’s total nonsense. Then they would assume pizzagate is nonsense...”
            </p>
            <p>
             Exactly the opposite happened. People have seen that satanists successfully browbeaten witnesses, colluded with law enforcement, co-opted the media and erased an incredible crime, and continue to do so, despite these things:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Multiple confirmed diagnoses of severe abuse scars on several children confirmed by more than one outside expert
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Victims who stuck to their story despite ridicule and abandonment from the other survivors.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Tunnels being found, confirmed as described complete with the items described...
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Lastly, they will get an idea of the size and power of the opponents we face when they consider that people still foolishly accept that this is debunked, and that it continues to be pushed by people who SHOULD be in possession of the facts, and that the culprits escaped any justice due to all manner of corruption and interference from authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate is riddled with these types of power schemes and conspiracies. That is the first thing a normie needs to learn. So McMartins is basic trading, and if a newly recoiled can’t get their head around it, accept that they will have to wait for the inevitable critical mass of pizzagate awakening like so many others.
            </p>
            <p>
             They successfully erased what happened and turned it into a black pill. To continue to label it as disinformation in the face of such a preponderance off worthy reports to the contrary, Is a foolish diservice to the victims, many of whom have stuck to their story, have they not?

             it's been a long while since i was reading (a lot) about this case, but if your biggest piece of evidence for pushing the msm narrative that mcmartin was b.s. was that gunderson was involved, that's not very strong.  I know there's a lot of info suggesting gunderson was (probably always) working for the wrong side and that he wormed his way into cases to help them fall apart (gaining people's trust and sucking them for information).  So given that eventually the mcmartin "case" fell apart and the official (and yours apparently) narrative is that it was a hoax, the fact that Gunderson was promoting it can actually be viewed to suggest that it was a legit case and that he did his job  (appearing to promote it for the victims but actually working behind the scenes to sabotage them).

             and c'mon about the tunnells.  since you haven't cited anything, i'll go from my memory also.  you're suggesting that there were professional geological studies done (and that's basically what i recall but i don't remember the exact credentials of who did what studies).   i'm sure any qualified geologist or building or other relevant expert would know the obvious point you make that any house has had some digging likely for, at minimum, a sewer or water line.  so if they come out and say there was enough evidence to show tunnels and not merely these ordinary things, i'll go with their conclusions unless you have evidence that they were clearly corrupt or the most inept experts in history.
            </p>
            <p>
             also, that the tunnels weren't "found" originally assumes that there was an honest investigation.  based upon your statement you likely don't believe in PG either, since wouldn't an investigation have proved one way or the other that there was a basement at CPP, tunnels which appear to being dug at  cpp in instagram photos, and child porn or info about the same on JA devices?  This sub remains and questions remain because there was no honest investigation and this

              I think a) the tunnels were there, and the children were legit b) Ted Gunderson was a disinfo shill.

              What I don't get is why he would support the archaelogical dig? Why not leave the scene at the end of the trial when the verdict was that perps were innocent = case closed?

               I don't know whether Ted was involved in the trials before the 1990 dig, but one thought as to why he was helping investigate the tunnels and other stuff after the trials was because those parents weren't letting up. the powers that be needed to know what they were uncovering.  ted was apparently good at gaining trust and at least appearing to he legit even over time

             Also, I have heard Ted Gunderson was very possibly a schill from other sources as well. But just because he says something about McMartin, does that in and of itself disprove the validity of the McMartin case??

              No, Ted Gunderson promoting McMartin is further evidence he is a shill.  It's primarily the facts of the McMartin case that show the whole thing was nonsense that put some innocent people through hell.

             Millenial_Falcon, I have to respectfully disagree with your analysis. Dr. Summit is definitely a real Psychiatrist. The archeologist who did the archeological dig beneath the foundation of the school was Dr. E Gary Stickel, a UCLA archeologist. These are real professional people, you can look them up outside of this article. Before you can just dismiss all this, I think you should at least hear out what they have to say...

            Long article, but VERY well worth a read. Roland Summit is a Psychiatrist who was a Professor of Psychiatry at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in LA. He served as a Mental Health liaison to parents and children who were alleged victims of the McMartin pre-school ritual abuse scandal that occurred in the 80s. As Dr. Summit thoroughly documents in this article, a UCLA archeology professor DID in fact do a dig beneath the pre-school, and DID IN FACT FIND extensive evidence of a secret tunnel system underneath the school, which multiple children claimed was secretly used by a satanic cult to transport the children to other locations outside the school for abuse. Also a secret chamber under the school was possibly used for performing satanic rituals (a large iron cauldron was actually found in a secret room underneath the foundation of the school). Most significant physical evidence I have ever seen proving the existence of ritual/satanic abuse...
