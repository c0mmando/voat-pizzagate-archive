<p>In this Voat Pizzagate thread on Flying in &quot;pizza/dogs&quot; email, &quot;exposing&quot; Barrack Obama came up and <a href="https://voat.co/user/Jem777">@Jem777</a> contributed a claim that Barrack Obama met with Bill Ayers in 1970\'s. And he posts a picture of the two men that he claims is from 1970\'s.  This is an absolutely extraordinary claim for a couple of reasons.  One is that Bill Ayers is like 17 years older than Barrack Obama.  in 1979 Barrack Obama turned 18 and had not real history of political activity before then.  The second reason is that Bill Ayers was in hiding for most of the 1970\'s.  He certainly would not be letting people take pictures of him.   So if you just know a bit of the history</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a start. Who is sitting next to weather Underground Domestic terrorist Bill Ayers in this picture in 70\'s. Looks just like B.O. That is odd since when this got exposed in 2008 he stated Ayers was just a guy in the neighborhood...even though it was revealed he started his political career in Ayers living room. For those that don\'t know Ayers research him. His wife also a convicted terrorist is Bernadine Dorn who mentored Michelle O. at Sidney Austin law firm in Chicago.....where the O\'scsaid they fell in love. This picture and much more evidence proves it is all a lie. This picture is a communist Marxist meeting.</p>

<p>Actually if you look at that picture you can prove that the photo was not taken in the 70\'s or the 80\'s.  Just using that picture, and asking Google about a couple of things you can see in that picture, you can conclusively prove the photo is from after 1992.  
</p>
<p>I\'ll post those links after folks check this out.   Consider this a challenge.   How can we date this photo using just elements in the photo?</p>',

             I'll just move it to the original thread.   But did you notice the two reasons we know that photo would have to have been taken in the 1990s?
            </p>
            <p>
             I do think that is Obama in the 1980's, but I believe it's from when he worked on the school initiative in the 1990's.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two giveaways are Obama's wearing a wedding ring and they are drinking "Seattle's Best" Coffee.  The Logo's are fuzzy, but it's clearly the Seattle's Best Logo.
            </p>
            <p>
             That company wasn't called that until 1991 and probably wasn't even in Chicago until a few year's later.

            Just some background on the history.  It's known that Bill Ayers and Barrack Obama knew each other.  They worked on a school reform project in Chicago, not the Weather Underground.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Annenberg_Challenge">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Annenberg_Challenge
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ayers formed the Weather Underground in 1969 and by 1972 he was a full fugitive from the law.  He went underground for years.  After Ayers turned himself in 1980.,   He did not go to prison because it was discovered the government illegally burgled and wiretapped the Weather Underground.  His wife  had some state charges and got three years probation and later spent a year in jail for refusing to testify in a different case.   So Ayers was not wanted by the US government.  He would go on to be a professor of education and well respected scholar. He went back to school and earned a doctorate in education by the end of the 1980s.  So for most of the 1980's he was in school in NYC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama's involvement in the civic life of Chicago began in 1985, he was a community organizer for a group of Catholic Parishes.  Then in 1988 he went to Havard Law and graduated in 1991 and started teaching at the University of Chicago Law School.  In 1995, he joined the school reform project, by which point Ayers was known as ex-radical who arguing that kids perform better in small classrooms which is pretty accepted by educators across the country now.
