            You have an open quote so it is hard to follow. Did he say those things about human sacrifice, etc?, because if so, that is him trying to discredit all things he listed.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Oh it's something fake? Well maybe the next fake stuff they'll bring is SRA or child trafficking" is basically what was said in the quote. That plus his being a regular at Comet should tell you something.

            Game for Pizza

            ** 1/2 Comet Ping Pong
           </p>
           <p>
            5037 Connecticut Ave. NW 202-364-0404
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            When the old Thai Room restaurant went dark two years ago, one of its neighbors knew it wouldn't be long before someone else would move into the space. "It would be me or someone else," recalls James Alefantis, a co-owner of Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping, the contemporary American restaurant he runs with chef Carole Greenwood. It didn't take long for the seemingly ageless restaurateur with the Peter Pan face to figure out that he'd rather be competing against himself than a stranger.
           </p>
           <p>
            What to serve? Alefantis and Greenwood originally thought they'd devote a menu to roast chicken and call the place The Hen House. The idea of keeping some vestige of the long-running Thai restaurant intrigued them, too, and the business partners considered keeping part of its title -- but offering pizza -- at The Pie Room. In the end, chicken lost out to pizza; Alefantis found a neon sign from Comet Liquor in Adams Morgan that he couldn't live without; and the interior of the Thai Room was transformed, with a lot of sweat and a shoestring budget, into a modern-day version of yesteryear's Italian American pizza parlors, with the added attraction of a few Ping-Pong tables in the back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite the paucity of decent places to eat in the vicinity, Comet Ping Pong was not an immediate hit when it opened in October. Some patrons groused that the salad-and-pizza menu was too small. Others complained that the signature pies were too expensive. I had a problem with consistency. The crust looked and tasted different from pie to pie. The service was sweet and young, but a slight air of "What are we doing?" permeated the dining room.
           </p>
           <p>
            What a difference nine months make. Surfing a big wave of interest in pedigreed pizza that stretches from coast to coast (is there a food lover going to Los Angeles who hasn't booked ahead for a seat at Pizzeria Mozza?), Comet Ping Pong is now a brand that should be raised in any serious discussion of Washington pizza (and nostalgia).
           </p>
           <p>
            Comet's menu hasn't grown much since the early days. There are still only two salads, one a respectable toss of mixed greens, the other a fine Caesar, both served in thin wooden bowls. They've been joined recently by an appetizer of chicken wings that remind me why I like Greenwood's food so much: She has an extraordinary way with the ordinary, as anyone who has eaten her first-class mussels, prime steak and chocolate cake at Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping can attest. The wings at Comet are big and meaty, glossy with honey and tingling with vinegar and red pepper flakes. They are good by themselves but become addictive after a dip in horseradish sauce.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theme is made strikingly clear before you even step inside the restaurant, thanks to the Ping-Pong table parked outside the front door. Inside, the good vibrations continue, with a maze of green tables painted to resemble Ping-Pong surfaces, lights that could pass for Ping-Pong balls on growth hormones and three Ping-Pong tables in a back room, just past a cozy bar and a stack of wood that fires Comet's igloo-shaped pizza oven. The look is natural rather than forced, and it includes whimsical details. Be sure to check out the restrooms, where artist Piero Passacantando graced the walls with fantasy Italian landscapes that show people playing table tennis.
           </p>
           <p>
            More eye candy hangs across from the bar: 52 black-and-white photographs of just about everyone who had a hand in the restaurant's creation. That includes Joseph Wills, the metal worker responsible for the clever wood-and-metal benches in the dining room; Ed Addiss, the wine importer who finds bargains from lesser known wine regions (in this case, southwestern France); Ali Moussalli, who grows beets, chard, herbs and onions on his farm in Northern Virginia for Greenwood; and even Alefantis's mother, Susan. "She does things for me all the time," her son explains.
           </p>
           <p>
            The appeal of such a venue is broad. Families appreciate the joint for the obvious (be warned: the sounds of restless little ones can easily outmuscle Dean Martin and Rosemary Clooney on the soundtrack), and the stargazing can be prime. Among the VIP regulars are ballet director Septime Webre and talking head
            <strong>
             Tucker Carlson,
            </strong>
            but even Donald Rumsfeld has dropped by for a pie.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know, I know. You're wondering about the pizza. Comet's pies are intended to reflect the childhood memories of Greenwood (who grew up in suburban New York and Washington) and Alefantis (who was raised in Buffalo and Washington). As such, the crust is thin and crisp, with a flavor distinct from so much of the competition because of the chef's mix of Italian pizza flour and whole wheat flour. The base is seasoned with garlic-infused olive oil before toppings are applied, and the round is slipped into an oven that hovers between 600 and 700 degrees. No ordinary base decoration will do: Greenwood makes her pies using fresh mozzarella cheese made from the milk of Jersey cows, hence the cheese's pale yellow hue, and a sauce that she made from the 2,000 or so pounds of tomatoes she got from farmer Mark Toigo and flavored with basil, garlic and a bit of honey before canning them at a Pennsylvania facility.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bronzed and bubbling results show up as large ovals or rectangles, cut into squares and presented on wax paper-covered silver trays. The toppings typically include something meaty (spicy sausage with garlic and fresh mozzarella) and something not (wilted greens scattered with black olives and mild ricotta), but they also change to take advantage of what beckons in the market. In late spring, I was tearing through asparagus, thin slices of crisp potato and fontina cheese, a lovely nod to the season that tasted as good as it looked. More recently, whole soft shell crabs decorated my crust, an idea Greenwood says she got from chef Jeff Buben by way of chef Roberto Donna. (Diners trying to get some assistance from the staff on how to tackle soft shell crabs on a crust don't get much help. Experience has taught me to slice right through the little beasts, which enriches the pie with their tasty liquid innards.) Another hit from the water is the pizza sprinkled with tender little clams, soft onions and fresh thyme. Additional toppings cost a dollar or two; one of the more unusual and delicious: mushrooms smoked over the grill at Buck's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dessert is another recent addition to Comet, and you'll want to save room for it: vanilla, chocolate and mint chocolate chip ice cream is churned by the locally owned Moorenko's Ice Cream according to Comet's specifications and is offered by the scoop, as part of a root beer float or in a sundae in a silver dish. Plan to go all the way -- good sundaes are hard to find. I'm keen on vanilla ice cream heaped with swollen strawberries, but others at my tables say the Tin Roof, with its warm chocolate sauce and roasted peanuts, makes them swoon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Truth be told, though, the best finish I ever had at Comet Ping Pong was yet another pizza.

             WOW! GREAT FIND!
I read many other old reviews, but not this one. What really stands out is that Comet Ping Pong supposedly wasn't planned. Also, Carole Greenwood was much more prominently involved than other articles have mentioned. Other interviews focus almost solely on Alefantis and his carefully planned Ping Pong interior and menu and Dr. Pong German restaurant as an inspiration. He was also really wanting the outdoor sidewalk ping pong tables and licensing for music and alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
             This article makes one ask, WHY HAS CAROLE GREENWOOD NEVER BEEN INTERVIEWED OR COME TO THE DEFENSE OF ALEFANTIS REGARDING PIZZAGATE?  Did I miss something?  What's his face from CNN also frequented the restaurant with wife and kids. In the early days, was Comet a MSN anchor hangout?

            Look at the leadership of the FBI when pizzagate was exposed... and look at them now. What is really bothersome is the amount of people who do know firsthand about what is going on and say nothing.

            Tucker has known (as well as Hannity) for years, but for the longest time they had to keep it inside else be called conspiracy theorists. Now that Trump is TCB, they feel relaxed and you can tell the difference in Hannity and Tucker from 2 years back, they are actually smiling and laughing again - their truth they know is coming live. Im sure most of us have also been in the same boat since 9/11, Bless the US, Bless the world.

             I think Fox has been restraining its hosts but they allow Hannity and Tucker a bit more leeway probably due to ratings. Tucker is known for piercing sarcasm and I think because of that he is able to get things out under the guise of being tongue in cheek when he is dead serious. I’ve noticed this before and I bet we will see more of it. I’ve also heard Ben Shapiro doing the same thing.

            I'm so glad to hear Tucker say this.  Take it FWIW.  I spoke to him about Pizzagate almost 2 years ago.  Chance meeting.  He had the typical Tucker knitted-eyebrow look when I brought it up.  He said he and his wife actually liked CPP. I was pretty perplexed for a while, but he has never wavered once from being a Patriot. But he did listen to what I said.  This was about 3 weeks before he went big time.

            We also talked about cigars, guns, and reloading.

Who "allowed" him that talking point?
Is FOX trying to get the jump on the rest of MSM by easing into this topic
Is FOX setting you up for their version?

            Garbage from MSM. Tucker was at CPP opening night Gala. USA INC is a corporation pretending to be a legit government. Tucker sells us to support the right. He is their tool of the Hegelian dialectic. Control both sides of the debate and keep the people in a false paradigm.

             I'm a fan of both Qanon and Carlson. But insinuating that Carlson's child trafficking comment was a Military Intelligence trigger is retard.

Tucker is a bright bright man, well informed. He knows how to play chess and set a trap. There are many people who know about pagegate, pedogate, and are waiting.

                Ted Gunderson, former head of the FBI, did a personal investigation after the trial was over. They confirmed that the tunnels A. were there, B. were covered up with dirt from another region, and C. inside of the tunnel they found several items such as a plastic Mickey Mouse toy bag from the exact same time period as the abuse allegations. Kids were taken through those tunnels so that they could be raped by adults. To any and all people here who don't believe that the McMartin case was legitimate SRA, get out of this forum and never come back.

                  Well, yeah. It makes sense. Underground is literally the one place you can hide, do your sick deeds, and no one will ever find out. Plus I'm sure it plays into their Baphomet "as above so below" garbage that they believe in. Fuck these people. Pedophile faggots.

               Why does there have to be “sides” to helping expose powerful satanic pedophiles? I think we are all here for the same reason, to expose this filth and it’s pretty obvious that the filth is on BOTH SIDES OF THE AILSE. Making any sort of assumption that this is exclusively a “Democrat” problem is majorly misguided.

                I agree. We are not here to argue among ourselves. Our goal is to expose elite pedophiles and put an end to their evil. Forge ahead researchers.

             I want to like the guy, but on the other hand, you have to assume he's being
             <strong>
              allowed
             </strong>
             to say these kinds of things. You don't go on national TV and talk about SRA and human sacrifice unless you were given the OK to do so. Or else you'll get Ben Swann'd.

             He is your champion and the sheeple's champion. Those red pilled know the CIA runs al media and both sides are controlled. Tucker loved his pizza when he was at CPP on opening night. Ask him how the pizza was.

             <p>
              "No one said no to Jim Jones, but for Jimmy, adopted when he was ten weeks old, it was easy to say yes. Jimmy was 16, normally a rebellious age, yet he believed in his father's vision. So did everyone he knew. It was exciting to be building a new world here in Jonestown. Stephan might see the negative side of things, but Stephan was an unhappy guy, while Jimmy was having a pretty good time. They'd always had a rivalry going, and Stephan had already learned not to criticize their dad to Jimmy, who would just tell on him. Jimmy would never dream of questioning his father. Especially now, when Jonestown was under attack."
             </p>
             <p>
              "An African American, Jimmy believed that if he hadn't been adopted by Jim Jones, his life would likely have been one of drugs or poverty or crime. In this way, his story reflects that of his father's followers. The majority of people who joined Jones's Peoples Temple were also poor or working class and black, from deteriorating neighborhoods and broken families, their lives taken over by a man offering a better way of life."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Like a tremendous earthquake, that image sent waves of shock and horror around the world. The epicenter wasn't really Guyana, though; it was San Francisco. After gathering converts from all over the country, Jones had based his Peoples Temple in the Fillmore district. Most of those who died in Guyana—almost 70 percent of whom were African American—had been living in San Francisco."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In 1972, he moved his church and his family to San Francisco, where he bought a former Scottish rite temple next door to a Black Muslim mosque on Geary just off Fillmore. By then, Tim, the white son of a Temple member, was living with the Rainbow Family. He and Stephan were 13, Jimmy almost 12, the only children still at home."
             </p>
             <p>
              "While Jimmy was playing ball and going to movies, his father was courting the San Francisco power structure. Jim Jones was like a ward boss; when people were needed at demonstrations or for election work, he could deliver them by the busload. In return, he pushed for a political post, and in 1976, mayor George Moscone named him to the San Francisco Housing Authority. Jones quickly became chairman, and, packed with his supporters, the meetings became more like rallies. There were other good photo ops, too, when prominent Democrats or activists such as Moscone, then state assemblyman Willie Brown, then governor Jerry Brown, Angela Davis, and Jane Fonda visited the Temple."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Stephan and, later, Tim came to recognize the fakery and lies, the overwork, deprivation, and physical and sexual abuse, that Jones used to maintain control. (The worst form of punishment was probably the "sensory isolation box," a four-foot-high packing crate into which those in disfavor might be put for as long as a week.) "My two brothers had more clarity on that," Jim says. "I think they focused on all the negative things about my father."

              As always the CIA was behind the Jim Jones massacre. CIA agent was know to be part of the operations. Have even seen him on film. Do the research. They are always setting up cults to practice their mind control over societies, discredit religions, enslave people. Scientology is theirs as well. David Miscavige was exposed as a CIA asset. The documentation can be found online.

              You can tell by the way he talks he's sincere and isn't covering anything up; he tries his best to expose the corruption as much as possible without being fired.

              I think that was meant to have a double meaning. See, Avanatti is a porn lawyer. There's literally zero chance that he's not into some weird shit. It's just not possible, let alone plausible. So maybe Tucker heard a rumor. People in the media tend to know more than everyone else, but there are things you just can't do on TV without some amount of protection, and chief among these is accusing people of things that you 'know' they did, but don't actually have proof of.
             </p>
             <p>
              In other words, Tucker is basically saying "I'm not a liberal, so I'm not going to smear the guy and expose myself to a defamation suit, (especially because he's a lawyer) but I'll get as close to doing it as I can." It's the closest he'll get to CNN, cause they blatantly speculate on things going on in the White House to make it sound like a reality TV show, and that's just not classy enough for the quasi-not-fake news that Tucker's paid to talk about.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think someone else was speculating that Avanatti is both literally and financially fucking his clients, but you wouldn't hear someone on Fox go quite that far. Maybe if party affiliations were flipped, somebody would say that on CNN or the View.

               He is definitely mocking us. Q fans will twist this into a “good thing” but it’s not. It is safe to assume he is referring to the franklin credit scandal here and mocking the conclusions of SRA, and human sacrifice from Dems toward the high profile Republicans that were involved in the franklin scandal. Tucker showed his shill colors here. Bummer.

                If you guys would retain your research you would know that he is a CPP regular, that the MSM is controlled, you think FOX is not MSM? You don't realize they control both sides of the arument? Notice the mods in here don't mention this, I do.

                 I agree with you 100%.  That's why I presumed this to be Tucker MOCKING us and trying to desensitize the masses to suggest that anything SRA, Child Trafficking, ect is wacky and not based in reality.

                I think you're looking into it too much. I think he was just trying to state that they'll stop at nothing to stop Kavanagh, why not go this far? He always mentions that they always seem to "project" and allege things that they're actually secretly into.
