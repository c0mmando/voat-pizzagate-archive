<p>Execution Ltd is mentioned on pizzagate a lot too, in connection with Will Draper, who allegedly was the financier of the Hamsptead cult.  His ex-wife Ella has recently withdrawn that allegation (<em>we as anon investigators were never supposed to follow that particular trail</em>).  I believe that is absolutely true as we have seen his high level city connections lead down a very dark rabbit hole.</p>

            Once you've looked in to Hampstead, you never go back. There used to be videos where you could see their sweet faces (in case someone could find them), now they are blurred out but the truth is still out there. Thousands marched in the streets to save them... to no avail. Back they went to the satanists...

            <p>
             GEMS Education originally intended to be one
of the leading chains of UK independent schools
acquiring a chain of 13 schools. It had to sell
Kingswood College in Lancashire because the
Grade 1 listed building was simply too expensive to
run profitably, according to The assignment report.
GEMS Education intends to be a ‘major player’
in running the coalition government’s new free
schools programme. Speaking at a conference
in London former chief executive, Anders Hultin,
stated that “the profit motive is essential for
such projects to work”. He believes success is
dependent upon being given autonomy from
local authority control. He also said he felt England
would eventually reconcile itself to privatisation
in education when it saw the results. (Times

Previous years have seen the likes of Bill Clinton (2006),[18] Queen Rania of Jordan (2010)[19] and in 2011 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took the limelight as Prince William announced a joint venture by the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry and the Ark charity.[20]

             Its activities include funding treatment for AIDS victims in Africa, taking children out of care in Bulgaria and Romania and developing educational opportunities for disadvantaged children in India.[21] It also operates eight academies, six of which are in London, through its subsidiary charity ARK Academies.

             If reading of all those charities and the possibilities did not make me sick enough, the last one almost made me Upchuck.  If Theodora's Children's Trust is not a Cc of Jimmy Seville's Late-Night trips to the hospitals to rape children, I don't know what is.  The Giveaway is "Giggle Doctors".   Elton John and his partner make me vomit.

             ARK is the main charity overseeing the introduction of seriously pseudo-psychological systems into the education system. From another angle we have Common Purpose installing their graduates as teachers, Headteachers and helpers of all kinds including most importantly, the governors. Advisors to the schools are also highly skilled operatives from within ARK and Common Purpose charities, but there are many more charities acting within this network pushing for the same outcome.

             Knighted in 1990 after nomination by Margaret Thatcher, Sir Tim Bell was made a Life Peer in 1998 after nomination by Tony Blair as Lord Bell of Belgravia. Chairman of the Conservative Party's Keep the £ Campaign, Lord Bell serves on various arts and public administration bodies. On 8 April 2013, it was Lord Bell who officially announced the news of Lady Thatcher's death. In August 2014, Bell joined the board of trustees for the Brazzaville Foundation which, through conflict resolution, aims to bring political and social stability to African countries.

             Bell Pottinger, the firm set up by Margaret Thatcher's PR guru Lord Bell in 1989, set up a base in Camp Victory in Baghdad, in what is believed to be one of the most-costly PR contracts in history.
