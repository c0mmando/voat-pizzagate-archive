            I agree.  GROW A PAIR AND RELEASE IT ALL:  VIDEOS, PICTURES, EMAILS, AND RECORDINGS.  How else can this ever stop?  Release what you know, Insiders, or you are just as guilty as the ones perpetrating the crimes.

           <p>
            Dear Beazcom4, I raised some kids in this dreadful world, and I'll tell you what I learned from classes and books, in case anything is useful:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Teach them self-defense and situational awareness as early as 12 years old.  Attend the class with them.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Teach them never to get in the car with strangers as early as possible.  Tell them even if the stranger tells you they have lost a puppy or their little child.  Bad guys are lying and trying to trick you. They should be asking an adult for help if they really need help.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Teach them little things like don't walk close to the curb of a street and never walk alone.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Tag everything they own with the electronic tag with the widest range.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Teach them critical thinking by always asking "why would they do that?"  "how do they benefit?"
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              When they are old enough, teach them that everyone isn't nice like mommy and daddy.  There are bad guys who like to hurt people.  They will try to trick you into going with them.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Teach them that they are so loved by you (and by God if you roll that way), that nothing they do cannot be shared with you. Keep that communication open.  Even when they are rude to you as preteens, treasure the independence, but maintain that love and care.  Ask them questions about how they fell about things, and if something feels off, help them explore why it feels off.  Tell them to trust their feelings and always err on the side of self love.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I am somewhat embarrassed to admit this, but I shadowed my kids.  As age appropriate, I would let them go public places with friends, but I shadowed them.  They never caught on until they were older and I told them about it, but by that time they were strong enough to be on their own.  You know, you have to let them live life, but you have to make it as safe as you can.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Finally, if you yourself have bad vibes about someone, never let your children alone with that person.  I had the experience of having a bad feeling about someone (Sunday School teacher, respected member of community, decorated war veteran, beloved family friend) and I never let my kids alone with that person.  Sure enough, years later, came out they were big time pedophile.  So, always honor your maternal or paternal instincts. Your significant other may not share your intuition, but you have to overcome that and err on the side of the kids.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Get a dog, especially yappy terrier or guard dog. They can be incredibly vicious in defense of children.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
          </p>

             Nobody is going to go to war with US citizens if we have a revolution. That's straight bullshit. When I apologize to Houthi's for "my" country nuking them, they aren't angry at me. They're angry at the Jews who run the show. There is no hatred for the people of the United States. Just for the Jews that run the world.

            a - turning all of the info to doj that is part of the establishment ??? why ???? 
b - implicate a few &amp; turn them in to the same establishment ???? again why ???
c - you organize yourselves as a whole , worldwide and you take it to the streets , put economy on a halt.
    trying to get justice done by using the same establishment that created all the problems in the first place is completely retarded.

            get a dog to sleep with your kids at night so that you can feel safer. You sound like you need help with security. even a small dog's bark will help scare off an intruder and wake up the house.

             I agree.  Get a couple of dogs.  Even small ones are excellent for alerting you to prowlers and deterring them from entering your home.  I knew a gal in a city who was murdered in her home.  Guy spent a very long time removing the bolts that kept up the bars on her windows.  If she had a  dog -- even a tiny yipper -- she would have been alerted.  So, yes, get a couple of little dogs and get some sleep.

            More advice for any FBI reading this. Familiarize yourselves with these laws:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             18 U.S. Code § 4 - Misprision of felony (knowing of a felony and failing to report it)
            </li>
            <li>
             22 U.S. Code § 618(e) - Failure to register as an agent of a foreign principal
            </li>
            <li>
             18 U.S. Code § 2381 - Treason ("or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere")
            </li>
            <li>
             18 U.S. Code § 2382 - Misprision of treason
            </li>
            <li>
             18 U.S. Code § 2101 - Incitement to riot
            </li>
            <li>
             18 U.S. Code § 2384 - Seditious conspiracy
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Enforcing these laws will fix most of the social problems in the US today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Follow the rules of evidence. Don't screw up a case by failing to get a warrant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not wait for the big catch. Many times the problem is the aide, not the politician. Start picking off aides and the politicians will be motivated to start cleaning house themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no national security exception. The rule of law binds Kings. There is no exemption for some idiot in the CIA who decided to run drugs on the side. All of the big scandals of the '80s were excused as "national security."

            As to FBI Anons 3 choices, I say this -
           </p>
           <p>
            OR
           </p>
           <p>
            D.  Turn over all information to the remaining viable portions of the justice system and give them all the resources they need to investigate, arrest and prosecute.  The truth comes out and the entire world realizes how much the former US governments have betrayed their own citizens as well as the entire world.  A moment of realization and redemption occurs, and all treaties and relations with foreign estabilishments have to be reorganized along the lines of the truth.  It is a terrible moment, but there is actual hope at the end of this process as reason is restored.  More vitality will become present in all economies of the world as something new begins to emerge - world government that respects national governments which in turn respect their peoples.  There are not civil wars but there are disagreements on how to implement reform, which are handled democratically and through interpreting the Constitution
           </p>
           <p>
            I CANNOT STAND when some "authority figure" tells me there are only three choices which they then proceed to dictate  - with an outcome that inevitably goes against the interests of justice and the instincts of common sense.  WRONG.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are other options, but the only thing that isn't an option is to let any individual that criminally trespasses on children in any way to walk away without facing justice.  Unacceptable.

             FBIanon isn't real . All his claims have shown nothing and there is no proof of authenticity. Sounds like some 4chan troll pissing about saying things that we want to hear and acting as if his voice is above others. There have been to many honey pots and fake evidence  in PG and its annoying to see so many fall for it.

             E. Whoever's got one of Weiner's harddrive on thumbdrive, release all of it now, all over the place. Make an unforgettable splash. It doesn't mean the Non-Pedos will win, but it will show the entire world the horribly sick side of those who rule us. Govt, Church, 1% -- Child Rape, Inc. If the societies can live with that, we are no better than dead.

             Agreed.  There are infinite possible outcomes depending in part on the choices people make.  Assuming war or civil war seems melodramatic.  I can imagine many possible scenarios which don't require either.

            thank you for that kind and understanding letter. There are currently many of  many who at least have been on the inside that need encouragement. The horror is indescribable but can testify to its truth. The problem does not lie with most just wanting to do their job and protect innocent victims. It is those in power over them who will stop at nothing including death threats, gangstaulking, and worse to those who speak truth to Power. Please continue to support this effort so that the honorable men and women in these agencies know the American people have their back. We can only conquer this together. Amazing citizen researchers combined with moral heroic servants of the people forming together in one bond on behalf of innocent children. That is an unstobbable team. And the Satanic pedophiles are terrified of this so are doing everything possible to prevent us from joining forces with our collective wisdom and moral clarity.

            Arguing with the idiots face-to-face helps us identify for ourselves what we think are the gaping holes in your theories. That way, when we're having a casual conversation with someone in real-life and they happen to mention "I heard about this Pizzagate thing," we can explain to them without hesitation why it's a load of bunk.

            Let's say it is.  Why do you care?  Being paid or just have literally nothing better to do.  I mean shit man, the Internet is a vast place with more information than you could ever digest on it.  Why are you HERE ?  What agenda do you have?  Pretty transparant in my opinion.  Shill level 2/10.

            , thanks for those links. :-)  For clarity's sake can you highlight the three choices at the end, click the button with the quotation mark, and hit save? That will make it clear you are quoting FBIAnon, rather than giving LEOs an ultimatum. Thanks!
