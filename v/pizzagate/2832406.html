            In my view homosexuality is the result of mental illness, could be multiple separate causes or several mixed, and it is never signature of a sound mind. Abuse can lead to it, pornography addiction can lead to it, certain compounds can perhaps lead to it, intentionality can most certainly lead to it and social pressure can lead to it. Mental illness is simply a brain that is not working correctly. I have many unknown but devastating mental illnesses although I thank God this isn't one of them. I do believe homosexuality is quite easily linked with pedophilia but I obviously don't know how that mechanism works and perhaps no one does, since the human organism is far too complex.

            The interview was recorded on September 23rd, after the 8:00 AM Mass at Resurrection Parish, were Bartosic presided the New Mass replacing Pastor Paul Kalchik who was cast out because he burned a gay flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            After Mass, Spalding asked Bishop Bartosic, “Are you a homosexual?” Bartosic understandably answered: “I can't believe you would ask that.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Spalding tells his readers that in Chicago this question is usually redundant, “The Chicago archdiocese is gay.” And, “Every Chicago Catholic knows this.” According to Spalding the "homosexual network" within the Chicago archdiocese has been a "plague".
           </p>
           <p>
            For Spalding it is “extremely troubling” that all three Chicago auxiliary bishops appointed on July 3 - Bartosic, Casey and Hicks - graduated from the "Pink Palace" Mundelein Seminary from the same 1994 class in a time when active homosexual behaviour among seminarians was public and pervasive and many good normal candidates were driven out of seminary. Part of the1994 class was also former Father Daniel McCormack, Chicago's most notorious gay predator priest.

              Tell me of your sins, so I can record them, and give them to the Holy See, so that he can control you for life. That was the first thing I thought when my Ma told me of their ways. Then I went to a Baptist church and learnt the other Baptists across the creek were'a going to Hell. Uncomfortable seats, and they tried to get money from me right away!

              The special collection on Nov. 18 in all U.S. Catholic parishes is earmarked for the Catholic Campaign for Human Development (CCHD), which funds groups that promote abortion and homosexuality.    WHAT?
             </p>
             <p>
              The U.S. bishops publish the fact that Nov. 18, or the Sunday before Thanksgiving, is the day in which 75 percent of Sunday's special collection goes into the coffers of the CCHD. Wednesday, however, Michael Hichborn of Lepanto Institute broke the story that CCHD has given $280,000 over the last five years to the Community Alliance of Tenants (CAT), which is on the steering committee of a coalition that promotes abortion and homosexuality.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a member of the coalition's steering committee, CAT is responsible for the coalition's decisions and actions. The coalition is open about its support for normalizing homosexuality and its promotion of abortion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Funding a group like CAT that is acting in collusion with such a coalition is a violation of the CCHD's own guidelines, which stipulate, "CCHD will not fund groups that are members of coalitions which have as their organizational purpose or coalition agenda, positions or actions that contradict fundamental Catholic moral and social teaching."
             </p>
             <p>
              SO NO DROPPING MONEY ON THE COLLECTION PLATE- NOV. 18th - Keep Your Money.

            Three New Auxiliary Bishops for Chicago Are All Graduates Of The Same "Pink Palace" Class of 1994
           </p>
           <pre><code> "One hall in the seminary dorm," related Kellenyi," is nicknamed the 'Catwalk.' known as the residence of the more fashionable gays." "Catwalk," he explained, was a reference to the runways of fashion models, but also reflected the campy, feline-like personalities of those who lived in this area of the seminary. One member of the formation faculty in particular, he said, was known to take seminarians to high-profile gay events such as a popular gay production in Chicago's Lincoln Park.

            Yes this is where the pope and bishops will spend their retreat in Jan next year.   LOL.  No wonder there is any increase of gay priests in the RC Church.  Francis is Fueling it.

            I wonder if it is really on the rise or just bubbling to the surface because they are that emboldened with how the public view of homosexuality is these days.

                I think you nailed it. It's always been bad, but they are attempting to control history and pretend that it hasn't been a decades long pattern, that they ignored and allowed to flourish.

                 Decades? Try centuries:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pope Leo X had more exotic tastes. Famed for his extravagant lifestyle, he was entertained by young boys leaping naked from cakes. When the new Pope entered Florence in triumph, he had a young boy painted gold, from head to toe, who paraded through the streets. It was pure propaganda, implying the return of a golden age under the rule of the Medici. The boy died shortly afterwards, poisoned by the gold paint on his skin but the papal celebrations went on for days.

                  Gold is poisonous just like pure water, but not like lead. They would have to have blown fine gold dust into his lungs, or stuck it with something poisonous. Most likely a sacrifice or ritual gone wrong. I am calling this a really old, cold case.

                  And I'm not sure I buy the story that the boy died from the paint. He probably died from something much worse. So very sad!

              Yes and most animals in nature have it, derp. With all the girls in the world being raped y'all keep going on about homosexuals. It's largely a man problem. Are you a man? Guilty, if I'm to follow the logic trying to be passed on this thread.
