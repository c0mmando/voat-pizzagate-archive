            It's fake only in that you are lying about what they do.   If you have evidence they are not doing what they claim, you can file a Form 13909 with the IRS.

             So why parade children with disabilities if it's really an 'arts' organisation?  That's the hypocrisy of The Art of Elysium. There'd be no problem if it were honest, and say that it collected donations for the arts.  Instead, it muddies the waters and leads people to believe that they give money to needy children, which they don't do.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Elysium is transparent (which it isn't) and honest, why doesn't it 'honour' 'arts' people?  Why do they ride on the coat tails of people who are perceived to donate to needy causes eg Amber Heard?
            </p>
            <p>
             Go through its Instagram and other social media outlets, there's nothing about giving it needy kids (because it doesn't); it's all about glamorous gala events with B-list celebs. There's a lot of self-congratulations but not much else.
            </p>

            <p>
             lmao.  Again, I challenge you to show where ONE CENT went to any of the above.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is Elysium admitting that they don't spend any money on children, but simply enlist 'volunteers' to do some outreach work with children:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Art of Elysium encourages working actors, artists and musicians
              <strong>
               to voluntarily
              </strong>
              dedicate their time and talent those in the community who can benefit from the life affirming and inspiring benefits of the arts.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Not only does Elysium NOT give any of its money to needy children, but only 66 per cent goes to its arts programs.  Check out those tax returns and see the hefty pay packet that founder Jennifer Howell gives herself.   Elysium provides no audited financials prepared by independent accountant. It scores a meagre two out of four for transparency, and financial accountability and transparency.

              You can look at their 990's and find out what they do and where they spend their money.  In 2016, they spent 742,184 on the following

             <p>
              You still don't understand a single thing about them.
             </p>
             <p>
              They put on arts programs in hospitals for children with disabilities.  Among other things.   Kids act in plays alongside real actors or learn music or comedy.

             <blockquote>
              <p>

There is no hypocrisy, you have simply chosen not learn what they do.

             <p>
              So then you can go and see if there is evidence of them doing what they claim to do.  I can find evidence that they have done programs in Mount Sinai Hospital, Children's Hospital in LA, the Epilepsy Foundation, Kaiser Permanente UCLA-Santa Monica, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, City of Hope, We Can Pediatric Brain Tumor Network, Totally Kids Specialty Healthcare and LAC USC Medical Center.

            can be explained as an experiment in Phenomenology. Heidegger describes Phenomenology as “the process of letting things manifest themselves.” Phenomenology attempts to enable people to see clearly something that is right before their eyes but obscured; things that are so taken for granted that they are muted by abstract observation."

             Lotus Flower in Egyptian Culture
The lotus flower was one of the most important symbols in the ancient Egyptian religion. Called as “seshen”, the flower was a symbol of Upper Egypt and represented creation and rebirth.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was closely associated with the Sun god, Atum-Ra as it was also a symbol of the sun. Later, the lotus flower was associated with Nefertum, the god of healing, beauty, perfume and fragrance. Nefertum/Nefertem was often depicted in ancient Egyptian art wearing a crown made of lotus flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Much like its use in Buddhism, the lotus flower was considered as a symbol of rebirth and recreation since it closes its petals at night and opens them back again in the morning.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is also the reason why the lotus flower was associated with the dead entering the underworld to be reborn there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another use of lotus flower in Egyptian culture is related to the cult of Osiris, funerals, the mummification process and The Four Sons of Horus.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Four Sons of Horus were born from a lotus flower according to Egyptian mythology and they were depicted sitting on a lotus flower in several ancient Egyptian artworks.  In addition to that, the goddess Isis was believed to be born out of a lotus flower. Remember they are sun worshipers. The lotus closes its petals at night. The symbol of purity is our children. Go to the grocery store and take note of every brand that has sun symbolism on the package, and then find out the parent company, main stockholders, ect. They are paying homage to Akenhaten (Moses) the exiled Egyptian god king who was most likely an inbred hermaphrodite.

            I don't know when people will realize that they are all Satanic whores. Like the arguments over The Kenyan being Christian or Muslim. He's neither! He's a Luciferian and does as he's told as a puppet in that army. For his services and soul that he sold, he's given a rank and privileges, but that all goes away when he doesn't follow orders.

             The Art of Elysium gives no money to needy children. All its money goes into arts programs for actors. It has charity status and pays no income tax.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its founders are Jennifer Howell and James Franco, who has linked his Elysium Bandini Studios to this fake charity. From my understanding, James Franco's EB Studios also has charity status. All it does is make short films and videos.
             <strong>
              There's no charity work.
             </strong>

            <p>
             <strong>
              None of Elysium's millions goes to needy children. It is able to maintain charity status because it gets volunteers (unpaid) to do some outreach work with needy kids.

             The furry scene was started to hide under aged people having sex with older people in my opinion. Once it took off as a deviant fad, it made it's own cover.

            UNREAL. I almost want to type this in all caps to express my excitement but will spare you the theatrics. This is an unbelieveable find.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been trying to follow up on my own Legend/Teigen Heaven/Elysium research and it appears as though this Jennifer Howell tries VERY HARD to keep a good PR image and has really tried to avoid any tasteless or symbolic photographs everywhere on the net and makes it appear as though her 501-C3 charity is squeeky clean...
           </p>
           <p>
            Except for
            <strong>
             THIS PICTURE
            </strong>
            ... which TELLS THE ENTIRE STORY, that right there is 100% BAPHOMET, the God with many names throughout history that we all know as 'Satan' or Lucifer, Baal, and Enki, one of the "Annunaki".
           </p>
           <p>
            It couldn't have been more obvious with her choice of "Performance" artist Marina Abramovic, the fact that "Elysium" is so close to the "Mysteries of Eleusis" of Greek Lore and Occult practice, and the fact that not only is James Franco a co-investor and board member, but everyone involved with the project is INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE MANY ASPECTS OF THE SEXUAL ABUSE DISCOVERIES HAPPENING IN HOLLYWOOD RIGHT NOW So wtf is UP with this place? I suspect ALOT now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe another poster was right about this place, it DOESN'T appear as though DONATIONS ARE RENDERED TO POOR AND DESERVING CHILDREN, rather, it is to fund VISITS by some of these personalities, and event organizers, TO VISIT THE CHILDRENS HOSPITALS OF CALIFORNIA, and provide interesting activities for them in their time of suffering, which, at the outset is completely above board, a great service to society, and a very noble cause, except, as a few rotten apples have shown us like Jimmy Savile, children's hospitals and care homes are one of the first things on any good detectives list. I find it kind of ironic too that it seems much of the money goes to fund a few of Franco's goofy projects.... Hmmmmm, that reminds me, I should go post about the Golden Globe #MeToo charade we witnessed over on CDAN...
