<p>One brand name for this drug is Nembutal, coined by John S. Lundy, who started using it in 1930, from the structural formula of the sodium salt—Na (sodium) + ethyl + methyl + butyl + al (common suffix for barbiturates).[22] Nembutal is trademarked and manufactured by the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck (now produced by Akorn Pharmaceuticals) and is the only injectable form of pentobarbital approved for sale in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="md-july-1-2011-danish-company-lundbeck-blocks-sale-of-drug-for-u.s.-executions">July 1, 2011: <a href="https://archive.vn/tZTyy#selection-351.0-351.54">Danish Company Lundbeck Blocks Sale of Drug for U.S. Executions</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Lundbeck, said in a statement that it “adamantly opposes the distressing misuse of our product in capital punishment.” Lundbeck informed its distributors that from now on its sodium pentobarbital injection, a barbiturate sold under the brand name Nembutal, would be available in states that conduct lethal-injection executions on only a restricted basis....The death penalty is prohibited throughout the 27-member European Union, and human rights groups have brought pressure on drugmakers not to supply lethal drugs for American executions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pentobarbital is also commonly used for veterinary and human euthanasia, which of course the company fully supports.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Lundbeck also has <a href="https://archive.vn/mpPNd#selection-769.116-769.278">quite a lineup of drugs related to schizophrenia and depression</a>. <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301063959/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/antidepressant-medications-for-children-and-adolescents-information-for-parents-and-caregivers.shtml">Two of them, Lexapro and Celexa, are among the SSRI antidepressants that the FDA was forced to give a black box warning to alerting consumers about the increased risk of desire to commit suicide when given to children</a></strong>. </p>
<p>Who wants to bet on the percentage of school shooters who have taken these drugs?</p>
<h1 id="md-the-lundbeck-rabbit-hole">The Lundbeck rabbit hole</h1>
<p>A deeper look into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lundbeck">history of Lundbeck</a> is interesting, as well. Founded in 1915 by Hans Lundbeck as a trading company, <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/7uek4d.png">they sold</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin">controversial German artificial sweetener saccharine</a>, a by product of coal tar. Their corporate magazine (<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/qv3xgf.pdf">see page 47</a>) notes that <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/3wmisi.png">demand for drugs during World War I</a> led to their <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/xbm86v.pdf">hiring Eduard Goldschmidt in 1924</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eduard Goldschmidt was recruited in 1924, beginning Lundbeck’s ascent in the pharmaceutical industry. He brought several agencies for medicines into the company with him. Among the first preparations Lundbeck introduced to the Danish market were the suppository Anusol® for haemorrhoids, the painkiller Gelonida®, the laxative Agarol®, and Inotyol® for the treatment of small cuts and minor burns. Goldschmidt also introduced over-the-counter products from Germany and France that promised quick relief from a wide variety of illnesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/gkrv9j.png">The Lundbeck logo is a red star</a> -- which of course is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_star">symbol of Communism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="md-at-least-one-blogger-has-connected-the-lundbeck-foundation-to-eugenics">At least <a href="https://archive.vn/TYjNw">one blogger has connected the Lundbeck Foundation to eugenics</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Goldschmidt was forced to withdraw from the company a short time later because of the occupying Germans\' rampant anti-Semitism. Interestingly, the Internet and the wayback machine appear to have been scrubbed of all references to Goldschmidt.</p>
<p>Could this be the point that Lundbeck began the trip down eugenics lane?</p>
<p>In March of 2012, the Lundbeck Foundation donated $22 million to Danish psychiatric research, funding the Lundbeck’s Foundation’s Initiative for Integrated Psychiatric Research. The stated purpose of this research is to “identify biological disease mechanisms&quot; and &quot;provide the basis for better treatment and prevention.” Five mental disorders will be investigated: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, autism, and ADHD.</p>
<p>While it is not surprising that a company whose profits come from psychiatric drugs would finance research in that area, it is who will be doing the research that warrants further investigation. Thomas Werge, a prominent Danish biochemist, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120414095247/http:/www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/topmenu/Nyheder/Nyheder+og+pressemeddelelser/Nyhedsarkiv+2008/Skizofreniens+gaade+lost.htm">published a research paper in 2008 announcing</a> that the genes for schizophrenia had been discovered and that there was a future possibility of being able to identify and abort schizophrenic fetuses. (<a href="https://files.catbox.moe/oeaojv.png">Screencap of Google-translated Wayback capture</a>).</p>
<p>That statement provoked national debates on the ethics of aborting potentially mentally ill babies, debates that continue to this day. What was consistent in the many debates that followed was the uncontested assumption that it is possible to identify the schizophrenia gene in a fetus. Werge continued to fuel the debate by saying, <strong>“This can be the beginning of being able to reduce the number of people who have to suffer mental illness.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author does not give evidence directly linking Werge to Lundbeck, but <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ezxb7c.pdf">the 2011 Lundbeck Foundation annual report</a> features an entire article by him lauding research into the genetic basis of mental illness -- complete with &quot;follow the stars&quot; propaganda featuring a Danish actor.</p>
<p>It\'s interesting that he posits that references to Goldschmidt have been scrubbed from the internet. They are indeed limited. I did, however, find quite a bit showing his proactive role in the aryanization of Lundbeck during the Nazi occupation on <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/7f8pwr.pdf">page 132 of this paper</a>, which also describes the <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/lttgd4.png">chemist\'s ongoing role</a> as <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/thpj3v.png">the chief inventor of the company</a>. Goldschmidt moved to Sweden for a few years, and then stepped right back into his position after the war to lead development of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/qv3xgf.pdf">Lundbeck\'s history page <sup>(p.48)</sup></a> credits <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/rjtrqq.png">Nazi patents</a> with spurring their post-war boom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Targeted research into new medicines accelerated after the war, while Danish companies benefited from the windfall of German patent rights arising from post war reparations. Lundbeck acquired the rights to a compound that it developed into the acute pain reliever Ketogan®, a hugely successful product that established the company on the growing world markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ketogan is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketobemidone">very addictive synthetic opiod</a> developed by IG Farben which <a href="https://archive.vn/THUXu#selection-1693.5-1721.297">most countries including the US deemed too dangerous to allow</a>. <a href="https://archive.vn/wD06S#selection-443.0-513.4">IG Farben is the notorious Nazi chemical company</a> convicted of using slave labor at Auschwitz and producing Zyklon-b.</p>
<p>So to recap, we\'ve got a Danish drug maker with multiple eugenics ties and Communist corporate logo subverting US Federal and state executions of child rapists and murders. Good thing there are generic alternatives. Oh wait...</p>

<p>The same month, globalist Communist Pope Francis <a href="https://onepeterfive.com/getting-it-wrong-about-the-death-penalty/">claims there is no crime in the world that deserves the death penalty</a></p>
<p>If we dig, I\'m sure we\'ll find more.</p>',

            one blogger has connected the Lundbeck Foundation to eugenics
           </a>
          </h2>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Goldschmidt was forced to withdraw from the company a short time later because of the occupying Germans' rampant anti-Semitism. Interestingly, the Internet and the wayback machine appear to have been scrubbed of all references to Goldschmidt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could this be the point that Lundbeck began the trip down eugenics lane?
           </p>
           <p>
            In March of 2012, the Lundbeck Foundation donated $22 million to Danish psychiatric research, funding the Lundbeck’s Foundation’s Initiative for Integrated Psychiatric Research. The stated purpose of this research is to “identify biological disease mechanisms" and "provide the basis for better treatment and prevention.” Five mental disorders will be investigated: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, autism, and ADHD.
           </p>
           <p>
            While it is not surprising that a company whose profits come from psychiatric drugs would finance research in that area, it is who will be doing the research that warrants further investigation. Thomas Werge, a prominent Danish biochemist,
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120414095247/http:/www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/topmenu/Nyheder/Nyheder+og+pressemeddelelser/Nyhedsarkiv+2008/Skizofreniens+gaade+lost.htm">
             published a research paper in 2008 announcing
            </a>
            that the genes for schizophrenia had been discovered and that there was a future possibility of being able to identify and abort schizophrenic fetuses. (
            <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/oeaojv.png">
             Screencap of Google-translated Wayback capture
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            That statement provoked national debates on the ethics of aborting potentially mentally ill babies, debates that continue to this day. What was consistent in the many debates that followed was the uncontested assumption that it is possible to identify the schizophrenia gene in a fetus. Werge continued to fuel the debate by saying,
            <strong>
             “This can be the beginning of being able to reduce the number of people who have to suffer mental illness."
            </strong>
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           The author does not give evidence directly linking Werge to Lundbeck, but

           It's interesting that he posits that references to Goldschmidt have been scrubbed from the internet. They are indeed limited. I did, however, find quite a bit showing his proactive role in the aryanization of Lundbeck during the Nazi occupation on

            I immediately knew what DOJ's order for freeing up firing squads and electrocutions, implied.

            Not only are lethal injections vulnerable to actions such as this, but there is an entire delay by appeals system set up around their use.

            Nice to see how desperate these cunts are, it shows their only hope is delaying execution in hopes of regaining power at some point in the future.  It won't work.

            Pretty sure Patriots will spare some ammo for firing squads if needed.  I also have lot of rope and building materials.  Seriously though, this isn't shocking.  If you look at the corporate family trees of IG Farben, Bayer and other chemical and drug makers, many of them have old ties to the Nazis and now the Deep State.  Phenobarbitol is cheap and could be made by the government without issue.
