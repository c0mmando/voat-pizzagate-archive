<p>There are so many coded messages in there, reminding his fellow heathens of what they\'re fighting for. Hence CNN\'s couching this in the use of &quot;TOUGH LOVE&quot; (how tough? Ritually abusive tough?) and binging up Christina Aguilera, an alleged victim of MK Ultra sex kitten conditioning. Then there\'s the mention of pizza.

<p>I decided to use this as my starting point and research what I could find about crimes taking place in church basements. It\'s all to tie what I believe to be a center of the ritual abuse of children and a gathering place for this cabal. I had help in figuring out where this place was and I would ask that the anonymous person helping me, help me again about what they\'ve found in the NOLA section of New Orleans. This is my new account, but I hope mentioning New Orleans rings a bell and that you\'ll tell me what you know. But for now, I\'m going to post a few of the more horrific cases I\'ve found. They happened a few years ago, but it will give you some idea of how long this has been going on. </p>
<p>This first case involves: SRA, the killing of children, the hierarchy of the Catholic church\'s lack of morality, transgenderism/cross-dressing, and the ritual murder of a nun.

<p>This is the thoroughly bizarre story of Rev. Gerald Robinson who served in a north side church located in Toledo, Ohio. While there, the strangulaton/rape of 72-year-old Sister Margaret Ann Paul occurred. She\'d been ritually murdered and the case went unsolved for 40 years even though a $30,000 reward was offered. When Robinson was arrested in April 2004, an anonymous woman came forward. She said she recognized him as one of the men that ritually abused her in the church basement for years. But the police couldn\'t dismiss her story when corroborating evidence linked her claims to Sister Margaret\'s slaughter. Here are the details: </p>

<p>A Toledo Roman Catholic diocesan priest charged in the 1980 slaying of a nun was accused yesterday in a civil lawsuit of repeatedly torturing and raping a young girl in ritual abuse ceremonies at a north-side church.</p>
<p>An unidentified woman claims she was the victim of bizarre demonizing ceremonies conducted by the Rev. Gerald Robinson and other clergy nearly 40 years ago in the basement of St. Adalbert Parish on Warsaw Street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Robinson was not the only one that participated in the demonic ceremonies involving children. &gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father Robinson, who is scheduled to go on trial in October for the aggravated murder of Sister Margaret Ann Pahl; Gerald Mazuchowski, a former lay minister; the diocese; St. Adalbert Parish; the Oblates of St. Francis De Sales, Inc., and fifteen &quot;John Does&quot; were named as defendants.</p>
<p>Sister Margaret Ann, 71, was strangled, then stabbed up to 32 times April 5, 1980, in what has been described as a ritualistic slaying in the sacristy of a chapel in the former Mercy Hospital. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercy Hospital? Are you getting these asshole\'s sick sense of humor? Here\'s more: </p>

<p>Nothing new emerged until last year, when a woman whose identity has been kept secret testified before a diocesan commission in Toledo that she had endured years of sexual, physical and psychological abuse by a group of priests during her childhood and teenage years. Fr Robinson, she alleged, had sexually assaulted her and forced her to participate in Satanic rituals.</p>
<p>Some of her testimony seemed unbelievable - particularly when she described being placed in a coffin crawling with cockroaches, being forced to eat a human eyeball and be penetrated with a snake to consecrate her orifices to Satan. She said the priests had killed children, mutilated dogs and performed an abortion on her as part of their devil-worship.</p>
<p>Something about her testimony, however, stirred the interest of the Toledo police, and triggered the reopening of the inquiry into the murder of Sister Margaret Ann. Police officials have refused to discuss what it was they found that they had previously overlooked, saying only that a part of their evidence involves a criminological technique known as &quot;blood transfer patterns&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, let me pull out a sentence: </p>

<p>As for the church\'s part: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Challenged as to why they did not investigate the allegations of Satanic rituals, church officials have said that the claimswere not credible. They have not explained why Fr Robinson was not placed on leave after he was named as a suspect, in apparent violation of their own policies. He celebrated mass until last week.</p>

            What was it that the police found all of a sudden they had not seen before, sighting "blood transfer patterns".   What are blood transfer patterns?  Anyone know?  I may look into this.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.practicalhomicide.com/Research/LOmar2007-2.htm">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            DOCUMENTING BLOODSTAIN PATTERNS If the crime scene technician is not trained in bloodstain pattern analysis it is imperative that the crime investigators obtain complete documentation of any bloodstains or patterns both with and without rule of measure. Never assume that all the bloodstain patterns belong to the victim.
           </p>
           <p>
            Blood is present in most crimes scene involving violence and therefore presents the investigator with additional information to determine the sequence of events, which may have taken place between the victim and the assailant. Bloodstain patterns at the scene or from the clothing of principals in a case can be used to confirm or refute assumptions concerning events and their sequence. In addition, bloodstain patterns can illustrate the position of the victim, such as standing, sitting, or lying. Bloodstain evidence can also show evidence of a struggle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore an effective bloodstain pattern analysis can confirm or refute statements made by principals in the case. For example, "Are stain patterns on a suspects clothing consistent with his reported actions? Or, "Are stain patterns on a victim or at a scene consistent with accounts given by witnesses or the suspect"?

             From my understanding, one example of a blood transfer patterns would be someone stepping into the blood on the floor. It's when an object comes into contact with the blood and the pattern it has made.

              Thank God for forensic progress!   Can you imagine that priest and those others?  They thought they had gotten away with their crimes.  All the time also still doing all those horrid things to others as well.  I can't believe they stopped with her.  I believe they killed that nun because she saw something and he knew she would tell.  Basements are underground just like tunnels.  That is where SRA crimes are committed.  Underground.  Like the Under Under Tunnels.

               Bless the cops that persevered and didn't forget about the murdered nun. t would have been easy enough to give up on. Those are the kind of police we used to have, but now the Deep State swamp is trying to force out the "good" guys ... the ones with consciences that actually care whether people live or die. Ones that do not sell victims out for a diabolical agenda.

                Yes, we can thank Hillary's Community Policing.  They have implemented it in all large cities and are pushing it in other ones as well.  Not sure what it all entails but I don't think things are working too well in those places, at least not for the public.  They have been getting a lot of the forces from former military.

            The lawsuit contends that Father Robinson and Mr. Mazuchowski "had a close relationship with Survivor Doe's mother, who also participated in the ceremonies in the woods and was becoming high priestess of Satan."

           <p>
            Survivor Doe's mother, who also participated in the ceremonies - this could possibly be a family cult case.  It could also mean she just had an affair with the priest and became so entranced in the Satanic Rituals she  turned her daughter over to them.  But also could mean something more as in a family cult that could go back decades or longer.  What a horrible case.  Similar to that of

             It s horrific. While the mother made the choice to become what she is, the child did not.
            </p>
            <p>
             It sounds more as if the mother was recruited through the church and this priest. The church basement is where the rituals began and it doesn't mention the mother. People are offered all sorts of things to go along and the child undoubtedly would have told the mother so getting her to their side was important. They found her Achilles heel and went from there. At least that's how I'm reading it. But you could be right about the family cult thing. But from what's contained in the article, it seems more likely that the mother was recruited .. hence the fifteen other men involved.

              This is so sick and sad.  As horrid as it is though, I am so glad it worked out for this girl, now a woman to finally get justice.  What a horrible thing though for her to know that her own mother sold her off.  I think that adds to the abuse even more of course.  She must have a wonderful mate and also good mental help in order to have made it this far.  But it never ends.  Things keep coming back piece by piece.  All your life things get exposed.

               Yes, and part of her victory is that the police believed her. That's huge! It's scary enough to come forward, but then to be dismissed? Or learn the police were complicit? You're victimized twice.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes, the betrayal must be really hard to process. Where does she fit in her mother in her thoughts? The instinct is to love your mother, but how can you when she sold you out? It's hard to achieve peace with that tragedy in your past. Yes, her husband must be amazing. I'm glad she found him and was still able to love and bond and trust again.

                So right about LE.  I wonder what that force is like now.  Have they still the courage and the right people to forge ahead with such an investigation?  Or have they been infiltrated. 
I hope it is still Holy Toledo.

                 However, I did come across something VERY interesting about the phenomenon of being a transgender. Historically, it's been considered very evil and it might have its links in just that. Of course, my personal opinion is that it has to do with abuse. Abuse can shatter a child's identity like nothing else, but it's intriguing speculation.

But that is how it is.  Yes, this is one of  the sickest forms of abuse.  Most of the abuse ends when the 
Child grows beyond the parent's interest, so think of it, how can they continue to make this Child suffer?  They push them into this transgenderism. Then also it just hurts to think how if that Child has medical/surgical changes made they will suffer their whole lives.  I can't even imagine the pain if that Child now an adult realizes the mistake.

                    Yes.  I have thought about that so many times.  All the Children presently going through this and even the adults that may come to realize they have been had, and that all they needed was to receive the proper mental health help.  There is so much money to be made by the medical field and big pharma.  It is a mortal sin, imo.

                     Absolutely. I always felt that spiritual sins are worse than material ones. I'm not saying stealing somebody's money is all right. It's absolutely wrong, but those sins tht defile the spirit or soul are the most egregious. It demoralizes and destroys you and the spirit is God and the soul houses God. No, I don't want to think about it, but there you go. It's unimaginable and yet it exists.

                      Killing the soul of a child by sexual abuse should be at least punishable by life in prison.  But the pedos want sympathy for being ostracized.  Sickening.

                       In some cases, I really believe the option of a death penalty should be available. Not in every case, but some? Yes ... what they did is equivalent to murder.

            . Unfortunately, we require linked evidence that supports all major claims, including:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There are so many coded messages in there, reminding his fellow heathens of what they're fighting for. Hence CNN's couching this in the use of "TOUGH LOVE" (how tough? Ritually abusive tough?) and binging up Christina Aguilera, an alleged victim of MK Ultra sex kitten conditioning. Then there's the mention of pizza. I mean, if the alleged rape of children isn't enough to rally the troops, what is?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Unsourced speculation like this turns this from a serious investigative piece into billboard for rampant confirmation bias that pizzagate deniers can and will use as evidence we're loons on a witch hunt. You need to edit the thread to either provide linked sources supporting the claims that

           <ul>
            <li>
             there are coded messages in Obama's statement

            <li>
             that "tough love" is associated with SRA
