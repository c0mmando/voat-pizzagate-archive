            Egypt –“ Qadhafi added that this act, which is a malicious sex crime, reveals the ugly face of those who introduced the AIDS virus to Africa in order to exhaust its strength and deplete its resources with the intention of gaining control over Africa. He remarked that Africa has turned into a market of high demand for pharmaceutical and other AIDS-treatment medical products. He claimed that international monopolies strive to continue disseminating the AIDS virus as long as possible in order to double their profits from sales of pharmaceutical products, which inhibit the effects of the disease.”

            In 1997, there was a massive outbreak of HIV in Benghazi’s El-Fatih Children’s hospital. More cases occurred in the years after. In total, 426 children and 18 mothers were infected with the deadly virus. “We buried the 73rd victim last week,” Ramadan al-Faytouri tells RNW. “A little girl named Aisha Zeyyeni. Her mother had died earlier.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Doctor El-Hojouj and five Bulgarian nurses working in the same hospital were accused of deliberately infecting the children. Following a highly politicised trial, a Libyan court sentenced the medics to death in 2004. The death sentence was upheld on appeal but eventually commuted to life imprisonment by the Libyan Supreme Court in 2007. Following the intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy, the then-president of France, the medics were then extradited to Bulgaria and released.

            BBC Monitoring Alert - BULGARIA
AIDS BENGHAZI
           </p>
           <p>
            “Earlier in the day the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry issued a joint 
statement of the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia in which they 
said they recognized Libya's Interim Transitional National Council (TNC) 
as a legitimate representative of the Libyan people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Libyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi thanked the EU and Bulgaria 
as its member for averting a possible bloodbath in Benghazi, by 
launching the air strikes.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We perceive the ties with Bulgaria as friendly," TNC representatives 
said. The participants in the meeting commented the case of the five 
Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian intern who were charged with 
conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, 
causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in Benghazi, Libya.
           </p>
           <p>
            The six were sentenced to death twice and eventually released following 
a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian 
issues. On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited 
to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian 
president and they were freed.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the Tuesday meeting the TNC representatives said that new facts are 
to come up concerning the case, which will show that "it was staged by 
Gaddafi's [Al-Qadhafi's] regime."”
           </p>

            -Hiv Trial in Libya-
           </p>
           <p>
            In April 2001 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi made a speech at the African summit on HIV/AIDS. He told the conference that the world AIDS epidemic started when "CIA laboratories lost control over the virus which they were testing on black Haitian prisoners"
           </p>
           <p>
            He called the HIV crisis in Benghazi "an odious crime" and questioned who was behind it."Some said it was the CIA. Others said it was the Mossad Israeli intelligence. They carried out an experiment on these children." He went on to say that the trial would be "an international trial, like the Lockerbie trial.
           </p>

             To	translations@ stratfor.com BBC Monitoring Alert - BULGARIA AIDS BENGHAZI “Earlier in the day the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry issued a joint statement of the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia in which they said they recognized Libya's Interim Transitional National Council (TNC) as a legitimate representative of the Libyan people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Libyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi thanked the EU and Bulgaria as its member for averting a possible bloodbath in Benghazi, by launching the air strikes.
            </p>
            <p>
             "We perceive the ties with Bulgaria as friendly," TNC representatives said. The participants in the meeting commented the case of the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian intern who were charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in Benghazi, Libya.
            </p>
            <p>
             The six were sentenced to death twice and eventually released following a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian issues. On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian president and they were freed.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the Tuesday meeting the TNC representatives said that new facts are to come up concerning the case, which will show that "it was staged by Gaddafi's [Al-Qadhafi's] regime."”
