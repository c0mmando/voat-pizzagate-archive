<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT:t Psychoanalytic theory, with its move away from drive theory to object-relations, lacks a compatible model of the power of psychosexuality in adult life (including in therapy). <strong>It is proposed that in infancy drive tension, frustration and urgency may be erotized by the caregiver; while actual sexual excitement may remain unmirrored and uncontained.</strong> This produces a psychosexual core which is unstable, elusive and never felt to be really owned. In sexual acts we can project and identify with our own sexuality, felt to belong to the other, yet allowing more successful re-internalization and gradual integration. The relief at being able to relate to troubling aspects of the self, via the other, creates a deep attachment bond, although sexual excitement may fade as self-integration becomes more secure. The technical challenges of working on sexuality in long-term, relationship-focused psychotherapy with an implicit parental model are briefly considered.</p>

<p>Quotes from p. 45 Gager and Schurr –</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Somewhere to the right of the “normality” apologists for incest are those like psychiatrist Karl Menninger who suggest that early sex with adults may actually contribute to mental health. Arguing that children are not irreparably ruined by exposure to such experiences at an early age, Menninger refers to a follow-up study done by two well-known Freudian psychiatrists on adults who had been child victims. Because these adults had turned out to be “distinguished and unusually charming and attractive in their outward personalities,” Menninger concludes that early sex doesn’t have to be harmful....</p>

             In 2003, Walker Digital devised an Internet–based surveillance system called U.S. HomeGuard. The basic concept was to hire 1 million work-at-home employees who would log in over the Internet to provide constant surveillance of image feeds from some 47,000 security cameras. These webcams would be installed nationwide at security-sensitive sites including border crossings, water reservoirs, chemical plants, nuclear power generators, airports, etc. Observers would report any suspicious activity to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security within 30 seconds. Wiredmagazine called the idea "intriguing"

Their vision was to create a service that would not only complete the requirements for the course, but also serve the whole community of the Ivy League....Dormhop has evolved since we started working on it, with the aim to connect students across the Ivy League and beyond. Using the platform, students can get in touch with fellow students at the university they want to travel to in order to find a host and a place to stay. Our matching algorithm will try to find the ideal host for you.

             Around the dinner table one evening, Christopher Onesti’s physician father shared a story about an emergency patient who died due to a preventable mistake -- improper intubation. ..So, from the day he walked onto the Harvard campus in September 2016, Onesti was set on launching a startup. He met like-minded freshman Nicolas Weninger, an electrical engineering concentrator, and the two began brainstorming viable startup ideas. They drew inspiration from their collaborative project in Introduction to Computer Science (CS 50), which ultimately led to the launch of Entyde, which they entered into the 10th annual i3 Innovation Challenge. The student startup competition is organized by the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

             . It should be noted that D'Agostino was close to the late Senators Jesse Helms and Patrick Leahy, with Leahy calling D'Agostino "a living saint," because Cathy O'Brien alleges Patrick Leahy raped her daughter many times, and otherwise tortured her, Cathy, in numerous incidents.

              Azerbaijan leader's daughters tried to buy £60m London home with offshore funds
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The daughters of Azerbaijan’s president agreed to buy a £60m London property using a secret offshore company, in a case potentially carrying “a significant risk of money laundering”, a tribunal has heard.
             </p>
             <p>
              Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva sought to purchase two luxury Knightsbridge flats for £59.5m, including £3m to convert them into a single home. The deal in 2015 was intended to be the latest addition to a multi-million pound property portfolio in Britain acquired by president Ilham Aliyev’s family.
             </p>
             <p>
              Leyla Aliyeva initiated the purchase at the same time as her divorce from Emin Agalarov, an Azerbaijani businessman and pop star. Aglarov’s father Aras, a Moscow-based property developer,
              <strong>
               hosted Donald Trump on his 2013 visit to Russia for the Miss Universe beauty pageant.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Details emerged in a disciplinary tribunal into the solicitor who carried out the transaction, Khalid Sharif. Sharif – a senior partner with the London firm Child &amp; Child – admitted failing to carry out money-laundering checks and breaching his professional code.
             </p>
             <p>
              The tribunal fined him £45,000 and £40,000 in costs. He is the first UK professional to be punished following the publication in April 2016 by the Guardian and other media of the Panama Papers – 11.5 million leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
             </p>
             <p>
              A close associate of the president,
              <strong>
               Javad Marandi
              </strong>
              , introduced the Aliyeva sisters to Child &amp; Child, the tribunal was told. Sharif then set up a British Virgin Islands company, Exaltation Ltd, on their behalf, bought from Mossack Fonseca. Its purpose was “holding UK property”.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...President Aliyev has ruled Azerbaijan since 2003. During this time his daughters have reportedly amassed vast personal business empires. The Aliyevs own a £17m mansion overlooking Hampstead Heath in north London and a luxury flat in Hyde Park, plus various mansions in Moscow, Dubai and the Czech republic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sharif also arranged a second transaction which saw Marandi “gift” a £3.5m London apartment to a friend, Mirjalal Pashayev. Pashayev is a cousin of Azerbaijan’s first lady and vice-president Mehriban Aliyeva. The three-bedroom flat at 31 Hans Place, immediately south of Harrods, was transferred from one opaque corporate entity to another...
             </p>
             <p>
              The Aliyev sisters have not responded to requests for comment. Leyla Aliyeva is said to prefer living in Britain to Russia. She is an artist and socialite, and is
              <strong>
               reportedly friends with Prince Andrew, Lord Mandelson and Elisabeth Murdoch...

            And then we have this bit of news as well.  Harry, Megan and the New Royal, Sussex are going to make a trip to Africa.  Those Royals.  They just have Hearts of Gold don't they.  Opening a school for youngsters with Anna Freud (related to Clement Freud convicted pedophile and his wife who was also accused of sexual abuse by a 17 yr. old).  Nothing to see here folks.  And then we have those of the Royal Family that just love to take into their hearts those poor Children of Africa.

            Prince Harry, Meghan planning a tour of Africa with baby Sussex in tow: Report
           </p>
           <p>
            The U.K.'s The Sunday Times reports there are plans for Harry and Meghan to tour Africa in the fall, and they may take their baby with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            "As it stands the plan is that Harry and Meghan and their newborn baby, in probably about six months, will take a trip to Africa and tour several countries in Africa," Royah Nikkhah, royal correspondent for The Sunday Times, told "Good Morning America." "And around October time probably visit two or three different Commonwealth nations which are of course the nations in Africa that have a close relationship with the U.K."
           </p>

            "The countries that they will be going to haven't been decided yet. That’s a discussion that is ongoing between the government and some of the host nations who want to have Harry and Meghan," Nikkhah added. "The tour will be on behalf of the government but very likely to be some countries that Harry and Meghan have a close connection with."
           </p>
           <p>
            Nikkhah broke a story earlier this month in The Sunday Times that Harry and Meghan are reportedly considering heading on a “sabbatical” for six months, with Africa as their likely destination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Africa is a place close to both Harry and Meghan's hearts.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is where Harry, 34, whisked Meghan, 37, away a few weeks after the couple's first date in 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looks like Diana's plans to warn and keep Harry and William from harm are long gone.  I am sure she is tossing and turning in her grave.

            Sylvia Woosley was just ten when Freud, 24, began abusing her, and he later brought her up as a daughter, inviting her into his marital bed with his actress wife Jill.
           </p>
           <p>
            The article about his wife Jill begin accused is very hard to find and may well have been scrubbed.  I have posted it before.  The whole family is perverted.  They think nothing of it.  They consider it normal, imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kate hooking up with these perverts is a dead giveaway that she thinks nothing of it either.

              Nothing would surprise me about any of them.  I heard one of the boys was gay but I think it was Harry.  Let's figure they both are since Charles just can't keep his hands to himself.  The story or rumor is that he was deflowered by Lord Mountbatten.  I could just vomit.  Diana gave her life for those boys.  She tosses and turns day and night.

Because these adults had turned out to be “distinguished and unusually charming and attractive in their outward personalities,” Menninger concludes that early sex doesn’t have to be harmful....

            Was the rise of psychiatric medical model by sigmand freud at the same time as fascism in Germany? Burroughs Wellcome out of GB is linked to tavistock.......comet ping pong had two doors in it , one saying Well the other come. Burroughs Wellcome also has a HQ in the piedmont of NC.......close to Duke University, Ft bragg, both of which mentioned as taking part in mkultra programming. Many large mental institutions and prisons surrounding these institutions. Charlotte NC , banking HQ of US. David Koresh recruited for WACO there from western part of state / seventh day adventists churches. Also other big pharma HQs .........Now , it is evident why the govt. killed so many there...experiment for programming ......they chose people who were suggestable, from churches.

               There is an armenian connection to mi6 and east india company, turkish drug trade, the boston brahmins...
A sociopathic strain can be seen i. The suren pahlav clan..precursor of the pallavicini clans in venice and london...
Research zoe pallavicini..
Paleilogos..
And pallavas of south india..
There symbol is always the double headed eagle...
Which is a rendition of a gland in the brain..
              </p>
              <p>
               The suren pahlav clan is a mystery breed ..i believe the nacash in the bible..
Read tue wiki page and comment section..
Napolean fab pedigree page shows a pallavicini connection ..
              </p>
              <p>
               The double heeaded eagle also shows up in the hanseatic league ...as well as mysore coat of arms..
In indonesia it is the garuda ..eagle god..
They trample.on the head of the naga or snake..the mans journey to higher consciuosness state ie God..
Keep us in a state of beastly material city civilisation domesticatedd existence via human cattle herding tech..
They understand merchant banking and using human cinsent to loan their energies to their banking system to hold them as surety and collateral to the debt..
I beleive the normans and their descendent toffs and tories of england where not vikings but the armenian clans hiding behind the scences..
Research house of suren ..
