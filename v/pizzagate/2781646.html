<p>I\'ve added some bold to highlight parts I feel deserve attention.</p>
<p>From what little I know of this guy he seems like an unconventional businessman. He took over his company\'s Instagram and used it as a personal account. He\'s been attacked for showing sympathy towards Trump. Apart from being odd, he also has some very serious accusations made about his temperament and treatment of his staff who have accused him and others of bullying. He mentions being a drug dealer in the article and this could be an explanation for his behaviour. It\'s also a handy excuse for anyone wanting to dismiss these allegations.</p>
<p>Here\'s something interesting from a very negative article on Elle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the record, the company is wildly successful. Though it was founded in 2013, over the last year it catapulted to popularity across social media and aggressively expanded store opening plans to Melbourne, Sydney, Seoul, the UK, and the US. It is projected to earn $300 million in sales in 2018 and, last summer, Estée Lauder made a minority investment (it owns 28 percent).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huge amounts of money and aggressive expansion could be signs of something corrupt going on and fit in with these vague accusations. But does it have anything to do with Pizzagate?</p>
<p>Well what do Affleck, Clooney, Pitt and Spielberg have to do with a make up company? Pitt is linked to Angelina Jolie and the adoption of African babies. There were also rumours of abuse of the children. Clooney is a major PG suspect as is Spielberg. Affleck I can\'t remember too much about but he is certainly a troubled individual. Truaxe also refers to \'so many porn &quot;studios&quot;\' and I\'m not sure what his quotation marks are implying. That the studios are just fronts for something else perhaps? Prostitution? Drugs? It would hardly be surprising but again how does this fit in with his skincare company?</p>
<p>He also pleads with some of his friends to be careful as if he fears for their lives. This could only mean the crimes he refers to are very serious for the people he\'s accusing. He also tags in Richard Branson, another PG suspect as well as Donald Trump. Has he gone to the White House for protection?</p>
<p>My theory on how skincare may be linked to PG is through its use within Hollywood and modelling. Did they find themselves involved in being part of child trafficking where underage kids from around the world were promised acting/modelling stardom but then used for sex? When we discuss these sex trafficking rings its always the big players we focus on but we forget about the people who would also be constantly around. Make up is very important and always needed to be refreshed. On a more sinister note it\'s also useful for covering up bruises.</p>
<p>It is easily dismissed all of this as the man seems to have the right behavioral problems for the public to view him as an incoherent drug addled madman. However if the media jump on this from the angle of ridiculing conspiracy theories it may be worth keeping an eye on.</p>',

           <p>
            I did some research on the tissue brokering industry. Here's what I found out:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Planned Parenthood operates its own fetal tissue harvesting network. How it works is they have tissue technicians placed in every abortion clinic that’s affiliated with them, and these techs are sent email orders from PP and fill whatever ones they can based on what they can collect from their daily scheduled abortions, and then they ship the tissues directly to the buyer through UPS. The buyers pay a 'service fee' in order to avoid legal issues for selling human body parts. [7]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The illegal organ trafficking trade involves a host of offenders. There is a recruiter who seeks out the ‘donor,’ there is a transporter of the organs, there are staff of the hospital or clinic that receives the organs, and of course the medical practitioners who perform the transplants. There are also middlemen, contractors, buyers and the banks that store the organs/tissues. [13]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Kidneys, which are by far the greatest in demand (for organs), are often bought from living donors for as little as a few hundred dollars, and can be sold for as much as $200,000. [13]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The average buyer spends $150,000 (though prices in excess of $200,000 are common) while the average donor gets $5,000. The big profits go the middle men and “organ brokers”. [14]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              A living donor can give a whole kidney, a portion of their liver, lung, intestine or pancreas. Otherwise, the donor must be declared brain dead while circulation and oxygenation remain intact. [14]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There are "broker-friendly" hospitals, complete with surgeons who either don't know or don't care where the organs come from. [14]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Typically a broker will team up with a funeral home director, forging consent forms and a death certificate to harvest human tissue before the body is cremated or buried. [14]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The training required to be qualified to remove organs and tissues from fresh corpses is minimal. [15]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Bones, skin, tendons, and heart valves can be cut out and used to create medical devices that can be sold for profit around the world. [16]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Donated tissue routinely goes to for-profit companies, feeding a billion-dollar industry that uses those tissues for everything from repairing a knee to plumping up a penis. [16]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Overseas and in the US, some companies that profit from human tissue spend considerable resources cultivating sources of fresh bodies. Often, employees of tissue banks are pushed to compete hard with other tissue banks for access to bodies — courting hospitals, funeral homes and morgues. [16]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The demand for tissue grows more intense every year. One tissue buyer summed up the all-out competition for corpses this way: “Whoever has the most bone wins.” [16]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>

              In the US alone, which is the biggest market and the biggest supplier, an estimated two million products derived from human tissue are sold each year, a figure that has doubled over the past decade. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Inadequate safeguards are in place for ensuring that all tissue used by the industry is obtained legally and ethically. In contrast to tightly monitored systems for tracking intact organs such as hearts and lungs, authorities in the US and many other countries have no way to accurately trace where recycled skin and other tissues come from and where they go. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              One of the weaknesses of the tissue-monitoring system is the secrecy and complexity that comes with the cross-border exchange of body parts. The international nature of the industry makes it easy to move products from place to place without much scrutiny. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It's illegal in the US, as in most other countries, to buy or sell human tissue. However, it's permissible to pay service fees that ostensibly cover the costs of finding, storing and processing human tissues. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Ground-level body wranglers in the US can get as much as $US10,000 for each corpse they secure through their contacts at hospitals, mortuaries and morgues. Funeral homes can act as middlemen to identify potential donors. Public hospitals can get paid for the use of tissue-recovery rooms. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Phillip Guyett, who ran a tissue recovery business in several US states before he was convicted of falsifying death records, said executives with companies that bought tissues from him treated him to $US400 meals and swanky hotel stays. They promised: “We can make you a rich man.” It got to the point, he said, that he began looking at the dead “with dollar signs attached to their parts". [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The for-profit companies set up non-profit offshoots to collect the tissue — in much the same way the Red Cross collects blood that's later turned into products by commercial entities. Nobody charges for the tissue itself, which under normal circumstances is freely donated by the dead (via donor registries) or by their families. Rather, tissue banks and other organizations involved in the process receive ill-defined “reasonable payments” to compensate them for obtaining and handling the tissue. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              No centralized regional or global system is in place to assure that products can be followed from donor to patient. [17]
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              About 35 per cent of active registered US tissue banks have no inspection record in the FDA database. The typical tissue bank operates for nearly two years before its first FDA inspection. [17]

            Cosmetic companies are tied to human trafficking. They require constant sources of human tissue to manufacture their products. Tissue brokers make huge $$$ selling tissue from fresh corpses. Very slack regulations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I assume that with all the shake-up going on in Hollyweird with human trafficking networks, the cosmetics companies are losing some of their sources, and might even get fingered.

            Boots Cosmetics [Boots] originated in the UK, merging with Alliance UniChem (pharma, surgical, &amp; medical wholesaler) in the mid 2000's. What I did not realize, is that as of 2014, Walgreen's bought 45% of the company.... Now known as Walgreens Boots Alliance. I've not dug beyond this, but I'm sure there are threads of the web spinning to Lauder &amp;/or other major players. 
These "mergers" are no more than the corrupt elite shuffling their evil slime trails from point A to B. 
I'm in my early 40's &amp; thankfully never bought into the need to wear lots of makeup. However, I've noticed the trend for about a decade of young women heavily painting, contouring, &amp; falsifying their faces with loads of ridiculously expensive makeup. 
The logical connections are all there..  ugh, I feel sick. 🤢

            I think Estee Lauder is looking very dirty in this.  Lauder owns many of the skincare and makeup brands: Tom Ford, La Mer (one small container costs more than $1000), Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Flirt!, M.A.C., Prescriptives, Smashbox, Tom Ford and Tory Burch. Many designers also offer scents and body products exclusively through Estee Lauder. These include Coach, Donna Karan, Ermenegildo Zegna, Kiton, Marni, Michael Kors and Tommy Hilfiger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Estee Lauder quite obviously buys out ANY competition. That is their way of destroying the competition.

              A lot of people are liberals even though it isn't politically correct. The magazine is aimed for women mainly, but, I think it reaches a demographic that may not be privy to pedophelia news.....good thing.

            Isn't Affleck member of the Council of Foreign Relations? This always struck me as being odd. Would have to look it up though to be sure.

             Read years ago that some hollywood insider went to a party where Ben Affleck and Prince William were there naked at the pool...they are the only names I remember....... Dismissed it at the time as surreal.Have not seen Ben's name come up in the outing of actors who are pedophiles.

             I would hazard a guess that this is exactly what Estee Lauder wants--for The Ordinary to shut down.  Lauder can then get back to business as usual, selling $1 products for $250 and the market will be cornered.  I can't help but think that what's happening to Truaxe is what has happened to so many brilliant and wonderful natural health care doctors being suicided.

              I feel sorry for him.  I hope he will be OK.  He seems to think he can bring lawsuits against all of these people at least that is how it seems.  Finding out what may be in there now in the makeup lines is pretty scary.  I don't use Lauder but another line.  Only minimal.

                   I don't give a fuck about this mod petty bull shit.  The presentation of ideas and the dismissal should be done with relevant rebuttals not flippant attacks.  Are any of you lame ass 'anti-shills' going to do any better than the lame ass antifa fags.  The context of this post is about the commodification of the humans and the antics associated.   Why has none of the mods refuted the narrative of Esoteric's post about;

                    I guess I don't understand why you are attacking the mods, here. We know Esoteric is the worst kind of shill. We have two choices, jangles. 1) We can ban him and feed the "Muh mods controlling and censoring another great contributor" meme. 2) We can feed him his own shit ever single time he shows his sorry face and spread awareness about his terrible behavior.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you were a friend of Jenny in real life, and ES manipulated her into getting banned and later possibly killed, wouldn't you want us making his life miserable?

                   <p>
                    Also, this isn't his post. He was sneaking in here trying to blend in with the real child rape investigators.

            Deciem has done something that no other skincare company has ever done.  It's come out from behind the smokescreen to sell only active ingredients at a fraction of the price.  Every other skincare company will make claims if only the active ingredient is 20th on their list of ingredients, The Ordinary of Deciem sells you the active. The average cost of a deciem product is about $15.   I can't help but think that all the other skincare companies are really pissed off at this bold move by Deciem.   Could it be that they see him as such a threat that they are prepared to go after him to shut his business down?

              'Active ingredients' are the ingredients that proven to do the work eg retinol; vitamins e, b c; alpha lipoic acid; argireline; peptides (the list goes on). Up until The Ordinary came along, companies like Estee Lauder could put however little of an active ingredient in a skin care product, tout its benefits, and put any price on it.   For example, Dr Gross's retinol cream is $120+; The Ordinary sells their retinol for $10.  Marula oil is sold by The Ordinary for $18; Drunk Elephant sells exactly the same oil for $72.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Ordinary has won customers with its no-frills, active ingredients-focused, freakishly affordable line of products. When it launched a foundation in 2017, there was a 25,000-person waitlist. The Ordinary puts all its products in the same boring little bottles and each product contains usually one active at  the maximum it's proven to work.  Skincare products containing vitamin c can sell for hundreds; The Ordinary sells pure vitamin c for $5.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's all about gimmicks for skincare companies like Estee Lauder. The Ordinary has been the maverick in the game.
             </p>
             <p>
              I suspect that Estee Lauder didn't like the new kid on the block and saw this was dangerous for the whole scamming skincare industry.  And when you can't beat the threat, you buy it out (it's their MO and it happens everywhere, yes EVERYWHERE).  Estee has bought I think about 28 per cent--not a huge stake, but enough to destroy from within.
             </p>

              Yes, Truaxe seems to have lost the plot.  But how does someone go from being a really smart person to someone doing lots of crazy things?  Something is not right.

              And yes, sheep placentas have been used for decades on skin. La Prairie had a farm on which black sheep were farmed for their placentas.

The clinic still offers this dauntingly expensive treatment – about £18,000 on top of the one-week package – and keeps a flock of black sheep for the purpose. Half of Hollywood, heads of state and the worried wealthy have rolled up over the decades for this, and thanks to the huge profits the process has generated, La Prairie has become vastly more comprehensive.

             I agree that they could be shutting him down, but also that maybe he found out what they have been doing behind his back.  Possibly inserting horrid stuff in the skincare line that would make us Barf.  What their intent was Idk.  They could have thought they could get away with it and hide the ingredients somehow or they wanted to incriminate him and destroy his company and ideas.  I don't think he would go out on a limb saying all these things unless there was a good reason.  He is in Serious Danger.

             I was away the other day on a short car trip and my husband brought out a small coke to the car.  We were both thirsty.  I just sighed, since we don't drink Coke or Pepsi, etc.  But he brought a hot pretzel so I was quiet.  Later it came to me about what I had read about what they put in some foods and drinks.  Stems in Coke,  Barf.

             Exactly what I was thinking. Snatch babies or small children —&gt; “use them up” for their sick desires —&gt; the corpses get used in the skin care products (via liquification —&gt; isolation of relevant product for usage).

               Yes, this has been going on for decades.  La Praire,has its own spa in France where the black sheep are raised to extract the placentas.  All the rich people go there. It costs a fortune for a 'treatment'.   In the 1970s and 1980s many face creams and eye creams contained placenta.

                But is that a cover for use of human cells...since there is enough literature to.show animal.cells.have side effects. Like chronic fafigue and q fever..
I very much doubt the elite.would spend 100,000 dollars and knowingly take on this much publicised risk...
These places could be frints for a black market for the elite demand for human cells...
For example.the diplomat pouches in the form of shipping containers could be used to ship children..and in return for.payment u have the shipping of artwork from.europe...this treatment is banned in the US..
Brings to mind ..the pegasus.museum and the embassy art program

              YES!  This is right up their alley.  Especially that of $teven $.  It reminds me of the horrid thing they did to Heather O and Judith B.  Skin. I will leave it there.
