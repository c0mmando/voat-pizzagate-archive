<p>Here\'s some more stuff on what we have on Graham\'s Samaritan Purse :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As already reported on Voat, Greta Van Susteren gave her name to the &quot;Greta Home and Academy&quot; orphanage located in Leogane, Haiti <a href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/about-the-greta-home-and-academy/">Link to Orphanage website</a> Leogane is a community southwest of Port au Prince on Haiti\'s southwest peninsula. Leogane was hit especially hard in the 2010 earthquake, and Van Susteren\'s orphanage was built soon after the quake. Apparently Van Susteren raised a lot of money for the Haiti cholera epidemic, and maybe for the orphanage?? The Greta Home and Academy is part of the larger &quot;Samaritan\'s Purse&quot; Christian charitable organization. The President and CEO of Samaritan\'s Purse is Franklin Graham, the son of none other than Christian Crusader BILLY GRAHAM</p>
<p>I have done some digging on Van Susteren\'s orphanage in Leogane, Haiti, and came across one potentially important lead. Author and researcher Stephen Lendman wrote a really important article on child trafficking in Haiti, called &quot;Child Slavery in Haiti&quot; <a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2010/02/child-slavery-in-haiti/">link to article</a>. In the article, Lendman talks about Haiti\'s horrible &quot;restavek system,&quot; a century-old system where poor children from mostly rural families, known as restaveks, are sent by their impoverished families to work as servants for wealthy Haitian families in the bigger cities. <strong>These &quot;restaveks&quot;, some as young as 3, in many cases fall victim to physical and sexual abuse, and are kidnapped into child sex trafficking rings</strong>.</p>
<p>Lendman talks extensively about the Laura Silsby trafficking case in Haiti, and discusses how the director of the SOS Children\'s Village in Port-au-Prince said that many of the children Silsby was trafficking came from families and were not in fact orphans, despite Silsby\'s claims. He described how child trafficking increased massively across the board in Haiti after the 2010 quake. Getting back to the restaveks, Lendman cites a report from the Pan American Development Foundation about the restavek system and child trafficking. A really important finding in the report from the Pan American Development Foundation, is that most of restavek child slaves who are trafficked to wealthy families in Port-au-Prince, specifically come from poor families living in &quot;... the southern peninsula communities of Les Cayes, Jacmel, Jeremie, and Leogane&quot; <strong>(location of Greta\'s orphanage).</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a small, single runway airport in Cartersville, Georgia, a tiny airline got an urgent — and unprecedented — call last week: to fly the only two Americans known to have contracted the Ebola virus from West Africa to the U.S. for treatment. The first flight took off from Liberia on Friday, carrying Kent Brantley, a doctor from Texas. On Tuesday, Nancy Writebol, the second patient, arrived at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix Air Group may not be a household name. But the little-known airline specializes in &quot;weird&quot; government assignments, including serving as an air ambulance for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</strong></p>
<p>..According to its website, Phoenix Air owns 85% of the land at the airport in Cartersville (population 19,731), taking up five hangars and two office buildings. Federal records show that the company employs about 150 people and owns 45 aircrafts. Its business with the federal government totaled $46 million in fiscal year 2011, the most recent year that figures were available at fedspending.org.</p>
<p>Other databases with more recent information show the company won contracts in 2013 from the Defense Department, Interior Department, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which operates the CDC. It has also performed aviation services on behalf of the Justice Department and NASA.</p>

            From 'Spook Air' to The 'Lolita Express': The Genesis And Evolution of The Jeffrey Epstein-Bill Clinton Relationship
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Seal was known to use aircraft that belonged to the company Southern Air Transport and he also employed flight crews that worked for that same company. Southern Air Transport,
             <strong>
              formerly Air America
             </strong>
             , was once directly owned by the CIA and today is remembered for being a CIA front during Iran-Contra.
             <strong>
              Less known is the relationship between the CIA-linked airline and Leslie Wexner and his then-close associate Jeffrey Epstein
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Furthermore, Fitrakis noted that in addition to Wexner the other main figures who were key in securing SAT's relocation to Ohio were Alan D. Fiers Jr., a former chief of the CIA Central American Task Force, and retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord, head of air logistics for SAT's covert action in Laos between 1966 and 1968, while the company was still known as Air America. Secord was also the air logistics coordinator in the illegal Contra resupply network for Oliver North during Iran-Contra. Fiers was one of the key individuals involved in Iran-Contra who was later pardoned by George H.W. Bush with the assistance of then-Attorney General Bill Barr. Barr — currently serving as attorney general in the Trump administration, and top of the chain of DOJ command in the investigation of Epstein's death in prison — has refused to recuse himself from the investigation into Epstein's network and his recent death.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite the involvement of these CIA-linked men, as well as the organized crime-linked Leslie Wexner, the then-president of SAT told the Columbus Dispatch that the airline was "no longer connected to the CIA."
            </p>
            <p>
             Notably, it was during this same time that Epstein exerted substantial control over Wexner's finances; and, according to Fitrakis and his extensive reporting on Wexner from this period, it was Epstein who orchestrated logistics for Wexner's business operations, including The Limited. As was revealed in the Arthur Shapiro murder file and in ties between SAT and The Limited, much of The Limited's logistics involved figures and companies connected to organized crime and U.S. intelligence. It is also important to note that SAT was well-known for being a CIA front company prior to the efforts of Wexner et al to bring the airline to Columbus, and that, a few years prior, Epstein himself had previously worked for intelligence-linked figures also involved in Iran-Contra, such as Adnan Khashoggi.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In an exclusive interview, Bob Fitrakis told MintPress that Epstein and Wexner's involvement with SAT's relocation to Ohio had caused suspicion among some prominent state and local officials that the two were working with U.S. intelligence. Fitrakis specifically stated that then-Ohio Inspector General David Strutz and then-Sheriff of Franklin County Earl Smith had personally told him that they believed that both Epstein and Wexner had ties to the CIA. These claims further corroborate what was first reported by Nigel Rosser in the Evening Standard that Epstein had claimed to have worked for the CIA in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fitrakis also told MintPress that Strutz had referred to SAT's route between Hong Kong and Columbus on behalf of Wexner's company The Limited as "the Meyer Lansky run," as he believed that Wexner's association with SAT was related to his ties to elements of organized crime that were connected to the Lansky-created National Crime Syndicate. In addition, Catherine Austin Fitts — the former investment banker and government official, who has extensively investigated the intersection of organized crime, black markets, Wall Street and the government in the U.S. economy — was told by an ex-CIA employee that Wexner was one of five key managers of organized crime cash flows in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             As this series has noted in previous reports, Meyer Lansky was a pioneer of sexual blackmail operations and was deeply connected to both U.S. intelligence and Israel's Mossad. Furthermore, many members of the so-called Mega Group, which Wexner co-founded, had direct ties to the Lansky crime syndicate.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Haaretz also noted that Rich's businesses were "a source of funding for secret financial arrangements" and that "his worldwide offices, according to several reliable sources, frequently served Mossad agents, with his consent." Rich had more direct ties to the Mossad as well. For instance, his foundation — the Rich Foundation — was run by the former Mossad agent Avner Azulay. Rich was also friendly with prominent Israel politicians, including former Prime Ministers Menachem Begin and Ehud Barak, and was a frequent provider of "services" for Israeli intelligence, services he freely volunteered.

            Interesting that the Minnesota police received their training in restraint tactics from the Israelis.

            <h1 id="md-lynn-forester-de-rothschilds-surprising-interest-in-epstein">
             Lynn Forester de Rothschild's surprising interest in Epstein
            </h1>
            <p>
             One major player who has been largely overlooked in bringing Epstein and the Clintons together is Lynn Forester de Rothschild. Notably, Forester de Rothschild has long been connected to neoconservative Reagan era officials — the Lewis Rosenstiel/Roy Cohn network described in Parts 1 and 2 of this series, as well as the Mega Group, which was detailed in Part 3 of this series.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lynn Forester de Rothschild became involved in the world of Democratic Party politics in the late 1970s when she worked on the 1976 campaign of hawkish Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) alongside now-notorious neoconservatives like Elliott Abrams, who would go on to play an important role in the Iran-Contra affair during the Reagan era and later serve in the State Department under Trump. She was also introduced to her second husband, Evelyn de Rothschild, by Henry Kissinger at a Bilderberg conference. Several of the individuals connected to the Mega Group and the Mossad-linked media mogul Robert Maxwell — including Mark Palmer, Max Fisher and John Lehman — were one-time aides or advisers to Henry Kissinger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before marrying into the Rothschild family in 2000, Lynn had previously been married to Andrew Stein, a major figure in New York Democratic politics, with whom she had two sons. Andrew's brother, James Finkelstein, married Cathy Frank, the granddaughter of Lewis Rosenstiel, the mob-linked businessman who ran a sexual blackmail operation exploiting underage boys, as was discussed in Part 1 of this series. Rosenstiel's protege Roy Cohn was the lawyer for Cathy Frank and James Finkelstein and it was at their behest that Cohn attempted to trick a nearly comatose Rosenstiel to into naming Cohn, Frank and Finkelstein the executors and trustees of his estate, valued at $75 million (more than $334 million in today's dollars).
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              According to the New Yorker, Lynn Forester de Rothschild requested "financial help" from none other than Jeffrey Epstein in 1993 during her divorce from Andrew Stein.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as Forester de Rothschild's ties to the Mega Group go, she is currently on the board of directors of Estee Lauder companies, which was founded and is still owned by the family of Ronald Lauder — a member of the Mega Group, a former Reagan official, a family friend of Roy Cohn, and the alleged source of Jeffrey Epstein's now-infamous Austrian passport. In addition, Forester de Rothschild also partnered with Matthew Bronfman — son of Mega Group member Edgar Bronfman and grandson of Samuel Bronfman, who had close ties to Meyer Lansky — in creating the investment advisory firm Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is unclear when Lynn Forester de Rothschild first met Jeffrey Epstein, but she was one of his leading advocates and had the ear of then-President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s, speaking to Clinton specifically about Epstein during her "fifteen seconds of access" with the president and also introducing Epstein to lawyer Alan Dershowitz in 1996..
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1995, Forester de Rothschild, then a member of Clinton's National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council, wrote the following to then-President Clinton:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Dear Mr. President: It was a pleasure to see you recently at Senator Kennedy's house. There was too much to discuss and too little time.
              <strong>
               Using my fifteen seconds of access to discuss Jeffrey Epstein and currency stabilization
              </strong>
              , I neglected to talk to you about a topic near and dear to my heart. Namely, affirmative action and the future."
             </p>

            Thank you for digging into this. Greta arguably played a really instrumental role in covering up the names of a potentially huge number of powerful people in D.C, who themselves were connected to the sex trafficking network of Craig Spence. This makes her current association with Samaritan's Purse undeniably suspicious.
