            One of the things that people never bring up that really bothers me-- the curfew in DC is 9:30 for kids. All these shows start at 10pm and DEFINITELY are not child-friendly. How and why would this place advocate to bring children during their bed time? Why does a pizza shop have no mention of pizza or imagery on it's exterior? Clearly, this a ruse.

            Totally, fuck those guys. That's bullshit. This community would never do that to you. We've had waves of ctr/cf trolls infiltration, but we are pretty good about spotting them and sending them on their way to come back with another screen name. We're all in this together; we got you, fam.

            He does speak on the international cabal like it is some kind of family, like in mafia terms. It's obvious he's heavily connected and isn't afraid to flex those muscles on anyone who would otherwise get in his way. I also thought it was curious when he said, "everything they say about me is true". When he said, "I don't like children", his IG would suggest otherwise, but when I look at him, I feel he, like Justice Scalia reportedly was, is a violent, sadistic pedo, that gets off on the abuse aspect of this on these already unspeakable acts.
           </p>
           <p>
            My gut tells me that he's is an active participant himself, but also the linchpin to the entire network. CPP is obviously an after-hours swingers club for powerful pedos, he's also likely in charge of the logistics behind actually moving the children around. I wouldn't be surprised if he travels to places like Denamark to broker large deals to buyers with deep pockets.

             No problem. When talking to others, or kind of conditioning them for what is to come, I've found it's best to kind of present the information and let them decide if it creeps them out or if they think something nefarious is happening behind the scenes. I saw that because if you immediately hit them with tons of facts, even if it's true, it will seem like you are pushing a partisan agenda of your own. Just my two cents of course.

             Yea, that was somewhat un-related, but since it was "skippy" himself that he called out by name, I saw that in my file, so I decided to add it to the link. Way back then? Saying stuff like that and naming names? Unheard of. Rest his soul, he's a patriot and took his lumps for that. Never forget. Also never forget the attending ME was also KIA as well.

             I realize that now. I finally gave up after several long exchanges. Trying to get people to see the light, but if they are playing some kind of small part in this greater agenda, there is no getting through to them. Presenting known evidence, using logic and reasoning or otherwise. I got carried away and forgot where I was for a second, got a warning from a mod that just said, "multiple rule 10's. You won't get another warning". In contrast, this community is a million times better. Fuck em, can't fix stupid.

            The Kim Noble art at the top of this album was never featured in Comet Ping Pong, and has never been connected to any of the suspects.  The origin of how this art became "connected" to pizzagate was that someone thought the "out of body experience" depicted in a Sasha Lord poster for a Comet event was
            <em>
             reminiscent
            </em>
            of something similar depicted in Kim Noble's art.
