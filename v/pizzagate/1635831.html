            trust is reserved for those loyal to you and to those who have earned it. We all need to have a mind of our own, but sitting here throwing stones at Alex jones is a distraction, he is not the main problem, the global cartel that is enslaving humanity is. I have never heard of cooper and if he is helping the cause more power to him.  I for one know that Alex jones is helping create distrust of the globalists among the masses. The more help we have the better! But he is not perfect, he is human like all of us. If he is disinfo he is doing a bad job of it. He is good for redpilling normies. Cooper has his own audience and circle of influence. To win against the globalist regime we are going to have to get United, it is a massive task to overturn them. They own everything, control everything, even the currency we all use. So this petty nonsense about Alex jones or David seamen or cooper.....who cares? Everyone has the right to their opinion, let's get united, let's respect each other ,and let's expose the globalists! Don't fall for the divide and conquer routine, they have been using it throughout history. We need to be better than that and rise up from petty division.

            yes, the boy in Van San't screen play is a prime candidate for trauma-induced multiple personality disorder or DID as you put (Dissociative Identity Disorder) , which is the same thing. His mother was a stripper and mental patient with a seizure disorder herself,  who abandoned him to be raised by his brother while she was under hospital care ,  so he was raised by his older brother who is possibly really also his father. as the dialogue implies. (so he's possibly the product of incest)  and there are snippets of video where his mother has him dressed in pink girls' clothes as a baby and drops him on the ground when she has a convulsion  ...etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            So the subplot is that the baby was taken away from her, and that the main character Mike Waters may  been some sort of satanic cult-abuse victim from the day that he was born. 
Hence the multiple personality disorder, where he has 'missing time' after dissociating into alter personality. Presumably those are gender-dissociative identities as well, because his narcoleptic attacks often happen when he's about to have sex, and he is hypnotized at one point by a 'handler' who later transports him to Europe. Bear in mind that in the screenplay this was all done on a 12 yr. old.
What no one will tell you in this movie  is that in real life  there is a huge gender-dissociative component to the street 'rent boy' scene.  IF you watch Cops you will see the scenes of trannies constantly being busted by police for either posing as female hookers and getting themselves in trouble, or for working the gay hooker strolls in various cities. Every city has one, an area where men can find gay street prostitution.
For some reason all of this was censored out of the film. But the real life 'Mike Parker' is clearly a gender bender type, its easy to imagine him having worked the stroll in drag, with his full lips and slight build etc. lending themselves well to the transformation.
My Own Private Idaho only 'hints' at it....such as the scene where Mike Waters is dressed as a maid and forced to clean the kitchen for a rich man who clearly gets off on feminizing him into a subservient gender-dissociative role.  All of this presumably when , according to the original screenplay, the young boy is at a crucial time of developing his own sexual maturation and identity (puberty).
So the subplot to the whole film is that Mike Waters is gradually turned into a woman , for all intents and purposes, and by the end he is on his own, completely degraded and then abandoned by the people who created him.
My suspicion is that Gus Van Sant's original director's cut was heavily edited by the production studio before it was released. Probably to remove the  references to gender-dissociation to make it at least a bit more palatable to the general public than it originally was. In fact if they cut as much as I suspect they did, it may have even required a reshoot, to restore it to Hollywood production lenghth. Van Sant hints at this sort of thing in his later film 'Jerry' , which features a full four minutes  straight of two men trudging side by side through mud. 
As though VAn Sant is making a private joke about how he had to use 'filler' to lengthen the film after they cut it to pieces.
I suspect that there is a lot of 'filler' added to My Own Private Idaho for the same reason, but to find it I would have to go back and watch it again. I don't ever want to see it again, truthfully. It is depressing. Possible 'filler' is the silly scene where they have REaves woodenly reciting lines scripted for them and intentionally botched as an amateurish school play, etc. Probably another one of Van Sant's 'protest' gestures to the producers who had restricted his freedom and forced him to cut , reshoot and lengthen the film.  It was like 'ok , if  you want to cut my work to hell, fuck you then. The reshoot version of this is going to be BAD, don't expect me to help out much on this' etc. So Van Sant punishes his financiers by delivering  them  a ham-fisted reshoot

            Also look up "A Jew in Mao's China" and see how the banks installed their own guy to control China's finances. He is the only white "Jew" in the Chinese Communist Party. They had to get the other members to refer to him as "brother" or something instead of "white Jewish foreigner".

            Well if anyone is doubting TPTB created  communist china and Russia the question that occured to me a long time ago and has helped me prod others is:
           </p>
           <p>
            if communism was such a threat and we spent billions on the cold war then why at the same time did we through giving all our jobs to china help another communist country go from a country that had nothing to a super power?  makes no sense unless you start to realize the whole thing was lies and just another way to bleed the masses in the West through cold war spending to stop the red peril and then further finish them off by moving their jobs to china

            I never thought of it that way.  It's such a complex web, but this makes complete sense that they'd use the blacks as a front-man  fall-guy,  considering George Soros and his group owns  North America  (and who knows what other locations), and he funded Black Lives Matter to instil a race war as a distraction to build more hate and destruction.

            They always use someone, or something (country/group...) as a shield to deflect attention from what their doing.

             Exactly. Everyone blamed Mao and by extension the Chinese themselves for the murdereous SHIT-HOLE which has been forced on them.
MEanwhile it was Queen Elizabeth and her feminist milieu, which built China into a superpower slave state with forced abortion since she took the throne in 1953. So you can see there is no racial love lost between these white female dominated oligarchs and the orientals. I suspect that this 'racial feud' may have an incredibly ancient origin to it. Or some mystery which is entirely esoteric and secret , which is so bizarre that no one would ever believe it. What I think is behind all of the persecution and control of the orient is something mainly 'pre-emptive'.. in other words my question is
            </p>
            <p>
             Are they trying to prevent something which is foreseen to happen , which may have happened in the ancient past?
There is something about the Chinese which is so different than most peoples...I suspect there is an untold history behind the origin of the oriental race and the origin of the white race.
Are they hybrid races , with alien genes , battling for control of the planet?
My gut instinct is that feminists intuitively hate orientals because they fear their intelligence, and intuitively favor blacks because they feel superior to them.

           <p>
            My Own Private Idaho was fictional but it was based on a lot of facts, it was like a portrait of the secret underworld of child prostitution. The more you learn about that whole scene in real life, the more realistic that film becomes, and Gus Van Sant based it on real life .
           </p>
           <p>
            The two original actors which VAn Sant was going to use were REAL rent boys who had been on the street for years. The character which River Phoenix played was named 'Mike Waters' in the screen play, but was based partially on the life of the real street hustler Mike Parker, who lives in Portland. The character of Scott was also a 'friend' of Gus Van Sant's. Scott was originally going to play the part later filled by Keanu Reaves.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it is looking like the film had its genesis as sort of a documentary, and then morphed into a Hollywood prospect as gay Hollywood  became interested, so Van Sant had suddenly big-budget backing in hand and went looking for some bigger name actors to fill the roles instead .
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course there were limitations on Gus Van Sant when he made that film , due to the sensitive subject matter of child prostitution. So the transition from documentary to mainstream meant some radical changes .
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, River Phoenix played the role of the 'exploited child prostitute' , ridiculously, at the age of 21, when in the original screenplay is supposed to be 15 or 16, having traveled with his older male pimp for three years, presumably since he was aged 12 or 13.   Due to the sensitivities and public standards of decency present, Van Sant could not make the film that he REALLY wanted to make .
           </p>
           <p>
            To make it true to the screenplay, he would have needed child actors. IF done with child actors it would have been hugely controversial. Especially the scenes where one client has the boy dress in an apron and clean his kitchen for him with a toothbrush, or the scene where the little boy falls in love with his male pimp and says he want to come and sleep with him and kiss him etc. 
When seen in this context you understand how risque that film really was, before the censors got to work mainstreaming it.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if it had been done true to the original theme it would have depicted the boy from age 12 at the start and about age 15 at the end , as the film was supposed to take place over  a couple of years in the boys life .
           </p>
           <p>
            So  maybe the REAL fantasy of Van Sant was to have the boys from 'STand By ME ', basically , in 'My Own Private Idaho.  The younger 15 yr. old  River Phoenix , as he had appeared in Stand By Me was probably gay Gus Van Sants' ideal vision of the main character.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take all the elements from that picture, the fact the boy is underage , orphaned,  is used for rich customers, is moved around all over the place, does not even know who his real father is, etc.,
it ties in closely with what went on in the real life case of The Franklin Coverup. 
In fact Gus VAn Sant admits that 'My  Own Private Idaho' was in fact based on an existing subculture which really did exist in Portland and SEattle. In fact the film cast includes a real male rent boy who had been on the street doing gay sex since he was 14. The boys name is Mike Parker, and there was a 1996 documentary done about him and his involvement with the film in 1996.  Called 'This Road Will Never End'. Parker is interviewed about working with River Phoenix to coach him for realism etc. Mike Parker appeared in My Own Private Idaho as the boy who described being drugged  under a bridge  and anally raped with a wine bottle by some big black dude who had picked him up.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, basically, the film My Own Private Idaho is partially based on real life. There is no rational reason to embellish it to include the son of the mayor , rich people, etc., unless there is some real life element to the sort of thing going on in real life.
The fact that this 'fictional' scenario so closely parallels what really happened with The FRanklin coverup and Boystown and Larry King as documented in Conspiracy of Silence forces you to realize that Gus Van Sant was not spinning wild tales.
Consider too that My Own Private Idaho came out in 1991, and Conspiracy of Silence was not even made until 1995.  So Gus VAn Sant could not possibly have been fictionalizing some sort of 'Troy Boner' fantasy thing from Conspiracy of Silence.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are even strange references to hypnosis and narcolepsy in My Own Private Idaho, so the perversity left no worms unopened. Suggestions of hypnotic mind control and memory erasure
and possible high level blackmail and corruption going on. For example the boy is taken to Rome
by rich shadowy people for undisclosed reasons...or edited reasons. HE's constantly 'coming to' throughout the film after passing out, presumably with his memory wiped of what was done to him.
This is of course evocative of 'recovered memory' syndrome and satanic ritual abuse.
So it looks like Gus let slip something about the use of hypnosis and drugs in these circles. Memory erasure.

             <p>
              another thought I just had and hasten to add here is that
             </p>
             <p>
              Gus Van Sant might have given quite a few people the willies when word got around that he was seriously about to make a semi-documentary on gay child prostitution.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Portland using
              <strong>
               REAL
              </strong>
              rent boys from Portland.
             </p>
             <p>
              "He's WHAT?!!!!???"
             </p>
             <p>
              Then add in the fact that the original screenplay had one of these real  kids being transported to Rome, of all places, and this real kid being sadistically degraded and feminized as a maid for rich people etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imagine for a second what their real motive might have been to offer Gus Van Sant enough money to 'step it up' into a Hollywood film and use famous actors instead, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              They intervened. With deep pockets.
             </p>
             <p>
              Consider what  the net effect, or, rather , * intended* net effect,  of that intervention was.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was intended to make the film a bit of a farce. To sanitize it.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example:
Why is the 'older exploitative pimp' Scott from the screen play instead  cast as **the  same age **as Michael, the adolescent teen rent boy , in the Hollywood version?
             </p>
             <p>
              In other words, maybe Gus VAn Sant was originally going to make a film which some people pretty high in Hollywood did
              <strong>
               not
              </strong>
              want to be made.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was like "uh , wait a minute here....lets see if we can offer you some big money here and make something, uh,...shall we say...'.better'?"
So  the end result was this horrible weird movie 'My Own Private Idaho' , which was heavily censored.
             </p>
             <p>
              you can just imagine the phone calls being made. "oh shit, he can't be serious....look...lets see ...uh huh....so you couldn't talk him out of it...I seee, yeah....well you know, we can work
              <em>
               with
               <em>

              this **one made for him too....but only if he honors the deal, on this one.. yeah. But  he's gotta give up a lotta control. OF course.  Find out what other films he wants to do. Looks like we got a new rising director here, shit..."  Click. Dial tone. Sigh. Pan out to view of LA beach front.

             and they had Larry King sing the 'The Star Spangled Banner' at the Republican National Convention. For a reason.
Think  of it.  Imagine how many high-ups in D.C. would recognize that face, and say. "OMG, its him! The guy who threatened us after they caught us at that party with those little kids going nuts on us when we were all drunk out of our minds!"
So they would know then and there who was in control of everything. 
Or worse , what if they had seen King at satanic rituals where people had been tortured , raped , or killed? Imagine the chill it would put in them to see him singing the anthem. Btw, King is the one who sings the no  'No Fire!' theme song during the Cremation of Care ritual at Bohemian Grove.
It is unmistakeably his voice in the tape of the Cremation of Care ritual.
Combine this with reports of pimps burning the  hell out of hookers all the time . The case of the heated coat hanger whippings in Montreal. The hot curling iron rape in Ottawa. The branded gang insignias on school girls in Los Angeles. Cigarette burns and lighter burns by the black gang in Halifax.  It goes on endlessly . No fire, indeed.
THis is demonic shit going on here. Bill Cosby and Sammy Davis Jr. both played the character of 'The Devil' in two different movies.
Betcha if we look into Haitian voodoo it involves a lot of ritual burnings and things. oh, been there, done that

            Three months ago I would of told you you were a racist moronic retard............now.............yeah your probably right.   You know what this really means?  If we go back to sleep after waking up we are complicit in the rape and murder of millions of kids.   I dont want that responsibility on my shoulders.  But we have to wake up our friends and our familes....but they are sooo damn programmed that it is hard as hell.  But we all must be willing to lose friends and family and be that nag.  We owe the kids at least that.  If your unwilling to even try to wake up your neighbors then what chance have we?

            If you scroll down on this corbett link there is a transcript that lays it all out.  Dr Sutton wrote several books explaining how wall street (the powers behind wall street) funded bolsheviks and hitler.   It was to create controll environments so easier down the road to implement full control.  Transcripts goes onto explain how thesame players were behind Mao.

            TPTB created and contolled most revolutions.   They then drained the workers in the  west first through war and then by taking their resources (money and knowledge) and given it to china and russia.   Through media and govt they continue the hype of how these countries are a threat to drain more money, kill more people and implement more top down control.   Obviously, they also maintain huge stakes in the countries they invest our money.

            I lately came to the realization that at the very top level all the governments are working together.  They play enemy if that is the role given to them, and have no problem sending their people to fight fake wars where the only beneficiaries are those at the top.

             Yes, they play good-cop  bad-cop, and if anyone has kids they know that psychologically speaking this is a really bad way to parent much less  rule over a group.   The end result is that the main agenda gets played.
             <strong>
              All countries play this game.

            </p>
            <p>
             The Reagan-Bush-Clinton was a good-cop  bad-cop  situation and  Cathy O'Brien  accurately  described that in her book Trance-formation of America.
I knew it was global, especially when  Bush and Blair were  unusually close.   The Chilcot Report describes one part of it, but Mossad played them both. Meanwhile,  the inbred idiotic ''Royal"  monarchy  only care about horse races,  money and the children they use while  rewarding  the most vile of citizens with the title of  ''sir''.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, children are a horrific part of this that ties it all together, along with organ harvesting and blood harvesting,  which the mods refuse to acknowledge while deleting every post on that topic.
            </p>
            <p>
             While North America and Central America is focused on a lie about  drug trafficking the children are overlooked.  And the lie about drug trafficking is that   Mexico is  blamed for bringing coke up to USA and Canada is blamed for bringing  Heroine down,  when in fact  CIA-Military supplied it from the middle east --- coke to Mexico  (see Oliver North - Noryega's  released documents)  while  Canada is a school yard victim who does whatever it's told, caught between the UK commonwealth,  France via Quebec, and USA big brother.   Recently Canada has seen a huge Chinese population getting synthetic  heroine from China and flowing it out from Vancouver,  causing the  American CIA-politicians to be a little upset with the competition.    In the end they really only care about the money and destroying the citizens  and it is the ruling power that is destroying the citizens of the world.

             It is 1984 its the boot on the neck of humanity forever and ever.   We cant go back to sleep.  Wake up your friends.   Tell them the truth even if they think your crazy.  If they hear it enough it will begin to leave a doubt in their minds......and if enough of us speak up regardless of the blowback by the sleeping masses.  We will have been some help to humanity.   Damn can we just believe this shit and do nothing?  Are we humans or are we fucking cattle.....I would rather be dead than live in their fucking world one damn year longer......lets push this shit hard hard hard and lets break on through to the other side......Hell they are not that many at the top.....their power only lies in hiding the truth!!!!

            I never heard of it. If this is true, things are becoming even more frightening, because I had researched already several of these claims.
Many are false (like Wall St. financing Hitler), but it indeed seems, they financed the Bolsheviks and made it possible that they could build up the industry adn electrify the country!
Very similar, what we saw since the 1990s with he buildup and the technology transfer to Communist China...
           </p>
           <p>
            What really shocked me, was when I researched JFKs death and the Warren Commission. The same people who invented the "magic bullet"-theory hired Alfred Hitchcock and Gene Wilders to make the anti-German concentration camp movies. The most famous is the Buchenwald movie, with shrunken heads from museums, typus corpses presented as people starved to death!
           </p>
           <p>
            I wondered what had JFK in common with Hitler, if they covered up his murder?
I found three things:
JFK created a new currency, independent from the FED - so he played against the power of the international money masters.
Then he was strictly against Israel's atomic weapon program and he wanted to bring it to the UN ("Vanunu").
And maybe the most important one: JFK held a speech (can be found on Youtube) where he warned not only of secret societies, but he even explained, that they would control big parts of the USA! At that time already!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            So JFK was not a NWO president. He was a patriotic man who wanted that the country was ruled by the people. Just like Hitler. Or like Putin. Or Victor Orban. Or Trump.

            And because this NWO-agenda has no democratic legitmacy, because people want freeedom and self determination, not a world government, these powers need a shadow government. And a shadow government ONLY works, if it can blackmail.

           <p>
            Therefore to me it is becoming clearer and clearer, how all this fits together: Alefantis as a CIA operative? Absurd? Not at all, if all the pieces are put together. It even makes very much sense!
           </p>
           <p>
            It suddenly begins to make sense that Feminism was invented by the CIA and spread by Gloria Steinem.
The Jews from the Frankfurt School were thrown out of Germany - but in the USA they received the full support of the CIA - modern art, just like feminism, pushed by the CIA.

            Ad Trump:
With the knowledge of Kennedy's stance against secret societies.
Who in the USA was a famous politician, who warned of infiltration?
McCarthy.
Who was McCarthy's laywer and right hand?
Roy Cohn!
Now things become interesting: Donald Trumps mentor was?
Roy Cohn!
           </p>
           <p>
            So it seems Trump knows everything about the secret societies, just like JFK did!
           </p>
           <p>
            There is hope for the USA and with the USA for the West. But it all seems to depend sadly on the survival of one man: Donald Trump.

             I did not know this about JFK wanting to separate from the FED. I only knew that Abraham Lincoln was the creator of the "Greenbacks," the US currency that separated the government from the banks at the time. That was during one of America's most prosperous times, I hear.

              To separate from the FED probably is an exaggeration. But he printed government dollars, not issued by the Fed, the international money masters.
Interestingly, what allegedly was the very first action of new president Johnson after JFK was shot? Cancel this order and eliminate the currency.

             Oh snap!  I have been hearing about Trump and Cohn for a week or so on radio and the internet.  Your post really brought it together for me.  Oh my god.  They have to stop Trump or they will likely all be dead in ten years in a world wide Pogrom of revenge.  If it ever builds to a critical mass of Americans that believe this is true...........its going to get very very messy.

              Have you read Governor Jesse Ventura's book, Start the Revolution Without Me?
              <br/>
              It goes over these issues in detail,   and a vid interview between   Governor Ventura and  news announcer  Larry King confirms it  because King new first hand as to what the Governor described in his book, having contact with those people during his journalist days.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another incredible book that I just finished was  Governor Ventura's,  63 Documents the Government  doesn't want You to Read.
             </p>
             <p>
              It forms a full picture of how this is all connected and how this is all happening and that's why Pizzagate is pedogate and must be linked globally, along with the other trafficking links to provide a full understanding about the scope and volume of   what is happening.
             </p>
             <p>
              Governor also talks about child slave trafficking as one of the main money rings.   A picture begins to be painted, one that the western politicians have used propaganda media and lies to hide form the public while hammering us with enough distractions, trust and patriotism  to  trust them to continue  their fake story about taking care of our best interests. 
Patriotism to the politicians has not served our  boys and girls.
              <br/>
              It's time to be a patriot to humanities well-being and clearly these a-holes have no such interest in mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm on the fence about Trump,  but he was definitely the lesser of 2 evils knowing what we now know about the Clinton-Obama-Bush regime.

               Yeah Trump has me nervous....I hope he is the real deal and will expose these bastards for who they really are.  But his mindless support of Israel has me somewhat scared he is a trick.  That he does enough to satisfy the people who are somewhat awake and puts us back asleep.  Maybe arresting some but then acting like it is all over.

                That's my concern too.  I think he can't be serious supporting Mossad!   But USA and the UN,  has always been mossad's  hit man. Not to say that UK and the rest of the countries aren't,  they fall in line by default with enough pressure.
               </p>
               <p>
                And for some  fucking reason the goal is to destroy society!!  It's not as Trump says Globalists want to take over the world,  while he fails to name who these globalists are,  but it is to destroy and genocide as the they did in Africa and as stated on the Georgia Guide Stones and  even on Hindu Shiva records of destruction and purging.
               </p>
               <p>
                This should hopefully be obvious  to any of the deniers at this point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Throwing a small play to the gullible public by arresting some,  but not the big top dogs because they have  diplomatic immunity and will get house arrest at best,  if that.
((as a global people we need to create a platform to repeal diplomatic immunity cause these scum have a license to crime.))
               </p>
               <p>
                Waking the world up  has to start some where and maybe this is that place.
               </p>
               <p>
                While Trump is talking about Globalists taking over the world families are being destroyed, children trafficked,  drugs trafficked,  war-guns trafficked constantly in the name of patriotism, while people are patriotic to the very ones who are destroying us rather than being patriotic to the well-being of the people.

                I'm just thankful Trump got in, because we know our children  would be in a sewage tunnel right now and the adults prepped and   heading to war with Russia,  whereas at least this provides some hope. I'm relieved about that at least.

                 I'm praying that Trump is playing the right cards without uncovering them all at once. He may be very calculated in his plan or he is just another puppet.  We just don't know.

                 Yeah everything seems so precariously balanced.  We cant destroy them without Trump leading and he cant go too fast or he will lose the narrative thread.  Most of our fellow citizens are asleep.  But I was also three months ago so there is hope.   But does Trump even have an interest in doing this?  I am not sure he does completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I really hope he is the real deal......if he is and really pushes hard.  Americans who are awake have to risk themselves also.  We need to do it like the Globalist do.  Top down, bottom up.   Trump can push from the top.   WE need to start pushing from the bottom and if we pull this off just right we will turn them inside and out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our job is to put on pressure on everyone.....push push push and never shut up again.

                  You bring up a good point. There's a great phone interview from Trump about the Twin Towers. He definately did not buy teh official story.
But being in power - even if you want to bring out the truth - he faces so many challenges and already has to fight on so many fronts (bringing middle class jobs back to the USA is already a herculean task; and he additionally fights the fake news media, too).
Can we really expect, that he would open the 9/11 front, if so much of the foreign policy and the stability of the establishment depends on it? At some point he HAS TO decide, not to open a new front.
The same can be said about pizzagate -&gt; pedogate -&gt; the shadow government. Also for Trump a day has only 24 hours.
I think we need to be patient. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

                  One thing that can really make a difference is to stop consuming from the global corporations.  It's a bit tough at first, but can be done.  Amazon, unilever, wikipedia, paypal, apple (if at all possible), netflix for sure, starbucks, the list goes on and on.

            I know this sounds crazy, but I believe it's true.  The first director of the OSS was Bill Donovan, he was sent to China to train Mao's gorillas and set up their first intelligence service.  Mao was responsible for the killing of over 20 million Chinese.  It appears Rockefeller chose Mao because he was leaning towards communism, they didn't need another consumer based society in the world.  They wanted a large, poor, manufacturing base for the worlds products.  At the same time as Mao, there was a politician that was capitalist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rockefeller and Kissinger went to China shortly after Nixon opened China to the west.  It appears they made a deal to move US manufacturing to China.  Once this was agreed,  the US oligarchs moved their companies there first to take advantage of the slave labor.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Corbett or the CorbettReport did a good show on this about a year ago.  China and the New World Order:
           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M1KD7Dnq4s&amp;t=9s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another article, by a man who was paying attention at the time, writes that Nixon was impeached for not going along with Rockefeller's and Kissinger's plans to move US manufacturing to China:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/12/31/us-middle-class-still-suffering-from-rockefeller-kissinger-industrial-transfer-scheme-to-china/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In my mind, how this fits into pizzagate is just that these oligarchs (our and Europes) need a way to control politicians, and pedophilia leads to highly controllable person.  They run nations and create wars as a way of changing the world to fit their needs.  These people are serial mass murderers.

             Thanks to all the comments here.  It's been educational.
            </p>
            <p>
             As soon as anyone describes the people involved the paid detractors come in and format a story to discount the truth, attempting to discount the story and make the truth-tellers look crazy --  using names like conspiracy theorists or  fake news proponents, etc...
  add another war, more inflation and inability to make ends meet,  more addictions and they've gotten away with using the world population as a slave herd of   cattle  for a very long time.

             that article on Kissinger and Rockefeller states that they moved American manufacturing starting in 1973, but they moved a HUGE amount of American  manufacturing to Japan as well about the same time, and they started building up Japan as the heir apparent  in the years immediately after WW2. Sony Corp. put out its first product, the first transistor radio, in 1946, the year after the Allies officially occupied Japan. In other words , Sony and Panasonic  were a front for the Western companies like RCA and Westinghouse and General Electric which wanted to dump America's unions and regulations and move on. Same goes for Detroits auto industry. So at a guess China was needed to secretly supply Japan. I would bet that a lot of things which we bought labeled 'Made in Japan' were subsidized on the backs of China. I would not be surprised to find out that things like paper and rubber and food and copper and things were taken from China to subsidize the growth of Japan and S. Korea and Taiwan etc.

              William Engdahl was talking on phone to James Lilly, the US Chinese Ambassador (who was CIA and 30 year friend of HW Bush) who told him, "If North Korea didn't exist we'd need to create it as a way to keep the Pacific Fleet in the Western Pacific."
             </p>
             <p>
              Engdahl took this as an admission that the CIA created North Korea.  (He also thought Lilly was drinking).

            Agree. Again to state who sponsored Mao, Hitler, Stalin etc. History is not what you think. Who is not a member of these secret societies as even openly attested to by Gingrich. D. Trump and why is everyone trying to stop him.

               Not at all, there are so many people on here who dislike him. He is not perfect by no means, but we need to get more united in order to defeat this evil cabal. If we get reallly united we can accomplish anything maybe even change the world! :)

             worse, all the stories you hear about black pimps whipping white teens with coat hangers, branding them and burning them and moving them from city to city, and yet no one lifted a finger to stop it. it just GREW , so that it moved from essentially where it began, in the American South, to Northern American cities like  New York , and then EXPANDED globally to Canada and Australia and Ireland and England and New Zealand and Germany...The entire WEstern world is listening to hip hop and worshiping pimps....
this is no accident.  The globalists CREATED this. They even supplied the black gangs with their guns , drugs, and probably 'seed girls' from CPS. People don't have a clue how perverted and demented this is. Where  you've actually got British feminist royalty plotting this all out and creating it.  Even helping Jamaician and Haitian gangs to emigrate to Canada and Seattle and Dublin..it defies belief.
ITs so sick no one would believe it. But its actually true, and the fact that no one would even believe it is what makes it even possible for them.
The Queen poses as a frumpy old christian lady once a year with a horse and buggy and a few old ceremonies, but behind the scenes these people are HARDCORE SATANISTS.

              The evil that has been running rampant in his world is so sick it's beyond comprehension for most people. I'm sure you are aware of the stories of her majesty and her slimy husband taking orphans out for picnics and some of the kids never returning. Surviving children have spoken out about the abuse and murder that these two freaks enjoy carrying out on innocent kids. And then there's the mass graves of children that have been found years later in places the queen has ties to. It get physically ill when I have to hear the brainwashed useful idiots fawn over these types of people!

               I saw a video of a naked teen boy climbing out of buckingham palace and falling a few stories. I will try to find the link. Some have said it debunked but never heard the reasoning behind it being debunked.

                I saw that and actually posted that link myself about a week ago. What was really weird was how that was downplayed and the official statement was it was "debunked" simply because no victim turned up for treatment at a hospital! Very strange!

                 these royals remind of the depravity of the roman emperors, like Nero and Caligula. History has a way of repeating it self.
