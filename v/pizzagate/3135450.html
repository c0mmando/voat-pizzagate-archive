April 2, 2019
The ‘Mad Doctor,’ Danielle Roberts, D.O., appears to be practicing family medicine in Plainview, NY.  Plainview is in Nassau County, near Oyster Bay. She is apparently affiliated with Plainview Hospital. Her office address is listed as:</p>
<p>888 Old Country Rd
Plainview, NY 11803
(516) 719-2546
This is the same address as Plainview Hospital, whose board of directors may or may not know she is the notorious Nxivm branding doctor.  Dr. Roberts has 11 years of experience in medicine, and four years of experience in branding women.</p>
<p>The New York State medical licensing board has found nothing wrong with her branding women, and there are evidently no criminal charges against her for her role in DOS.  Yet, when one Googles “Dr. Danielle Roberts,” there are more than a few stories about her and Nxivm on the first page of results. She has become well known for her branding work in DOS.
For those who don’t know – and perhaps are considering her as their family physician – Dr. Roberts was the healer who scarred women – as many as 150 of them  – with her master’s initials.  She did this between 2015 and 2017 – and maybe later. (Maybe she still brands women.)
They were mostly young women. She branded them two inches from their vaginas – in the most sensitive and painful place – the pubis.  As the years roll on and the flesh withers and the person changes from a young woman to matronly to elderly, the scar goes with her.  Every day, or nearly every day, the 150 will look down, and not with pride, and see the mark, the scarring of Keith Raniere. And maybe ask, “How could I have been so stupid, so manipulated and abused?”
It may be possible to re-scar and obscure the initials or get a tattoo over it, so it can’t be read, but the underlying scar will remain. That stays for life.  The 150 will be buried or cremated with that scar on their pubis.</p>
<p>Is Dr. Roberts branded? If she is – did she brand herself or get one of the DOS slaves to do it on her pubis?
For the apologists of Dr. Roberts, I submit that without her, there would have not been DOS branding.  The crazies who thought up DOS entrusted to her the actual implementation of this vile and brutal practice.  She would make it safe. Make sure it did not backfire on Keith (or so they stupidly thought).</p>
<p>Dr. Roberts’ handiwork. She knew she was etching Keith Raniere’s initials – but she chose not to tell the women. Yes, she knew, for she had to draw his initials with the white-hot pen. Yet the women were told it was a symbol of the four elements. Dr. Danielle Roberts was a coconspirator in this lie.</p>
<p>There may have been the blackmail, the collateral, the nude pictures, without Dr. Roberts, but the branding – that was made possible by her. She was the one who knew how to do it.
Lauren Salzman did not know how to brand. Allison didn’t. Cami didn’t. Rosa Laura didn’t know how to safely take a cauterizing pen – white hot and painful – and apply it on the pubic region of a naked woman – in the dark, by candlelight – and how to burn into her flesh with it the initials of Keith Raniere.
And how to make sure it was safe afterward. What to do so it won’t get infected. How to advise the women on topical antibacterial cremes and covering it with bandages till it scarred up good and clear. How to assure them – even as they lay on the branding table – naked and held down by other naked women – readied for the horrific experience of their lives – and assure them that it was going to be safe; that they would get out of this alive.
Here was a doctor performing the operation, Dr. Roberts. That made it safe.  They knew her from Nxivm, knew she was a doctor. She was the one who told them it was safe, as she took the white-hot pen in her hand and etched out slowly and painfully the initials of Keith Raniere.
Today, some 150 women carry the mark of that beast on their person – private and hidden – to be seen by them dressing and undressing. When taking a bath – or during intimate moments. It’s a secret thing, something to hide from lovers or husbands, something to deny to friends who knew of their former association with Nxivm.
“Are you branded?,” someone is bound to ask any woman who was known to once be part of Nxivm.
How do you answer? Do you lie and deny it? Or admit?  “Yes, I have the scar of the monster on me.”</p>
<p>Danielle Roberts at a speaking engagement.
I am quite certain that every one of the 150 will remember Dr. Roberts leaning over them, scarring them, amid the smell of burning flesh and intense pain, and that memory may grow more vivid in time. The 150 won’t likely remember Dr. Roberts kindly. Maybe she did not think up the idea, but she is the one who did it – who applied the pain and told them it was alright.</p>
<p>And no one really knows if this branding, so close to the genitals, might not affect the physical health of the women, as it must their mental health. Yet, Dr. Roberts continues to practice medicine. She goes on practicing. She charges patients and probably makes good money. Maybe, when she is not branding women, she is a good healer. But it’s hard to say, if, whatever the madness that would make her think it was fine to brand women – scores of them – and not think of the consequences – is not a disabling, disqualifying factor in her work.
On the popular website, Vitals.com, which provides information about doctors, she has seven reviews. Six of them mention her role in Nxivm.
<a href="https://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Danielle_Roberts/reviews">https://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Danielle_Roberts/reviews</a></p>
<p>Here are the reviews:
“Dr. Roberts loves to brand women near the genital area with a cauterizing iron. Specializes in extensive surgical procedures without the use of anesthesia. Looking for someone to cause you extreme pain, discomfort, and then film the whole thing? This is your gal!”</p>
<hr />
<p>“Please do your research before visiting Dr. Danielle Roberts. She was in a cult NXIVM and was branding women who asked her to stop but she continued anyway while other women held them down. A complaint has been filed against Dr. Roberts and there will be more to come. The cult leadership has been arrested (5 of them) and the “President” has already taken a plea deal. The founder of the cult has been charged with sex trafficking and production child pron. Please do your homework, I’m sure there are other good doctors in your area you can see without supporting a woman who has done such ‘medicine’.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“This doctor was a NXIVM cult member and is now promoting her own brand of sick cult behavior. She branded women with the initials of the NXIVM cult leader and is obviously unfit mentally to practice as a physician.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“She was a little shaky when forcibly burning Keith Raniere’s initials into fellow cult members. Supposedly good at leather burning as well.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“This doctor was branding women to become sex slaves in that cult NXIUM. NXIUM’s ‘Vanguard’ is that creepy sociopath Keith Raniere. How dumb do you have to be to get sucked into a cult with a repulsive creep like Raniere. Stay away!”</p>
<hr />
<p>“Dr. Danielle Roberts is amazing and perfect. Please do not listen to those other horrible reviews. She is the best and i would never want any other Dr.. I would follow anything She told me.”
**</p>
<p>Would you trust Dr. Roberts with your health care?
Some think it wrong that the general public be advised that she is the doctor who made it possible in the 21st century to brand women as slaves of a man – if you can call him a man.
After all, she was not practicing as a physician when she branded the women.
“What she does in her private time is her own business,” I believe is what one state official said in response to why she did not lose her license. “You don’t need to be a physician to perform scarification [branding].”
Still, wherever she goes – like the brand does on seven score of women – she will be known as Mad Doctor Roberts – who crazily branded, – even if it was in her private time – with the hot iron, without anesthetics, a criminal’s initials on the pubis of what the criminal thought would be his 21st century slaves.
In fairness to Dr. Roberts, she too was one of those slaves, willingly, a slave to Keith Raniere and at the time (and maybe she still does think it), she thought it was right to do what she did.
That, more than vengeance, is the reason to expose Dr. Roberts wherever she goes. Her judgment in at least one thing – branding women – was so monumentally reckless – that patients who might be entrusting their lives in her hands and depend upon her judgment – have the right to know.
Dr. Danielle Roberts thought it was good judgment and morally right and supremely ethical to scar up 150 women. – that’s part of what every patient should know about her when considering using her services for their family health needs.

            It seems to me that if the women were forcibly held down and yelling STOP while the good Dr. Danielle Roberts branded them, there should be some law to protect the innocent victims. Just saying...

            Danielle Roberts DO, is practicing medicine inPort Washington, NY not Plainview. She is not affiliated with any medical groups. Confusion about this might have occurred because on vitals.com she is listed as working in Plainview Hospital.

            called and found out she only applied there and was not working there. 
Instead she's at a wellness center called Port Salt Cave. Her office contact info is

            To be fair to Frank Report he does use the vague terms appears and apparently when discussing her place of employment.

            I called the Plainview hospital Administration offices and talked to a woman who looked up her name on the computer and she stated that Ms. Roberts DID fill out an application but
            <em>
             did not complete the interview process and emphatically stated that she is not employed at the facility
            </em>
            . She seemed quite interested and elated to know that the person applying for that job was the NXIVM brander.
           </p>

            I said the same thing to

             She is clearly in Vitals.com as working at Plainville. There are even some comments to back her up from angry verified patients who don't like what the reviewers have to say about NXIVM. The link is
             <a href="https://www.vitals.com/doctors/Dr_Danielle_Roberts.html">
              here

            </p>
            <p>
             As far as debunking I'll do some more research on this. But check out the vitals.com link and let me know what you think.

              Right. I did look at your link and it does imply that she would be practicing at the hospital, only due to the map that was placed there by Vitals.com, it's looking like a generic website generality. Maybe that is also where FrankReport is basing his research from. I know I should have gotten a name when I spoke to the receptionist but she was quite helpful and accomodating and did not suspect any reason not to believe her.
             </p>
             <p>
              I tried to message Frank on Twitter and I have still received no response, it's kind of odd.

               Frank is weird to say the least, much of his writings swirl around his subconscious issues about NXIVM, he apparently is still working through the anger stage. I don't actually trust him that much.  I've commented on this before. I think he is dead wrong about the Bronfmans. But you have to give him credit on his tireless efforts here. 
He is being sued by Claire Bronfman. I'll read his stuff more closely and look for words like 'appears' 'apparently' as we all should.

               Thank you for doing what you did and I hope the changes I've made and this discussion is ok for the mods.

               Either way what does matter is that they now currently know that she was the NXIVM branding doctor.

            To be fair, nobody probably ever felt it was necessary to make it illegal (or describe it as unethical) to brand consenting adults.   People have dumb stuff done to themselves by doctors all the time.

           <p>
            However, if she knew that these people were brainwashed, and not told what was going to happen, there are probably other charges that would stick.

            , I would love to give this our "Share!" flair, but first we need a link supporting the claim above. Has licensing board reviewed the evidence against her? We should link their ruling here per Rule 2. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit. Then I'll switch the flair. :-)  Thanks!

             This seems to be still investigated? When they looked at it the first time, they said it was ok (see info below), and then they seem to have opened an investigation due to public pressure in late 2018:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Edmondson reportedly filed a complaint about Dr. Roberts with the New York State Department of Health.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               However, “the agency said it would not look into Dr. Roberts because she was not acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.”
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Just days after their first article, the Times reported that, “Officials in New York State plan to review why regulators and others did not act after women involved with a secretive group reported they had been branded with a cauterizing device.”
             </p>
             <p>
              A spokesman for Governor Cuomo told the Times, “The review will also examine whether state officials should now pursue those complaints.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>

            </p>
            <p>
             A more sinister interpretation would be that they opened an investigation, came to the concusion she did nothing wrong, and closed it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frank Report is usually well informed.
            </p>

             could re-write the sentence in question as follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The New York State medical licensing board inititally refused to investigate Dr. Roberts, although one of the branded women filed a complaint. But in late 2018, officials said they would examine whether these complaints should now be pursued.

               <p>
                didnt think charges or having license pulled because of branding woman who consented to it would happen
               </p>
               <p>
                you would think there would be something to nail her with
               </p>
               <p>
                was she paid?
               </p>
               <p>
                does she have a brand too? ( never thought to ask that one )
               </p>
               <p>
                taxes?
               </p>
               <p>
                I dont think she should be able to go on her merry way, although her reputation is crapolla to many

                I havent found a thing on her being looked into
               </p>
               <p>
                also, Sara Bronfman seems to be getting a pass
               </p>
               <p>
                CDAN blind had her not coming back to US because she didnt want to get arrested
               </p>
               <p>
                Is it against the law to brand someone with their permission?
               </p>
               <p>
                was the under aged girls branded?
               </p>
               <p>
                and my favorite...Did Stormy have the brand and covered it with tattoos
               </p>
               <p>
                ( I seriously dont think so, but I in the minority on that one)

                Will have to go through all our stuff

                Did they brand in Mexico?
               </p>
               <p>
                What about charges for those in Mexico?
               </p>
               <p>
                And were the deaths of the two women really suicides?

            Yeah, she’s totally fucked — the entirety should go to ruin for their poor choices. Yesterday was a day for forgiveness and they each chose the wrong path despite. They will reap of their labor in this life and next should there be a place for their spirits to suffer and waste. Their memories will be discarded as vile and of no good purpose but to serve as example for the wicked amongst us who have meaningful potential for salvation
