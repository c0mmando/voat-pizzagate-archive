<p>The Elm Guest House child abuse scandal arose from claims of sexual abuse and the grooming of children by British politicians, at parties for men at the former Elm Guest House near Barnes Common in South West London during the late 1970s and 1980s.
An investigation, Operation Fairbank, which was led by the Metropolitan Police Service, started in late 2012. The investigation was a "scoping exercise" aimed at a "preliminary assessment of the evidence rather than a formal inquiry". Existence of the operation was confirmed on 12 December 2012, after operating in secret for several weeks. A full criminal investigation, Operation Fernbridge, was launched in February 2013 as a result of allegations arising from Operation Fairbank.</p>

            I've recently watched a number of pedo catcher docs in the UK,,, a great one about the special pedo division of scotland yard and a couple on some poor kids working at Buckingham Palace.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I think the mood in the UK is ready to really expose the Elite Pedo network... the Pizzagate crowd need to use all the hard work that's been done exposing these guys in the UK to tie it in with US/DC/Hollywood network.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think Podesta -&gt; Clement Frued -&gt; Madeline Mcann .... ;)
