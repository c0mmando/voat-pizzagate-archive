            NutMeg Sparkles is going to be all over this. Hoping they’ll be a blood diamond or two in it for her. Ugh. She and Ginger will be paid ‘ambassadors’, calling it.

            Very interesting read MB2.  I never understood the Idris appeal either. Mediocre looks + talent.

            Elba was a nobody for years. How many world famous black British actors can you think of? If he was that talented why did it take producers years to notice him and make him a star?
