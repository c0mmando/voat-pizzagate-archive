            Hey guys,
           </p>
           <p>
            Still safe, I don't think this will be a particularly fast-moving case though, still worried about possible arrest and prosecution but will cross that bridge when I come to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as being worried about that I'm not recieving tons of abuse simply because I answered people's request on here and Reddit to do a GoFundMe for my site, worst mistake of my life so many people sent me messages of abuse and now have people doxxing me. Wish if I never did that now an extra added stress to deal with. I wish if I just outright refused now, have people literally leaving comments on my personal freelance page giving mass 1 star reviews and saying I'm trying to scam people.
            <a href="https://www.freeandfearless.org.uk/abuse-ive-received-right-thing/">
             Yea this past 24 hours have been the worst of my life.

            This is a scam BTW, the guy has exposed nothing new about Venables, and is asking for money and promoting his own digital marketing agency, he's been thoroughly exposed as a liar back over on Reddit.

            Currently safe and well, it's breaking all over mainstream news channels in the UK at the moment.

             Hi Richard,
As a UK thing, I'm a little more removed from the happenings by being stateside. But let us never forget these cults run internationally. I will try to digest what you posted and see if I can help.

            Giving this an IMPORTANT flair. OP, if this guy sets up a GoFundMe for legal expenses, please make a post containing all the info here (including comments) so people can make an educated decision whether to support, and I will sticky it for a week to raise awareness.

             The worst mistake I made was doing a GoFundMe, several other redditors requested I start one so I did, jesus the backlash though, I deleted it within hours instantly became about the money even though my original intention was NEVER to get money, it was to raise awareness, I'm still facing arrest and prosecution but now have people doxxing me and sending me tons and tons of abuse.
             <a href="https://www.freeandfearless.org.uk/abuse-ive-received-right-thing/">
              This past 24 hours have been the worst of my life and all for trying to do the right thing.

              That really sucks Rickeo. I'm sorry that happened. One of the shitty things about investigating this stuff is that every single person who has truly exposed these monsters has had that kind of experience. I don't know if it's shills paid to disrupt who drive it, or if there really are that many self-absorbed self-righteous keyboard warriors with such an idealistic view of the world they don't realize there are very real, financially costly consequences for people who actually expose criminals. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help.

            First of all, kudos to Richard (the Redditor) for exposing the child killer. I remember the murder back in the day, and it was heart-breaking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard, I'd suggest to contact Bill Maholey, the filmmaker who has with great persistence looked into child abuse cases in the UK, like Haute Garenne in Jersey or the Westminster cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll need a good lawyer, and, as I already suggested, setting up a GoFundMe Page might help. The British public was outraged when the toddler was killed. Maybe you can get some help from social media savvy people spreading this on FB and Twitter. Also, consider moving in with family and friends for a while. Tell everyone you're not suicidal and would never kill yourself. Good luck and stay safe!

            Dude ... Going down this road it's obviously important to recognize the possibility for Law enforcement (or other) agencies to become involved, especially given the nature of his blogs. More so, considering it concerns allegations and exposure of vip's and political figures in their country of residence.  Becoming a targeted individual isn't some thing one should aspire too (unless you dutifully accept those travails).
           </p>
           <p>
            So i'm a little confused, he did this knowing the judicial consequences, accepted it and continued, what is he actually needing help with ??.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it more that he doesn't want to become another statistic ??.
If that's the case, then that was an assured possibility from the very outset.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best luck to him, now he is certainly an identified and known datum point in their 'system of things'. Personal security, everyday awareness 24/7 and either quit blogging/hope, do nothing/pray or keep doing what he's doing/good luck.

             Dude, if someone thinks they are being targeted for murder and says so, believe them.
            </p>
            <p>
             People treat things on the internet as being too removed from reality... This thing happens everyday. When we glimpse it, we need to react accordingly. God bless.

              I do not under estimate the possibility of anyone being targeted, it is something very real and was not my intention to discredit or disparage him at all, more of way of attempting to understand if he did not realize the potential or more the probability of his actions setting off exactly this type of scenario. Maybe a bit (not naive per say) but ill-prepared and there fore under estimated the very real life consequences of bringing awareness to (potential) criminal/corrupt and immoral behaviour and practices. 
Peace and blessings.

            Thank you for posting this.  This is at the same time a sad story and a warm story.  Sad because this person trying to do good is being persecuted by people in power.  Warm because though he suffered many sad sorrows of being beaten down he has become a kind and helpful adult.  We must find help for him somehow.  Those that are reading if you are from UK please give any suggestions that may be of help to our young man Richard.  Others please if you have any information to pass along please do so.

             <strong>
              Why Child Abuse Cases are Important to me &amp; Why I’ve Decided to Shine a Light on the Subject
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             My name is Richard McKeag and I’m a 27-year-old male. From the outside, I appear like any other ordinary young man in his late twenties but deep down I have a troubling past plagued by a rocky childhood and abuse suffered at the hands of social services and my care workers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Growing up I was just like any happy-go-lucky kid, I was brought up by my grandmother whom to this day, I adore very much. I had three brothers and a sister, I was the eldest of my siblings and contact with them was sparingly thin, as they were brought up by my mum while I lived with my Gran.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I don’t want to get into the ins and outs of why I ended up in care, mainly out of the little respect I still have left for my mother who is still alive. To cut a very long story short, I was removed from my Grandmother’s care at the age of 11, as my mother who had recently had all her children taken from her and placed into the care of the local authority, had a nervous breakdown and moved in with my Gran.
            </p>
            <p>
             Social Services gave my gran an option, kick her daughter out or have me taken out of her care and put into the care of the local authority. My gran refused to make the choice of choosing between her daughter and grandson – a decision I do not hold against her however, social services decided to make the decision for her and removed me from her care and placed me under the care of the local authority and under the subject of a full care order.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             For the most part, my time in care was horrific as I was moved from placement to placement, kids home to kids home and most were worse than the one before.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first children’s home I was in Orchard House in Stockport, was by far the worst Children’s home I have ever been in. Within just a week of being there, I had the then manager of the home, hold me down so another – older child – could beat me up. I was subject to dozens of restraints (if you could call them that) where staff members would sit on my chest or on my back, leaving me unable to breathe.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The manager of this home during the time I was there, was a real nasty piece of work. I re-call on occasions where I’d be sat in the lounge with no slippers on my feet, he’d come walking in and stamp on my feet while yelling aggressively “Why don’t you have any slippers on?”.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a really traumatic time during my short stay at Orchard House and it’s a period of my life that has left me with many psychological and emotional scars today.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The point of me writing this article isn’t to get sympathy and it’s not to slander anyone’s name. This is why I won’t be naming names within this article, I simply want to highlight why many upcoming articles on my site will be covering child abuse and child sex exploitation.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             To say my whole time in the care of the local authority was bad would be a lie. I particularly enjoyed my time at a home called Prospects in North Wales, that helped mold me into the man I’ve become today. Taking out of the equation one staff member who worked there, the other staff were lovely, genuinely caring and made the remainder of my time in care an enjoyable experience.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Unfortunatle this can’t be said for the majority of the homes I was in.
            </p>
            <p>
             While in the following homes:
            </p>
            <p>
             Orchard House Children’s Home – Stockport
            </p>
            <p>
             Country Care Children’s Home – Derbyshire
            </p>
            <p>
             Adventure Care Children’s Home – Derbyshire
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I suffered significant abuse. Whether this is by the staff members assaulting me, throwing feces in my face or being dragged out camping in the middle of winter, braving gale force winds, all because I couldn’t be trusted to live close to local residential areas, as they were scared I’d run away. I’ve been kicked, punched, spat at, called names, physically and emotionally abused. While at other homes there were minor incidents, these are the homes where I experienced significant abuse.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I have since tried to bring legal action against these homes however, I have found it difficult to find any solicitor who will take on the case. Most state that because I didn’t prosecute and involve the police at the time (I didn’t know I could) it would be difficult to do anything now, especially considering so much time has elapsed it will be difficult to prove my claims in a court of law.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I want to make it clear that I HAVE NEVER experienced sexual abuse while in the care system. I have however experienced severe physical and emotional abuse and seen how corrupt the establishment and specifically the government agency that calls themselves Children’s Social Services can be.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Especially since becoming an adult, I have been hounded, abused and treated unfairly by Social Services. They have tried to involve themselves in personal family affairs on the basis that – because I state I experienced abuse when I was younger, it makes me much more likely to be an abuser (by their logic).
            </p>

             It’s a strange situation to be in, to this day I still do not see myself as a victim, which may sound totally contradictory to everything I have written above.  I am a strong believer that life is what you make of it and we should not be determined by our past. As a young child, it was so easy for me to justify to myself, all the abuse I received, by telling myself I was a bad kid. Only now I am older and wiser can I see how flawed that thought process was. I can also come to the sensible conclusion that while my future is indeed what I make it, I can’t deny that the abuse from the past and poor decisions made by social services have negatively impacted my life and continue to cause issues in my life to this very day.
            </p>

             I started free and fearless as I’ve always considered myself a bit of a digital-activist. I’ve always been passionate about international affairs, politics, and local issues. I then stumbled across so much data from people who are claiming to have been abused by people in power, whether this is at the hands of their local authorities, MPs, teachers, children’s homes or other figures who were in a position of trust. The data I came across was gut-wrenching and I felt like I had to try and shine a light on some of these cases. So while Free &amp; Fearless was never a project started to cover this topic, it has none the less become a platform that will be host to this subject and many others like it.#
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I just wanted to give a brief history of my personal past and try and justify to my reader-base, why I am passionate about this subject and will be pursuing it with such a passion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone who would like to stay updated with regular posts and articles made by myself on these issues, should head on over to the Free &amp; Fearless FaceBook Page and give it a LIKE!

             Hi guys,
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of you may have read my posts here on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             in the past, for anyone who knows me or have seen my posts (some were removed by the mods due to reddits rules) then you'll be well aware that I run a blog that exposes VIPs who work in government and entertainment or high profile cases that are involved in paedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             I posted 11 days ago to tell you all about Jon Venables a man who at the age of 10 killed, raped and murdered a 2-year-old boy, he mutiltaed him, poored paint into his eyes, threw rocks at his head, sexually assaulted him and stuck batteries in the two year olds anus and mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was released from prison as an adult in 2010 but given a new identity for the rest of his life. Twice now he has been recalled to prison for downloading and distributing images of children as young as two, the courts keep letting him go free and live in society where he poses a serious risk to the general public and children.
            </p>
            <p>
             I exposed his identity and as such will be arrested, people were skeptical last time I said this but the press have issues this today the Guardian describe my website here perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
             My website was the first website to show on Google search for jon venables new identity, it got that many hits my servers crashed.
            </p>
            <p>
             I specifically mentioned in my article that I knew what I was doing was illegal but I needed to do something to try and ensure this sick pervert wasn't released onto our streets again.
            </p>
            <p>
             My website also exposed Maxine Carr.
            </p>
            <p>
             The guardian article explains my website perfectly without naming it directly.
            </p>
            <p>
             In short guys I'm due to be prosecuted and could face two years in prison for trying to expose paedos and keep the general public safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there's anyone out there who can help me please let me know, I'm scared but eager to do the right thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please keep me in your thoughts, I do not trust the government, they have already blocked my website via alot of UK ISP's. I have also exposed a lot of MPs in the UK for child abuse and paedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             If this account goes dark, please do something, act, share my story and case, I don't want my work to be for nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any and all help and advice would be greatly appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT
            </p>
            <p>
             Forgot to add I started my website as I was abused as a young boy, you can read more here.
            </p>
            <p>
             After I started the site a month or so later mail to my house started going missing, credit cards, government letters, bank letters, all mail I knew I should be getting but didn't turn up. Some mail also seemed to be tampered with.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also made this video about Prince Phillip and his links to Epstein. I shortly recieved a notice from YouTube saying they had a legal complaint and would be removing the video for bullying and harassment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly after that I started to get emails from readers in the UK saying that my website kept saying it was blocked by their ISP.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know I've rustled some feathers as I post a lot about politicans who I have outed as paedophiles as well as some celebrities. I always knew I'd possibly face legal action one day, that's not what scares me, what I'm worried about is because of the abuse I suffered as a young lad, I suffer from depression and have self harmed in the past (not anymore) I am also on anti-depressants, so it's all too easy for the authorities to make it look like I killed myself.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that sounds over paranoid but everything is coming together, I hope I'm wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just let me go on record now and say I'm NOT suicidal in anyway shape or form and would not kill myself.
            </p>

             There is a community on Gab for British people, I have already shared the Guardian article. I dont know the name of your website or yours and I don't know what you can do without exposing yourself. I'm also UK but you will have support in this country as these fucks should not be allowed to have anonymity.

               Thanks, I messaged the op on reddit and he gave it to me. I tried to message  him after his website got pulled but really weirdly, Reddit decided to revoke my account completely without explanation, so I don't know how he fares. Very strange.

            <hr/>
            <p>
             The attorney general’s office has launched an investigation into social media messages which may breach the worldwide legal injunction preventing identification of the convicted child killer Jon Venables.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1993, Venables and his co-defendant, Robert Thompson, were convicted of killing the two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before their release on parole in 2001, Venables and Thompson were given new identities, which are supposed to be protected by a court order.
            </p>
            <p>
             The injunction prevents the media or anyone anywhere in the world publishing photographs of them, information that could lead to their being identified or soliciting such information.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fresh inquiry follows previous prosecutions. Four years ago, two men were given suspended prison sentences for posting images on Facebook and Twitter that purported to reveal recent pictures of Venables and Thompson.
            </p>
            <p>
             Breach of the injunction, which is prosecuted as contempt in the high court, carries a sentence of up to two years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is an offence to publish images of the two killers even if the images are of a completely different person since that would expose innocent individuals to the dangers of an attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             Venables was recalled to prison last month for the second time after he was suspected of having child abuse images on his computer.
            </p>
            <p>
             There appears to have been a proliferation of messages on multiple social media sites recently giving information that might identify Venables.
            </p>
            <p>
             Confirming the new inquiry, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office told the Guardian: “We have received a complaint that the anonymity order has been breached and we are investigating it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Other messages on social media appear to give information that might identify the whereabouts of Maxine Carr, the former girlfriend of the Soham murderer, Ian Huntley.
            </p>
            <p>
             The spokesperson for the attorney general’s office added: “We have not received a complaint that the anonymity order relating to Maxine Carr has been breached. If we do, we will investigate it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Publication of the images has alarmed officials, who fear they may be used to track down individuals who have been granted anonymity by the courts. Those publishing information seem to be aware in some cases that they are defying the law but persist nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a concern that if the latest breaches are not pursued then the practice could spread to undermining the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, under which certain offences no longer need to be disclosed after a set period. About 11 million people have some form of criminal record.
            </p>
            <p>
             The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, published a call for evidence earlier this year to assess the impact of social media on criminal cases and establish whether extra reporting restrictions are needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time, he said: “Our contempt of court laws are designed to prevent trial by media. However, are they able to protect against trials by social media? I am looking for expert evidence on whether the increasing influence and ubiquity of social media is having an impact on criminal trials and, if so, whether the criminal justice system has the tools it needs to manage that risk.”
