            Thanks a lot for this info Toker, and wow, a shipping container operating room. Who would think, but it makes total sense in a war zone... the container ready and fully equipped. By the air handlers do you mean the air supply to the container / tent, or for operating procedures? 'Scuse my ignorance.

            Appreciate you sharing your expertise. It's been suggested that there are operating rooms prepped and ready, the receivers the same, and the bodies instead of going straight to the morgue, take a visit to the hospital en route. I don't have any sources for this, but maybe someone has? I agree it sounds completely nuts, however how else can it be such big business?

            If you're going to spin a yarn you include some elements of truth.  Organs do have a limit on viability.  Anoxia for minutes ends higher brain function.  Viability for other organs can be extended.  Organs that meet the donee biologically are more successful.  If a massive amount of organs are being transplanted there would be a huge increase in sales of anti rejection drugs.  The Cabal would charge an arm &amp; a leg.

            Could someone please look this topic up on the dark web?

Where are these freaking organ harvesting operations done? Where do the transplant operations take place? In an actual hospital? Back alley? I mean how do these organs stay viable? How do they even know b4 hand if they match anyone?
           </p>
           <p>
            And - if someone can let the rest of us know - how does one go about setting a computer up to get onto the dark web.      From what I've heard, you can buy or sell anything there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like we could find out what we need to know.

            Same sort of thing that David Steele says.  These guys have been introduced to us to act as "thought leaders" for truth seeking communities.  What many people don't realise is that it is the research communities on forums such as reddit, 8chan and Voat which are doing the heavy lifting in terms of truth coming to light.  The intelligence community is trying to circumvent the consequences of this truth.  They can't follow and stop all of us.  So, they introduce 'figureheads'... I keep going on about not looking for 'heroes' here.   Revel in one's own autonomy..  That's hugely dangerous to ((them)).

            I interacted at an early stage on Youtube with GW, calling him out on some contradiction in his spiel (I can't remember what now) but his quick response to pacify my comments threw up a red flag for me.  I agree that his work has been interesting and has actually helped to paint a picture for us,  but it has very much kept us looking in one direction...that is Hillary Clinton and the DNC.  The picture is bigger than that.  And George and the others like him are trying to contain and control the narrative.

             I think the bigger picture is a group of loosely organized narcissistic greedy movers &amp; shakers that come and go as they please.  They see  the world as their oyster.  I call them the Cabal.  They know each other well.  Birds of a feather ....

             I had an open mind about him in the beginning. I knew a lot of people were sure he was the real deal, so I gave him a chance. My first and only video to view in this way was when he told us to tweet a certain hashtag, that we would each get at least a million dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also heard that he called a pizzagate reporter (David Seaman) "disinfo". Now, I've been following DS since 2012 and have never heard him spew anything that wasn't factual. So I asked George Webb on Twitter. What has David said that was untrue? Since I heard that Webb was actually affiliated with the CIA, I knew he knew the extreme importance of words. Disinfo is a serious claim and it has a distinct meaning.
            </p>
            <p>
             He wiggled out of it in the slimiest way "oh, I should have said distraction"
            </p>
            <p>
             Meaning he considers disinfo and distraction to be somewhat interchangeable. They are most assuredly not. Not only that, he lied about a fellow reporter and ignored me when I asked him to correct his mistake in the format he made it, in other words, to his thousands not of viewers who saw the video where he made a false and slanderous claim. Instead, he left it as a reply to me on Twitter and never corrected himself properly.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also heard him say that Hillary wasn't actually into the occult. I sent him the interview with Larry Nichols claiming she's been a practicing watch since the 1970s, and Guccifer saying that she's known as the high priest of their satanic cult. Web ignored me.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can't have a truth teller who acts like this. He is a disinfo agent and a distraction operative. And I'm ready for him to go away, have been for many months now.

            Thanks for your thoughts. May I ask, is it correct that there is an hour window for heart transplants, between the passing away of the donor and transplanting to the recipient?  Also, is the heart useless after a shot to the head?

            Where are these freaking organ harvesting operations done? Where do the transplant operations take place? In an actual hospital? Back alley? I mean how do these organs stay viable? How do they even know b4 hand if they match anyone? What about the possibility of rejection of the organ? 
Who has the $$ to pay for these organs? How does coworkers, neighbors, not notice that these freaks are leaving and returning having had unexplained major surgeries?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even prisoners, many are drug users, STD carriers ect... How the hell could they be used as organ donors?
Or are we talking more along the lines of harvested for cannibalism? Vomit!

             I am not a big authority on the medical aspect of organ harvesting, but they are done in hospitals by trained doctors (at least here) and in developed countries.  The set up is a perfect setting with the recipient coming to the organ not visa versa.  Some hospitals have heliports and near transportation.  There is a large payment for organs, and they go of course to only the very rich. I remember reading 50K and up depending on the organ.  Remember seeing the hospital they had on here that was shut down but the machines were still plugged in?  That is perfect for the operation.  There are some like that and then some within well known hospitals and those are for the Very Elite.  This is a big business to make money, so yes they take every precaution for those with big money. I was researching St. Louis, so I can speculate on which hospitals are involved, but will not due to just being plain scared.  This info was passed on to others by someone I was working with, so I hope they are working on it.

               I'm sure they're worth tens of thousands in Hospitals, for organ transplants. People are on waiting lists for years sometimes. I'm sure they're almost priceless on the black market.

                Indeed. Most countries don't have donor / transplant schemes, and if they do, the waiting list is years and they may never have a chance of one.

                Many have the money to purchase on the black market, as evident by the multi million dollar industry it is.

            You foresee the U.S. government giving tacit approval of the Deep State stealing organs from poor people?

           <p>
            Do you live in the US? Here's what happened in LA when the police who beat Rodney King within an inch of his life got acquitted:

            Have you not been paying attention to the Black Lives Matter movement?
           </p>
           <p>
            The perps in this case did something 100000000000x worse than beating up Rodney King, they were stealing organs from poor black people. Do you really think poor black people are going to allow rich white people to steal their organs?

              white, yellow, green, orange, Jewish, Christian, Muslim who cares. Whatever force or people who were using Holman Square and Haiti as organ on the hoof centers aren't going to be able to keep doing that. Maybe they'll go back to Africa and go back to raping those poor black people. But whenever the Truth about organ harvesting comes out all hell's going to break lose. I have a really hard time seeing things go back to business as usual.

             He named Seth Rich's killer based on a report from a HOAX site, Sorcha Faal. This is no smear campaign, it's a wake the f up campaign, and i've been posting about Webb for a long time, it didn't start today.

             He has also said he likes Obama, he states that he is a Zionist (though Dark Math can probably even excuse that one), and at the end of the "OMG we interviewed Seth's family investigator!!!" video from yesterday, he straight up claims Donna Brazille is innocent, didn't do anything wrong. His own (sudden) sidekick had to correct him "I don't think we can make that claim yet".

            <p>
             Now he's blaming Muslims for everything, just as the Podesta/Clinton/Soros cult are wont to do. And y'all demand no proof beyond his word. Because he's got a great track record of telling the truth? Um, no. I'm not sure why.

             He claimed multiple chairs were thrown at the NV convention. Besides claiming he was going to interview Seth Rich's brother, he claimed he was looking at logs which DON'T EXIST. And he's claiming that he has passed info to Wikileaks, in a manner that they don't accept, so this appears to be another wild lie. He also claimed that if we tweet out a certain hashtag, he would find us and we would each get at least a million dollars. He's deleted all those early videos though, as well as all of his Twitter feed up until about a month ago. No reason given. Just makes it hard to track his lies, is all.

So he was drugged, beat up, then calls his lady friend but what, doesn't mention he was just beat up and interrogated? Or if he did mention somehow that information was kept secret?

             Is it really worth scraping through the lies and bullshit to get whatever it is you're getting from Webb? Do you enjoy being caught up in another person's web? A complete stranger who has in the past taken part in pedophile entrapment schemes ("Brownstones") with the CIA? Weren't we doing just fine following our own leads that arose from the evidence? Why believe we need some Knight to take over, is it from laziness? Or frustration since thus far our efforts have amounted to little? This is exactly the opening intel agencies need to infiltrate a movement and suck it dry; see his definition of "School Play".

If you understand the purpose of brownstones, vid cameras to entrap high level fill in the blank why in the world would one advertise on craigslist where any run of the mill perv could show up? There is absolutely no logic to his story at all. Oh wait, you are generic perv, let me turn the camera off/oh wait generic perv don't want you, can you send someone who is important? And he had the choice (according to him) of a child or dominatrix? So george, you had the choice of a child and yet did not report it asap bc you were just doing research? What happened to the child george? He is so phony I'm amazed anyone still gives him any credibility.

But, I also feel that if I don't share this, then I am not warning those who are believing everything he is saying. Also, if what this woman is telling me is true, then there could be other victims out there. I think my record here should show you guys that I'm not a shill.

              Anyway, this woman on Twitter has been telling George Webb to leave her family alone.  Her and I wrote back and forth. I asked her if it was ok to share this and she said yes.

             <p>
              This relates to Pizzagate or pedogate, because many of you use the information that George Webb provides in your own research. I'm sure some of what he says is true. But, I'd be careful after this.

             If he actually named Seths Rich's killer and nothing had happened, then I can practically assure you nothing will. Probably not enough evidence. I do believe George Webb has some good info, but what he said about "old ways" vs. "new ways" is fucked up. And I'm pro death penalty.

            To me he's talking to the Pakistani organ traffickers, having just named their money laundering people.  Is he attempting to use NLP to have people's 'eyes glaze over' as he talks about
            <em>
             the old business
            </em>
            and the
            <em>
             new business
            </em>
            , saying 'no-one will probably listen to this' ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who and what is
            <em>
             the entire network
            </em>
            that he says he 'doesn't want to destroy'?
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, what in the absolute fuck guys? I'm on the fence over GW, but come on... what on earth is this?

             You are all fools, Gw has no real clearance.  He knows this and says what he can. Don't forget this. Those of us whom are not able to disclose more respect his due diligence here.

             He said today that he started this series as a pushback for things that were happening to him personally in Portland. He doesn't have the same motives as us here. His is self preservation.

              Good point Arthur. I caught that but it didn't sink in at the time. Thanks for the pointer. Would that be why he's not interested in Pizzagate? I feel that anyone who has learned what's happening to children would make that their priority. Idk....

               Webb said he couldn't be bothere with PG until somebody has some proof. Really? Yeah, no mountain of circumstantial evidence all pointing at the same thing. He is a joke. Don't forget, he likes Obama and doesn't want Podesta or Hillary to be jailed. That is too much for him. His club will support him no matter what.

               I think he says something about having problems with andrew mccabe, who seemingly wronged him somehow. George  consistently  brings up that $650k mccabe supposedly took  too

                 I take him with a grain of salt. The whole drama today and gumshoe in the last week could be pretend. If it changes something in real life, great, if not, it was a good tv show. Since anyone can contribute it makes me lean toward it being real(ish)

                  I feel the same, not one way or another about anyone unless something changes in real life. I've tried but havent been able to listen to him due to his diction. It makes me feel antsy when he doesn't get to a point or finish a sentence, however I had to go there today !!

                   Agreed, when he says something juicy or insider and doesn't clarify or finish it's pretty frustrating. Then he drones on about blackberries again. And yeah, today's was a showstopper

                    He is on it and a blessing in the citizen effort.  Disregard him if you wish, just don't pass off his efforts as selfish.  You all are pussies for facing this as an anons.

                    It was! However, super strange that that other site released the same killers name on May 24. It's just all weird. And yes!!! The way he drones on and on "yeah... so we've got the blackberries... and we've got the car dealership... and we've got the blackberries.... and we've got the car robberies... and I'm saying to myself "you have George, you have, but no-one else has!!"  Laughing... at least we can do that ; )

                     Haha definitely. As far as that site, i wonder if they were collaborating with him or tipped him off and he looked into it. Maybe there's a bunch of others investigating too. I know it might look like he's larping. Who knows.

                      Smiling! Idk, but he made such a huge thing about 'releasing the name' today like he'd discovered it all by himself. I haven't read that other site but you know I'm going to do that now, to see if they're talking about the same things GW is. As you say who knows. Maybe this week will be a great one! Hey did you see Hanity came back this evening with all guns blazing??! I'm watching it now, he's shooting from the hip at Hilary, DNC, Soros amd the MSM. It's great! Here's the link --

            I agree. That didn't make any sense to me either. In fact it was one of the most absurd statements I've ever heard in my life. It was like saying "Hey guys can we go back to stealing organs from people 18 and up only?".
           </p>
           <p>
            It's fucking bizarre and I've been scratching my head all day. The only thing I can think of is he's being facetious and ironic. He's basically saying "Listen the gigs up, all of it. The organ harvesting story is out there and you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube so don't even try."
           </p>
           <p>
            Make sense? If GW is being facetious then you can't bust his balls for making an inside joke to the Intelligence Community.

             isnt what he is saying that it is better to take organs from prisoners being executed because they got the death sentence than it is to kill children to take their organs ? i dont think he is saying its okay to kill people to harvest their organs but is choosing the lesser of two evils ?

             <p>
              No, he's gone over that already. The murder rate in Chicago is way higher than its peers. GW said that's on purpose, create gang war-fare and they'll "execute" each other for the most part. The rest get's hired out. Who knows. But now that the story's out Rahm Emanuel will have to act and shut down the mass executions in Chiraq.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now just to prove I'm not a shill I suspect GW is only talking about half the problem. I'm sure the Mossad, CIA, ISI and everyone else in the IC was getting in on the action all over the globe. So GW is only ratting out half the perps.
             </p>
             <p>
              The question is who rats out the rest? You up for that job? No? Me neither. :-D I'd rather have a fight with a buzz saw.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I think now that
              <s>
               Luke SkyWalker
              </s>
              Andrew SlowWalker is gone at the FBI the Bureau can go back to what it did before and that's arrest people in the IC that are doing this OUTSIDE of Holman Square and Haiti.
             </p>
             <p>
              And even then the FBI won't go after everyone. So I guess the Deplorable Horde Army will have to take up the torch on that one. If 100,000,000 Deplorable Shit Lords the world over all work together I'm sure they could stop the rest it.

               <p>
                He'll survive. In fact I'd say there is one possible way out for Israel and Mossad here and that's to keep getting George Webb as much notoriety as possible. And what could come next is maybe what they've planned all along "The Jews(tm)" being so brilliant and all.
               </p>
               <p>
                George could run for Congress and very publicly assist the entire effort to clean up this whole mess in front of the American Public. George is very approachable and completely lacking in conceit. The fact he's NOT a rich banker means he could spearhead the charge in restoring Israel's reputation after its imminent 28 days in Alcohol and/or Drug rehab for its roll in 9/11 albeit 2nd fiddle to George H.W. Bush and the CIA/FBI. Obviously there were some Jews like Larry Silverstein who were in on it and should have known better.
               </p>
               <p>
                To rehab the CIA/FBI they just have to clean house and make them wear ankle bracelets for the next 20 years if not forever. But for Israel "The Jews!(tm)" need Jewish heroes not involved in Financial Services and they need them quick.

             I don't think your colorful language (found in other comments here) helps you in any way, but nonetheless, facetious was precisely the word that popped into my head as I watched the video. It's also the word I was groping for in another thread where Webb's comment that he doesn't want to see Podesta go to jail was the hot topic.

             <p>
              Yeah that was sketchy but I think it was like the facetious thing. He was hinting that John Podesta should make a deal with Jeff Sessions so he doesn't have to go to jail.

               I doubt it was that specific, because that is not remotely possible. It's one thing to make a deal when one is accused of certain crimes, but if Podesta was guilty of a fraction of which he is accused, the only deal Sessions could perhaps make is to have the sentence reduced from 200 years to say 150, which wouldn't help him much. I think Webb has a proclivity to speak facetiously, especially as time goes by. Mind you, it's a habit he should probably break.

              I highly doubt they'll be re-opening the organ harvesting business. The gig's up. Soon there will be 100,000,000 then 200,000,000 who know there are groups working within the United States trying to Shanghai poor people and steal their organs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Be honest with yourself for a second. You can't forget all the sordid shit was saw. This is a 90 degree turn in American History. 200,000,000 people aren't going to tolerate the government allowing rich people to steal organs. Forgive me but that's insane to think that knowledge could be swept under the rug.

               I believe 95% of the US and Europe have
               <em>
                no idea
               </em>
               the trade in organ harvesting is even going on. And as it's such big business, I don't think for a nano-second it's going to stop.
              </p>
              <p>
               Are we going to go to visit each war zone to check prisoners bodies for organs missing? Are we going to visit every prison in
               <em>
                the world
               </em>
               to check the same? And this, according to George Webb, is
               <em>
                the business
               </em>
               he's been 300 days
               <em>
                exposing
               </em>
               . And now he tells them he "doesn't want to destroy the entire network", and that the old business of taking prisoners organs is coolio ??

              Webb-splaining. Absolutely priceless. The Mossad send what pretty much to me looks like their best and most kick-ass agent not involved in Brownstone Operations and he risks his life to brick by brick dismantle the entire Potemkin Village of Ass Clowns running the FBI and this is the thanks he gets.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's fucking pathetic. Mossad threw us Deplorable Shit Lords a freebie and you're complaining the Filet Mignon has a hair on it. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Who the fuck else would have taken down the FBI? You tell me you useless fucking cunt. Who the fuck would have done that? You? You're a pathetic piece of panty waste who does and knows nothing.

                 I think we should try to keep the debate civil. We all want the same things after all, even if we disagree about certain subjects which is natural. Lowering the tone doesn't help, as I've said to myself many a time. I'm not perfect. It's hard at times, but we should try not to get personal.
