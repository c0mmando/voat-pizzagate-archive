<p>Police said Kenneth Viggo Albertsen, a 66-year-old living in Chiang Rai province on a retirement visa, is behind a website and Facebook page called “Burmese Border Chicks for Hire” that sold sex with Myanmar women for 6,500 baht (US$200).</p>
<p>The business brought women to meet clients on the Thai side of the border in Mae Sai, and also offered to “guide” men into Myanmar for sex services, police said. &quot; </p>
<p>“He has been operating for at least 10 years,” Colonel Jirabhob Bhuridej, deputy commander of Thailand’s Crime Suppression Police, said.</p>
<p>Police said Albertsen was arrested after arranging for two Myanmar women, aged 25 and 18, to cross into Thailand and meet undercover officers who posed as clients at a hotel in Mae Sai. </p>
<p>He and the two sex workers, plus another Myanmar woman who allegedly helped arrange the meet-up, have been charged with procuring prostitution, which carries up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>The raid comes as Thailand is trying to shake off its reputation as a haven for sex tourists.</p>
<p>Yet while prostitution is technically outlawed in the kingdom, it is largely allowed to operate in plain sight, with huge glitzy “massage parlours” in Bangkok and brothels in towns across the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Bribes and widespread corruption help to insulate the lucrative industry from authorities.</p>
<p>The explosion of social media has also moved much of the business online, helping agents procure women and arrange sex services in the shadows.</p>
<p>Women from neighbouring Myanmar have long been victims of sex trafficking in Thailand, while rights groups have expressed fear that the poor country could be the next stop for sex tourists as it opens up after years of isolation. </p>

            </strong>
            . Otherwise we will have to remove this post.

               So, you are an idiot or a fraud? Stop talking about sex traficking, by elite or non elite. That is not PG even though you attempt to morph it into it. You are a joke and cast out of the circle of the few legit in here. Get thee gone, and regret all your cred going down the tubes so fast. You reached for too much all at once in this thread. It is obvious what you are attempting. You are rejected for conflating sex traficking by elite or anyone at all as pizzagte. Fail. Epic fail. Satanic ritualistic traficking and rape of children as well as torture and murder of children, and organ harvesting. Shut the fuck up about backpage you moron.Im so pissed that a fraud like you had me giving respect for a period of time. Your about as outed as Honeybee at this point. So where do I go to get my FBI criminal complaint form again?

             Isn't this article more geared to proving FB willingly partnered with sex trafficking? I believe that's the point -- not that the sex trafficking was run by elites although it stands to reason it was because everything has to be approved before slicing into their pie.

               Easy mate! 
Right, the women "25 &amp; 18" were the women that aided in his arrest. So over the last 10 years this scum was operating- some john never asked him for " girls " ???????????
Get real!

              Correct!!! That was the point in making the post. The largest social media platform in the world aiding in the sex trafficking of women! 10 years?! That's no accident! How many more? If backpage . Com can run pimps ads ,well so does Facebook. The article says the johns paid $200 - all that $ went to the guy busted, just a drip went to those chicks.
