            AI  Artificial Intelligence has Zampolli as it's CEO.  Also he is connected to Malania Trump in some Escort Service during her modeling career.

            has said that some sites are just fronts and do not really exist only on paper and they are probably a front for their trafficking.  There was a Sustainability site in Haiti that B Clinton and Bill S of Linkin Park were both invested in and

            and I researched it.  Website but no official address and it seemed to us that there was something fishy about pictures of people recycling plastic bottles, etc.  very odd.  So this AI of Zampolli could be another bogus front.

            It seems that Dominica is an important haven for global elite criminals:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Iranian born, Alireza Zibahalat Monfared, became a citizen of Dominica through the “Passport for sale” program
             </strong>
             when he received his passport number R0097918 that was issued on September 4, 2014 to be expired on September 3, 2024. On March 3, 2015 a Diplomatic passport from the Commonwealth of Dominica bearing the number DP0000426 was issued to Monfared. In January 2016, the Head of My Dominica Trade House(MDTH), Monfared was on the run from Malaysian law authorities and he ended up in Dominica. As an International fugitive, Monfared was being harboured in Dominica by Roosevelt Skerrit and Vice President of the West Indies Cricket Board(WICB) and head of the CBI unit, Emmanuel Nanthan for about 6 months while they failed to cooperate with International Law Enforcement officials. On January 12, 2017, Monfared was arrested in the Dominican Republic after a lengthy international manhunt and was extradited to face trial in Iran after extradition through Havana and Moscow. Monfared along with Reza Zarrab and Babak Zanjani were involved in Iran’s biggest-ever corruption scandal, when they embezzled $2.7 billion using the UN Oil Sanctions. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was president of Iran during that time.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family.[24] The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paolo Zampolli is using the island nation of the Dominican Republic as a front in the old Masonic Agnelli Family business of running a secret international network of Luciferians, Mafia, SS, Nazis, Fascists, Mercenaries, Criminals, Prostitution and Pedophile rings for the Knights of Malta, CIA, and a Demonic New World Order.

             Yeah, I made that comment last year. Thanks for the cred.

             ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family.[24] The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paolo Zampolli is using the island nation of the Dominican Republic as a front in the old Masonic Agnelli Family business of running a secret international network of Luciferians, Mafia, SS, Nazis, Fascists, Mercenaries, Criminals, Prostitution and Pedophile rings for the Knights of Malta, CIA, and a Demonic New World Order.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the age of 13, Ivanka Trump signed on with the new look department of Elite Model Management - under the tutelage of John Casablancas.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction. Now, very few if any tie these two figures together in the inner circle of Donald Drumpf, Bill and Hilary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             He brought Melania out of Milan, Italy to New York where his front, ID Models, paid her rent. A Slovenian magazine, Suzy, investigated Melania and Zampolli. Their conclusion was Zampolli was a pimp, and she was a Zampolli executive “WHORE.”

            I pulled up their website unkids.org and it is not even operational.  There are no links, just a picture of 4 kids with their mouths wide open!  Yes, this deserves much more attention and investigation.

            Very interesting.  I missed that.  Looking more and more relevant to your previous submission on the United Nations.
