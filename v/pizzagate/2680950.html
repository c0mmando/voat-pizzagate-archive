            KEY DETAIL
Mr. Bennett was 7 when he was cast in “The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,” a 2004 film Ms. Argento directed, starred in and helped write.
The script, based on a book by the pseudonymous writer JT LeRoy, depicts the grim relationship between a drug-addicted prostitute played by Ms. Argento and her son, played by Mr. Bennett and two other young actors. Ms. Argento’s character dresses her son as a girl to lure men, and the boy is ultimately raped. ANYONE on vote who pays for cable is a conflicted person. CANCEL CABLE NOW. Stop feeding these monsters.

              Canceling cable is boycott, not censorship. There is no art involved anyway. Its glamourous pornography. But its more the leftist propaganda that makes it absurd to pay for. And the degeneracy thrill is a bad habit too. Art is an excuse now. Child porn as "Art". Just pull your dick out and call it performance art. Child sacrifice is performance art. Just ask marque de sade. Comedy is not art either, its craft. As to what if any "art" should be ilegal? Tough question given whats considered art now. Some might think a snuff film is art. What if a person agrees to be the victim? Does it go from crime to legal torture porn snuff film art? All cable is mind rot propaganda in varying degrees. Absurd to pay for it. Im thinking of marginalizing it, not making it illegal. I think the NFL should be boycotted the same as the players boycott the anthem. What expressions should be ilegal if any? All actions are expression, is all expression art? I dont think so. Some might say yes. One mans degeneracy and crime is anothers artistic pleasure. I guess we can settle all of this on the battlefield in a civil war. The victor will decide. There was a happy medium of porography vs art or as art until the degerates came after the kids. If a comedian jokes about raping kids like Gunn did and someone beats him bloody, I wont protest, id lean toward him deserving it. If someone kills him in the act of raping children I say hero to the killer, some would say the pedo is a martyr.

            <p>
             A 17 year old drank to the point he couldn't fight off the advances of a 90 pound actress yet still inexplicably had a totally inrelated errection the woman took advantage of...
            </p>
            <p>
             Or a 17 year old actor/musician who has probably been fucking since he was 13 (I am neither and still managed to get it in by then) saw a payday?
            </p>
            <p>
             Idk if you don't understand vaginal intercourse or human biology but I will gladly explain the latter.

            Someone here did a post a short time ago on the dubious claims of Argento, Rowan, and other Weinstein accusers. Speak up who ever you are. Would love to hear your take on this.

              Comments like yours are one of the main reasons that male victims of sexual assault don't report the crime to the police. It doesn't matter how good looking the rapist is, or that he was able to get an erection - he was underage and the experience has had a negative impact on his life.

               No it isn't, but I think if it wasn't hush money he would of kept the figure higher. Hopefully  if he does he isn't bringing their craziness with him.
