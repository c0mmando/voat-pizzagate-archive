            Well said.  Is there anything in our history, that we could use as an example, as to the 'light on the subject', where we did make the climate so uninviting?  If so, that could be used to describe and plan it.

            I agree with you yet disagree at the same time. One person will not ever be able to fix this. But check out the background of all the people that Trump has appointed to his cabinet- the info isn't in your face, you have to really dig, but quote a few of them have backgrounds in going after pedos. You really achieve a sense of hope once you start looking into the backgrounds of these people...of which of course the media doesn't report on. Trump
            <em>
             does
            </em>
            have an agenda. And it isn't the shitty kind of agenda that we are used to hearing about.

             I agree that his cabinet is promising.  And one good about a crooked MSM, is everything they do, just makes Trump and us more motivated.  I do agree, though, that he's going to need an alternate media source that constantly puts out the TRUTH, to counter them.  IF all the alternative outlets aren't shut out and censored.

            That he publicaly says he can advise Trump while blabbing this stuff pubicly, is contradictory.and not real smart.

             Same here!  Thanks for all the details.   And doesn't it seem kind of shady that a CIA (former or not) would come out accusing the FBI so heavily?  We know the FBI has had to be extra cautious in giving us any direction.  But they at least have done that for us, which is a huge risk for them.
