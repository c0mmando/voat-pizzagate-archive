The initiative seeks to galvanize international action against extremism through the forging of international, intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation.

<p>To probably no one’s great surprise, Haiti is one of the countries where DynCorp has contracts from the USG to not only train and support the Haitian National Police force (HNP) but also DynCorp is a key player in providing international officers to serve in the <strong>U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)</strong>. In addition, DynCorp affiliates provide corrections advisors for training and support of prison workers. .. More recently, <strong>DynCorp acquired the high-powered firm Casals and Associates Inc.</strong> who have also received US government contracts in Africa and Latin America and as well as the Caribbean. .. <strong>Casals and Associates have been awarded another major contract worth estimated at $500 million in partnership with USAID.

<p>Smith’s husband has between $250,000 and $500,0000 invested in Abbott, which marketed OxyContin until 2002. The painkiller has been blamed for escalating the addiction crisis that has left more than 340,000 Americans dead since 2000. But Archie Smith only acquired the stock last year, well after Abbott Labs quit marketing OxyContin and had divested it’s involvement with the painkiller Vicodin in 2013. <strong>He received the stock when Abbott took over Minnesota-based St. Jude Medical Center last year</strong>, which he had initially invested in, Smith’s campaign said. </p>

              Today Dynport is owned by CSRA
             </strong>
             . CSRA headquarters is located about a 10 minute drive from Dyncorp International headquarters. Curiously enough, Dyncorp's parent company Delta Tucker Holdings LLC is literally next door to CSRA in Falls Church, Virginia.

            To probably no one’s great surprise, Haiti is one of the countries where DynCorp has contracts from the USG to not only train and support the Haitian National Police force (HNP) but also DynCorp is a key player in providing international officers to serve in the
            <strong>
             U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)
            </strong>
            . In addition, DynCorp affiliates provide corrections advisors for training and support of prison workers. .. More recently,
            <strong>
             DynCorp acquired the high-powered firm Casals and Associates Inc.
            </strong>
            who have also received US government contracts in Africa and Latin America and as well as the Caribbean. ..
            <strong>
             Casals and Associates have been awarded another major contract worth estimated at $500 million in partnership with USAID. The firm works to support USAID in international legal matters.

             Smith’s husband has between $250,000 and $500,0000 invested in Abbott, which marketed OxyContin until 2002. The painkiller has been blamed for escalating the addiction crisis that has left more than 340,000 Americans dead since 2000. But Archie Smith only acquired the stock last year, well after Abbott Labs quit marketing OxyContin and had divested it’s involvement with the painkiller Vicodin in 2013.
             <strong>
              He received the stock when Abbott took over Minnesota-based St. Jude Medical Center last year

            From what I will "guestimate" is; there are actively two groups involved with the high-level abductions and grooming, with a third group related to the families. 1st group looks for adepts to train. 2nd group finds them in the wild and activates those that have gone astray. 3rd group may be helping adepts as either a means of infiltration of 1 and 2, or as a cure neo/agent smith style.
           </p>
           <p>
            And throughout it all, ex program leaders and intel people previously associated with the programs often find in-the-wild adepts and start working them for their own gain.
           </p>
           <p>
            To repeat "guestimate"...

            Abbott Lab located in Chicago? Where Rahm Emanuel stole the election to be mayor? Low in the polls, then voila ...like Natanyahoo. Electronic voting machines place the dark ones in key positions. Rahm , who's father blew up buses in Israel...duel citizenship. ..while we were supposedly fighting the war on terror? A Vanity Fair article about him stated , as Obomba's chief of staff, he had a small device on his desk so that he could see every step Obomba took.

            'International action against extremism'? Sponsored by Erdogan of all people?

           <p>
            Erdogan has transformed Turkey to an almost Islamist state. Years ago, he used to say that democracy was only a tool to get to power, and transform the country according to Islamic law. Everybody laughed, and didn't take it seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then people stopped laughing, after he did his first reforms. He tried to lower the age of consent IIRC, but had to retract the bill after many Turks complained.

             Yeah, but I think the extremism they are talking about is Western white people not tolerating their muslim hordes. Pointing his finger at Greece while threatening to take Cyprus for the natural gas in the Leviathan field. Multilateralism sounds way to much like multiculturism to me.

             Democracy means 51% decide, and half of people are below average intelligence, and women are 51% of electorate. Quite obviously it is a means to power, exploited by the only group with the political and media influence to do so: the Jews.

             Erdogan is probably the greatest world leader alive.

             ASTAR Air Cargo was an American cargo airline based in Miami, Florida, USA. It operated regularly scheduled cargo charter services to as many as 34 US airports and nine international airports on behalf of
             <strong>
              DHL
             </strong>
             , as well as worldwide charter freight services. It provided air freight services to six domestic and foreign locations for the
             <strong>
              United States Department of Defense
             </strong>
             . Its main base was Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Kentucky, with hubs at Miami International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its two target customers continue to be DHL Worldwide Express and the United States Air Force.
            </p>
            <p>
             On May 28, 2008, DHL announced the plan to terminate its business relationship with ASTAR by outsourcing the air transportation to its competitor UPS. In May 2009 DHL terminated their plan to outsource to UPS and ASTAR continued operating out of DHL's CVG facility.
