<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Commerce Department official Lola Gulomova, who previously worked for NASA and the World Bank, was killed on Friday in an apparent murder-suicide in Washington, D.C., local officials say. The suspect was identified as her husband.</p>

<p>The incident happened at about 9:25 a.m. when officers responded to the 4300 block of Windom Place, Northwest, for a welfare check, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. When officers arrived, they gained entry to the residence and observed a man with a handgun</p>
<p>“Officers heard a gunshot then found the adult male suffering from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound,” police said in a statement. “An unconscious and unresponsive adult female was also found inside the residence suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.”</p>
<p>Gulomova, who was 45 years old, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her husband, 51-year-old Jason Rieff, was rushed to an area hospital where he was also pronounced dead, according to police. The couple had two children but they were not at home at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p>“Preliminary investigation by detectives from the Homicide Branch suggest that Ms. Gulomova’s death is a homicide and Mr. Rieff’s death is a suicide,” police said. “The investigation also revealed that this incident is domestic in nature.”</p>
<p>Javlon Vakhabov, the Uzbek Ambassador to the United States, said he was “absolutely shocked” by the news.</p>
<p>“We lost a true friend of Uzbekistan. My deepest sympathies to her close ones,” he said. “Have met her last
week at the [embassy]. She was supposed to leave for Tashkent [on Saturday] to lead [the] first ever trade mission to Uzbekistan.”</p>
<p>... Gulomova joined the U.S. Commerce Department in 2008 and worked at diplomatic posts in Guangzhou, China; Taipei, Taiwan; and New Delhi, India. She covered major sectors such as civil aviation, energy, and foreign investment in the U.S. While working in India, she supported numerous high-level visits, including a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama in November 2010.</p>

<p>Trade mission to Uzbekistan? Could there be something about that? Doesn\'t sound like it, but you never know. But look at that list of countries. </p>
<p>Didn\'t our POTUS talk about NASA and the moon landing? Said they should be thinking about Mars or some such sentiment. I think Q made mention of something about NASA also. Will try to find them.</p>',

            What happens in D.C. stays in D.C. The District of Columbia police force ultimately answers to Congress. D.C. is not in a state. Remember the controlled pizzagate investigation? Police Chief Newsome?
           </p>

            "This is a news release from the Washington Metropolitan Police Dept., provided verbatim.
           </p>
           <p>
            Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Department’s Homicide Branch are investigating a homicide and a suicide that occurred on Friday, June 7, 2019, inside of a residence, in the 4300 block of Windom Place, Northwest.
           </p>
           <p>
            At approximately 9:25 am, members of the Second District responded to the listed location for a check on the welfare. Upon arrival, members gained entry to a residence at the listed location and observed an adult male with a handgun. Officers heard a gunshot then found the adult male suffering from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. An unconscious and unresponsive adult female was also found inside the residence suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.

            DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded to the scene and found that the female victim displayed no signs consistent with life and remained on the scene until transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The male was transported to an area hospital. After all life-saving efforts failed, he was pronounced dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            The male decedent has been identified as 51 year-old Jason Rieff, of Northwest, DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            The female decedent has been identified as 45 year-old Lola Gulomova, of Northwest, DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Preliminary investigation by detectives from the Homicide Branch suggest that Ms. Gulomova’s death is a homicide and Mr. Rieff’s death is a suicide. The investigation also revealed that this incident is domestic in nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exact cause and manner of death will be determined pending an autopsy to be conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner."

Officers heard a gunshot then found the adult male suffering from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. An unconscious and unresponsive adult female was also found inside the residence suffering from multiple gunshot wounds."

              I think your post is very relevant. Pizzagate is a PART of the bigger picture. Child, organ and drug trafficking are the foundational economic engine for the globalist economy. It keeps them in power to do other things...like technology transfers.

               I completely agree. Not sure I can invest that much time in finding an acceptable reason, but it's up. People are seeing it. They can determine for themselves and do more digging if they wish.

            is correct. We need evidence of a connection to the abuse of kids by the global elite. Do we have any past pattern of pizzagate at NASA or World Bank? Links to previous posts on either would be enough to leave this up IMO. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Thanks!

            Sorry, are we looking into each death that has not been ruled to be a death by natural causes now - ´ really don't see any Pizzagate relevance here in this case. Maybe better post to

                   I've done initial investigation and this is indeed a rabbit hole. My instinct told me it was and it is. Whether or not I have the time to dig into where the rabbit hole goes, I don't know, but I will add an update so that others can pick up on the lead if they want to.

                     Don't know the accounts you're referring to, but I would trust you would know if they were legitimate or not.

                     Have no idea what's going on. I did remember a posting about how the owner of this site fought TPTB by refusing to take down posts, but then this other stuff happens. Not sure. All I know is that if someone was a moderator that it would make no sense for them to insult a new member and to encourage a cohort to bully and, further, for that cohort to tag other bullies to join in on the bullying. It would seem they would try to defuse a situation and not actively encourage such behavior, but that's me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Don't know why they would keep someone like that around. Sometimes it's a moderator with privilege reason. Sometimes it's just that the person has proven themselves ''helpful'' and they overlook a lot of ''non-helpful'' issues. Other times, some head honcho just vibes with them and they're allowed to do anything they want. The only thing that's disturbing is that this if for the children and to get our country back out of the control of an elite cabal filled with pedos. This drama is a complete distraction from exposing this cabal and that's why it's so reprehensible.

               I think maybe she shouldn't be calling people "pedophile enablers" for starters. She really does have a big mouth. You will agree on that, won't you?
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not sure if another member should question whether a post should be under a subverse. I'd have to think about it. I do feel members should be able to ask questions ... definitely. As to what she has to do with it, the background given ticks all the boxes of someone being involved in pizzagate ... including the link I just posted about Uzbekistan, the country where she was to host a trade summit, being one of the purveyors and violates of children for sex trafficking. That is a huge connection do you not think? Because if you don't, I might remind you that everyone thought it a big deal when Podesta hosted summits. The same with all the rest of the crew.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of other connections, as I said in the OP, that I was posting it because it ticked the boxes and that I would try to go digging for additional information. It's what I did with the Linda Collins-Smith post. While I looked
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Vindator">
                @Vindator
               </a>
               flared it with an accuracy query and I had no problem with that. I fully understood and was prepared for it to be taken down or left up with the flair. So if this .... this
               <s>
                rude
               </s>
               <s>
                skank
               </s>
               person said something along those lines and asked
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Vindicator">
                @Vindicator
               </a>
               to get involved in the flair ... again no problem.
              </p>
              <p>
               And now that I've had time to think, no, I don't think an OP owes an explanation to a member about what subverse they put a post in. IF the post doesn't belong there, it's a moderator's job. So the member certainly can tag them if they wish.

                I think it is appropriate to call someone 'pedo enabler' who says it's ok to employ pedos as long as you don't socialize with them after work.
               </p>
               <p>
                And regarding your post - it is clearly forum sliding, and has nothing to do with Pizzagate, judging from what you wrote in your OP.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have covered all major institutions in our Pizzagate research. They all have incredibly high numbers of employees. If we start digging up newspaper articles about every person who worked for them and died, we'll end up with a cluttered thread, where the really relevant post get buried.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your post f.i. pushed the posts about the arrest of 'Dr Pizza' down the thread.

            the moon could be a stopping point on the way to mars:  pick up additional supplies, fuel etc.  (I thought someone mentioned this earlier following potus' tweet, but it wasn't there.)

               You know what? At this point I'll believe anything.
              </p>
              <p>
               What was that movie? With Schwarzeface? Total Recall? Weren't they on Mars?
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know what's up with that. The whole subject is something I'd never understand either. Since I don't think we were on the moon, it stands to reason I wouldn't think we'd be on Mars either. As for an artificial satellite, artificial in what sense? Things collide, and if a chunk were big enough, it could orbit. I mean, that's the Big Bang Theory, no?
              </p>
              <p>
               So you may well be right. I'll hazard a guess and just think he's preparing us to find out we didn't go anywhere and that everything has been a farce. Think about it. If PedoWood did help in the Orson Welles War of the Worlds prank, they would have major clout, no? I mean, blackmail up the wahoos bejeezes for days. So I'm thinking they went the propaganda route for a one-hundred-year Get out of jail free card for being a perv.
