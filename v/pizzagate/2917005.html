<p>The series, Baby, which begins streaming Friday (trailer below), is described as exploring “the unseen lives of Roman high schoolers. Loosely inspired by a true story, the series follows a group of Parioli teenagers as they defy society in their search for identity and independence against the backdrop of forbidden love, family pressures, and shared secrets.”</p>
<p>But the organization claims the eight-episode show “portrays a group of teenagers entering into prostitution as a glamorized ‘coming-of-age’ story” and notes that in the real-life scandal that Baby is based on, “the mother of one of the teenagers was arrested for sex trafficking.”</p>

<p>The video-streaming service is planning to release an eight-part drama loosely based on the \'Baby Squillo\' teen prostitution scandal that rocked an affluent Rome neighborhood five years ago. </p>
<p>The 2013 scandal implicated businessmen, police officers and politicians, including the husband of Benito Mussolini\'s granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini.</p>
<p>Mauro Floriani was one of 20 men accused of having sex with teenage schoolgirls who were selling themselves for sex to fund their designer shopping trips. The prostitution racket was made up of girls between the ages of 14 and 16. </p>
<p>The former financial police officer received a suspended one-year jail sentence after pleading guilty and was ordered to pay a fine.</p>
<p>The National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) said the series is glorifying underage prostitution.</p>
<p>If Netflix executives care more about ending sexual exploitation in this #MeToo moment than about profiting from sexually exploitative themes, they will cancel production of this show immediately,\' NCOSE Vice President Lisa Thompson wrote in a letter to Netflix, according to Deadline.</p>
<p>To turn around and produce a show that glorifies the sex trafficking of minors and dub it \'edgy entertainment\' is the height of hypocrisy,\' she said. \'There are no \'baby prostitutes\' – only sexually abused, exploited and raped children.\' </p>

<p>The true story caused a huge scandal in Italy.</p>
<p>The real life scandal, dubbed the ‘Baby Squillo’ scandal (which roughly translates to baby prostitute) was uncovered in 2013 when a 14-year-old and 15-year-old from Rome’s wealthy Parioli district were found to be at the centre of an underage prostitution ring.</p>
<p>According to Italian media reports from 2013, the two girls – who were referred to by pseudonyms Angela and Agnese – started after they searched ‘easy money’ on Google. They wanted to be independent and buy luxury goods.</p>
<p>They followed an ad which led them to their future pimps: Mirko Ieni and military officer Nunzio Pizzacella.</p>
<p>Ieni rented an apartment where the girls would meet clients after school.</p>
<p>The younger girl’s mother became involved in the ring, with Agnese providing money to help pay for household bills.</p>
<p>In a horrifying phone call wiretapped by police, Agnese pleads with her mother that she is unable to work because she needs to catch up on schoolwork and does not feel well.</p>
<p>After telling her daughter she needed to work because she was short of money, the mother offers her suggestions including how she could study for a few hours before or after work or that she could work alternate days.</p>
<p>The Italian Insider reported that Agnese’s mother was sentenced to six years in prison and stripped of all parental rights.</p>
<p>The ring was discovered when the mother of the other girl, Angela, became suspicious of her daughter’s increased income and called police.</p>
<p>High profile clients – including businessmen, police, UN staff members and government officials – contributed to huge media sensation and public interest throughout Italy.</p>
<p>A list of 50 clients included police officer Mauro Floriani, the husband of Alessandra Mussolini – a far-right politician and granddaughter of fascist leader Benito Mussolini</p>
<p>While prostitution is legal in Italy, the legal age for sex is 18. Police believe the clients were well aware of the girls were underage.</p>
<p>Multiple clients received fines and prison sentences. Ieni was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Pizzacalla to seven.</p>
