<p>&quot;In clear weather south of Tokyo Bay in the early hours of June 17&quot; the USS Fitzgerald collided with an ACX Crystal container ship. According to the Philippine ship\'s captain, the USS Fitzgerald failed to heed warnings of flashing lights before the container ship veered right to try to avoid it, but hit it anyway.</p>
<p>The Japan Coast Guard wasn\'t notified of the accident until about an hour after it happened. </p>
<p>&quot;Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that the ACX Crystal, chartered by Japan\'s Nippon Yusen KK (9101.T), made a complete U-turn between 12:58 a.m. and 2:46 a.m.&quot;  See YouTube video of ship\'s course: [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1b58yelh_c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1b58yelh_c</a>].</p>
<p>&quot;The incident has spurred six investigations, including two internal hearings by the U.S. Navy and a probe by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) on behalf of the National Transportation Safety Board. The Japan Transport Safety Board, the JCG and the Philippines government are also conducting separate investigations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ACX Crystal has been owned by Olympic Steamship Co SA, Panama (a subsidiary of Japanese shipowner Sunford Shipping Ltd) and managed by Sea Quest Ship Management Inc of Bacoor, Philippines since 2008.[1][3] The ship has been bareboat-chartered to Sinbanali Shipping Inc of Manila since 2014,[3] but is reported by NYK Line on June 17 as being actually owned by Dainichi-Invest Corporation, a Japanese ship investment firm.[5] ACX Crystal is a mid-size container ship employed by ACX (\'Asia Container Express\'), the intra-Asia container shipping trade subsidiary of NYK Line, the global shipping and freight logistics division of the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi.
In June 2017, ACX Crystal was employed by NYK on its \'PX1\' (Phoenix 1) intra-Asia trade line linking Japan, Vietnam and Thailand ports.&quot;

<p>A key question is why would a container ship in clear weather collide with a high-tech radar-equipped navy vessel at almost a 90-degree angle? Had the navy ship signaled for the container ship to stop? Was there any fear of inspection (for either drugs or evidence of human trafficking) on the part of the captain of the container ship?

            Our Navy Destroyer had its computer system hacked they were "radar blind" to the container ship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Navy Intelligence already knows who hacked their ship's navigation system. Revenge will be kept hidden it will happen but we won't ever learn of it. Navy Seals have already killed the hackers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason it won't ever be made public is because it could start World War 3 so it will remain hidden.

            Watched the container ship on a tracking site the night after it happened make the turns required to ram the USS Fitz. You can watch the crash and the ship then leaves and returns about an hour later.  At least 7 sailors drowned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Questions:
How does a container ship, which takes forever to turn outmaneuver one of our top warships?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why no call for help for at least 50 minutes?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if the container ship would not call why not the USS Fitz which was flooding and almost sank?
           </p>
           <p>
            There was reports the flooding caused the communications to go down but in this day that would seem impossible and why not a mayday then?

           <p>
            That doesn't mean that it was PG-related.  Perhaps it was.  Unless you can get some insider info or interview someone from one of the ships, we will never know.
