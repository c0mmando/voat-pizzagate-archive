<p>Reported on 8-6-14 by NBC, Joe Biden and his comments are part of a larger agenda that begins with George Soros and the Open Society Foundation that advocates a borderless world. This mindset is part of the initiative toward the NWO (new world order) where national boundaries are eradicated and sovereignty of nations that determine their own policies are a thing of the past. In short, it\'s the precursor to global government, installed by the elites for the entire planet.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/mission-values">https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/mission-values</a>].</p>
<p>On its &quot;Mission &amp; Values&quot; page, Open Society Foundation says it promotes &quot;diversity of opinions; democratically elected governments; and a civil society that helps keep government power in check.&quot; This is laughable, as it\'s been shown that Soros will not even accept the democratically elected republican president-elect, Donald Trump, let alone a democratically elected president in Bolivia, Venezuela, Russia or anywhere else. What he really means is he\'s trying to engineer the population of the planet to support <em>his</em> candidate only, and disavow any other candidate.</p>
<p>But beyond these considerations, ponder what happens to children when local government is weakened and compromised by wars and corrupt leaders in other nations. They\'re vulnerable and fall through the cracks. I believe this is all by design.</p>

<p>The Department of Health &amp; Human Services is having a hard time accounting for unaccompanied minors crossing the US border. According to the report, as of September, 2014, 47,000 illegal immigrant children were missing in America.</p>
<p>This is what Open Society Foundation really advocates: a borderless world where children have no official identity, like in Haiti, can\'t be tracked or located once they are given up, and can be trafficked and disposed of like garbage. This is nothing less than planned genocide.
It\'s world population reduction in line with the protocols of the Georgia Guidestones and elite publications that promote drastic depopulation efforts to facilitate the coming &quot;liberal world order&quot; they hope is just over the horizon.</p>

<p>Thanks to a valuable post from redberries, &quot;We have connected James Alefantis with wanted child-trafficker Laura Silsby,&quot; we\'re getting a better idea of the methods and purposes of child trafficking. Traffickers are connected to many third world nations where laws are limited and barely enforced, like Haiti, which has no national ID card for children until they reach voting age.</p>
<p>Orphanages and such are formed and preyed upon by the traffickers whose way has been cleared by carefully placed government officials.
The children are moved to various places, some advertised on the Dark Web. They\'re sold and considered disposable, and are often the &quot;gravy&quot; or &quot;icing on the cake&quot; of drug and illegal weapons transfers.</p>
<p>This is all part of a global agenda run by the elites with President Obama\'s aid and the aid of other world leaders like Angela Merkel, Hollande of France, the British and Belgian royals, the Saudis and on and on. The agenda often requires chaos and war to provide a smokescreen for the movement of weapons, drugs and children. The media is complicit under the pretext of it being a &quot;national security&quot; issue, protected under the umbrella of intelligence agency confidentiality which has allowed these criminals to operate with impunity.</p>',
