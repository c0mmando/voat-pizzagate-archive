<p>In an exhaustively well written four part series by <strong><a href="https://archive.is/Rkrkq">Yoichi Shimatsu</a></strong> on the <strong>Jeffrey Epstein Saga</strong> we will be examining the <strong><a href="https://archive.is/9vsl6">last article</a></strong> in this series that illustrates a <strong><em>vast network of intelligence operatives from many angles</em></strong> that have infiltrated our alleged &quot;higher institutes of learning&quot; and have begun to bribe their way into supporting research that will ultimately and invariably lead to <strong><em>vast depopulation programs.</em></strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the several weeks since <strong>Epstein\'s alleged &quot;death&quot;</strong> and quite a bit before, we have learned of Mr. Epstein\'s propensity for <strong><em>&quot;charitable works&quot;</em></strong> in the name of science and research in many interesting fields of discovery, all quite interesting but one comes under a different type of scrutiny due to it\'s connections, the sprawling campus at <strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong> and the <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology or simply MIT</strong>. </p>
<p>We all know that MIT has come under quite a bit of internet conspiracy scrutiny regardless of how much the Mainstream Media tries to cover up the truth behind Arron Swartz murder:</p>

<p><strong>MIT</strong> seems to be <em>crawling</em> with <strong><em>personalities and perverts</em></strong> from all angles, mixed and placed so superfluously that it is almost very difficult to see and understand what team they are playing for in regard to the <strong>White Hat/Black Hat</strong> scenario and agency. These connections meld and twist into each other and in retrospect give quite a comprehensive picture of the direction the <strong><em>New World Order</em></strong> <em>purveyor\'s</em> have in mind for us. We have <strong>Epstein, elements of The Clinton Cabal and traces of the Clowns In America from the Bush Era, Operation Paperclip and DARPA</strong>, one can only surmise that we are observing quite an <em>instrumental hub</em> in the formation of the <strong><em>New World Order</em></strong> using <strong>technology</strong> as it\'s base.</p>
<p>Like a <strong>spider\'s den</strong> in the <strong><em>Lord of the Rings</em></strong> <strong>MIT</strong> has become a haven for pedophiles and freaks <em>studiously and tirelessly</em> working for the <strong><em>New World Order Paradigm</em></strong> and having a <strong><em>bit of luciferian fun taking advantage of the weak in the meantime.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/9vsl6"><strong>The Epstein-Funded Child Porn Hub MIT Media Lab That Murdered Aaron Swartz</strong></a> is reminiscent of a <strong><em>graphic novel of perverted evildoers bent on world domination and turning the world\'s population</em></strong> into a <strong>electronically monitored</strong> and <strong>controlled</strong> <strong><em>Transhumanist</em></strong> society and <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> of the players are present here showing their true colors: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>George Church</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In an <strong><em>eerily reminiscent episode of bribery and extortion</em></strong> we have <strong>Professor George Church</strong> already apologizing for meeting with Epstein and taking his donations because he had a moment of ‘<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/05/citing-nerd-tunnel-vision-biologist-george-church-apologizes-for-contacts-with-jeffrey-epstein/">nerd tunnel vision</a>’, who just happens to have <strong><em>WORKED</em></strong> for the episode\'s <strong>subject in question.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>George Church</strong>, molecular biologist specializing in <strong>genetic editing</strong>, <strong>CRISPR</strong>, was co-initiator of the <strong>BRAIN project</strong> launched by <strong>President Barack Obama</strong>, which is (face it, folks) a continuation of <strong>MK-ULTRA</strong>, using plug-in chips to fine-tune cognition after the initial experiments by those pioneering <strong>Doctors Sydney Gottlieb with LSD studies</strong> and <strong>Ewan Cameron</strong> through <strong>electro-shock therapy</strong> produced such excellent results in the assignments for <strong>Mark David Chapman and Whitey Bulger.</strong></p>
<p>An innovator of chip-DNA synthesis, Professor Church has been the director of research projects at the Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH, genomics) and the <strong>Wyss Institute of Synthetic Biology</strong>. For those who recall my Pizzagate series, <strong>Hansjorg Wyss</strong> is the Swiss philanthropist who ran Synthes, a producer of prosthetics, implants and biomaterials, which was hit with medical malpractice suits for illegal experiments that killed several patients. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hansjorg Wyss</strong> huh? Don\'t we know him from the <strong><em>Handkerchief/Pool Party Clinton/Podesta/Wikileaks Emails</em></strong> that started with <strong>Susan Sandler and her buck Steve Phillips</strong> setting up an evening for <strong>Hans</strong>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Wyss was a friend and associate of John Podesta until he was scared off by the risk of blackmail following sexual performances at private showings.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems Wyss might have escaped the radar but his colleagues did not.</p>

<p>Dear Herb,</p>
<p>A short note to say how much Dale and I enjoyed last night. What a stimulating evening, thanks no doubt to the Sandler rules and the fantastic company. What a pleasure to see Susan again, and meet Steve, Mary and John, and Hans.</p>
<p>We hope we see one another again very soon. While I know it is uncertain, I have my fingers crossed we may somehow see each again when we are at Stanford for the IDI in a couple weeks.</p>
<p>Dale joins in sending hugs.</p>

<p>The <em>players</em> involved in this episode of the <strong>Pizzagate</strong> saga seem to be <strong>just as interesting</strong> as the exchange that happened that day on the island of  <strong>Martha\'s Vineyard</strong> off the coast of <strong>Massachusetts</strong>. <strong>Each and every one of them</strong> has had a <em>massive impact</em> on the socio-economic and political scene historically and currently but <em>none</em> of those characters are as interesting as <strong>Herb and Marion Sandler</strong> as illustrated by this <strong>Saturday Night Live</strong> skit that aired in <strong>October of 2008</strong> that was heavily <a href="http://deadline.com/2008/10/mystery-of-missing-snl-bailout-skit-explained-nbccom-took-it-down-for-legal-reasons-will-put-back-up-edited-version-today-7198/">redacted</a> and censored after it\'s original airing:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/PulledSnlBankBailoutSkit">https://archive.org/details/PulledSnlBankBailoutSkit</a></p>
<p>This skit happens to blow the LID off of <strong>Pizzagate</strong> in the sense that in connects <strong>The Sandler Clan, George Soros, Nancy Pelosi, Barney Frank</strong>, and of course the <strong>Clinton Foundation</strong>, <em>among other major campaign contributors</em>, not only to <strong>Pizzagate</strong>, but to the <strong>Franklin Scandal</strong></p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> <em>ALSO</em> had a leading role in the <strong>Housing Market Crash of 2008</strong>, now what are the chances of <strong>Epstein and the Sandlers</strong> both having instrumental roles in one of the worst <strong><em>Housing Market crashes the world has ever seen?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epstein may have personally initiated the dominos falling that eventuated in the collapse of Bear Stearns by asking, on April 18, 2007, for his $57 million back from a hyper-leveraged <strong>Bear Stearns</strong> hedge fund investing in mortgage-based financial gimcrackery.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>George Church</strong> also has <strong><em>ANOTHER</em></strong> interesting connection to <strong>Pizzagate, Tony Podesta and Joule</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Church</strong> has co-founded 22[84] companies, including Veritas Genetics (human genomics, 2014)  <strong>Joule Unlimited</strong> (SolarFuels, 2007, with Noubar Afeyan and David Berry) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Church">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Church</a></p>

            Dear Herb,
           </p>
           <p>
            A short note to say how much Dale and I enjoyed last night. What a stimulating evening, thanks no doubt to the Sandler rules and the fantastic company. What a pleasure to see Susan again, and meet Steve, Mary and John, and Hans.
           </p>
           <p>
            We hope we see one another again very soon. While I know it is uncertain, I have my fingers crossed we may somehow see each again when we are at Stanford for the IDI in a couple weeks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dale joins in sending hugs.

            MIT protesting about faculty knowledge regarding donor and pedophile Epstein
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             MIT students and faculty are calling for an overhaul of the institute’s fundraising processes following revelations that
             <strong>
              a number of senior administrators at MIT — beyond former Media Lab director Joichi Ito — were aware of the university’s relationship with convicted pedophile and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein
             </strong>
             . Last Friday, hundreds of MIT community members took to the steps of the university’s student center to denounce the university’s
             <strong>
              involvement with Epstein and other high-profile donors, including Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and conservative industrialists Charles G. Koch and his late brother David
             </strong>
             . In speeches, members of the group MIT Students Against War, who organized the rally, called on the MIT administration to release the names of those who had accepted Epstein’s funding and called for the firing of anyone aware of the relationship — including university president L. Rafael Reif. Then, during a nearly two-hour faculty meeting on Wednesday,
             <strong>
              Heather Paxson, an anthropology professor
             </strong>
             , and Lisa Parks, a comparative media studies professor, read aloud a letter to Reif drafted and signed by dozens of tenured female faculty members.
             <strong>
              MIT computer scientist Richard Stallman, argued that some of Epstein’s victims were “entirely willing,” and described the distinction between a 17- and a 18-year-old victim as a “minor” detail. Stallman resigned earlier this week. (Multiple sources)

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I argue that the anti-trafficking network consolidates expertise through a shared moralizing politics of bureaucracy and carceral sensibility of securitization. This network mobilizes the issue of child protection to expand the reach of technologies of search and prediction, and to afford legitimation to a newly normalized level of digital surveillance. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with the United Nations and anti-trafficking organizations in Thailand, with a child protection NGO and police in the Netherlands, and with software companies and law enforcement in the United States.

             Thakor, who majored in feminist studies and anthropology as an undergraduate at Stanford University, was initially interested in how sex workers themselves utilize emerging technologies. But over time, her focus has shifted to the opposite end of the spectrum: how sex work and trafficking are policed using digital tools.

            <p>
             This is such a live, timely, and rich issue. "Trafficking" illuminates the interconnectedness of multiple systems of inequality and injustice–I want you to consider the ways in which your particular skills and ideas could be useful outside of the classroom. To this end, I have set up external partnerships with two different agencies working on anti-trafficking issues. Two of the small groups will have the opportunity to frame their final project around these partnerships.

             Jeffrey Epstein, who had a personal preference for teenage girls, was their angel investor, providing an estimated one million dollars or more to the Lab's bag-man Joichi "Joi" Ito, whose background check discloses zero academic or engineering qualifications for being in charge of anything except the janitorial service at MIT, indicative again of the intellectual level of the baboons with the Bush crime mob and their queer pals in the Obama regime, who managed to subvert academia.

            <p>
             Now what does British-Australian intelligence have to do with child porn during Joi Ito's early Internet days in Tokyo? I can recall one of my sub-editors who was married to staffer at the Australian Embassy expressing her dismay at embassy cocktail parties, where the male staffers (to the disgust of their wives) boasting about their outrageous sexual exploits against little brown boys and girls, in a game of one-upsmanship between cringeworthy pedophiles

            "Joi Ito's obscure origins involved a father who immigrated from Kyoto to work as researcher for the Detroit auto industry. Somehow his mother became particularly close to Stanford Ovshinsky, a battery designer and solid-state "inventor". To those familiar with Operation Paperclip-Overcast, Ovshinsky's "inventions" in solid-state electronics are not impressive works of a creative genius, given the fact that most of those "inventions" were developed in wartime Germany and hijacked (without an iota of concern for copyright). During World War II, Ovshinsky worked at the Goodyear plant in Litchfield, Arizona, where he modified lathes to produce artillery shells, and in the postwar period worked for the defense contractor Hupp Corporation, an assembly plant for Army vehicles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore with the connections to Operation Paperclip, which morphed into DARPA, Joi Ito grew up as one of the Pentagon brats just like Jeff Bezos, the favorite boy of his maternal grandfather Lawrence Preston Gise, a founder of NASA and DARPA, as disclosed in one of my earlier articles for rense.com. It's called nepotism, folks, based on "family secrets" reinforced by incest."
           </p>
           <p>
            There was quite a bit of controversy when Epsteins donations came to light and many wanted Ito to resign, some odd fellows came out in support of Joi even though he stepped down anyway.

            Joi Ito is surrounded by a crew of likewise dodgy characters. The petition is online, but The Daily Beast's Taylor Hatmaker has done a great job of condensing it: "Some of the prominent signers of the petition to keep Ito include former presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig, Whole Earth Catalog creator and tech icon Stewart Brand, managing partner of MIT Media Lab's venture fund Habib Haddad, MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, LittleBits founder and CEO Ayah Bdeir, and Harvard genetics professor George Church.

            The existence of Cambodian child-sex tapes was detected by reddit editor
            <strong>
             Aaron Swartz
            </strong>
            who pursued the clues from San Francisco to New York and onto Cambridge, Mass., to the MIT campus sprawled along the dirty water of the River Charles. As I have pointed out in the past, he was then working on research grant for the
            <strong>
             Edmond Safra foundation
            </strong>
            , under the cover of open access to academic research but his
            <strong>
             <em>
              personal passion was to expose the politically connected pedophile
             </em>
            </strong>
            . The late tycoon Safra gets a lot of bad press from Illuminati-controlled publishers, but in reality he was one of few traditional Jews to resist their perversion of the Jewish community and the Hebraic tradition. Although I've been vocal on this issue, it really is the moral responsibility of faithful Jews to launch action against the perverse and criminal heresy.

            The GCHQ, for those who have not kept up with the Brit spooks, has more recently been directly implicated in the Russiagate scandal against Donald Trump, the rise of Huawei out of colonial-era Hong Kong, and John Podesta's excursion to New Zealand for the false-flag staged at ISIS mosques in Christchurch, plus a player in Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and the hidden hand behind the Negroponte neocon brothers and the MIT Media Lab. Therefore, this logical thread suggests that the British top queers aka the Rothschild-Goldsmith cabal were ultimately behind the murder of Aaron Swartz and before that the arson that killed banker Edmond Safra, patron of the Aleppo biblical and Torah scholars opposed to the Illuminati State of Israel. The Illuminati fingerprints are all over the Epstein-Wexner-Maxwell affair.

            The complicity of DARPA and the National Science Foundation in this campaign of misdirection under a blanket cover-up is yet to be exposed. This level of financial fraud demands FBI action and Massachusetts state attorney general's probe into the MIT Media Lab, including its role in the Cambodian pedophile-child porn project and the murder of Aaron Swartz. The nexus of evil must be dismantled in a court of law and the culprits assigned long prison terms. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos needs to step into this quagmire, which threatens to suck down MIT and Harvard into a swamp of distrust.

            has been a guest, at least on one flight, aboard Epstein's Lolita Express Boeing 727. Their secretive encounter goes a long way toward understanding the hidden agenda behind transhumanism, which is the planned genocide of the major of the human population, which will eliminate more lives than all previous genocidal events in past history. Never mind Himmler's drop in the bucket compared to the Gates-Epstein plan for mass destruction. The very tact that androids are going to be needed as workers and personal assistants indicated at least 7 billion people are being targeted in the soon-coming clean sweep. The biowarfare labs certainly have sufficient deadly pathogens to accomplish the task while the elites will be in Earth orbit or on moon bases.

            "Transhumanism" has genocidal implications of technology-enable savagery at its most extreme, which is why I prefer the more accurate term of the post-human order.

              Be very clear that a new world war is shaping up, and planning and preemptive action needs to be taken against the two extremes: the advocates of population growth and the supports of genocidal population reduction. The global population will have to decline, but this should come about by consent and social policy, not by either terrorism or genocide. Jeffrey Epstein left behind time bombs that must be defused and junked. There are hundreds of thousands of madmen like him among us, and they must be rooted out from positions of power and influence, or there will be hell to pay in days and hours to come
