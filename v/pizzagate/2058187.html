I have noticed another popular theme on SNL lately, which is not getting the same recognition- P1zzagate!! The following are links to some of the  skits and examples of PG related references:</p>
<p>Jan 2017: Almost Pizza- a woman tries to trick a man into \'eating pizza\' that \'isn\'t really pizza\'
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIBR-AFcnLE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIBR-AFcnLE</a></p>
<p>Feb 28, 2017: PIZZA TOWN, speaks for itself!! &quot;if you find that snitch kill him!&quot; pizza parlor, kids theme, organized crime, cop more interested in \'pizza\' than arresting the criminal.
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d6QlnO7iT7E">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d6QlnO7iT7E</a></p>
<p>March 12, 2017:
Zoo Pornographer- news skit where a zoo photographer is mistakenly labeled \'pornographer\' ... the supposedly innuendo filled conversation sounds more like a how-to of molestation!
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LS7YO6C-7NI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LS7YO6C-7NI</a></p>
<p>April 8 2017:
Birthday Party Clown: themes of children\'s parties, alcohol, white males, disney character, and dismemberment.
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-XuT5qKt00">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X-XuT5qKt00</a></p>
<p>Soda Shop: Bizarre depiction of inappropriate sexual advances by white male ice cream man, ice cream \'shop\' setting/children\'s \'restuarant\', refers to grooming behavior happening in front of others.
 <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6wqtti7EeE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6wqtti7EeE</a></p>
<p>Louis CK monologue: themes of white privilege and power. 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lsa7N7LHJk">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lsa7N7LHJk</a></p>
<p>Louis CK is known for referring to child abuse and pedophilia in his monologues, in a previous SNL monologue in 2015 he discussed child molesters &quot;in the 70s&quot; and compares abusing children to eating candy. refers to fictional molester as \'jean baptiste\' with a european accent.

<p>Do we have sympathizers on the snl staff? Could someone close to snl writers have government or police connections or insider knowledge? </p>
<p>Normalization of pedophilia could be argued here, but not buying it due to the disturbing nature of many of the skits. </p>
<p>Points to the nature of the issue going beyond anything related to political parties. Debunks the theory that pizzagate is 100% tied to hillary clinton. this show is decidedly pro Hillary, and instead of ignoring or ridiculing PG research, it seems to be begging viewers to have conversations about pedophilia... it\'s actually normalizing the idea that it DOES exist and that white men in power are complicit. </p>
<p>i found these skits more than a coincidence, happening regularly throughout 2017. Interested in what you all think--</p>',

            They want to mix dark, disturbing themes with humor. That way, people are programmed to associate terrible things with laughing and happy thoughts.

             i don't know.... not really buying the desensitization scenario, why not lay low? it's  like not letting us forget, right as pizzagate was occurring. seems counterintuitive. 
and i don't care how sick the world is getting- there is NO WAY that the average citizen or nbc viewer thinks that child molestation is okay.

              Of course they don't. Not yet. But getting people to LAUGH at the subject of child molestation is a logical starting point. Next will be lowering the age of consent, because they will "prove" with "science" that kids are "more mature than they used to be 100 years ago." People will buy it, trust me. The younger generation of this country will believe anything as long as you tell them its progressive and tolerant.

               i get what you're saying, i just don't agree. overall, in the history of the world, child sex abuse has been practiced in every culture and under the cover of all the great religions as well. Pederasty has been an accepted ancient practice. i do not agree that the world is more 'base' than in the past centuries. humans will always exhibit evil ways, but this is a deep taboo that if anything has grown stronger. children used to be property just like women. 'childhood' as an ideal of innocence did not always exist.
all these 'desensitization' arguments are usually bogus.... violence and hate towards each other, labeling each other, making divisions, sects, wars, extremism- THIS is what we are being 'desensitized' to.

                We are also being desensitized to old elite men fucking young children. Don't you get it? These ghouls, these real life vampires, they no longer want for all of their dark deeds to have to be done in secret? They want to be able to be with these children in broad daylight, and they want for everyone to join in with them and become part of their sick religion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyone who believes that the elite of this world should NOT be gutted and hanged, you are helping them get away with everything that they do.

             Don't expect SNL to be anything other than on board with The Cannibal Queen and libby agenda. They've been pushing this crap pretty much since inception:

             <p>
              The skits for this episode are as follows:  ... A couple leaves their two young girls with Uncle Roy, a pedophile who has the girls play various games for his amusement.
