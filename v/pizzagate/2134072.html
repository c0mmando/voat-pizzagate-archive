            Ironic "falsely accused" Dearman was one the the Directors listed for 88-90. So was Ivor Cooke....porn producer king associated with Rodox and Color Climax porn and child porn. I bet probably snuff as well. Also listed as a director, an Oxford Professor, Beverley Frances Gardiner, who specializes in......child and family psychology.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what do these THREE have in common that they ALL, at one time, were directors of the same undercover Biz? Thats the million dollar question but it seem pretty obvious. There were a lot more directors thru the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dearman was also an "Advanced Online Marketing Consultant" (online, like dark web more like) as well as a recruiter for models and actors. This fuck not only used his own kids for ritual abuse and CP but also was a director listed for 88-90 which when a jewelry heist took place, CP films were found in that same part of the building Dearman was a director. It was basically a hub for dark web shit and for some reason, NO ONE listed as a director of this place after CP was discovered were arrested. U.K. Is filled with scum, specifically Buckingham Palace.

              What part is not making sense and I'll try to explain.  It's obvious what 88-90 was doing, but connecting dots to USA is the hard part.

                This building has several businesses, one being a jewelry store. It was robbed and in the basement, the robbers actually found child porn films.  Ironically, there is also a Mailbox Unlimited set up with the same address, for an "office" set up in the basement. Ricky Dearman, along with MANY other "directors" are tied to the Mailbox Unlimited to that address

                 I don't believe the robbers just
                 <em>
                  happened
                 </em>
                 to find a bunch of child porn under the jewlers. Someone, somewhere has organized a set up. Also, this occurred not too long after the video of Dearman's children were released making their allegations - what a coincidence
                 <strong>
                  "rolls eyes"
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is all a false flag to detract from more nefarious operations. The whole family are nutjobs actors.

                  The whole family...meaning the kids too? You know medical professionals did say there was evidence of sexual abuse, right? But, ya, Ricky started scrapping stuff right before this jewlery heist. Something fishy for sure and I think it ties right to the Royals. But all the different board of "Directors" is the most damning evidence.

                    I guess you can choose to believe Ricky Dearman is a sick fuck or not. (He is) If you believe it's a hoax, there is STILL child abuse. What those kids described and talk about, if "coached", someone coached them to say all that horrific stuff. That in itself is child abuse.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So regardless of the kids, the fact Ricky Dearman was a director for Mailbox address that's tied to CP is the main problem. The same mailbox that Ivor Cooke was a director should give anyone a wake up call.

                     You have a point. Yes and if someone did coach those kids, because, let's face it, someone clearly did as their responses/descriptions were too quick, lucid, knowledgeable and graphic for little ones their age, then whoever it was deserves the absolute shit kicked out of them too

            Ricky dearman was NOT falsely accused.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm confused, did OP create this thread supporting dearman? If so, why any upvoats at all?

             I posted it to make people aware of this case.  My post history clearly indicates my position on this stuff.  It would be interesting to contact the wife that fled to see what she has to say.  I am aware of the history of the BBC, too.  It is no surprise they would white wash this case.  I have seen the statue in front of the BBC building, and I kow the ex-CEO is now with the NY Times.

               And I have been following your posts, too, so I know we are on the same team.

               Have you read the Nag Hammadi Library?  It seems that they are manuscripts warning humanity about the people we are dealing with today.  It seems like the original manuscripts were destroyed, hidden, and rewritten to remove the warnings.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a lot of talk in the manuscripts about the rulers and authorities and paying taxes to them, as well as paying interest.  I am looking for any mention of pedophilia, child sacrifice, and/or cannibalism.  There should be warnings about that, too.

            Who's surprised that the father's denying the allegations.  Why wouldn't he?  Also, if those kids were acting, they're the best child actors in history.

             Best child actors ever.  Their dad should be a pretty good actor too right?  He was really bad i thought.  I swear it looks like he's trying to hold back a smile at times. Definitely over acting

               I just noticed that the judge mentioned in the article is the same one that has been mentioned here is several posts the last day or so.  The alleged larper from CERN...  I hope you know who I mean.  I think they changed their user name several times, and kept deleting posts.

            This guy is a liar. This case has been proven and these children's testimony along with medical evidence of ritual sodomy and rape were found by medical professionals. This man is connected to the Clinton Foundation via Haiti. We have documented evidence. Tavistock will be exposed through this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a link to the below post with 54 Upvoats exposing this case. These children were taken to this pedophile treatment center to deprogram
them.
