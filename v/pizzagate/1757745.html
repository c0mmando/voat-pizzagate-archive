<p>As we all know, MK-ultra/ monarch mind control and satanic ritual abuse, are playing a big role in what we are dealing with here on pizzagate/ pedogate and she gives us very detailed insight into those topics and what it does to people. </p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCA9OSLIKXihDMwvfzSronQ">channel</a> doesn\'t seem to be very popular around pg- researchers or in general, so it\'s worth a (2nd) post for sure. The monarch programming happened to her in virginia and I think she even mentioned DC in one of her videos...</p>
<p>Below I will post few of her videos to give you a little overview and a good point to start, because for people new to her channel it can be a little confusing, since there are videos about many different topics, taken by her different alters and also videos recorded before she was even aware she has dissociative identity disorder and that she is a victim of monarch mind control. Always read the description and pay attention to the dates in the title/ the &quot;re-upload&quot; tag if you want to get the timeline right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this video I list off some of the monarch traumas I went through that had come up so far at the time. I know a lot more now than I did then, and I also didn\'t share all of what I had written down on that list. This was probably the most numb I\'ve ever been in my entire life besides that last video I just posted where I talk about the traumas that involved Bailey (one of my child alters)....I\'m still pretty numb to a lot of this, but I can at least cry now more often. The integration I thought was going on obviously wasn\'t...that might be part of why I felt even more fucked up, because my alters were the ones that were actually experiencing a lot of this in first person...so I couldn\'t really get much of a release from it all at the time. </p>

<p>I\'m finally letting go of the mask I was forced to put on most of my life. I started out just trying to move my body more naturally again only to discover that I wasn\'t communicating naturally all this time. I went to speech therapy as a kid and they forced me to talk like a &quot;normal&quot; person which in my case actually caused me a lot of pain and agony throughout my life whenever I\'d speak. I always felt like I was trying so hard to talk and it really hurt, now I know why. I\'m starting to be a little more comfortable with how I\'m talking since taking this video. I took another video that\'s uploading after this one that will explain more of some realizations I came to about all of this. The speech is also impacting my alters, so far I know it did with Ashley and Bailey. Sarah already had a stutter. She was the only one who was truly showing our more authentic self. It\'s not just stimming they made me stop doing and the forced eye contact. They also put me into fear and made me feel ashamed of the way I talk. Fuck that.

<p>She has no rl friends or a family who do support her and she barely can leave her home and I just can\'t stand the idea she could end up homeless because she can\'t pay her rent. This would probably be her end. She deserves our help!</p>

<p>But please resist the temptation to ask her for further information that could lead to pg related arrests or something the like. Like asking for names of her abusers and stuff like that. She doesn\'t seem to know about what is currently going on here and she really should concentrate about her own recovery and doesn\'t need even more stress. She is already giving enough...</p>

            I visited her channel and viewed a couple of videos.  I had not known of Serenity before.  She is very smart and complex and gives us an understanding of what her life has been like. I don't think she's making this up.  I hope she gets all the support she deserves.

             Yes, I feel the same. I watched most of her videos and I'm certain she is authentic.
It would kill me to know she ended up homeless. After watching all those videos and talking to her via email, I think I got pretty emotionally involved.
Hope somebody helps her. I already did all I can. Please share her channel or gofundme if you can.
Thank you!

              Already did a little (very) gofundme.  Hopefully more as I can.  What occurs to me is this;  you know how she says her father made a fortune from her and her siblings doing porn?  I think generally we need to legally take the money away from abusive parents and restore it to the victims.  Not sure of the legality but we need to remove any statute of limitations so they can be restored as much money as possible.  If the victims are unable to handle their assets, maybe a sympathetic guardian could be appointed.  They often need years of recovery and cannot work.  It is so unfair.

               Yes it's unfair and of course all this money and if you ask me, everything else they've got should be taken away and be given to the victims.
But I think we are far from things like this happening legally. First we would have to have law enforcement that isn't part of all this wrongdoing in the first place. :/
Thank you very much for your support!

            I've got too much on my plate to dig into this, but here is a BUMP in hopes that someone else will.  I've just listened to a few minutes of one video and if she's not making this up then YES she deserves support.
