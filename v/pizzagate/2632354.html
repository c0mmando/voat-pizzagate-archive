<p>So I decided to look up Ed Lieberman...turns out he is likely to be <strong>Edward Lieberman</strong>, &quot;a lawyer with corporate and political clients in former Soviet countries who was married to President Bill Clinton’s former deputy chief of staff, Evelyn S. Lieberman, who died in 2015&quot; (<a href="http://archive.is/wAQeW">link to archived article</a>). </p>
<p>Edward Lieberman\'s name came up in the FAKE Trump-Russia collusion, as he played a key role in arranging Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet army veteran, to run a pro-democracy agenda for Kazakhstan from Washington DC. Akhmetshin is claimed to be one of the people present at the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016. The Clinton Cabal clearly tried but <em>failed</em> to set up Jr. (<a href="http://archive.is/EUmRo">link to another archived article</a>)</p>

<p>This art exhibition that PODESTA was invited to was described by the local Baltimore paper as &quot;HELLSCAPE&quot;, in an article titled &quot;The Abuse of Beauty&quot;! </p>
<p>Below are 3 direct quotes describing the exhibition - it would give you a gist of the themes of <strong>ABUSE/VIOLENCE/HELL</strong> commonly found in Tony Podesta\'s artwork collection. <strong>THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK!</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. This hellscape gets weirder. &quot;Joe,&quot; an eerie, grinning head that resembles the vice president, watches the four sufferers from a niche in the wall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. This appears to be a Dante-inspired, multilevel hell, inhabited by everyone from chefs to politicians.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. All of Lieberman\'s sculptures, in fact, appear to have suffered a beating.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Abuse of Beauty (<a href="http://archive.is/Klr7M">link to archived article</a>)</p>
<p>Charles Bukowski wrote &quot;To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it. To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art.&quot; If style has any role in art, it\'s to make dull things dangerous. Ed Lieberman, a Washington D.C.-based artist and attorney, paints and sculpts conventional archetypes with a style of brutality—and danger—that sets the tone for Gallery 1301\'s inaugural exhibition.</p>
<p>The new Charles Street gallery has joined the list of recently established gallery spaces supporting emerging artists. Opened in May, Gallery 1301 has a fresh yet sophisticated feel: glossy hardwood floors, the smell of wet wall paint, windows lighting all ends of the space. Walls sectioned at various angles create a dynamic space ending with an open, polygonal room, with niches perfect for small sculptures. The space is ideal for a multidisciplinary show like this. Paintings and sculptures alternate between walls and corners. The show has a clear color scheme—the all-blue paintings, complemented by the warm terracotta and bronze sculptures and balanced by a few black portrait busts.</p>
<p>In the center of the polygonal room, four black busts form a cluster, elevated to just below eye level. Two of the seven deadly sins—&quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Gluttony&quot;—appear to be screaming from the depths of hell, heads turned upward to meet the viewer. Likewise, &quot;Rigoletto,&quot; the cursed jester from the opera of the same name by Giuseppe Verdi, wrenches his neck upward, the bells of his hat captured midbounce. Oddly enough, the fourth bust in the cluster is &quot;Chef&quot;—a caricature complete with a hat and a bushy mustache.</p>
<p>This hellscape gets weirder. &quot;Joe,&quot; an eerie, grinning head that resembles the vice president, watches the four sufferers from a niche in the wall. Although the bust\'s apparent namesake is relatively human for a politician, the sculpture embodies the paradigm of the politician through the emptiness in its eyes. On the other side of the room, &quot;Soul in Hell,&quot; modeled after the famous Bernini bust, yells down at the cluster of twisting heads. On the tallest pedestal sits &quot;Purgatory,&quot; a battered head atop a wooden box decorated with writhing bronze torsos. This appears to be a Dante-inspired, multilevel hell, inhabited by everyone from chefs to politicians. Religious and allegorical figures, such as &quot;Madonna and Child (after Michelangelo)&quot; and &quot;Charity (after Bernini),&quot; also face the sinners, serving as a force of judgment over the hellpit.</p>
<p>Lieberman endows his generic subjects—created in traditional bronze, terracotta, and oil—with a vivid sense of violence. &quot;Boxer,&quot; a crudely rendered terracotta bust, is the most literal manifestation of this abuse—a smushed face captured in the moment of taking a hard punch. All of Lieberman\'s sculptures, in fact, appear to have suffered a beating. Some look more like their original form—a blob of clay, pummeled by reuse—than fully realized portrait busts. Even his religious subjects appear to have been abused. &quot;Archangel Gabriel,&quot; representing a character traditionally depicted as a glorious divine figure, takes on the same gestures and distortions of a face midbeating, head swinging, eyes shut, lips pursed. The bust, cast in bronze, resembles the traditional Gabriel only in his curly ringlet hair—although this, too, is rendered with a ferocity.</p>
<p>This scene, set by the relationships between the sculptures, is far more interesting than the sculptures as individual pieces. They rely on archetype for meaning. Each bust is modeled to fit a certain caricature, or otherwise deviates from the standard characteristics into something more vague, but still without significant commentary. The aggression with which Lieberman sculpts his heads appears to be more an attempt to capture gesture than to interpret or redefine the subject\'s character.</p>
<p>Lieberman\'s paintings are more daring than his sculptures. Where his sculptures come across as simple character sketches, his paintings are more dynamic in technique and image. While they, too, depict typical subject matter—the female nude, mostly—they place more emphasis on the medium and less on archetype. The paint—all in blue monochrome—is used sparingly, leaving large patches of linen unpainted, as if there were openings bitten into the forms. &quot;Untitled (Nicole)&quot; features a frantically painted reclining nude woman, legs compressed to fit the frame. For a relaxed pose, it\'s a pretty uncomfortable image.</p>
<p>The seated figure in &quot;The Examination&quot; is particularly striking against the raw background. The forms are defined not by color or value—the piece is painted in one blue and, for the most part, one value—but by the texture of the brush strokes. A single, translucent stroke makes up each finger, pressing on the figure\'s cheek. Stippled marks form the hair, long streaks create the folds in the jacket. Easily the strongest piece in the exhibition, the painting demonstrates an awareness of the medium and the force of the pure blue color.</p>
<p>In &quot;Michael,&quot; a stiff figure sits in a chair formed by a few dry lines, surrounded by a circular, Baconesque room. The face, again in the spirit of Francis Bacon, is disfigured by violent marks. The cool blues nearly thwart the discomfort of the scene, but the stark lines of the background and aggressive central positioning of the sitter affirm the anxious atmosphere.</p>
<p>In &quot;Untitled (nude back),&quot; a blank oval makes up a woman\'s thigh, resting on her deep blue calf. The coarse outline, vicious mark, and, of course, the color, evoke Matisse\'s &quot;Blue Nude&quot; at the Baltimore Museum of Art. The philosopher/critic Arthur Danto cited Matisse\'s painting as an example of what he called &quot;the abuse of beauty.&quot; Likewise, Lieberman commits acts of visual violence against the beauty of the human figure, only his manner of abuse is, at times, overbearing. While Matisse replaced beauty with power, Lieberman essentially ignores it.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, style forms too consistent a pattern that whatever idiosyncrasies it intends to create become washed out. Nonetheless, the Lieberman show is a refreshing change as the Baltimore art scene continues to be populated by repurposed materials and non-figurative work. The show offers a return to academic roots—roots that are sometimes overlooked even by the local art institution. In this age where anything can be art, traditional media and subject matter can often ring a dull note. But in a constantly evolving art scene, old practices can form an important divergence. Gallery 1301 offers a space for such contrast to an artist community that thrives on differences.</p>

"Boxer," a crudely rendered terracotta bust, is the most literal manifestation of this abuse—a smushed face captured in the moment of taking a hard punch.

While they, too, depict typical subject matter—the female nude, mostly—they place more emphasis on the medium and less on archetype. The paint—all in blue monochrome—is used sparingly, leaving large patches of linen unpainted, as if there were openings bitten into the forms. "Untitled (Nicole)" features a frantically painted reclining nude woman, legs compressed to fit the frame. For a relaxed pose, it's a pretty uncomfortable image.
           </p>

            The seated figure in "The Examination" is particularly striking against the raw background. The forms are defined not by color or value—the piece is painted in one blue and, for the most part, one value—but by the texture of the brush strokes. A single, translucent stroke makes up each finger, pressing on the figure's cheek. Stippled marks form the hair, long streaks create the folds in the jacket. Easily the strongest piece in the exhibition, the painting demonstrates an awareness of the medium and the force of the pure blue color.
           </p>
           <p>
            In "Michael," a stiff figure sits in a chair formed by a few dry lines, surrounded by a circular, Baconesque room. The face, again in the spirit of Francis Bacon, is disfigured by violent marks. The cool blues nearly thwart the discomfort of the scene, but the stark lines of the background and aggressive central positioning of the sitter affirm the anxious atmosphere.
           </p>
           <p>
            In "Untitled (nude back)," a blank oval makes up a woman's thigh, resting on her deep blue calf. The coarse outline, vicious mark, and, of course, the color, evoke Matisse's "Blue Nude" at the Baltimore Museum of Art. The philosopher/critic Arthur Danto cited Matisse's painting as an example of what he called "the abuse of beauty." Likewise, Lieberman commits acts of visual violence against the beauty of the human figure, only his manner of abuse is, at times, overbearing. While Matisse replaced beauty with power, Lieberman essentially ignores it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oftentimes, style forms too consistent a pattern that whatever idiosyncrasies it intends to create become washed out. Nonetheless, the Lieberman show is a refreshing change as the Baltimore art scene continues to be populated by repurposed materials and non-figurative work. The show offers a return to academic roots—roots that are sometimes overlooked even by the local art institution. In this age where anything can be art, traditional media and subject matter can often ring a dull note. But in a constantly evolving art scene, old practices can form an important divergence. Gallery 1301 offers a space for such contrast to an artist community that thrives on differences.

           <p>
            Why did they start working against Donald Trump?  Was because they didn't like Donald Trump's performance in Emin's music video?

            Do you think no one told Donald Trump Jr that the Trumps no longer liked the Agalarovs because he was really enthusiastic about the Russia government's support for the Trump campaign?  He said he loved it.

           <p>
            Also why did Don Jr and Donald Sr lie so many times about this meeting in 2017?  Because that exposed them to possible obstruction of justice charge.  Especially since they had to keep changing their lies until Don Jr just had to release emails or as one of the folks in the meeting put it, Why did he release this e-mail admitting to collusion?

              Actually I think this has to do with being busy or not paying attention to the news.  I think it's actually more about the wholesale rejection of certain new sources.  If a rock is turned over that has news that is bad for Trump.........
              <em>
               whether or not the story is true
              </em>
              , folks will never look under that rock again or any rock that looks like it.   It becomes not a search for truth, but a search for news that doesn't challenge our previoulsy held beliefs.  It's this whole sale rejection of regular new sites that have opened the floodgates for fake news sites to prey on this community over and over again.  Cynical rejectionism is not being skeptical, it is not keeping an open mind.  In fact, what you often see is the same folks who are completely cynical about regular media are so gullible about fake stories from sites who tell them what they what to believe.

              And this meeting in Trump Tower has been discussed extensively on this forum.  And it's key to the Mueller investigation.  But people who rejected "Muh Russia" story 18 months ago keep getting surprised by things like
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papodopolous pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about his meetings with a professor he believed close to the Kremlin who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton.  He is cooperating and will receive consideration for other crimes he committed.  Dirt on Hillary Clinton was what the Agalarovs promised Donald Trump Jr.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump's National Security Advisor pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to discuss lifting sanctions on Russia.  He is cooperating and will receive consideration for other crimes he committed.  He is the highest level official convicted of a crime in some time.  Lifting of Sanctions was also discussed with Don Jr in Trump Tower.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump's Campaign Manager being indicted and his deputy campaign manager pleading guilty to crimes like money laundering and being unregistered agents of foreign powers....in this case the kleptocrat who ruled Ukraine with Putin's help and then fled to Russia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump's personal attorney having a search warrant served his house, office and hotel room.  A move which requires an elevated level of probable cause.  (An ex-FBI agent said, I only know a lawyer being raided a handful of times in my career, they all went to prison.)  Part of this investigation has been moved from under Mueller, but part still figures in the Mueller investigation as the lawyer delivered a plan to lift Russian sanctions on terms favorable to Putin to Michael Flynn.
             </p>
             <p>
              12 Russian Military Intelligence officers being indicted for conducting a wide ranging cyber campaign against the 2016 election in the US.  The indictment is quite detailed  and reveals that Mueller has high level systems intelligence showing that the persona who claimed to hack the DNC was in reality a cutout persona and it was really a GRU officer (as many people noted immediately in 2016).  That this GRU officer was in communication with an Organization that requested the stolen material and asked that their request be expidited to achieve maximum political impact for a shared goal, harming the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.  This organization is almost certainly Wikileaks and Mueller quotes from emails and messages between them and the GRU officer cutout persona. The indictment also mentions that a US congressional candidate (!) ask the GRU cutout persona for the stolen information and got it.  A "a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump" asked for material and got it.  This is almost certainly Trump's oldest political advisor and friend, Roger Stone.
             </p>
             <p>
              Basically people who have reject all negative stories about Trump keep getting surprised by a case they rejected two years ago.  A case that keeps growing.  This is why there's a war on the rule of law, a war on the press, a war on the FBI, the fantasy QAnon conspiracy of Trump about to arrest all his political opponents.......because the facts are not on Trump's side.  So anyone who mentions these facts, the media, the FBI, the DOJ, Mueller, Rosenstein etc must be attacked because "Muh Russia" is real.

            Excellent work!  I'd like to find photos of his other "art," but no luck so far.  Still looking.

             I looked through the archive on this referee for May 10th 2014, but couldn't find any.

             But this is the Blue Nude the article referred to:
             <a href="https://art100.wikispaces.com/file/view/Matisse_Blue_Nude_1.jpg/33374553/Matisse_Blue_Nude_1.jpg">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             So.., I think we'll have better luck looking for / going through the artists' names and seeing their portfolio individually.

              That is rather odd, for there not to be photos. So the invitation was email? and was it on the website of the gallery? Im curious if maybe people were at event and tagged it on Facebook. That is a little strange not to have one or two images. that article about his work does not even show an image which is 1. odd, and 2. the descriptions are odd. its suspect in that he has a connection to children and Clintons and Foundations so the descriptions sound like sculptures. I am in the art world (outside of the elite, lol) but all galleries post images of at least one or two pieces to entice you into the show, and at the very least there would be images of the event posted by attendees on Facebook or instagram.
