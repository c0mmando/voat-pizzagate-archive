<hr />
<p>After viewing more and more of these playdoh stop animation vids I was left wondering how long it takes to make these? I always thought it was a time consuming undertaking and I was right. </p>
<p>&quot;How long does it take to make a stop motion film?
When I was younger I used to make my own short stop-motion movies. They were only about two minutes long, but I would spend a good hour on them at the least. To make a full length movie it would take 2â€“3 years of lots of hard work.&quot;</p>
<p>*But producer Travis Knight was much more blunt about doing the hard work of stop-motion animation. Instead of using computers to render images and smoothly move characters, stop-motion animation on films like The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, requires animators to move tiny puppets a fraction of an inch at a time and then photograph them. The photos are strung together and become a film.
*
*On The Boxtrolls, they were able to complete 1 to 2 MINUTES of footage per week.</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s the worst way to make a movie,&quot; said Knight. &quot;It makes no sense. You\'re cutting your hands and contorting your body. But it\'s an incredible art form that is so rare and so beautiful.&quot;*</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/09/26/the-boxtrolls-and-why-its-crazy-to-do-stop-motion-animation/#4047ba1970bb">https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/09/26/the-boxtrolls-and-why-its-crazy-to-do-stop-motion-animation/#4047ba1970bb</a></p>
<p>Hmmmm, so most of these stop animation videos are either 10 mins - 30 mins - or an hour. And there\'s a bajillion of them. Some channels upload 2 or 3 of these style, a week.  I think we need to be noticing some of the granular details. If these are so time consuming...how the fucking fuck are these being made by supposed moms and dads with their own kids - who have time to stop down and make these - much less the time involved with coming up with the content story, beyond the act of making the films. I don\'t think it\'s being done by them, obviously. And if not them, then who? And if you look at a lot of them, while basic in background settings the characters themselves are very well done. These are done by an artist - not a mom doing this as a weekend project for her and her kid innocuously. And I think that\'s worth noting. And perhaps it seems self evident, but still wanted to note it. The time and labor involved in these alone (saying nothing of the cartoons, etc) is alarming. Whoever the responsible groups are - they are very prepared to convey their agenda and have what would seem like a number of people, working on this full time, to crank these out like they do. </p>
<p>And who knows maybe they use some program that makes it look like claymation, etc - but it seems like it\'s true stop motion and would be extremely time consuming. </p>
<p>I think we need to be thinking outside the box, on things like this. I\'m finding a million different blog articles where parents and writers are alarmed but it doesn\'t seem that people are connecting the broader dots like we are. They see and report on syringe videos, but no one mentions how crazy it is that 100 different channels would all be colluding with their own syringe vids, etc. And how the fucking themes are always the same. The more I watch the more I\'m frustrated in these stupid repetition of themes, but they\'re so out there that there doesn\'t seem any easy way to decipher what the fuck is actually being messaged. It\'s fucking with me enough though that I\'m just getting started and we are going to take them down.</p>
<p>I also went and took a close look to see if I could find the same visual style (ie - grid lines on spideman\'s mask /hair styles/ common expressions) to see if perhaps we could discern if whoever is making these, is making them all and then partnering with these channels and sending them vids with some sort of agreement and then the channel loads it. So far, I haven\'t found anything conclusive but still in the very early stages of examining it. </p>
<hr />
<p>I\'ve also started to collect details of these channels, as best as possible. I am not doxxing anyone, but linking publicly available information. </p>
<p>Please do the same and lets start digging in and seeing what we can find on these people. For instance if you\'ll just go to the &quot;about&quot; tab for the youtube channel itself you\'ll often get a trove of info. </p>
<p>Here is a very popular channel. DCTC - They openly call themselves &quot;Disney Cars Toy Club&quot; - they have their own fucking merch. Like all the others they very blatantly have these Marvel and Disney characters in all of their videos. So for them, I\'ve been taking it and looking at the about: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MaterCarClub/about">https://www.youtube.com/user/MaterCarClub/about</a></p>
<p>So they have an email. They have a PO box in NC. They seed with a number of keywords and I think we need to look at these and dig through seeing what relevant info we can locate. And all in all...these people look very normal. And that\'s what they always say about the serial killer or what not \'oh he seemed so nice. A little quiet, but everyone liked him\' - </p>
<p>So -
1. check the about tab on their channel 
2. on the about tab they also link to their instagram/twitter/fb - etc. We need to be going through this and these other channels. Identify anyone following them and who they are following that seems noteworthy. 
3. If they have a personal website linked, go to the about us, or similar - they list their phone number, etc. </p>
<p>I think we need to compile some kind of ongoing referral list and learn more about these mf\'s. </p>

<p>This may just be totally unrelated, but thinking back to Heavy Breathing band, with majestic ape - it does seem a little curious that her ski mask is red - and she wears those sunglasses the sort of look like bug eyes - or similar to spiderman\'s mask look. </p>
<p>Does seem an interesting similarity, if nothing else. </p>
<p>I\'m working on an additional longform writeup, but wanted to drop this in the short term.  I think we need to be deep diving this all for the foreseeable future, because I think if we were able to crack some of the symbolism - it would yield a massive step forward. </p>
<p>I love working with you guys and united in the cause.</p>',

           This may just be totally unrelated, but thinking back to Heavy Breathing band, with majestic ape - it does seem a little curious that her ski mask is red - and she wears those sunglasses the sort of look like bug eyes - or similar to spiderman's mask look.
          </p>
          <p>
           Does seem an interesting similarity, if nothing else.
          </p>

           I'm working on an additional longform writeup, but wanted to drop this in the short term.  I think we need to be deep diving this all for the foreseeable future, because I think if we were able to crack some of the symbolism - it would yield a massive step forward.
          </p>
          <p>
           I love working with you guys and united in the cause.

            This is an amazing body of work. I truly comend you and fully intend on contributing. This Elsagate/Weird ass channel phenom is gaining a lot more attention after the Tosh segment. Tosh being an obvious establishment puppet delivering that message is kind of a hair scratcher.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless, a few days ago I posted about Tosh's segment on FB only to get the usual backlash from various regulars. In the process of explaining my case I naturally did more research. Needless to say I'm equally as disguted as you. I do think by digging here we will gain priceless intel. Because you're right about these being highly professional. The production time doesn't add up for these small families. The themes seem to communicate some weird and truly (at times) dark shit.
           </p>

            Let us dig.

             The "usual backlash," huh? What kind of backlash could you possibly get from posting a video like that? Were people trying to defend the videos, saying they were no big deal, or what?

              Pretty much yea. There's a consensus that anything "PizzaGaters" look into is overly fabricated.... Fortunatly there's enough people outraged of the sheer volume. The proof these channels reek of organized putridness is very, very easy to point out. I'm sure anyone following the argument can see it fairly quickly.

            Guys, be warned. This lead has managed to horrify and traumatize freaking /pol (yes, they and The Donald know about this, though TD might need another thread to remind them about this). That takes a massive level of depraved to pull off.

            I know I repeating myself, but with we're up against, we NEED something like this given the reports of PG investigators getting PTSD from the horrors they've witnessed. What good is it if these horrors end up consuming us, causing us to succumb to despair. We need a flame of hope to hold on to, much like the masses are going to need a symbol of hope when the inevitable happens. Personally, the images of "Black Thanksgiving" won't go away, and may never do so. Had at least two pizzagate related nightmares, one of them Elsagate related.

             "Black Thanksgiving?" Educate me on that one, friendo.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the PTSD thing, I've never given that any thought until right this very second, but that really explains a lot. My life since PG began has been intensely negative. Seeing pedo swirls and triangles on all kind of logos/products, having the word "pizza" turn my stomach (pizza used to be one of my favorite foods ever), and just wondering at any given moment "I wonder how many children are being caged and tortured right at this moment?" All of the things I've seen, from JA's Instagram, to Tony P.'s "art collection," to Marina Abramovic's fucked up "movie" called "The Space In Between," have left me with an extremely negative mindset, and its actually caused problems in my relationship. My girlfriend is a very "only concentrate on the good things" kind of person, and me talking about PG has left her depressed as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone else have any PG-related stories like that?

              All I can say about "Black Thanksgiving" is that it involves a satanic mockery of Thanksgiving. To protect everyone else's sanity, I won't go into the details of what exactly I saw.

             +1. What we 're dealing with is in large part, a spiritual war. A war one shouldn't engage without having a spiritual trust in all that is good, regardless of one's religion. I've posted about this a long time ago (as MagicBox on OCN):

            Might be a good way to put a team of lawyers on them.  Though, I suspect legal is already fully informed and told to stand down for whatever reason.  Or maybe an executive team trip to the manufacturers weekend house was in order....

            Take a look in this file, I am not great at researcher but  there is some interesting things in there, in reguards to these videos. When I get free, I am going to take a deeper look myself.

            I'm absolutely convinced that these vids are bankrolled via American tax payers (and the sale of children) via alphabet agencies.

             Boy that would be the cherry on top wouldn't it? The whole time we've been looking into CPP and all this other stuff, and right under our noses people were using the money from our paychecks to do things like kidnap children and produce this filth on YT.

            Wow.  Thanks for your excellent research and hard work.  That crap gives me a headache so it's not something I choose to look into.  Kudos to you for doing so.

            "Here is a very popular channel. DCTC - They openly call themselves "Disney Cars Toy Club" - they have their own fucking merch. Like all the others
            <strong>
             <strong>
              they very blatantly have these Marvel and Disney characters in all of their videos.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            So for them, I've been taking it and looking at the about:"
           </p>
           <p>
            One tack that could be taken is to get them on unlicensed use of copyrighted characters IF they haven't been altered significantly.  It would just mean "ratting them out" to Disney, Marvel, or whoever.  :)

             I'm fairly certain the big companies are aware of this. Because the CEOs of these companies are, for the most part, "one of them" as well. Stan Lee, Michael Esiner (and the new guy who runs Disney now), all these guys are part of the cabal.
