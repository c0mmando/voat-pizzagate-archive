<p>Also in 2008 there was the &quot;Body World\'s exhibition&quot;  where over 200 corpses where put on display, attempting to examine the &quot;cycle of life&quot;. One corpse was a pregnant woman with her unborn child still in the womb.

<p>Seems to have multiple in-direct links to Marina Abramovic. They were both visiting speakers in an event at the University of Oxford, Ruskin School of Art. Here <a href="http://www.rsa.ox.ac.uk/people/visiting-artists-speakers">http://www.rsa.ox.ac.uk/people/visiting-artists-speakers</a></p>
<p>Many articles online(some foreign) regarding them in the same light. Google searching &quot;gunther von hagens marina abramovic&quot; yields a ton of dirt.</p>

<p><strong>Relevancy:</strong> I bring this up because it\'s fairly clear in my opinion that Dr. Gunther is involved in highly questionable practices that could potentially involve human trafficking (dead or alive). He also appears to have the overwhelming support of overall establishment. A new viral video of his latest gallery of corpses is going around, causing a viral wave of people to accept this as the norm. They\'re thinking &quot;this is cool, this is acceptable, this is freedom of expression&quot;... When in reality, it\'s all pretty morbid to say the very least. Of course a friend of mine is completely oblivious to the occult world of expensive Art and it\'s connection to human-trafficking, murder, and morbid fetish\'s. Even still, she posted the short video on Dr. Gunther\'s latest gallery of corpses on display, and went on to defend his right to do it... Without responding to her post, I began digging for myself. Haven\'t found the smoking gun yet, but this guy is definitely been put on my watch list.</p>',
