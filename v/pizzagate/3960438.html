<p>This post gives a list of people at the WH meeting: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1513548">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1513548</a></p>
<p>According to WH records  Alefantis was invited there by Jared Oestermiller [Office of Management and Budget (OMB)].. and according to this Rense article all the participants at the meeting were gay activists: <a href="https://rense.com/general96/capricciopizza8.htm">https://rense.com/general96/capricciopizza8.htm</a></p>
<p>But I wanted to dig further for their connections and I found this: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/fC73mzk">https://imgur.com/a/fC73mzk</a>  <em>Jared Ostermiller, Alyssa Wilmoth Keegan (Maggie), and Will Gartshore (Stuart Gellman in next season\'s CAROLINE, OR CHANGE) at the opening night post-show reception of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF.</em></p>

<p>Prior to joining WWF, Will worked as a writer for the Energy Future Coalition, as a communications consultant for Independent Action PAC and as managing editor of the Greener Business Guide to Washington, DC. Will has also spent over 20 years as a professional actor and has worked in theaters in DC, New York, and around the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jared Ostermiller, Alyssa Wilmoth Keegan (Maggie), and Will Gartshore - all three were at that meeting that Alefantis attended. The event was a play at the Round House Theater in Washington, DC. </p>
<p>The other person at that meeting from the WWF was  Roberta P. Elias from World Wildlife Fund (WWF)  and we know about the links of that organisation to the Royal Family... hold that thought..</p>
<p>First I want to get to the actress Alyssa Wilmoth Keegan (Maggie). The thespians of Washington DC are a closely connected community and I remembered writing about an actress/yoga/herbalist young woman who have been murdered on Christmas Eve and had coincidentally and interestingly, met Prince Charles. The story always felt \'off\' to me and that\'s why I recorded it. One post:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1655747">The actress murdered in Washington had some connections that may of interest after all. THEARC, and even a Prince makes a brief appearance.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I have some interesting links with THEARC and therefore, the Alefantis set. Also, Tricia even met Prince Charles...

<p>Here is an article of Prince Charles visiting the farm during his Washington trip in May 2011.

<p>This was one of her instagram posts and I always felt it was some kind of message : <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BSskBYF">https://imgur.com/a/BSskBYF</a>  A ballet shoe left on her doorstep.  I know that she volunteered at the children\'s ballet at THEARC where Septime Webre (friend of Alefantis) was director at the time.</p>
<p>It just so happens that a link between Tricia and Alyssa Wilmoth Keegan  can be found.  In the Washington Blade (which covers news on the LGTB community) <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/05/16/fords-come-away-keegans-next-normal-among-2017-helen-hayes-award-winners/">Ford’s ‘Come From Away,’ Keegan’s ‘Next to Normal’ among 2017 Helen Hayes Award winners</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Monday the local theater scene honored its own with the 33rd annual Helen Hayes Awards. ..Theatre Alliance’s “Word Made Flesh” a play about young, unwed African-American fathers and their sons was named Outstanding Play (Helen). And Keegan Theatre’s “Next to Normal” won Outstanding Musical (Helen). Folger Theatre’s “Sense &amp; Sensibility” beat the competition for Outstanding Play (Hayes) and other categories.</p>
<p>About midway through the three-hour ceremony, out musical theater star Nicholas Rodriquez sang a stirring rendition of the late Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” in remembrance of theater professionals who died during the last year. <strong>A large projected image of Tricia McCauley, the well-loved actor who was murdered on Christmas day, received a strong reaction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alyssa Wilmoth Keegan received the trophy for Outstanding Lead Actress in Play (also Hayes) for her Maggie in gay playwright Tennessee William’s “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” at Round House Theatre.</strong> And Dorea Schmidt won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Play (Hayes) for her work in Woolly Mammoth’s lesbian-themed “Collective Rage: A Play in Five Boops.”</p>

<p>In this article: <a href="https://dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2018/09/21/review-living-and-dying-with-tricia-mccauley-at-venus-theatre/">Review: ‘Living and Dying with Tricia McCauley’ at Venus Theatre</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living and Dying with Tricia McCauley is a raw and personal journey through grief. Tricia McCauley, the local actress whose brutal 2016 murder rocked the theater community, was a personal friend and collaborator of Deborah Randall who wrote, produced, and directed this one-woman show, now playing at Venus Theatre in Laurel, MD. Randall, who is the founder and visionary behind Venus Theatre, is also the performer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Randall seems to be an interesting character with an interesting YT channel : <a href="https://youtu.be/1nqkEajZzeg">TPTB: Little Girl</a>  and in her latest video she talks about Tricia and the themes of frolicking and magic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hl2SNEQm6aA">https://youtu.be/hl2SNEQm6aA</a>  This does not surprise me at all because that\'s the feeling that I get from this group of people. Themes of magic and witches are often within their theater works.

<p>On to Roberta Elias of WWF <a href="http://wwf.worldwildlife.org/site/MessageViewer?em_id=20601.0&amp;dlv_id=21641">http://wwf.worldwildlife.org/site/MessageViewer?em_id=20601.0&amp;dlv_id=21641</a></p>

More like TerraForm and bash <a href="https://voat.co/u/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>  Where have I heard that name TerraMar? Let\'s ask David Gordon</p>

Well sorry to see but David is busy with the Russians..Wait a minute, a Consulting firm demanding transformation and openly against POTUS is working with the Russian\'s? No way can\'t be. But where have I heard that name TerraMar? End part 1.....</p>

<p>The thread goes on about the symbology around Terramar and this tweet in particular compares the Terramar logo to the symbol of the Royal Arch Masons <a href="https://twitter.com/NavysBlood/status/1282825498674913280">https://twitter.com/NavysBlood/status/1282825498674913280</a></p>

            Review: ‘Living and Dying with Tricia McCauley’ at Venus Theatre
           </a>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Living and Dying with Tricia McCauley is a raw and personal journey through grief. Tricia McCauley, the local actress whose brutal 2016 murder rocked the theater community, was a personal friend and collaborator of Deborah Randall who wrote, produced, and directed this one-woman show, now playing at Venus Theatre in Laurel, MD. Randall, who is the founder and visionary behind Venus Theatre, is also the performer.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Randall seems to be an interesting character with an interesting YT channel :
           <a href="https://youtu.be/1nqkEajZzeg">
            TPTB: Little Girl
           </a>
           and in her latest video she talks about Tricia and the themes of frolicking and magic.

           </a>
           This does not surprise me at all because that's the feeling that I get from this group of people. Themes of magic and witches are often within their theater works.

            "Participants in the UK are dressed in yellow fisherman's outfits and placed on a virtual 'X', are said to "have the X Factor". [See explanation below]." This reminds me of J. Podesta's "fish in hand palm picture." Is Podesta a Royal Arch freemason? Other associations abound in relation to the Royal Arch mason post. Does the so-called "X-factor" refer to DNA (single x chromosome) or the ability to produce male children? Dunno. But something fishy is behind all this. The article says, "The child is dressed in a Yellow fisherman's outfit as part of a script from Alice in Wonderland, which is already on the Internet. The child is said to be "off to see Alice". It is something along the line of "I wish I wish I hadn't eat that fish" (that verse), and the child is electroshocked with the fish symbolising the womb, and the rod the phallus." If a fish symbolizes a  womb (not sure about that) did Podesta father 14 children for MK experiments? Seems dubious, but who knows?

             World leaders gathered to focus on ocean issues. The U.S. Department of State’s Our Ocean conference felt like a turning point in ocean policy. The focus was on success stories, solutions, and government commitments to conservation (see #1, above). Leonardo DiCaprio gave an impassioned keynote speech that became a cover story (

              “Obama, Leonardo DiCaprio Vow Efforts to Protect the Ocean”

              The Clinton Global Initiative

             is focusing on oceans. CGI (an initiative of the Clinton Foundation) has a strong history of fostering cross-sectoral action on important issues, via its promotion of concrete commitments from member organizations. CGI’s burgeoning Ocean Action Network will convene in 2015 to co-create solutions amongst industry, governments, NGOs, and philanthropists.
