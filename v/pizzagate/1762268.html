            I dont know what it is, but even though this guys spiritual-warrior angle pulls out some heavy impulse cringing on my part, this guy is intriguing as ever. When he "dna reads" and only closes his eyes and suddenly acts like he manifested how many times Pense raped...thats a bit much. I hope this guy wasnt a skitzoid and withered away due to not seeking out help. His final video makes me want to cry.

            Thank you for bringing this to my attention.  He is strangely compelling, though the way he accesses information is not something I understand.  He seems to be on to something.

            His last video was quite heart breaking.

             I agreed with you.  I normally would never post something of a "new age" nature; however there is something else going on here...he was begging for help, he wished more people cared like he did about the poor innocent children....and now the whole world is on it...hopefully he's smiling :)

               Can I go to bed now or do I have to download those pics, extract the color and ask google what color this is in order to prove to you it's blue?

            He was "channeling" the "galactic federation of light" in order to to fight the "reptilian aliens", who disguise themselves as humans (also by "channeling" them), so I don't know how serious we should take him. I mean his source is literally "the galactic federation of light".... This goes a little far, or no?

             This guy was crazy, talking about Galacticans and Mike Pence's light levels reaching 37%. So that's how he was able to psychically tell Mike Pence was murdering over 100 children.

             He claims he was being poisoned at night as he slept - but says he doesn't understand how they do it.  Also I have read of a cancer inducing ice dart that "melts" in the body and leaves no trace of the attack.  There is so much weird information swirling around, who knows what is true and what is not.  Reality ain't what it used to be - at least for me!

              The technology that exists is so unbelievable that it doesn't even need much effort to hide. No one believes it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember researching direct energy weapons. One of the search results was a link to a schizophrenia forum. This guy had accidentally recorded his voices. A male and female voice having a conversation about how much the guy sucked. If that was a legit situation, it's going to take a lot to get ourselves out of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fun fact: V2k (voice to skull) technology was successful in the 50's. Tested in MKULTRA, victims reported things like their cereal talking to them. In court it came out that the voice and frequency transmissions for silent sound traveled on ambient sound to the target. Like a piggy back ride. So things like rice crispies or a sink emptying would make sound that would normally only be heard on the subconscious level (silent sound transmission) audible with louder ambient noise.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't have source info handy, but this information was included in the declassified MKULTRA documents...that weren't destroyed. Sorry, rant over:)

             he mentions all the milabs and where they are all at invluding the four horsemen nazi Denver airport with with that fuck boi horse statue with the red eyes. He basically confirmed the govt is a bunch of nazi war criminal spirits reincarnated put in after 1945. Especially Not to mention all the nazi references and child molester art everywhere at the Denver airport The art is what confirms Tory smith's claims about everyone in govt being nazi war criminals and their souls being kept for the "prize of America". there is a blatant nazi mural at Denver along with the eh fact that it is built by nazis in the shape of a swastika. Germans/reptilian hijacked bodies were skeeeetch. Honestly surprised that shit hasn't been raided.

             He also mentions the department of homeland security was created by adolf hitler. Well George bush created the department of homeland security. And his birthday checks out. He was born not too long after adolf hitler passed away in 1945.

           <p>
            So that's the reason he gave no attribution?  His sources were "esoteric?"  Was he dabbling in the occult?
           </p>
           <p>
            All he did was read lists of "offenses."  Nothing to check.
           </p>
           <p>
            He looked quite ill in his later/final videos.  It was said that he died of "cancer," which may have been secondary to compromised immune system (HIV/AIDS).

             There are accounts of the akashic records.  If it is possible to tap into this, then perhaps he knows what he is talking about.

             A bit confusing that he says [in one of his videos] that Obama was arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             And elsewhere it is claimed that some MKUltra/Monarch slaves have the gift of foresight.  [Sorry, can't find source, but it was the "slave" who claimed she was the FBI director's sex slave] - anyone, please post link if you're familiar with that tract.

               In the case of remote viewing, it is a technological advance in intelligence that in overrunning the old ways of intelligence of blackmail, force, and corruption. Working from the truth of the Akashic records...  [I didn't notice mention of the Akashic records on first reading]
              </p>
              <p>
               The reason I am sure that intelligence will go this way is because my remote viewing skills were so sought after and fetched such high prices.
              </p>
              <p>
               The truth of the matter is that more than sex and drugs, people want to be free of their internal doubts and torments. Men paid a lot more to see me than the White House beauties for that reason. A really stunning girl went for 30,000 a day and Rockefeller was getting 30 times that for me.
              </p>
              <p>
               On the face of it a tall story, but most certainly worth a read if you haven't seen it already.

             I fully expected reactions like yours; however he is making some very serious claims and I feel his voice/sources should at least be considered...if you watch how fast he died and how healthy he looked in the video right before he went for his police interview (where he states they may try to kill him)...he went down fast...but i get where you are coming from too.

              I know we try to stay with concrete observable facts here, but there is something believable about Tory Smith's claims.  It would be ignorant to assert that only that which we see is real.  Radio waves and germs are beyond our senses but we know they are real.  Also I see no reason why all beings beyond our perception have to be bad guys.  At any rate, Tory's deep caring for children in undeniable.

            Truly interesting. However, one thing I can debunk because I have done research in this area (although I welcome proof that I am wrong here): PepsiCo (and others) do not put aborted fetuses in their soda. What they do is use certain cells of aborted fetuses and use them for
            <em>
             research
            </em>
            on flavors. (Not that I like that either ...)

             Yes, I have heard the same thing.  But the fact they would even conceive of even experimenting with a fetus adding flavor is deeply disturbing.

              Maybe we mean the same thing. Just for clarification: The fetus cells themselves do not add flavor. It is the chemical process for developing new flavors they want to study. But as I said, even this is a terrible thing to do.
