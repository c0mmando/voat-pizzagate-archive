            Brock's Media Matters was still defending ACORN after Veritas exposed them for child trafficking. Podesta had influence over ACORN prior to them being exposed for child sex trafficking by Veritas. He was secretly laundering Soros money to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to point out load and clear that this isn't the first time Brock and Media Matters have defended crimes against children.

             *"ACORN has repeatedly and deliberately engaged in systematic fraud and that the group hides behind a paper wall of nonprofit corporate protections to conceal a criminal conspiracy on the part of its directors, to launder federal money in order to pursue a partisan political agenda and to manipulate the American electorate." *

             October 1, 2009, President Obama signed into law legislation known that effectively prohibits the federal government from granting taxpayer dollars to “ACORN and any ACORN-related affiliate.”

             "Re ACORN, it seems to me that the analysis should be whether solicitation of crimes (election fraud, tax fraud, human smuggling, prostitution) is ACORN policy, or does the latest scandal reflect the "stick it to da man" attitude of the kind of street operatives ACORN attracts and recruits. As GF says, you judge them by what they do, not what they say. Either way, they need to clean up quickly or disappear: They are hurting the reputation of people far better than they are, whether or not you agree with the liberal agenda. And in fairness, when crimes are committed by, say, the CIA, we don't say the individual operatives dunnit: We say the CIA dunnit."

             Judicial Watch obtains FBI investigation documents. Reports that though ACORN changed it's name after the scandal and bankruptcy, it now operates in the form of numerous state entities and in such affiliated organizations. ACORN uses the same network and institutions and revenue streams, including

             I think Patrick Gaspard is still there. Director of Political Affairs. He's closely affiliated with ACORN and all sorts of labor unions, SEIU etc.*
            </p>
            <p>
             The brother of Patrick Gaspart is Michael Gaspard, who is Counsel for The Advance Group (ACORN spin off)

            Guys we need to stop trying to turn this into a battle. We are all on the same side here. If we focus on doing good investigative work and producing solid leads and attention. None of the mud they sling will stick.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to make it so they only things they can say about pizzagate when they look for the facts are good things that are
            <strong>
             true
            </strong>
            and verifiable with
            <strong>
             sources
            </strong>
            !
           </p>
           <p>
            But we have to stay objective, discern for ourselves if an article is true but looking at  its sources or doing a quick google. And if found to be false call them out downvote and ignore. But continue investigating.

             Brock was at one time a alleged conservative who went after the corruption of the Clinton's in the Whitehouse. He switched sides is a partner to James Alefantis and created Media Matters a literal "fake news" site to attack real news. He also was involved in a blackmail case with a former associate who wanted to talk. There are pictures of him with Alefantis and in his house.?How is he not being shut down by authorities for spreading "fake news." He is hiding his real relationship, scrubbing his history, pretending to be objective thereby intentionally misleading people.
