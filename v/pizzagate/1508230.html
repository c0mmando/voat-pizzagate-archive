            Snopes "fact checked" the notion that putting pedophile symbols on children's merchandise is harmful to children. Snopes found that this notion was false, and that putting pedophile symbols on children's merchandise is not harmful to children.

            So rest assured parents, you can count on Snopes to think for you when it comes to what is best for your children. You officially have the green light from Snopes to put pedophile symbols on your children's belongings in order to teach them to associate pedophile symbols with fun, toys, games and more.

              Snopes feigns retardation in order to red herring people away from logical thought.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "(As we have noted in the past, fear of "pedophile code" imagery is occasionally the basis for panic, but law enforcement officials believed that the symbols themselves are used among adults to signal preferences, not as labels for children, not as markers placing them in any danger.)"
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              That point from them is completely irrelevant. Putting the symbols on child merchandise is meant to get children to associate the symbols with toys, games and general fun. It is meant to create a positive association with the symbols in the child's mind. It is self-explanatory how this is ultimately harmful/dangerous for children. It is also a way for pedophiles who work with children to signal each other subtly. For example, if someone saw that stuffed toy truck in a daycare center, most people would think nothing of it. But a pedophile would be able to recognize it and begin testing the daycare workers/owner further to see if there was a predatory opportunity going on. The daycare owner could also then claim ignorance and act shocked if someone pointed it out, plausible deniability that would not be possible if they had put up specific artwork of the symbols and so on. And of course any pedophiles who see the merchandise can then purchase it for that reason.
             </p>
             <p>
              Snopes also lies so blatantly that the readers would have to completely retarded not to realize it.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The symbol on the plush monster truck was similar:
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              No it is an EXACT MATCH which the readers can see staring them in the face with the images right there.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               It was also similar to the logo of popular surf brand Roxy, which features a large line of clothing for young children and tweens
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              No, the Roxy heart looks
              <strong>
               nothing like it
              </strong>
              which again, readers can see for themselves in the article. It is
              <strong>
               staring them in the face.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              How in the world could anyone be so retarded as to look at that STARING THEM IN THE FACE and nod in agreement? Really?
