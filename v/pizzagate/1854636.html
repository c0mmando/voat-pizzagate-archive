<p>See article about taking two children lungs and hybrid with pigs. Anyone else find it odd they felt they needed to say kids were &quot;likely in a car accident&quot;.

All these &quot;cutting age sciences&quot;, like what Epstein seems to support, the stem cells needed seem to be best from YOUNG children or aborted fetuses. We know where the aborted come from, but where are all these young kids coming from??</p>

<p>Also, there is a shortage of Nitrious oxcide nationwide. A endontist friend of mine was talking about it a month and a half ago. I just talked to him last night, he said it is now a very serious issue. Supposedly caused by a fire at the plant. One plant? Or it\'s being used a LOT more? I\'ve read other reports that shipments are being fulfilled, everything is fine. That is not true.

            I think Jeffrey holds medical and scientific conferences on his island as a cover for himself and his buddies. Serious collaboration of brilliant minds during the day,  debauchery at night or maybe the other way around. His sexual tastes have been described in detail by some of his girls and they don't include dental chairs but maybe some of his friends have dental hygienist fantasies. Anyway at his age he is bound to have lots of dental problems and no self respecting billionaire would be caught dead walking into a dentist office. Instead you fly in your favorite dentist and give him or her a nice bonus for the house call. And I mean this sincerely, I'm not being sarcastic. ,

             I can see the house calls, but searching on all different stem cell researchers right now, there are a ton of research centers, world wide. All these centers need access to to healthy, young NON damaged (important) tissue and organs. So, think about it, what huge dollars would be involved to those who Broker this. A "foundation" that "supports" state of the art research like stem cells sounds almost like a Broker.
            </p>
            <p>
             I feel like every stem cell research center needs to be closely examined.Who owns them, connected to them and where exactly are they getting the human tissues/organs that are young and in great shape?
