           It's why they label Pizzagate as fake and attack us. All of it comes from a single source. I uploaded it on my YouTube page. This particular incident caused an outrage and was called the Sinclair Incident. They gave the same exact script to multiple newscasters at completely different stations.

            Most of the news comes from the AP newswire. Could explain a lot of the similarities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reuters is another newswire.

            Yet you guys can't figure out that the theater between Trump and the media is also fake. He is one of them. They all work for Rothschild. No matter how many times you are told arresr are a comin, and it doesn't happen, you go back to the anonymous source like it is credible and proven.  Trump is pushing their agenda 21, the Rothschild and Rockefeller UN agenda. All spooks are Masons, Trump is a Mason, a Jesuit. Mocking bird is old news. It is the mockingbird media and the Smith-mundt media, propaganda was made legal. There is no PG investigation, it was a cover-up. There are no PG arrest coming. you don't arrest people duirng a cover-up, you protect them for doing their job. Keep waiting for Q to "come through". That's what they want you do, waiting, not acting, giving in to hope instead if initiating action. At least the French have some balls, even if they don't fully understand it is Rothschild cartel steering their government. For the record, I am fine with the 500 million number, you guys are too stupid to rule yourselves or have a say in the plan, ya gotta go. Support Trump and agenda 21, I'm just watching the show and mocking the sheeple. Shame I will likely get wiped out with the rest of you grass eaters, but thats the way it goes. They are smarter than you, in control, and you think what they allow you to think. They win. But maybe Trump and Q are really secretly fighting for you behind the scenes, right?

             I added or until we all take back our world if you saw the second part of that. I don't wait for Q to come through I have been doing Pizzagate research and running that PG redpill YouTube page for over a year now trying to do something about it. You can lay down and die DeathToMasonsASAP because it sounds like you already gave up. As you said you are just here for the show, so why are you here? To mock people trying to stop this? Q may be a psyop, he might not be, but we haven't all given up yet. Their is no future for Humanity with your line of thinking.

             Have to agree it looks like this. I’ve been watching this for a while and it’s just more of th same. There’s more child prostitution busts it seems like but no big names going to jail or worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q by an honest assessment, looks like a psyop to get “muh patriots” to do what hey have been doing great for decades: absolutely nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don’t bother getting angry or violent and make sure to call anyone a shill who wants to take action. Why? Because trust the plan. Same bullshit as Jesus is going to save you. Same bullshit they’ve been peddling the masses for centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m cool with the 500 million number also but I hope I survive and that the coming world isn’t too bad. I actually like life and the earth and think it will be a lot better with a lot less people.

            See this is why i hate politics in entertainment or anything. Because the CIA and propaganda and ruining what i love. I don't want Anita Sarkeesian feminist style politics in my entertainment, i don't want politics in football, i don't want politics in my movies, i don't want police using a Punisher logo or thin blue line, i don't want that stupid shit period. Don't use my toys as a cultural battlefield.

                 Wow! With those pictures actually on their website, wth are they still walking around ? I was outraged just by that shady login page... if I had seen those pictures (so glad I didn’t) I might have lost my mind at that time . Nothing shocks me anymore, but this seriously is shocking !!

            </p>
            <p>
             "The real $64,000 question here is why the Obama Administration has literally encouraged the mass migration of thousands upon thousands of unaccompanied children across a very harsh and dangerous border.  Why would those in authority put children in harm’s way like this?  Certainly when they finally arrive at the various border checkpoints these children are then inprocessed and taken where?  Who are the guardians?  As wards of the state, where are they housed and fed?  What is their ultimate destination?
            </p>
            <p>
             That brings us to the county Child Protective Services and Foster Care System that are so abusive to children it’s downright scary.  If this is where the illegal alien children are ending up, it is now common knowledge that many are in extreme danger.  Adults looking for child slaves and pedophiles desiring young traumatized children are notorious for becoming foster parents.  In many instances these children are the very ones that end up in a Pizzagate type of situation—sexual fodder for Washington’s elites."

              I remember that. They were the "journalists" held in NKorea I think. Obama got them out, but some thought they may have been involved in trafficking. I think the girl is one of the journalists daughter. But they are eating PIZZA.

              Reuters has a cozy pic of BILL CLINTON, the rescued journalist and her young daughter. BILL  just so happened to be sent by Obama to collect the 2 journalists from ROCKETMAN KIM.  Hmmmm. Where was Laura Silsby?

             "...sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch" was not written by Hillary. It was written by Lewis Amselem, OAS in an email that included Uma.....who would show it to Hillary as Sec. of State.

            <p>
             "The sordid history of Lewis Amselem, Deputy U.S. Permanent Representative to the OAS In 1989, the Current U.S. Representative to the OAS Covered Up a Case of Torture in Guatemala
            </p>
            <p>
             "denounced years ago for having concealed the identities of individuals, one of whom was a U.S. national, who tortured and raped a U.S. nun in Guatemala."
            </p>
            <p>
             With fingers crossed, the old rabbit's foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the
backyard to Moloch . . .

             This could be taken as tongue in cheek, were it not for the fact, Alefantis features the Moloch programming also.

             I did a VOAT post on this also: #chickenlovers and sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3036281

            <p>
             The bigger story was the "interference" by the Clinton State Dept. in the Honduran coup aftermath which destabilized the country and created the flood of "unaccompanied children" illegally into the U.S. under Obama. Many of these children "disappeared." I guess that one chicken sacrificed was multiplied many times over.

            Pizzagate was the distraction to dismantle the awakening. Pedogate is real.

             Pedogate is the distraction to chase us off from pizzagate. Success. Now this sub spends it's time s trying to expose who is and is not a pedo. Like I care. The CIA, government, FBI, celebrity, systematic satanic kidnap, rape, torture, murder, organ harvesting of children was what was being revealed. Now it is reduced to this director likes boys.  James Alefantis Rothschild and the agencies continue with impunity while you call random hollywood losers creeps. Great job.

              Like you care if someone is a pedo? That's pretty effed up man, if you dont care about something that can ruin a kids life forever. Pedogate isnt just about a few actors who have an attraction to kids. I think you misunderstand the scope of pedogate which is why you're saying it's the distraction. Pizzagate implied there there were DC connections at a pizza parlor sacrificing children.  Pedogate implied a worldwide connection of human trafficking networks run and funded by politicians/actors/occultists/cia/mossad/etc. Pedogate is not a new idea. It has slowly been exposed over the decades. Pizzagate however is a new idea. Not to say that the pizza lingo isnt relevant, but nobody is sacrificing children in a pizza parlor. It's just the gathering place for all the murdering pedophile faggots to get all hot and bothered for the after party somewhere else.

             We lost what little we had of a republic/democracy, take your pick , the day JFK was murdered. Then we went full fascist when g bush stole the 2000 and 2004 elections. Hitler liked little girls and his nazi band of brothers were pedophiles. When they invaded Italy, the little boys were getting raped. Mothers went to Germany and talked to the wives. It stopped. There is a direct correlation between fascist governments and pedophilia. They do not like women or children  , so the pedophilia is accepted. The reason the catholic church and western governments condone it is because they are all fascist. Although , I think , there is a definite shift happening..social media and websites like voat.

              We have a Constitutional Republic until the Constitution is Constitutionally changed and ratified. The citizens are the 4th branch os government. Powers not enumerated in the Constitution are left to the states and the PEOPLE. The citizens job is also to defend the Constitution.

             The Dangers of Democracy
            </p>
            <p>
             "Democracy.  The word is nearly ubiquitous in American political discourse.  We routinely refer to our country and those modeled after our own as democracies.  We listen to speeches, read books, and profess our belief in democratic principles, democratic governments, and democratic ideals. Americans in the modern world completely fail to comprehend two important points.  The first is that America -- as organized under the Constitution -- is not a democracy.  The second is that democracy, in its pure form, is nothing more than mob rule."
