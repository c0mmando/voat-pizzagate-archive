What I\'ve been pondering all morning is that since we have no other reported sightings of these two since the <a href="http://kfor.com/2017/04/03/video-shows-tennessee-teacher-suspected-of-kidnapping-student-walking-into-oklahoma-city-walmart/">March 15th visit to Wal-Mart</a> in Oklahoma City, why haven\'t we been given any more information?  Why did it take 2 weeks before these images were released to the public?  Why do we only have these images?  Why not the parking lot, so we can confirm whether or not they were still in the silver Nissan Rogue?

<p>There are traffic <a href="http://www.oktraffic.org/map.php?location=okc">Cameras</a> All throughout the center of Oklahoma City, and the cameras closest to Rte 35 and rte 240 should have picked something up around the same time, shouldn\'t they?  At least to point in a direction?

<p>There\'s just such a blinding lack of information going on in this case.  A lot of questions.  It pisses me off.  They\'ve got to have some idea of where Cummins is.
