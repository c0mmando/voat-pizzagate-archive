<p>The man who founded Domino\'s is Tom Monaghan.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino\'s_Pizza">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino\'s_Pizza</a></p>
<p>Tom Monaghan is the founder of a project called Ave Maria University.

<p>Notable from this article is:
\'The University\'s Founders Club, which was established by Tom Monaghan, advertised that the purpose of OBS was \'to find solutions to sensitive situations confronting priests and religious in accordance with the authentic teaching of the Church.\'
<strong>\'\'Outplacement services\' for \'sensitive situations\'? Translation: OBS helps to quietly shuffle around pederast priests....</strong> (bold mine)</p>
<p>So, if Tom Monaghan was protecting pedofiles in 2010, and Dominos was founded in 1960...there could be more to this story.</p>
<p>I would like to note that Michigan has been associated with ritual abuse and satanic cults in the past.

            Thomas Monaghan was also the founder of "Legatus", a Catholic business organization filled with power-players of business and industry. Legatus has its hands on lots of things, and if anyone investigated it fully, they'd be fairly disgusted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reinhart of enterprisecorruption.com was able to predict the stock market crash of 2008 by the timing of Legatus meetings. Seriously.

            I'm just asking the question to the group. If you are interested in states with high percentages of ritual abuse cases, read Transformation of America and find out more about Michigan and Tennessee. There are indeed states where pedos are major politicians and therefore rings are allowed to thrive and generational abuse victims are farmed. Literally produced to be of service to the system. It's sick, I know, but it's real.

            Knight of Malta. (Like Bill Clinton, the Bushes, Greenspan, Guiliani, Murdoch, Kissinger, Reagan, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Judge Scalia and many more). And this just happened: "Pope Francis has taken control of the Knights of Malta. To non-Catholics, this move may seem like an obscure intramural skirmish, but it has sent shock waves throughout the Roman Catholic world."

             Holy shit. Scalia was killed because he was going to squeal on the whole pedofile ring, which would have brought down people on your list. Ave Maria is a big thread to start to unravel. Thanks for your reply!

            You're missing your target.  The University Founders Club is not your target.  Opus Bono Sacerdotii is.  You shift to talking about OBS without saying what it is or what it stands for.
            <a href="https://opusbono.org/">
             https://opusbono.org/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And looking into OBS which I never heard of, I think this conclusion is off
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             OBS helps to quietly shuffle around pederast priests
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            OBS doesn't seem to be in the business of shuffling, they seem like the last resort.  This is not what the Catholic Bishops have been accused of in the Spotlight Days.  These seems post-Spotlight.  In the case of OBS, these priests have either been accused or found guilty.  It seems to me that this is an organization that helps disgraced priests after the Church has kicked them out or is thinking about kicking them out.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have a section on their website for Priest stories.  Here's one of them.
           </p>

            <pre><code>Not everyone can visit a priest in prison or assist him when he’s released, often with nowhere to go and no one to turn to.  However, because of your continued generosity, you are fulfilling the Gospel message of Jesus Christ the High Priest: “For I was [a priest] in prison and you visited me.” Matt 25:39

“Dear Joe, I’m writing in the hope that you can assist a priest like me in my planning for life after prison.  I am eighty-four years old.  I was sentenced to a term of 12-15 years in 2004 in State prison.  With time served in county jail before the trial, and in consideration of “good time” credits earned in prison, I will be completing my sentence and released next month. 

I have no place to go.  I have no money.  And I’ve outlived the family and friends who could have helped me.  My only source of income after incarceration will be Social Security (I think about $500/month).  Of course, I have not been allowed to collect SS while incarcerated, so I have no savings.  I was told to write to you by an official at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.  I was informed that they don’t help priests like me, but they said that you do.

            Further evidence that this is about disgraced priests is on their FAQ page where they mention:.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Laicization is the loss of the clerical state, which returns the priest to the functionality of a lay person
This was what some churches call being "defrocked."

           <p>
            The FAQ is mostly legal defense advice for priests, canonical legal defense.

            1a. The Bishop and the Vicar General would like to see me tomorrow at 3pm in the Chancery. I am not sure what it is about, but like many of us in the presbyterate, I suspect it may not be good. I do not have a canon lawyer to go with me.  What should I do?
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              I have heard horror stories about how priests have been "railroaded" by diocesan review boards, how long will it take for my canonical case?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              What does it tell us priests when an accused bishop gets to have a thorough, professional investigation and an accused priest does not?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Can a bishop simply "fire" one of his priests? It seems like all they want to do with those of us accused is make us go away. I've never even been able to talk to my bishop directly.

            It seems clear that priests come to this organization after their Diocese has punished or is contemplating punishment against them.

             I've read everything by Robert Anton Wilson, one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century. He wrote a lot about conspiracies and secret societies and has a large following among modern mystics and spiritual seekers. I highly recommend his books Prometheus Rising and Quantum Psychology to anyone who wants to understand the human mind. His message is always very optimistic and positive, though a thorough understanding of the 8 circuit neurological/psychological model can be used for negative purposes, of course.

              Yeah I was actually interested in the Prometheus rising book after I looked at his other books, looks like something I would read. Says in wiki that Prometheus rising spawned a philosophy of sorts that has to do with cycles of human behavior, they use the term "scripts". So that is interesting as well to me because look at this cycle...1989 guy with gun shoots hole in pizza joint over what he believes is some kind of conspiracy involving the proprietor of said pizza place. 2016 guy with gun shoots hole in pizza joint over what he believes to be some kind of conspiracy involving the proprietor of said pizza place. Both situations ended in no blood shed, police called them both paranoid. Here I sit reading about pizza gate stuff and I bump into the story from 1989 its just trippy is what I'm saying.

            You should really read the Post about the Domino BDSM ad that will not be show on tv but is all over the internet.  Really creepy and will do a lot to verify your post.  It made me a believer although I had already had questions about Domino Pizza.  See my other comment here.

              I have been suspicious of Dominos for quite some time and really was already convinced when I read about the domination and domino symbol and JP emails.  How much evidence do people need?  Edit:  With the article in my comment and him in an orphanage, well gee folks.

                Well, I looked up St. Joseph's Children's Home and it specializes in care for physical and sexual abuse and behavioral problems, but since they were pretty small at the time, it could mean they were abused before he came to the Home.  Not saying it did not happen there.  He had a brother too. still digging. Will see if there are any charges of abuse against the home and also it mentioned in his wiki report that it was a serious let down his being discharge from the Seminary since he had a sincere desire to become a priest.  After investigating so much lately about the Archdiocese and the priests and their victims I am totally convinced that he was abused.  I wonder if Cardinal Bevilacqua has been in his life other than a mentor? Well, In 2012, a document was discovered showing that Cardinal Bevilacqua had ordered Monsignor James Molloy, now deceased, who served in the Office of the Vicar to Cardinal Bevilacqua until 1994, to destroy a list of 35 abusive priests. Monsignor William Lynn was accused of covering up cases of abuse by archdiocesan priests, having at the time been the highest U.S. Catholic Church official to face criminal charges.  So he was much more guilty of hiding abuse than I thought.  What a strange person to pick for your mentor.

                 Good luck with that. No worries. Focus on your stuff. I will have a look at it. Bet it leads to Clinton Foundation. They love kids, organs, guns, drugs, influence peddling and selling favors. Selling anything really.

            Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan is a Catholic devout and activist. He is the founder of Legatus, and is a close friend of Cardinal Bevilacqua, who was for many long years his ecclesiastical advisor. He still calls him "invaluable" and a "dear friend".Cardinal Bevilacqua was found by a grand jury to have excused and enabled the sexual abuse of dozens of priests on hundreds of children at the Philadelphia Archdiocese between 1987 and 2003. He covered up and transferred an extremely dangerous predator, Father Romano J. Ferraro, who is now serving a life sentence. Three priests and a parochial school teacher were arrested for the rape and assault of young children in their care.   Being that Monaghan defends him does not say much for him.  Just sayin',

              He was made Chairman of the Papal Foundation.  To be a member a donation of no less than $1M is required.  Pope Benedict XVI managed it.  Whoa!  Fiona Barnett named him in her account of rape and mayhem.  I am convinced that Legatus has something sinister going on.

              I am sorry to say I am just realizing how bad it is.  I left them years ago but dabble once in awhile.  Praying and such.  I am ready to believe almost any thing after what I have read on here.  I came from reddit/pizzagate.  Red pilled is now in my vocabulary.   Religion is what is the center of all of our problems.  Holy crap is all I can say.  Thanks for all your research I will read and watch videos little at a time.  This is a lot to take in all at once.

              This must of been the article I read about how the name Domino's came about.  It was a delivery driver who thought of the name after delivering a pizza one night.  He said he knew what to call it instead of DomiNicks. Call it Domino's and since Monghan had at that point had 3 places, he put three dots.  He said he would add a dot after each new pizza place was secured.  He commented at that point he did not realize he would own so many franchises!

            I actually wondered the same thing... I mean what are the chances that "playing dominoes on cheese or pasta" would be a phrase you use in pedo circles... 
How long has the term "Dominoes" as a code word for S&amp;M been around? If Domino's was founded in 1960 there may be a quick way to eliminate or confirm the suspicion for further research?

             Where is the actual evidence that Dominoes means S&amp;M.  Does any corroboration exist before the Pizzagate theory?  Unlike "cheese pizza" for CP, there seems to be no actual evidence of prior history for Dominoes.

              Domino just means domination, not S&amp;M. It's just word play that is great for pedos because they get a symbol (a domino) to use and illustrate sex with a child. In every case, the adult is the dominant force. Thanks for your comment. :)

               Let me rephrase.   Where is the actual evidence that Domino is code for domination?   (an aspect of S&amp;M, btw.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Where is the corroborating evidence that code was in use before the Pizzagate theory.  I contend this doesn't exist before the emails came out and people started searching for code.

              The word Domino means dominate in Spanish, so in s&amp;M the domino or domino the game played with dominoes simply refers to the game.

               Domino in spanish means the same thing in English.
              </p>
              <p>
               OR
              </p>
              <p>
               It's the first person conjugation of dominar      So it would be I dominate.
              </p>
              <p>
               But that aside, how does that apply in this case?

            Is this a stretch?  Yes...that being said, I find Monaghan's choice of charities to be curious considering what Catholic priests and "outplacement" and "sensitive situations" generally means.  I say keep digging...look for anything hinky by people/companies working with or for Monaghan's charities.  Also, don't forget to also search names in the Podesta and Clinton wikileaks for connections.  Podesta is Catholic as well.  Keep us posted.

            I just checked out domino's former mascot (the noid) wiki page... not that this is related but apparently a guy by the name of Kenneth Lamar Noid became convinced the noid mascot was a personal attack on him by Tom Monaghan. In 1989 Kenneth walked into a domino's in Atlanta GA with a handgun and took the employees hostage. He demanded a pizza, 100,000, a helicopter, and a copy of a book called The Widow's Son. The book is an Illuminati themed work fiction part of a trilogy.

             Interesting that Kenneth Noid claimed that Thomas Monaghan used to come into his apartment.

             Here a journalist refers to the Noid as a pervert and finishes with the statement that Kenneth killed himself.

              Yeah I read about all that. It seems like no one really knows what happened to Kenneth after the incident. I though it seems fishy like a psy op type situation. Who has the last name Noid anyway? I'd love to find more information on Kenneth.

               Weird, but he claimed that Dominos owner Tom Monaghan used to come into his apartment, and a journalist uses the word "pervet" in conjunction with the Noid.

                right he was institutionalized and then killed himself a few years later I gathered that. That isn't much info imo. Was he living alone before this? Or with family? what about when he killed himself? Did he leave a note? Were was he institutionalized and for how long? Meds? Did he make any claims after the incident? Whats the deal with the book, seems really the most odd thing he asked for. I didn't see the pervert part before that is weird and seems like it was shoe horned in there. I also find it weird they use the three names thing that you see a lot with so called crazy people. Lee harvy Oswald, John wilks booth.. ect.

                A subsequent court hearing found Noid innocent by reason of insanity; a paranoid schizophrenic, he was found to have “acute psychological problems,” was turned over to the Department of Human Resources, and ended up in Georgia’s Mental Health Institute, where he spent three months. Years later, in 1995, unable to shake the idea that the Domino’s ad campaign had intentionally targeted him, Noid committed suicide in his Florida apartment

             Nothing surprises me, but this behavior (psychotic break in programming) is consistent among people used by this system...which includes mind control and ritual abuse. Could be that Noid was trying to break out/away from same system he saw Momaghan as representing. Very interesting. Thank you.

            Sannlelkurrin, I think you have gathered together a good set of links supporting the questions you are raising and the hypothesis that Domino's guy could be involved. I will leave this up, and flair it as a "Potential Lead".
           </p>
           <p>
            A direction you and others might want to take for additional research would be to look at Monaghan's family and see if he perhaps has a relative who is a sex-offender. Maybe an uncle or brother.
           </p>

            One thing I will add: Catholics are obliged to reach out to sinners of all types, including pedophiles, to invite repentance and acceptance of salvation. The OBS group could be an authentic product of Christian mercy and not supportive of pedophile crime at all.

             Thanks. The comments here have already been helpful. I'll keep looking. The hiding in plain sight thing was what made me post this to start a discussion. Literally driving by and seeing the logo everyday. A small amount of research made a connection, but I get your point about sinners of all types.

             One of the Corporal Works of Mercy is to
             <em>
              To visit the imprisoned, or ransom the captive.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             So yes, it doesn't mean you approve of the crime, just that the criminal is a human being.
