<p>Erica Gomez of El Paso, who is seventeen years old faces capital murder charges for the Feb. 9 killing of her newborn child by way of 9 stab wounds.</p>
<p>Gomez, a student El Dorado High School was arrested 14 days after the murder and is being held at El Paso County jail on an $800,000 bond facing capital murder charges.</p>
<p>I reached out to Gomez’ classmates and friends to find out what Gomez’ story was. All of them range between the ages of 15-17 and as minors I promised not to reveal their names and or identities.</p>
<p>Many didn’t know she was pregnant, others claimed she was going to keep the baby and sell it, others said she was going to move out and live with her boyfriend who was stringing her along. The stories were conflicting but the majority of them in the chat group we created said it was an abortion and she shouldn’t be in jail.</p>
<p>Many of them quoted the snippets of coverage by MSM who claimed killing a child up until the time of birth is a “right of women’s health”. All these young children believe they have the right to end the life of an infant because “My Body My Right”.</p>
<p>What this young lady did was murder. She stabbed an innocent young baby girl 9 times and abandoned her in a shed and went straight to back to bed. The rhetoric of the radical leftists MSM along with the educational system that purports radical grievances and ideologies has torn the fabric of basic morals and the sanctity of life.</p>
<p>I reached out to Beto’s campaign team for a comment multiple times one person from his Presidential campaign team in El Paso with broken English said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t know of the case which you speak of but as President he intends for every woman to have the right to abort a baby she created at any stage of the pregnancy”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I followed up with a question:</p>
<p>“So, if it’s easier to give birth to the baby and then kill it to save money is that an abortion or OK?”</p>
<p>The answer was chilling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some people don’t have money to go to the hospital it’s expensive. Her body her choice P@t@ (explicit Spanish word for prostitute)!” and the call was disconnected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who is teaching these young girls and women that a human life is so worthless?</p>
