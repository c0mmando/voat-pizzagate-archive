            "Brock Pierce is one of the founders of bitcoin" This is not true. Pierce claims early adoption of digital currency because he used to run a company that mined virtual gold. This is not crypto-currency but later he inserted himself into the space as an investor and was eventually elected to the board of the Bitcoin Foundation. The Foundation is a self-appointed bunch and not necessarily well-liked by actual bitcoiners. It's a lobby group, and they have lost the game to Perianne Boring, the former RT journalist who runs a bitcoin advocacy firm in Washington D.C. Pierce doesn't seem to be associating his previous life with bitcoin, albeit his occupancy of the Puerto Rico Children's Museum is somewhat creepy. He was welcomed back into the establishment when he joined the Clinton Global Initiative. The fall of the CF is going to create an immense vacuum in the field of "protecting pedophiles from scrutiny in exchange for political donations". That's why I have renewed looking into what he's up to. I'm glad I'm not the only one!!!!

            Their network is falling apart at the seams, like spaceys House of Cards it is LITERALLY going to fall like one ALL around these fuckers eventually. Keep hammering away everywhere you can on social media this beast WILL get damaged well enough for it to be recognized the world over if they don't succeed with their plans b4 we do.

              This is not true either.  The author of the bitcoin technology was someone going by Satoshi Nakamoto.
             </p>
             <p>
              From Wiki.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009."
...
On 18 August 2008, the domain name "bitcoin.org" was registered.[29] In November that year, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System[6] was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[29] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open source code and released it in January 2009 on SourceForge.[30][31][13] The identity of Nakamoto remains unknown.[12]
              </p>
              <p>
               In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first ever block on the chain, known as the genesis block.[32][33] Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the following text:
              </p>
              <p>
               The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.[13]
              </p>
              <p>
               This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.[34]:18
              </p>
              <p>
               The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPOW) in 2004.[35] Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto.[36][37] Other early cypherpunk supporters were Wei Dai, creator of bitcoin predecessor b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold.[38]
              </p>
              <p>
               In the early days, Nakamoto is estimated to have mined 1 million bitcoins.[39] In 2010, Nakamoto handed the network alert key and control of the Bitcoin Core code repository over to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation.[40][41] Nakamoto subsequently disappeared from any involvement in bitcoin.[42] Andresen stated he then sought to decentralize control, saying: "As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the first things I did was try to decentralize that. So, if I get hit by a bus, it would be clear that the project would go on."[42] This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin.[43]

            You're wrong about bitcoin. It has no official founders or creators, no one's really sure who made it but it is open source which is what allows us to trust it. You should support cryptocurrency, it's more for the public than against it. It allows us to break free of the fraudulent, centralized financial system that governs this entire world and is manipulated regularly to steal from entire nations.

             Blockchain technology was supposedly created by some guy in Japan. Although, it may be more than one guy. The NSA does know who created it though.

                Child, fiat money means it's backed/issued by a government so crypto is like the perfect opposite of fiat.  I don't think I'll reply to anything else you say, you're either very uneducated or just a troll.  All value is subjective, even with gold, this means it's all "intrinsically worthless", the only thing that gives anything value is that many people believe it has value.  Crypto is unstoppable and uncontrollable from any sort of centralized standpoint (unless you bought it all, then you'd control it), that's what makes it more valuable (for those of us who were there at the beginning) than fiat/government issued currency.
               </p>

                You should read and study more.  Maybe buy $20 worth of bitcoin (or monero) just to play around with it and see how it works.  The difference between our understanding is just that, understanding.  You don't get it yet or are just fucking with me.

                No. You're getting your info from liberal media (institution that has been protecting pedophiles). All, I'm saying is get your info from non-marxist sources. Don't link to these sickos. You're promoting them and supporting them.
