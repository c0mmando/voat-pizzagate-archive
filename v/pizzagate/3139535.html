<p>A video published by ABC News shows a group of migrants abusing young children who appear to be in no imminent danger by forcing them under a razor-wire lined border fence in a water-filled ditch. The children scream in terror as the adults force them into the cold water and submerge them while passing them under the concertino wire-lined border barrier.</p>
<p>The blades of the concertina wire ensnare shirts and jackets of asylum seekers who are dunked into the 55-degree water, wading through the drainage ditch just yards from the San Juan del Rio Colorado border crossing,” ABC News’ Matt Gutman wrote. “One cannot easily make out faces, only wet fists gripping the steel slats and the piercing screams of children. On the other side, U.S. Border Patrol agents are filming and shouting in Spanish, ‘Go back…don’t do this. Look at the child! Hey! Be careful with the child! Be careful with the child!’”</p>
<p>A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection told the reporter that policy prevents U.S. officials from intervening. However, agents can be heard yelling “You’re going to traumatize this poor child. She’s crying. … if she crosses the child can drown.”</p>
<p>The children did not appear to be in any immediate danger before being forced into the terrifying situation by the adult migrants. Mexican police can be seen attempting to stop the abusive behavior as U.S. Border Patrol agents watched from the other side of the fence, paralyzed by regulations and policies prohibiting their intervention</p>
<p>While some of the people in the video appear to be parents of the children, Border Patrol officials place the blame squarely on the transnational criminal organizations that bring the migrants to these remote and dangerous crossing locations.</p>
<p>This is another example of the transnational criminal organization’s disregard for safety and wellbeing of the children they smuggle,” Supervisor Dulesky stated. “They will do whatever is necessary to get their product through the border, ensuring their payment.  This further demonstrates the need for updated infrastructure on our borders.”</p>

<p>international criminal organization being the reason it belongs here </p>

<p>agents patrolling the Rio Grande River in an airboat encountered a woman and three small children who had been swept away in the strong current as they attempted to illegally cross the border river, Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials reported. Observing the four people in distress in the water, the agents quickly maneuvered their boat into position and pulled the woman and her three children to safety.</p>
<p>Migrants continue to ignore the hazards and risk their lives attempting to cross the Rio Grande River,” Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Louie W. Collins said in a written statement. “Had our Border Patrol agents not been in the area to respond quickly, the woman and her children would have more than likely drowned.”</p>
<p>A few days earlier, Del Rio Sector agents provided emergency medical services when a two-year-old migrant girl began having convulsions and seizures after her mother brought her across the Rio Grande River from Mexico. After stabilizing the child, doctors arranged transportation by ambulance from the Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center in Eagle Pass, Texas, to the San Antonio Children’s Hospital for “more advanced care,” Breitbart News reported.</p>

            Some will say that we should not care about these Children and not incur the cost of their care.  But what to do?  I know you well enough to know that you care about All Children just as I do.  The situation that has been created at the border is sad shameful and disgusting.  It is tailor made for the Child Stealers.  If the Kids get into trouble health wise, they just take off.  We are always left holding the bag on our side and the Mexican Patrol as well.  So horrible but Thank God for those that care.  Some parents just don't care about their own Children.  We see that with our own people here as well.  Those parents should be locked up.  But then the other side of me thinks about their Children.  As evil as those parents are, they are they only Mother or Father they know.  We know the attachment a Child feels.  Yes, Heartbreaking and Yes, those Children are right in the middle.

             Hell of a lot easier...morally and financially...to take care of ONLY the kids. That's one that can be absorbed as people sponsor them (it still puts them in harms way as far as traffickers inside the system is concerned but limits the access). Anyone over 18 stays on that side during the process, but we'll take care of the kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             With as long as the process takes, now that you've overwhelmed the system, the kid stands a better chance of citizenship in the next decade than the parents do.

              I hate separating Kids from their parents.  Granted some are rotten, but only a few.  Most people love their Kids just like we do here.  Children so look up to them no matter if they beat them or not.  Sad but true.  I worked with Kids many hears ago for quite a while.

              This is so hard.  We created this problem so it is ours to figure out the most humane way possible.  We marauded the globe.  Now the chickens are roosting at our border.  What a problem.  Drugs.  Trafficking it all plays a part in trying to figure this out.  But the totally innocent ones must be spared.  It is always the Children.

             Heres what I would do if I were Trump
"I have been rendered ineffective by the puppet political hacks that occupy Washington. I therefore will be removing any and all law enforcement agencies from duty within 50 miles of our southern border. There will be no law enforcement officers along our southern border. To the Patriot malitia that intend to enact Justice in those unmonitored areas, please don't do that or you will be called bad names by powerless people clamoring for a last hope of avoiding what's coming to them. God be with us for hell has shown it's face and stands against us."

            Most of the kids don't even belong to these scumbags...the ones who are kidnappers should be arrested, and the ones who are actual parents and doing this should be shot.

            Why do they bother when they know there are border agents right on the other side? Oh yeah because if they have children they will not be deported so they use the kids as pawns. Disgusting.
