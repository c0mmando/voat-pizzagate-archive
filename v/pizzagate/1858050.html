<p>Please someone deliver these pdf\'s to the local press in Virginia (avoid biased media if possible) and ask them to look into it. They have better access to interview local authorities to find out what is there to be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the reporting method enables dropping 4 out of 5 cases in the national report, used by national press too, this must be fixed!</li>
<li>It should be found out how many victims the Department of State Police reported to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services</li>
<li>if the reported amount by the State police varies from the reported amount by the HHS, there\'s a proven <strong>cover up</strong> in the governmental level</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I ask your help to find out if this same issue repeats in other States. Please check what\'s told by your local State authorities and local press, and compare it to the numbers <a href="/v/pizzagate/1857604">given here</a>. Note: Until investigated, we should not trust these HSS statistics at all. Tip: search terms &quot;Sexually, Abused, Child, Victims, Sex Offenses, State(named), police, report, 2015&quot;</p>
<p>A mistake is there, that\'s for sure, and I double checked it\'s not me. The scale of the mistake might be as high as 40, like in Virginia, see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming that 13% of cases are reported to authorities, there might have been more than 26,300 child victims in Virginia. 3,011 of them were reported to the police and 653 (less than 3%) reported by U.S. government to the public. </p>
<p>If this repeats through each State, it\'s possible that there are as many as 2,000,000 sexually abused children annually in the U.S.</p>

              Hmm,it's quite a disparity. At first I thought # of victims coming off of arrest reports which would then dwindle downwards as cases were dismissed for lack of evidence or put on a withhold of adjudication which keeps a suspects record clean. Even then, I would not expect that dramatic a dropoff but I suppose it's possible. Its good you are looking into this.

               The only reason I might see for the drop (if not in purpose) is an error in the reporting system, which then should really be fixed. Too bad nobody from Virginia has checked in to contact those local papers.

            There is definitely some covering-up going on at the state level. In at least one case, the Department of Families and Children, or the CPA, or whatever it is called, has actually been dissolved and replaced with a new agency because it was doing such a bad job. Elsewhere employees have been arrested for falsifying records and covering up abuse.

            It's harder to be sure what is happening at the federal level. Often the federal statistics are dependent on voluntary reporting from the states, so while they are a less-than-credible mishmosh, the blame doesn't lie solely with the federal officials.

            I too have noticed this and struggled with it since the beginning as statistics are super important to the Wiki. It should really tell you something though that our representatives and agencies care very little for reporting the truth even if in this case it would get them more public support, jobs, opportunities, press, etc.

            I know this is a stretch and not scientific.
But when these guys are caught, it's usually multiple offenses and victims.  When we hear about serial killers having 15-20 victims it's a big story.  Some of these pedos like saville had hundreds. British news said after the info about Saville got wide spread, almost a thousand complaints came in from all over England.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cases tried and convicted I feel are only a small percentage, maybe even a fraction of the total. Remember, many kids are so scared it takes years of therapy just to approach talking about the subject.  Many can only communicate through drawing.  I have a feeling we have millions of victims per year.

             That is very possible. Too few reports leads to an arrest, too few arrests leads to prosecution, too few prosecutions leads to a conviction, too few high profile convictions (if any) are about child rape. The pedo train just moves on, untouched, kids keep on suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a data point of view, as there are rich pedos using several kids (like Epstein was) and poor pedos sharing same kid (e.g. buying a child prostitute), it would be interesting to know some statistics if these match to any even (how many pedos per victim, or victims per pedo, in average)

              Exactly, priests raping kids who are deaf so no one can hear anything.  Abuse of mentally impaired kids.

            "Maltreatment" is a broader term so it's a more inclusive category.
           </p>
           <p>
            Table 3–10 Maltreatment Types of Victims, 2015 
■ A child is counted in each maltreatment type category only once, regardless of the number of times 
the child is reported as a victim of the maltreatment type. 
■  A child may have been the victim of more than one type of maltreatment, therefore, the maltreatment type count is a duplicate count.
           </p>
           <p>
            Table 3–11 Maltreatment Type Combinations, 2015 
■ Categories are based on up to four maltreatment type combinations. 
■ Neglect includes medical neglect and “other” includes unknown. 
■ The categories are mutually exclusive. 
■ Combinations are for unique children within and across unique records. This means a child with 
the same ID and a report that includes only neglect and a separate report that includes only physical 
abuse was counted in the combined Neglect and Physical Abuse category. 
■ The category of Remaining Combinations includes: Sexual Abuse and “Other”/Unknown; 
Psychological Maltreatment and “Other”/Unknown; Neglect, Sexual Abuse, and Psychological 
Maltreatment; Sexual Abuse, Physical Abuse, and Psychological Maltreatment; and all four mal-
treatment type categories plus “other”/unknown.

             Both reports are presenting the number of Victims, not a number of cases, and they are not mixing sexual abuse with combinations in the pages I linked.
