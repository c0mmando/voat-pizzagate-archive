            THIS IS A COMPLETELY DISCREDITED STORY. THE POSTER SHOULD BE ASHAMED. IT WAS RETRACTED YEARS AGO , JUNE 2014..
           </p>
           <p>
            ****Now the disgrace falls on National Public Radio, which has also published a long correction admitting that its original report contained errors. NPR said its article has been updated to correct the errors, such as wrongly reporting hundreds of bodies were discovered and that the true story had been “exaggerated.” NPR published the following June 24 correction about a story it broadcast on June 3: “This post originally stated that the bodies of hundreds of children had been found in a septic tank at a former home for unwed mothers in Tuam, Ireland, drawing from news reports that were based on research conducted by a local historian. The story was exaggerated by the media and key details of the historian’s findings have been called into question. It’s not clear how many — if any — bodies may be buried in the disused tank. This post has been updated to reflect developments.” In addition to its correction, the AP published a June 23 story explaining how it made the errors — by “repeating incorrect” claims from other news outlets: “The Associated Press was among the media organizations that covered Corless and her findings, repeating incorrect Irish news reports that suggested the babies who died had never been baptized and that Catholic Church teaching guided priests not to baptize the babies of unwed mothers or give to them Christian burials.” - See more at:

             Enough time wasted on you, YOU should be thoroughly ashamed of YOURSELF for trying your hardest, with your weak, unfounded, slanderous attempt at trying to help cover up this REAL story of REAL babies and children who suffered horribly at the hands of these monsters. Instead of doing your best to help bring to light the atrocities these people committed against innocent babies and children to justice,  you are actually defending them. Disgusting.

            Another undeniable truth, and the worst thing is that truly the only way we could ever get rid of them would be to execute the lot of them and that won't happen unless the whole world realises that the system is rigged, and that won't happen until most people are completely in the shit with the lives of themselves and their families at risk, and that probably won't happen until the elites attempt their final solution, which won't happen till they think they can win and they hold all the cards.  The best the populist movement can do is push it back a few decades it can't actually win I'm afraid even that might fail, pizzagate has been the only thing I've seen that represents a real chink the elites armour and watching it being attacked from all sides has been fascinating because it's like watching the nwo operating in real time, true proof of the existence of the illuminati.  What exciting times we live in.

            Yup again you are spot on, well almost.  what I've learned from all of this is that I used to be a libtard and now I realise what that means so now I'm simply a liberal operating outside the left/right wing prism, I'm all about greater economic equality and equal rights and freedoms for everyone but I can also think that, for example, transgender surgery is self mutilation brought on by mental illness and that anyone who does it is not a suitable candidate to adopt a child, or that being religious isn't a sign of stupidity, or that a stay at home parent is preferable to a state raised child and for obvious biological reasons that's more likely to be a woman, and I can say these things out loud and that doesn't make me a dangerous right wing propagandist.  By my logic you are wrong you are not a libtard because Libtards are morons who are incapable of free independent thought, Libtards are easily led towards supporting ridiculous things that deep down they don't really believe like positive discrimination etc. because they are defined by feeling morally superior through their affiliation with the left, thus the use of the suffix 'tard'.

           <p>
            You've also used one of my favourite terms meritocracy, if you try explaining that to someone who is unaware of it they actually believe that we already live in a meritocracy.  Meritocracy should be the most prevalent term in contemporary discourse because it is the true notion of fairness and while it is absolutely impossible to fully achieve, if we actively sought to do so the world would gradually become more equal.  Instead people cling to this notion that democracy is the only thing that guarantees a fair society even though democratic nations are uniformly unequal and some nations who have democracy forcibly thrust upon them immediately collapse (Libya, Iraq, etc.)  If you want to make a Libtards head explode try arguing that a meritocratic dictatorship would be better than a free capitalist democracy, it's pretty entertaining.

            Yep breitbart calls it cultural Marxism, traditional Marxism was dead right in the relationship between the owners and workers (not saying communism was the answer) so it made sense they'd turn the logic of it against us. It seems to me though that if just a few well informed, virtuous people found themselves in the right position they could change it, set a new example.  For that reason i am now absolutely convinced that no one ever really wins the big lotto jackpots (predicted in 1984), the powers that be would never risk a Julian assange type character  getting their hands on a couple hundred million pounds in start up capital that could cause real damage to them.  If I won £150million and didn't get on the wrong end of an assassination attempt within a year I'd count that as a failure

            Please see the original transcript of his speech. He portrayed those whom peddle fake news as shit eaters and shit lovers and in the context of the conversation is was referring to MSM, AP was one of the main sources for it and everyone who picked this up from them ran with same headline. Other than that yeah funny timing for it all

             Yes I know he wasn't referring to pizzagate, my point was, how is the most holy pope even aware of such a thing? Do they discuss this shit-eating habits of people on the dark web in Rome? And also that pizzagate is classed as fake news by the msm.

            No, we're not sh*t eaters. We're just tired of the way it smells and want to shovel it out of the highest levels of our government and other institutions, including the Catholic Church. I guess Pope Francis is content with it?

            I'm totally with you on the pro athlete part, I'm from Scotland and I support Celtic football club, theoretically if I were the best footballer in the world I could make 350k a week playing for Barcelona and 35k at best playing for Celtic who couldn't afford to pay what Barcelona pay, but I have no doubt I'd choose Celtic for a number of reasons.  Firstly 35k per week is too much money for anyone never mind someone who kicks a ball for a living, secondly I'd want success for Celtic over any other club, and thirdly I'd prefer to live at home.  The sports media talk about wages as if it's all that matters and that filters to every child fan growing up, indoctrinating them into a view of capital over happiness, money over principles, self interest over community.  Most kids won't grow up to be a pro athlete but if they aspire to for long enough they'll become a cutthroat soulless self-interested capitalist.  Mission accomplished

            Correct, there is literally an underground railroad to rescue abused nuns, torture dungeons, psychological abuse, tiny amounts of food and hard work, just terrible, but what do people expect from the church that gave us the inquisition.

            I have immediate family members who watch keeping up with the Kardashians and honestly I can't believe I still love them it shows the strong bond within a family.  On a side note the tablet I'm using to type this has Kardashian in the predictive text but doesn't have the abbreviation for et cetera, I can't believe the world I live in its gone nuts

              The church did not name it Lucifer. It is called the VATT. The scientists nicknamed it Lucifer.  IT is the biggest and best in the world, which puts to shame the claim that religion is anti-science.

               they might as well have called it lucifer. they are evil kid fuckers, eaters of children's souls, and just throw them away. it should be called lucifer, and the goddam pedo-priests and their priest enablers should have this "biggest and best telescope in the world" (!!wow!!) shoved up their holy asses!!!

             The Catholic church, sad as it is, are a satanic cult, it is so obvious now.

            If you read the entire context of the Pope's comments it sounds a lot more like he is admonishing the mainstream media for their part in fake newsery than calling out the alternative media, which is consistent with his overall message since he became pope=anti (corrupt) establishment. I think there is most likely a Pizzagate, Vatican version, but I don't think he's part of it. I think he's fighting it, which is why he's doing things like completely restructuring the Vatican bank and opening up the bank to scrunity. 
Incidentally, the previous Pope received a report on pedophilia in thr Church the day he resigned, and part of his explanation for resigning was that he was too old to fight 'the wolves'...maybe he was stepping down to let another take over the enormous Pizzagate like battle embedded within the structure of the church.

             Yeah... and if you look at the timing of his first statements about 'fake news' they came simultaneously with the MSM narrative.

              It seems more likely to me that MSM appropriated his critique of them. They often twist his words to mean the opposite of his original sentiment, as they do to Trump. 
There are corrupt bishops that vote for the pope but there are also bishops on the side of light. Pope Francis is often misinterpreted by those with a worldly point of view as liberal, so my guess is that the corrupt bishops who voted for him thought he would be easier to manipulate. 
God is ultimately in charge, and I think it was His doing that Trump and Francis came to power when and where they did. Neither are "angels" but the actions and words of both suggest they are fighting on the side of light within God's broader plan.

               I think most people are not even aware pizzagate exists and you would be surprised how many still believe the msm. But yeah, its true that alot of people don't care/don't want to know, which is worse.

                I'm not surprised at all people are fucking stupid and I include myself in that, also you're right I'm not exactly up to date with all things current but I don't shut up about pizzagate and with the exception of one or two people no one I've mentioned it to previously knew about it.

                 haha I know, its incredible really, I think all the flouride they have in the water here is doing the job, and I am no genius myself but this whole pizzagate thing has lit a fire in me thats not going out. Its the worst atrocity ever seen and its like no one gives a fuck! I do understand also that tv, social media etc have become the big distractions they were designed to be. But I can do my little bit by trying to bring awareness to it in whatever way I can, besides doing nothing about it. I feel an obligation to do it

                  My thoughts entirely I actually think in some small way I'm taking advantage of this situation, these paedophile rings, because it represents a real chance to fuck with the elites.  I think that 16 years on if the 9/11 truth came out it would do next to fuck all to stop the elite machine, no one worthwhile would be jailed and I think most people were happy to accept Iraq was a farce for oil anyway.  The corrupt banking system was covered by the msm post 2008 and although people were angry, we all moved on without even a single high profile banker being held accountable.  Acknowledgement of pizzagate could never be ignored however so I will never stop pushing this as long as I live.

                   I know how you feel. Look at Iceland though, in regards to the bankers. I think the problem is that we have been so dumbed down and DIVIDED against each other.  If we were to unite, it would be possible. With a good strong leader, its possible.

                    Yep and the irony is the only way to unite is to accept our differences and stop shoehorning cultures and political stances together, they're dividing us under the banner of uniting us it's a complete headfuck.  I sometimes think assange is the leader and if he isn't then the leader will be inspired by him and snowden.  We can but hope

            The mass graves story was retracted years ago. There was no septic tank and not one skeleton was found. The entire thing is fraudulent.

              It was retracted by the AP. I gave you the link.
             </p>
             <p>
              What is perhaps most striking about this story is the extent to which much of the mainstream media has had to walk back its inflammatory stories. The Associated Press even apologized in June for distorting the record. But the damage has been done: once again, the Catholic Church in Ireland has been unfairly blamed for persecuting innocent women and children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anti-Catholicism in Ireland, England, and the United States is fueling the “mass grave” hysteria. It’s a sick appetite, and there is no shortage of irresponsible persons feeding it.

               You have no idea what you're talking about. Ask anyone who grew up in Ireland. Read this and tell me how the Church has been 'unfairly blamed'

               I am a Christian by the way. The Catholic church have systematically abused the Irish people for years. You are obviously a troll or have no clue what you are talking about. I live in Ireland and I can tell you it did happen. I personally know men who were abused by these priests, and I know women who were in the homes for mothers and babies and had their children taken from them at birth.

             It's funny the pope would make that accusation, in all likelihood he is the one that enjoys feces. These people operate in half-truths.

              The powerful cannot stop themselves from saying the truth about themselves.  First it was MSM concocting a pizzagate conspiracy theory that had the Clintons running child trafficking rings (which at the time MSM first claimed it was not asserted ANYWHERE in the alternate news), and now the Pope attacks fake news with a fetish few of us know of, and outs himself.  It really is hilarious.  Every time they try to attack the truth, the tell more about themselves.
