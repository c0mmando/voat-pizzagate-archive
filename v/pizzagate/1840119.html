            Amazing that 3 negative comments are on top, even though they didn't come in that way (mods, Voat site in general.) There was a similar bust as a result of raids by the same organization in 2014, with Europol tweeting about it and RT reporting on it. We all know how people work VERY hard to discredit truthers and I would imagine that true truthers wouldn't be so quick to get negative on this. Here's the problem: every fucking person on planet Earth can be discredited in some way. Put the media behind it, and the flaws are blown up. Look at what this man and this organization have done and ask yourself "has anything good come from this for our cause?" The answer is "yes." Bring me bullet proof shit, and then let's get arrests. Until then, my disinformation is just as good as your disinformation: circumstantial at best. Get me a video of one of these mother fuckers and then you can tell me you "topped that." Until then, dig like the rest of us.

            I do have to say that all of the divergent opinions here on Kevin Annett and his ITCCS are correct, there is an inordinate amount of speculation about this man on both sides of the coin he seems to represent and has gotten himself into more than one controversy. I myself have spent some time investigating the claims made by him and this international tribunal he created. I was confronted by a wall of detractors that claimed he was involved in many financial fraud schemes and of course all of the typical smear campaigns. I left with no clear picture of Annett and the court that he created and it's efficacy. What I did see is that he very well might have a loosely knit group of foreign intellectuals that truly do understand the real power behind 'british' 'Common Law' or 'Natural' Law and international Affidavits of truth under God.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we may have noticed, this approach has little effect in an Admiralty/Commercial Law jurisdiction. In the End, however, it is the Truth that will prevail.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Annett's redeeming contribution to the worlds understanding of the elites child sex trafficking and extortion/abuse/ritual operations and genocidal programs is his bringing awareness to the thousands of indigenous Inuit Canadian orphans that met atrocious and horrible fates at the hands of Catholic and Jesuit 'caregivers'. May their memory be not in vain.(One such survivor and witness saw the Queen herself wisk TEN prime Inuit pizzas, oops I mean children, off into obscurity)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, tread carefully in ITCCS land, it's a quagmire, but the man certainly tried and is still trying and really is on to something.

             Agree with you, seems to be a wall of deatractors for sure, but isn't that what we find when someone is actually doing SOMETHING? I agree, as well, that there seems to be enough evidence that he is doing some good through his work on multiple fronts; awareness, the ability to use common law tactics, etc

            Titus Frost did an excellent video on the sacrificial rituals April 30/May 1 which was really informative. Makes me wish worldwide everyone would come together and we could all go to the Illuminati locations of worship and physically prevent this kind of sickness from happening.

            Official Vatican document silencing victims and protecting pedos; the reason and proof of why Pope Francis calls pizzagaters "shit eaters":
           </p>

           <p>
            Pope Francis calls those who talk about pizzagate 'shit eaters':
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gEqEutwLmUYouTube">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The real reason Pope Francis is lenient on pedos while against truthers on pizzagate is because of a document issued by Ratzinger (Cardinal then Pope Benedict XVI) when he was the "Grand Inquisitor"-- yes Grand Inquisitor (Torquemada was the first Grand Inquisitor).
           </p>
           <p>
            Ratzinger was named by this survivor as being part of human hunting parties and ritual torture and murder of children:

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1800676
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He also avoided prosecution in a sex abuse case by claiming "diplomatic immunity" (because the Vatican is a country with it's own currency central Rothschild bank, intelligence services etc.):
            <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pope-seeks-immunity-over-sex-abuse-suit/2005/08/17/1123958097061.html">

            </a>
            NB: Pope Benedict XVI was the first pope to resign in over 500 years, and the first to resign voluntarily in over 700 years. We might well ask why.

            The document Ratzinger was responsible for is called Crimen Sollicitationis (it's written in Latin). It effectively silences those reporting pederasty by clergy no matter who they are, as well as the victims themselves under pain of excommunication. Excommunication for a Catholic means eternity in hell. Even, nuns and priests who reported pedo clergy were not only defrocked but excommunicated. Source:

            Although articles, as on Wikipedia (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis))

            )) say it is no longer in effect, the fact is by all accounts including their own in the same referenced article, it was simply replaced with another (secret) one in May of 2001.
           </p>
           <p>
            This document came into the public consciousness due in part to media coverage of the pedo scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interviewed for a television program in 2006, canon lawyer Thomas Doyle described the tight secrecy demanded for the procedure [of investigating child rape, etc.] as "an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy, to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by churchmen". This is a quotation from a (an ironically) BBC documentary on clergy sexual abuse in Ireland. While periodically removed from vimeo and YouTube, here is one I found today:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJT0b-gkIAYouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJT0b-gkIAYouTube
            </a>
            This is important because the it is this show which made Crimen Sollicitationis known among the general public.
           </p>
           <p>
            This document has been used in American cases (which have been won to the tune of billions so far) against pedo priests.

            This document came into the public consciousness due in part to media coverage and the priest pedo scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Parenthetically: This is not at all an indictment against Roman Catholic people or their faith. Please read this post according to it's relevance to pizzagate and institutional protection of pedophiles. It is important to note that homosexuality among RC clergy is rife due in large part to the prohibition on marriage of priests after the great schism in the middle ages. After a thousand years of Christianity, when the RC decided to split from the original church and become a quite different and worldly organization, they sought to confiscate property and all assets of clergy as they had considerable wealth and land. Priests were ordered to divorce their wives and turn everything over to the Vatican. [The original church, the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church, allowed and still allows married priests.]

            Edit: I found a song about Crimen Sollicitationes by a "ska punk" band from 2008. It has millions of views:

            A great achievement if it really happened. But it needs some reliable confirmation. Unfortunately, the elites have the upper hand when it comes to publicity. They can keep things secret and ridicule any hull breaches but we have to expose things credibly.

            Well, among other opinions, Snopes said:The same source falsely claimed back in 2013 that Pope Benedict XVI resigned the papacy because the Vatican had received word from a European government that they planned to issue arrest warrants for his part in “sheltering pedophile priests.”  Ha Ha Ha.  We know that Snopes has been trying to normalize many fake thing from people that we have been researching on here.  Just throwing this in to the discussion.  We know there is some truth to the heinous deeds of past popes and elites, and that the whole site of Snopes is very questionable.

            I would take anything from the ITCCS with a grain of salt. Kevin Arnett doesn't have a very could track record for honesty. I'm not saying he's wrong. It would certainly make sense for the MSM to ignore this story if true. But his credibility has been seriously compromised in the past:

            Notice in that Abel Danger link there's no link to any news story of arrests in that area around that time. You'd expect there to be some public record of it. There is nothing. That's not good.

             I agree. I also read that Annett, which at the beginning of his activist years was pretty good, made a 180 degree turn about and started supporting the CIA hoax "false memory syndrome" in SRA victims. Other genuine activists who supported him now call him a globalist disinformation agent. Please be careful. Here is the source in question (excellent article on organized pedophilia and child trafficking btw):

            8 children saved!!!  The ITCCS was successful in disrupting ritual sacrifices done by the Catholic Ninth Circle cult's ritual sacrifices on April 30th in cities in which the activities were unannounced, while the "announced" cities were less successful. Raid activities in Washington DC were not only unsuccessful, but plain clothed officials arrested the ITCCS members participating in the raids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Posting this because 8 children were saved!!! And, obviously more work is to be done. This applies to Pizzagate because we have seen an intersection of children ritually abused, tortured and killed with the activities of various cults that associate with various religions: Catholic, Jewish, and last but not least Luciferianism.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have much more to learn about the Ninth Circle, if anyone has some solid information on this cult, please share.
