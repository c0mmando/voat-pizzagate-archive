            Attack Pedophiles, not an entire ethnic group. When you do this you lose the moral high ground and not only that, you are just plain wrong. Dont try and hide your personal racism in a pure cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, attack pedophiles or GTFO.

            When are you guys going learn? There are bad Jews, Christians, Muslims. It is never an ENTIRE religion or race behind evil shit. Yes, there is a single entity which, in order to hide better in a general population, finds like-minded sickos of differing races to do their nefarious shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "this is the work of the JEWS" is conditioning which you are going to have to fucking overcome. You have been mentally/socially conditioned to break people into distinct categories and then blame all of them because one person is a member of that identity.  Because when you say it is "JEWS" you are always going to be wrong and never taken seriously.

           <p>
            PizzaPye - i hope that by posting this your foresaw the hit you were going to take - you're brand new here and the subject of Jewry and the Jewish Mafia is controversial enough around here, even when posted by the 'old timers', if you will - Voat is not exactly the Jew exposing machine you imagine (and for the record, i am not a Jew hater)
           </p>
           <p>
            there are several thoughts that come to mind regarding your post...
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             you're new, so your posting history isn't extensive enough for me to form an opinion on what your motive may be by connecting PG to Jewry and therefore i see it is a possibility that you may be trying to fragment and discredit the entire investigation - if i am wrong, i sincerely apologize, but if i am honest, this possibility must be considered - i hope you understand
            </li>
            <li>
             the fact that Israel, the Mossad and some Jewish elites have engaged in massive criminal activities throughout history is just that -- a fact -- and this is easily understood by anyone who chooses to do the research - that said, i have not been following PG very closely for reasons which are explained
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1434421">
              here
             </a>
             , so i do not know for myself that PG is centered around Jewry, nor how Soros may be connected, if indeed he is
            </li>
            <li>
             as evidenced in my
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1434421">
              WWASPS post
             </a>
             , and considering the significant role Christian priests, the Vatican and a faction of the Mormons have played in pedophilia,
             <strong>
              it is certainly not only Jews that are driving this activity
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             though i have not been following the PG investigation closely, it is my impression that somewhere between little and nothing has been
             <em>
              proven
             </em>
             at this point - granted there seems to be a substantial amount of extremely disturbing evidence, but practicing Satanistic activities, photographs of restrained children in an unknown context, writing in blood and coded language are not
             <em>
              proof
             </em>
             of child abuse - that said, i think what most of us speculate is accurate insomuch as organized child slavery and pedophilia are very much based in fact but, nevertheless, the victim must be tied to the perpetrates with evidence
            </li>
            <li>
             whether Jewry is at the root of PG or not, you must realize that anyone who points a finger in this direction is going to be auto-labeled an "anti-Semite" by the brainwashed masses who equate criticism of anything Jewish with racism and Nazism and
             <strong>
              this is going to be used to discredit the entire investigation, even by many in the alt-media scene
             </strong>
             (and certainly everyone in the MSM), even if it were proven, and therefore i'm not sure it's worthwhile to publicize these ties (if they do indeed exist) -- pursue it privately, yes, by all means - obviously every lead must be pursued and every name exposed, no matter where it may go, and if many Jewish names are uncovered, then people will begin to see the connections to something larger through those individualizes which will be far more palatable than being overtly hit over the head with '
             <em>
              it's the Jews dummy
             </em>
             ' in the first months of an investigation where apparently nothing has been proven so far as i am aware
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              lastly, and perhaps most importantly, if you attempt to bring Jewry into this in an overt manner, by extension you are likely going to summon the holocaust and Hitler and all the baggage that goes with that, and there is no doubt whatsoever that this is going to cause infighting and fragment the community, as is already obvious in this thread and others
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            my feeling is,
            <strong>
             don't do it
            </strong>
            - it's going to discredit the investigation on too many fronts - focus instead on the common goals; pedophilia and making the connections to those responsible - stay focused and keep the investigation as streamlined as possible - there will be plenty of opportunity to expand on the details
            <em>
             after
            </em>
            this is all fleshed out
           </p>
           <p>
            if anyone else agrees with this, i encourage you to link to this comment when Jewry is blamed (you can save the comment (using the 'save' link) and recall it later from your profile to make it easy)

            If you dont think zionist jews congregate like every other sect of people, youre being oblivious. If Soros turns out to be trafficking children with his jewish friends, it doesnt mean he and his friends were stealing kids because they were jewish, it means he and his friends were trafficking humans and they happened to be jewish.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not saying jews traffic children. I am saying that it would be possible for a large prt of the pedo ring to be made up of jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBIANON SAID SOROS IS THE KINGPIN OF IT ALL. SOROS IS A JEW. IF THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON BEHIND IT ALL IS A JEW, THEN THE HAND BEHIND IT ALL IS IN FACT A JEWISH HAND.
           </p>
           <p>
            WE ARENT ON A JEWISH WITCH HUNT. WE ARE HUNTING PEDOS. WE ARE HUNTING PEDOS AND ONE LEAD THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE LEADER IS SOROS. IF IT SO HAPPENS THAT SOROS IS THE HEAD-PEDO, THEN THE HEAD PEDO IS A JEW.

            Corruption and the abuse of power are anthropological problems. We need to expose all hands behind this, regardless of whether they are Jewish, white supremacist, Catholic, Protestant, Islamic, etc.

             It's not antisemitism to understand who they are and what motivates them. It is rooted in Judaism.  Satanism is part of Christianity. Judaism is the mother religion of all Abrahamic religions, (Christianity and Islam).  Satanism  is a wing of Judaism.

              Look, I understand ancient history. However, you must understand the scrutiny this investigation is already under and know that the way they are seeking to destroy it is by painting it as anti-Semitic. Also realize when SJW talk about "White-Privilege" they are committing the same fallacy. Our real enemy is elitism, no matter what angle it comes from.
