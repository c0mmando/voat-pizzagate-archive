            What kind of field trip involves getting lost in a cave? This isn't the Magic School Bus.

            Reminder that while the official rescue operation was taking place, the president of the Thai water authority and some of his staff had entered the cave without the knowledge of the authorities. They had taken with them enough food and supplies to last for weeks. But they became trapped. They were discovered by the official rescue team who had no idea they were down in the cave system. They'd been there for some time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did nobody report them missing? Why didn't they alert the official rescue mission? Why so much food?

            This is quite interesting, because the jury stated that 'pedo guy' was too much of a generic type of insult. Hmm...

            I'm interested to read these past posts. My thought was the only way musk could have won was to dig up enough evidence to show that this guy could -at least reasonably, if not provably- be called a pedo.
