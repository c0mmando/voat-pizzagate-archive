            Sadly, mainly looks like anti-homosexual and "god" pushers.
Males are our sexual abusers of children, but they are heterosexual males.
Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
           </p>
           <blockquote>

            </p>
            <p>
             A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
            </p>
            <p>
             Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
            </p>
            <p>
             A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
            </p>
            <p>
             Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

             Great, now adjust for the fact that homosexuals constitute 1.6% of the population, and you'll see why your argument is fallacious.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Based on the 2013 NHIS data [collected in 2013 from 34,557 adults aged 18 and over], 96.6% of adults identified as straight, 1.6% identified as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identified as bisexual."
            </p>
            <p>
             Not saying that all or even a substantial minority of homosexuals are also paedophiles, but it is certainly not a statistical rarity of the sort that you're suggesting. Of course heterosexuals will be overrepresented in absolute terms since there are many, many more of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             "A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual."
            </p>
            <p>
             If we go by this study, for example, homosexuals are actually very likely to be overrepresented as offenders, since 96.6% of men are straight and hence statistically underrepresented.

              I'll just remind us all that this study relates to who families might "trust" with their children.
At one time all authority figures -- especially priests -- were trusted.  That time is over.
See: "Focus on the Facts" -- Sean Cahill, PH.D -- the study is quoted above.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we want to keep children safe we have to understand that it is males who are our sexual abusers of children which even right wing women's groups agree with.  And heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
             </p>
             <h1>
              1 -- this is NOT my argument -- this is based on "Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters."
             </h1>
             <p>
              And obviously those conducting the study knew what the population of those convicted child molesters actually was because they self-identified.
Evidently, you didn't understand that.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, as for other history, in Hawaii at one time -- presumably before the coming of the white man -- they held homosexuals in high esteem and regard for their care for orphaned children.
That would NOT have been true if they had been molesting the children in their care.
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep in mind the populations in these two studies were actual CONVICTED child molesters.
They self-selected themselves by means of their crimes in assaulting children.
              <br/>
              And the majority were HETEROSEXUAL.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of the statistical estimates include the website's suggestion that gays/lesbians seek to increase their statistical numbers, without also making clear that heterosexuals may do the same.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the most obvious reasons for a lower count is the fact that homosexuals in many areas may fear coming out.  Certainly this is true in the South still today.  The public estimates the gay/lesbian population at 23%.  I'd also say that he statistics on bi-sexuals is also very low.  In fact, given the prejudices still in the US against homosexuality and bi-sexuality, I would guess that bi-sexuals might find it safer to ignore any desire for anything beyond a heterosexual relationship.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't know if you realized, either, that the study was based on:** Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters**

             </p>
             <p>
              Why is this number an estimate?
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The number of LGBT persons in the U.S. is subjective. Studies pointing to the statistics are estimates at best. The most widely accepted statistic is that 1 in ever 10 individuals is LGBT; however, some research estimates 1 in 20. Of course, this all depends on one's definition of gay (which may vary by study) and the participant's willingness to identify as gay, bi, lesbian or transgender. So, why can't the actual number of GLB people be counted? There are many things to consider when trying to count the number of GLBT persons.

              <p>
               At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

              <p>
               A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

            Very interesting.  Curious though, it says the footage is from Inauguration Day 2 weeks ago.  Why is this just being posted now?

             Mainly to point out the crowd and how people perceive the protest but the his Youtube channel says he posted it 14 hours ago so I wanted to post it just in case no one had seen it. This may well have been posted already somewhere else, but I haven't seen it.

             It was posted when it happened but it was shit footage and sound. At least he's yelling out FACTS and actually seems concerned about the IG posts, not just some organised paid shill protest to make us look like wankers.

              He yells out facts, then conflates gay relationships with pedophilia. Good way to make people ignore the facts if you ask me.

               That one girl SCREAMING REEEEEEEEEE ('F*CK YOU') is a perfect example of how people can be manipulated through blindly believing in stupid shit like 'intersectional feminism' -- totally fabricated word. They are easy to control when in a crowd (animal) mentality.
