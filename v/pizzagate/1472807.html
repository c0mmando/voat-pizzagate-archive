            Hillary lost because she is a liar and she has no conscience. American people saw through her lies and lack of concern. She will never understand that because it would require her to have empathy. Reptilian, robot, sociopath, high priestess of moloch whatever you want to call her she lacks a sense of humanity.

            The important thing to notice about this speech (see excerpt shown in Mark Dice video link below) is that once again she's wearing PURPLE. What does this mean? We should be paying very careful attention to anyone else associated with the Hillary campaign who appears in public in purple.

            This is actually a good attitude for her to take. It means she is completely committed to a false analysis of the reasons she lost - that means her strategy if she runs again in 2020 will be even more wrong-headed and irrelevant.

            The aspect of pizzagate that's troublesome is the effect it has on the less stable population. On Sunday, a citizen investigator went armed into CPP to investigate himself. I really believe that's what happened, I don't think it was a false flag... just doesn't fit the M.O. of any other false flag, so I have a hard time believing it was a government-created situation.
           </p>

            A lot of people here probably were very young in the 80s or weren't even born yet - but there was a similar "satanic panic" in the 80s, now the paranoia is spreading like wildfire because of social media and the internet.. Back then it was just word of mouth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there something going? Maybe. Should Comet Ping Pong and James Alefantis be flat out convicted by the jury of social media before he's even been given a trial? Probably not. Try to look at it from both sides.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just, for a moment, imagine that he's NOT GUILTY of all the heinous acts everyone is saying he is. What the fuck would you do in that situation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, that's not to say either way - maybe he's guilty, maybe he's not - but yeah, all the paranoia and accusations definitely are putting people's lives at risk. Employees of Comet Ping Pong, who likely have nothing to do with anything other than punching the time clock at the joint, don't deserve to have their lives endangered because of some internet tinfoil hattery.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are 2 sides to this very controversial issue, and valid points and arguments on both ends. I'm just asking that people consider the OTHER side

             May I suggest impartiality is the responsibility of the judge and jury. To the elite we are nothing but rabble but that is also our strength, we have the power of sheer numbers. Take the BLM movement as an example. The elite In the minority they have been taking advantage of the weakest and most defenseless in our society the children. Right now the perpetrators are using their power to control the narrative and hide behind fake news. In the past it was the satanic scare, or the false memory syndrome. The ball is in their court now to clear their name, and frankly it becomes more evident everyday that they can't because they are complicit. Deflecting won't work this time, this is the Information Age. Either clear your name or stand accused with rumor and innuendo. We are not a court of law, we are the public (the rabble) the perpetrators can go to court to if they want impartiality and to clear their name. We know they want to avoid that at all costs They have deep treacherous secrets they are hiding, they want the public complacent and asleep while they steal the children and launder money and God only knows what else is involved...They can have their day in court to clear their name they need to submit to that process just like Normal everyday people would have to. They think they are above the law. Are they? Will we let them? If they want the benefit of the doubt then they can clear their name in the court. as long as they fight dirty.... public suspicions will only grow... In fact they only seem more and more guilty everyday that passes. The light will expose the truth it's what they are fighting so hard to avoid. Where there is smoke there is usually fire right? its ok to call them out on their lies we are the rabble :)

             JA and the podestas can easily explain the odd photos or code words, instead they hide behind fake news and try to intimidate people from even asking questions about it. Innocent people cooperate with investigations. Guilty people don't. Generally speaking of course there are always exceptions. They are using the same technique that a cheater uses when caught:  deny even against all logic. So unless there is an investigation and solid explanations people will continue believe that something is very fishy. If I was him I would want an investigation so that I can put all the doubts to rest and clear my reputation 100 percent. But then again I have nothing to hide. They don't seem to mind letting people think they are pedos all that much.  What did Andrew breitbart say? What are you hiding in your closet podesta? They will have to answer for their closets sooner or later.

             It was definitely a patsy who was supposed to shoot someone and couldn't get the job done. 
Or it was a shill who just wanted to make us look bad.

                The police got there quick because they are aware of the situation with pizzagate and the craziness surrounding it. There's also a lot of high-profile politicians who frequent that area, so they are prepared to respond quickly, at any time.
               </p>
               <p>
                As far as your claim that if he was mentally unstable enough to bring a gun, he would have shot it... I disagree. I know plenty of people who are 2nd amendment enthusiasts, and they open carry. Open Carry is completely legal in NC, where he is from. He very well could be used to openly carrying a firearm. One thing is for sure: I don't know what was in his head, and neither do you. Neither one of us are psychic.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I DO KNOW that this area is heavily patrolled by police and a quick response time is not suspicious at all. It means the police were actually doing their job. Imagine that!
               </p>
               <p>
                The media isn't covering Pizzagate because there is no journalistic claim to be made. There are only questions. How should the mainstream media cover it exactly? If you were a news producer, how would you "cover it"? Asking questions is not "news".

                People are using confirmation bias, which we all have, to connect every dot they can that support the pizzagate theory.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm in here every day, hours a day researching along with every one else, but I keep an OPEN MIND, and realize that most of what's pointed out here is, in fact, speculation with no real concrete evidence of everything. Just tons of QUESTIONS and no substance.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you can't wrap your brain around how unstable people can get emboldened by stuff like this, I can't help you.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will continue researching, keeping an open mind, and when I disagree with something, I'm going to say it. Everyone's got their pitchforks and torches out - and IMO people need to slow down and think more critically.. and look at things from the other side, too.

                  That's because you defend your confirmation bias. "look like shills" says it all. You don't want to even entertain the possibility that any of this is contrived.

              It's been proven that the CPP 'shooting' was a staged event. Tape in place, professional photographers in place prior to shoot. Alex Jones (ARAB LAWYER) Sharif inside, and Welch? Just another faggot.

              Welch is a faggot, welch had just hit a child with his car, he was going to prison, someone convinced him to 'save the kids', so he went inside, found no kids, ... funny the lawyer Sharif said he had his kids, he was the last to leave, but WELCH found no kids, ... this entire story reeks of bullshit.

            Gee, why is she so concerned about CPP and Fake News? Is she looking for a scapegoat or is she protecting her pedo friends? And what, exactly, does she mean when she says "congress should do something about it"? At best, it's an all out attack in free speech. At worst she is trying to get us to all shut up about pizzagate.
