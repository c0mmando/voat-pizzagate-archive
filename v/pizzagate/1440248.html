<p>There\'s definitely some shilling going on here.</p>
<p>A few days ago it came to light that some users had the intention of exposing the Jewish links to Pizzagate and begun doing so. Then there was a bunch of people complaining about " antisemitism" and a bunch of shills calling to ban " antisemitism". The next day /Pizzagate appointed 9 new mods and now they\'re deleting all submissions that reference Judaism or Jews.</p>
<p>There\'s still a push to outright ban " antisemitic" users.</p>
<p>Everything I just laid out is entirely accurate. I\'m not assuming anything and I can do a bit more research and link to everything but if you look at the modlog and what\'s in it you\'ll see what I mean. There is a push to ban " antisemitism" in an attempt to disassociate Judaism with Satanism.</p>
<p>As one user had mentioned, "Satanism is a wing of Judaism. Judaism is the mother of all Abrahamic religions. Pizzagate is nothing new,it\'s an established and historically documented Jewish occultic practice called Blood Libel which is part of Talmudic doctrine. The Talmud is Judaism and it\'s what Rabbis study. "</p>
<p>This is why we are seeing a clear push to ban antisemitism. The subverse has been compromised by people who wish to damage control for Judaism.</p>
<p>How do we deal with rogue mods? I guess the subversives can hide behind free speech, but what do we do about the mods that are suppressing free speech and trying to deprive the community of information they deem " offensive" ? We cannot allow political correctness to constrain the truth. What do we do in circumstances like this where we can clearly discern that mods are potentially compromised?</p>
<p>
EDIT:</p>
<p>Even this submission was deleted. Unbelievable.  This subverse is compromised,  or at least the mods.  I will keep reposting to show people how some mods are clearly working against the community and impeding our research.</p>',

            Yeah then maybe just go and say something like : "This guy is doing this and that." Instead of talking about jews all the time.
You see, nobody actually cares to which religion those fucks count them selfs.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end they are no jews, christians or atheists, but rapists and murderers. Calling out the big jewish conspiration all the time does nothing, but hurt pizzagate, but since people already pointed that out several times to you and your friends it's pretty obv. that that's exactly what you are here for. Now shh!
