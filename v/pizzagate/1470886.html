            There's a couple of projects in the works, AFAIK, in light of the recent Spez censorship. Of course, there's also 8chan for those that don't mind swimming to the content.

            Just my humble opinion.
Decentralise and distribute. And start using paper again. Take example from anti totalitarian regime war era. Leafleat drop after curfew from those who had permission to move about at night time.
Any one can print brochures and cd in a matter of minutes these days, or flash memory cars. 
If the censorship become to heavy, still the internet would work for connecting, investigating, and for places like this one wher is possible to learn. 
They cannot stop people publishing on paper, and circulate it in all passible methods.
I think paper lasts, and can win, Look at the Franklin cover up, it is in people libraryis because it was made in print.

             Funny you should say this. I have a notebook full of information regarding pizzagate as I thought writing would be safer than having a directory on my computer relating to child trafficking and rape, even if we are investigating the wrongdoing of others. I think memes don't help the cause as much as a non-bias fact sheet through a letterbox would. I agree with you completely.

            I'm in the US and can access the site, but the most recent article that appears is from Nov 25, which seems a bit strange to me. Never been there before but it's kind of odd to me that they haven't posted anything new in two weeks.
