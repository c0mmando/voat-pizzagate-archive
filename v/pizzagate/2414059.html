<blockquote>
<p>Stanislav Lunev (Russian: Станислав Лунев; born 1946 in Leningrad) is a former Soviet military officer, the highest-ranking GRU officer to defect from Russia to the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Intelligence_Directorate">Main Intelligence Directorate</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main Intelligence Directorate (Russian: Гла́вное разве́дывательное управле́ние, tr. Glavnoye razvedyvatel\'noye upravleniye, IPA: [ˈɡlavnəjə rɐzˈvʲɛdɨvətʲɪlʲnəjə ʊprɐˈvlʲenʲɪjə]), abbreviated GRU (Russian: ГРУ, IPA: [ɡeeˈru]), is the foreign military intelligence agency of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (formerly the Soviet Army General Staff of the Soviet Union). Since 2010, the agency′s official full name is the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces (Russian: Гла́вное управле́ние Генера́льного шта́ба Вооружённых Сил Росси́йской Федера́ции).</p>
<p>The GRU is Russia\'s largest foreign intelligence agency.[1] In 1997 it deployed six times as many agents in foreign countries as the SVR, the successor of the KGB\'s foreign operations directorate (PGU KGB). It also commanded 25,000 Spetsnaz troops in 1997.[2]</p>
<h1>Compromise</h1>
<p>In 2002, Bill Powell, former Moscow bureau chief at Newsweek, wrote Treason, an account of the experiences of former GRU colonel Vyacheslav Baranov, who had betrayed GRU for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and agreed to spy for it. He was exposed to the Russians by a mole in either the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the CIA and spent five years in prison before he was released. The identity of the mole remains unknown to this day, but speculation has mounted that it could have been Robert Hanssen.[43]</p>

<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hanssen">Robert Hanssen</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert Philip Hanssen (born April 18, 1944) is a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who spied for Soviet and Russian intelligence services against the United States for 22 years from 1979 to 2001. He is currently serving 15 consecutive life sentences at ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado.</p>
<p>Hanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at Foxstone Park[2] near his home in Vienna, Virginia, and was charged with selling U.S. secrets to the Soviet Union and subsequently the Russian Federation for more than US$1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period.[3]</p>
<p>On July 6, 2001, in order to avoid the death penalty, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.[4][5] He was sentenced to 15 life terms without the possibility of parole. His activities have been described by the Department of Justice\'s Commission for the Review of FBI Security Programs as &quot;possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history.&quot;[6]</p>

<p>^ &quot;The BRIDGE&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>In the media</h1>
<p>The story is mentioned in Ronald Kessler\'s book The Secrets of the FBI, both in Chapter 15, &quot;Catching Hanssen,&quot; and Chapter 16, &quot;Breach.&quot;[citation needed]</p>
<p>Eric O\'Neill\'s role in the capture of Robert Hanssen was dramatized in the 2007 film Breach, in which Chris Cooper played the role of Hanssen and Ryan Phillippe played O\'Neill.[66]</p>
<p>The 2007 documentary Superspy: The Man Who Betrayed the West describes the hunt to trap Robert Hanssen. Hanssen also was the subject of a 2002 made-for-television movie, Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story, with the teleplay by Norman Mailer and starring William Hurt as Hanssen. Robert Hanssen\'s jailers allowed him to watch this movie but Hanssen was so angered by the film that he turned it off.[67]</p>
<p>Hanssen is mentioned in chapter 5 of Dan Brown\'s book The Da Vinci Code as the most noted Opus Dei member to non-members. Because of <strong>his sexual deviancy</strong> and espionage conviction, the organization\'s reputation was badly hurt.[68]</p>
<p>Hanssen\'s story is reviewed on season 2, episode 4 of Mysteries at the Museum. Actual footage of his arrest by FBI agents is included. His story is the last segment of four included in this episode.</p>
<p>The American Court TV (now TruTV) television series Mugshots released an episode on the Robert Hanssen case titled Robert Hanssen - Hanssen and the KGB\'.[69]</p>

            Lures teenage drug addicted girls to his house and tries have sex with them and talk them into letting him drink their blood. He tells them he is a "magic dragon." (seriously, read what he wrote) A couple of those little drug addicted tweakers broke into his house a few weeks ago.
           </p>

             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            people hate it. He constantly pings the mods and tattles on people, shows the mods things people say, in an effort to get fights started between the mods and the users.

            Whines because people do not like his obnoxious behavior. Some people never learn to keep their mouth shut and stop being an asshole. Learn not to be an asshole.

            **However, at Hanssen's suggestion, and without the knowledge of his wife, a friend named Jack Horschauer, a retired Army officer, would sometimes watch the Hanssens having sex through a bedroom window. Hanssen then began to secretly videotape his sexual encounters and shared the videotapes with Horschauer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom that was connected via closed-circuit television line so that his friend could observe the Hanssens from his guest bedroom.[62] He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage on Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.[63]

           <p>
            Hanssen frequently visited D.C. strip clubs, and spent a great deal of time with a Washington stripper named Priscilla Sue Galey. She went with Hanssen on a trip to Hong Kong, and on a visit to the FBI training facility in Quantico, Virginia.[64] He gave her money, jewels, and a used Mercedes-Benz, but cut off contact with her before his arrest, when she fell into drug abuse and prostitution. Galey claims that although she offered to sleep with him, Hanssen declined, saying that he was trying to convert her to Catholicism.[65]**

            That's quite a "Catholic"there! Hahaha! But then again, anyone w/half of a brain knows just how corrupt that institution is to begin with! Throw in a bit of MKU &amp; you've got a whole bag of assorted nut-jobs running around! 
Thanks for the drop!

             But hey, so long as he confesses... to that and the espionage... I mean come the fuck on! Using the cover of church confession to aleviate guilt from that? Who did he confess to, I wonder? He always came in at 6:30am didn't he? May have been timing it to speak with a single priest(or just a few)?

             <p>
              A priest at Oakcrest said that Hanssen had regularly attended a 6:30 a.m. daily mass for more than a decade.[60] Opus Dei member Father C. John McCloskey III said he also occasionally attended the daily noontime mass at the Catholic Information Center in downtown Washington. After going to prison, Hanssen claimed he periodically admitted his espionage to priests in confession. He urged fellow Catholics in the Bureau to attend mass more often and denounced the Russians, even though he was spying for them, as "godless".[61]

             During his tenure as director of the FBI, Louis Freeh presided over a series of blunders and failures that brought the bureau to a low point in its history. From the embarrassment of the Russian mole Robert Hanssen to the bungling of the Wen Ho Lee investigation to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars in a failed attempt to build a modern, computerized case management system, the bureau under Freeh's leadership stumbled from one blunder to the next, with little or no accountability. The nadir, as the nation knows too well, was reached in the astonishing string of failures that helped leave America vulnerable to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the face of this record, Freeh has now published "My FBI," a book distinguished by its shameless buck-passing. Nothing, it seems, was ever Louis Freeh's fault.

            i like how 8chan has the ourubouros satanic infinity symbol as its logo.

            I like more how your forum explicitly touts itself as Trump's handpicked shock-troops complete with faggy MAGA symbols -- since over half the country hates or mistrusts trump that is real smart branding for your supposed principal task of 'red-pilling the masses'
           </p>
           <p>
            since this level of ineptitude does not exist in this dimension, and since it is distracting trump's most earnest supporters from his reneging of chief campaign promises about the displacement of real Americans (whites), this is a legendary psy-op indeed.  Btw youre wrong: the worst spy in American history was Jonathan Pollard, an Israeli agent honored with their citizenship while serving his life sentence.

             I was going to disagree with you about Pollard, but my reference was the Rosenberg couple who gave the USSR all our nuclear secrets… and they got executed. Pollard got off scot free AND IS OUT OF PRISON. So sure; you’re right and we don’t even know what Pollard stole.

             During his tenure as director of the FBI, Louis Freeh presided over a series of blunders and failures that brought the bureau to a low point in its history. From the embarrassment of the Russian mole Robert Hanssen to the bungling of the Wen Ho Lee investigation to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars in a failed attempt to build a modern, computerized case management system, the bureau under Freeh's leadership stumbled from one blunder to the next, with little or no accountability. The nadir, as the nation knows too well, was reached in the astonishing string of failures that helped leave America vulnerable to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the face of this record, Freeh has now published "My FBI," a book distinguished by its shameless buck-passing. Nothing, it seems, was ever Louis Freeh's fault.

             A veteran F.B.I. agent who spied for Moscow for more than two decades has said that security at the bureau was so lax that it amounted to ''criminal negligence'' and that even file clerks had easy access to classified national-security information stored on the bureau's computers, according to a report by a special Justice Department panel that was released today.

             The confessed spy, Robert P. Hanssen, also told the panel's investigators in a series of interviews that his motivation for spying was money and that he had originally planned to ''get a little money'' from espionage and then ''get out of it.''
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead, Mr. Hanssen, a 57-year-old father of six, remained a spy for 22 years, collecting an estimated $600,000 in cash and gems from the Russians in exchange for American secrets, including the identity of Russian agents working for the United States who were later executed because of Mr. Hanssen's treachery.

            <p>
             Mr. Hanssen told the investigators that he had little fear that his computer hacking would attract the attention of his superiors, given the lax supervision of the computer system. ''If I had been a more malevolent spy than I was,'' he is quoted as saying, ''they would have had a very difficult time finding me.''
            </p>
            <p>
             The panel's report noted that because there was so little monitoring of intrusions into the computer system, Mr. Hanssen was not detected even when he began running computer searches on files involving Louis J. Freeh, the former F.B.I. director, and President Bill Clinton's family.
            </p>
            <p>
             ''On more than 20 occasions, he ran searches containing the names 'Hillary Rodham Clinton,' 'Hillary,' 'Chelsea' or 'Clinton,' '' the report said. ''He ran at least one search on Director Freeh. Had the F.B.I. been aware of these searches, it seems likely that auditors would have found this activity peculiar.''

             Sex offenders in schools controversy
            </h2>
            <p>
             On 9 January 2006, it came to light that Kelly’s department had granted permission for a man, Paul Reeve, who had been cautioned by police for viewing child pornography images and who was on a sex offenders register, to be employed at a school in Norwich on the basis that he had not been convicted of an offence. He, and an unknown number of others on the sex offenders register, were not on the DfES prohibited list, "List 99".[25] On 13 January, Kim Howells, a Minister of State at the DfES, admitted that it was he who had actually made the decision, in accordance with advice given to him by civil servants that the "person did not represent an ongoing threat to children but that he should be given a grave warning". In response to the critical media coverage surrounding the issue, Downing Street issued a statement confirming their confidence in Kelly and denying rumours that she was to be replaced.[26]
            </p>
            <p>
             There was further controversy when it transpired that another teacher, William Gibson, 59, who had been cleared to work at Portchester School in Bournemouth despite the fact that he had been convicted in 1980 for indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl and had been previously removed from three schools. A letter from the Department for Education that suggested the Secretary of State had considered his case and found that although his past actions had been unwise and unacceptable, he had undertaken teaching work to good effect since.[27]

             , what's still missing here is a concise statement of your "Pizzagate premise" tying these names together. This is very scattershot and hard to make sense of. Is your premise that Q is saying the Russian spy guy is connected to international child trafficking? To remove the flair, we'd need something along those lines.

               Pizzagate premise/theory:
              </strong>
              Q seems to be pointing out Stanislav Lunev and "The BRIDGE" as a reference to Robert Hanssen and the place of his arrest, which is likely due to curiosities surrounding Hanssen and other pizzagate-related persons/elements. My theory is that Robert Hanssen's activities as a spy, may have also included some form of connection to institutionalized child abuse and/or the cover-up thereof, facilitated by Opus Dei, at the behest of Podesta/Clinton et al.
             </p>
             <p>
              The history &amp; founding of Opus Dei is also mired in controversy, including accusations of support for Nazis/Hitler - incidentally, Opus Dei is also known for being opposed to Hitler per their support for Communism. This kind of schismatic support/opposition indicates an underlying agenda to "play both sides", to myself; Links between Opus Dei and Robert Hanssen, seem very deeply rooted in WW2 and Cold War espionage - coupling this with the sex-abusers in schools controversy which has surrounded Opus Dei member &amp; UK politician, Ruth Kelly - it seems even more apparent that ties between Opus Dei &amp; politics touch on corruption, espionage and child abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Curiosities pertaining to John Podesta's suspiciously angry article which opens with 9/11 signalling, Foxstone Park and the surrounding area(nearby Westwood Country Club) and 9/11-related incidents/elements also indicate 9/11 as peripheral to Hanssen/CIA/FBI...

               Maybe what you should do is try doing a post on a smaller part of this info -- making sure you can plausibly link it to child sex trafficking. If you broke the whole thing down into parts, each of which is supported, then you could link to each individual post as you built your case for the larger picture. Sorry...having a rough time following the trail of crumbs here.

                Stanislav Lunev was "the highest-ranking GRU officer to defect from Russia to the United States", while reading about the GRU, I came across the story of Vyacheslav Baranov, "who had betrayed GRU for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and agreed to spy for it." and who was "exposed to the Russians by a mole in either the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the CIA" - "The identity of the mole remains unknown to this day, but speculation has mounted that it could have been Robert Hanssen."

               </blockquote>
               <p>
                I'm suggesting at this point, that the "Ellis" dead drop site, is the bridge(or one of possibly a few) that Q is referring to, due to running themes of bridges and espionage (per also the 'bridge of spies', which someone else has raised on twitter).
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Further examination of Hanssen points in a few directions, not least of all, Opus Dei - wherein politics, religion, war, corruption, cult-like behavior, etc, seem to merge - incidentally the topics of WWII, Nazis/Hitler, Communism/Russians/Cold-War are all brought up yet again, including Ruth Kelly, a UK politician surrounded by controversy involving registered sex offenders being allowed to teach in schools, under her watch(so to speak).
               </p>
               <p>
                Cursory searches for anything relating to Hanssen/Clinton/Opus Dei, gave interesting results: The nytimes article and the podesta article, wherein we learn that for some reason or another, Hanssen was making regular searches of FBI databases for anything Clinton - Podesta chucking a hissy fit 4 years after Hanssen is arrested, 9/11 signalling in the process...
               </p>
               <p>
                The odd behavior by Podesta and Hanssen(including Hanssen taping his own wife without her consent), along with other curiosities regarding Hanssen's arrest in 2001 and 9/11, etc, all strongly indicate to me that the Clinton/Podesta(et al) group that are strongly pg-relevant, are involved with what Hanssen was doing.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                So, while the person that Q mentioned doesn't seem directly relevant to what I'm looking at just yet, I feel that the peripheral subjects have common ground in this whole issue of Russian/CIA/FBI espionage/corruption. Many links between "the elite" and the CIA/FBI have already been well established here, also.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason I haven't seen anything directly relevant to Stanislav Lunev, is because I am yet to look into him in more detail, as my attention was caught by this whole Hanssen thing...

              At the moment, it looks like that's possible - I'm also pointing out Opus Dei and others 'in power' who have ties to them, etc; links between political/religious power being misused in conjunction with child-abuse and relevant crimes/controversy.

             Actually, this is the sort of thread that puts a sour taste in my mouth about people posting non relevant Q threads in this subverse. You posted a thread that is not pizzagate and now you are digging around for the thinnest of threads to tie all this discombobulated data points to something relevant. I would have deleted it out right if it were up to me and counted it as a shit post.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Q makes a relevant pizzagate connection, great then post it, but this is not one of those.

              Thank you!  I had quite the hiatus which did confirm that too much time on computer for months at a time can leave a person with shoulder pain.  Feeling better, just have to take breaks or suffer the consequences.

               Want to talk to you about something.  A plan I have to counter the attacks of all the symbols they are using.  They stick them on everything.  I have an idea to combat it.  I can DM you.  It will include Twitter or anywhere people are on Soc. Media to spread our Mini Memes including a devised logo of OUR choice.  It will become known and recognized.  The mini-memes will change weekly but logo remain the same.  What do you think.  You are good at this right.  or do I have you mixed up with

                I'm not that good at it.  Just quickie, fast burners.  Some turn out good, others not so much.  I just use the primitive tools on available on the meme page.  I used to use graphics programs (before social media came about) for various things, but that was a lifetime ago.  Don't have those programs now.

FBI: Hanssen suspected he was under surveillance

            WASHINGTON – Accused spy Robert Hanssen suspected he was under government surveillance, telling his Russian contacts "something has aroused the sleeping tiger," the FBI said in an affidavit released Tuesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            The comment came from a letter that FBI officials said was encrypted on a computer diskette found in a package – taped and wrapped in a black plastic trash bag – that Hanssen dropped underneath a foot bridge in a park in Northern Virginia, immediately before his arrest.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI decrypted the letter and described it in an affidavit filed in support of its search warrant.

            Yeah, I just gave you a flair^... Haven't seen the new Q drop, I do know Hanssen was responsible for the largest intelligence breach in American history. Might be related to Hillary and the selling of Special Accsess Program's (SAP) to China, that killed several CIA sources... I'll check up on the new Q, thanks for the heads up.

              It basically means I have 24 hours to make the main body of this submission, reflect some sort of pizzagate relevance to the Q drop. The submission remains up for said 24 hours, so that others can contribute and so that I can make required edits as more is uncovered, if anything.
