<p><strong>FBI on Alefantis threats</strong>: they\'ve called Ryan to check in and see that he\'s OK, but that\'s it for the update. He says he knows for sure that the police aren\'t looking into anything.</p>
<p><strong>Pegasus</strong>: touches on links to Moonie cult, mentions walking tour video that showed lots of red spray paint in the area (&quot;kids&quot;, etc)</p>
<p><strong>Billboard campaign</strong>: some progress made, not ready for billboards yet;\' hardest part is part 3 (the red pill tool)\'</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Red pill tool</strong>&quot;: Information conveyed in a super professional format, clear, concise, short and to the point = we need a video series. Short videos starting with emails, FBIanon, Instagram, geography around Comet... the main things that brought us in in the beginning, that caused red flags. Put all the sources out there, unbiased. Want to give people enough info where they can red pill themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ryan is getting together with the other Ryan, from Random Rants of Ryan on YouTube, to make the videos; they\'re planning to meet up in person and get them done over a weekend. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planning for a website to host around 10 videos totaling less than 30 minutes, so that it appeals to the general public. As it is now, you have to read a lot. Lots of resistance to this among the public, for various reasons. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General idea is to make it as easy as possible for someone to consume. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently looking for a good website name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raised $820 so far. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/pizzagate-billboard-campaign">https://www.gofundme.com/pizzagate-billboard-campaign</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spirit Cooking</strong>: will have its own video. One of the best leads in pizzagate. Podesta obviously knew about spirit cooking given the fact that when Tony emailed John, he didn\'t have to spell it out, just said &quot;dinner&quot;. Abrahmovich performs satanic ritual with bodily fluids, cutting flesh, etc - John Podesta doesn\'t need this explained to him means he\'s likely been to these before - this is Hillary Clinton\'s campaign manager?!!</p>
<p><strong>Pedogate vs Pizzagate</strong>: Pedogate is the &quot;why&quot; that explains Pizzagate. Important to maintain focus on Pizzgate. Pedogate is like an entire castle, while pizzagate is like a little spot in the wall around the castle, a weakness in their infrastructure. We need to keep pushing on that little part of the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing of Pizzagate</strong>: We\'ve let MSM control the narrative of pizzagate = &quot;something only a nutjob could believe in and has been debunked&quot;. We need to do a better job as community to help our marketing of this. The same people who were convinced of pizzagate in the beginning are now further convinced, but are we getting the info out to the public? Each one of us can do something to help.</p>

            What's even  worse, this isn't even about pedophilia really, its about the need to procure children for horrific things tied to satanism - torture, abuse, and murder (sacrifice).

            So the real truth of this is even harder to talk about. Soros, the main guy behind the Democratic Party, has

             There are no horrific things tied to Satanism, because there are no large organized groups of people who literally worship Satan as a literal being. There are occasional individual loners like David Berkowitz, and there are groups like the Church of Satan that use the name Satan metaphorically to refer to a sort of enlightened self-interest, and there are teenagers who like to get a rise out of their square old mom and dad by saying things that will upset them. But actual organized groups that literally worship Satan don't exist. Take heart!

                I grew up in omaha during the Franklin scandal. Had a friend, now dead, who was called "Wednesdays' child" by the men featured in this  documentary. He wore a huge gold Rolex on his AIDS-ridden wrist, a payment for his services.

             Should be  "threatened him and his family". 
Just a little grammar policing for you so you can better make your aggressively rude and unhelpful  comments all over each thread. So bored with your sad protesting.

             Fuck off dude... what evidence do YOU have that this is fake? Why wouldn't Alefantis have filed a lawsuit over something like this? It's the clearest case of slander ever if it was fake. If I was JA - I'd sue the shit out of him if it was fake.
            </p>

             Why do I even bother responding to this pile of shill?

            They should contact Jake Morphonios from End of Times News he is the best at professional presentation of this material. His Out of the Darkness is amazing.

             Agreed... I've supported Jake and Ryan financially... ready to do more. Perhaps an advertising campaign once the video series is done?
