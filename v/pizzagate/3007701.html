<h2>The Brazilian healer became a prominent spiritual figure in 2010, when Oprah Winfrey visited him and said she almost fainted during the “blissful” encounter. And of course Marina Abramovic and Bill Clinton visited him too! /s</h2>
<p><strong>The TV host featured her healing experience in a since-deleted episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show titled \'Leap of Faith: Meet John of God’, in which she described seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anaesthesia and left feeling “an overwhelming sense of peace&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>The 77-year-old\'s reputation as a renowned \'spiritual healer\' crumbled two months ago after he was accused of sexually abusing a Dutch woman.</p>
<p>The woman\'s claims prompted over 600 similar allegations to arise from around the world.</p>
<p>Their ages at the time of the alleged assaults, which took place from the 1980s through to October 2018, range from nine to 67, according to investigators.</p>
<p><strong>All claim the medium invited them for private consultations, where he turned them to face away from him then performed sexual acts as part of their “cure”.</strong></p>
<p>Last week prosecutors brought new charges against him, including that he and his son Sandro Teixeira de Oliveira threatened a victim with a gun, then offered her money, to withdraw a complaint of sexual abuse again the medium back in 2016.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h2><em>Brazilian activist Sabrina Bittencourt has now sensationally claimed the celebrity medium ran a baby trafficking operation, in which children were “farmed” in Brazil before being sold to childless couples around the world.</em></h2>
<p>Bittencourt\'s previous investigations led to the spiritual leader\'s arrest in December.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She claims young girls were held captive in remote farms, where they were forced to produce babies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>She added that the women were murdered after 10 years of giving birth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a video, Bittencourt, whose organisation, <em>Coame</em>, helps women report sexual assault by religious leaders, said she has spoken to women from at least three continents who claimed they bought Brazilian babies from John of God for as much as £40,000, reported the Mirror.</p>
<p>Europe was also listed as one of the three continents where Brazilian babies were bought.</p>
<p>Bittencourt claims she has collected testimony from former members of the John of God cult.</p>
<h2><em>She claims Faria would offer money to poor girls aged 14 to 18 to go and live in mineral mines or farms he owns in the Brazilian states of Goias and Minas Gerais.</em></h2>
<p><strong>There they would become sex slaves and be forced to get pregnant - and their babies would be sold to the highest bidder from other continents</strong>, Bittencourt alleges.</p>
<p>She said: “In exchange for food, they were impregnated and their babies sold on the black market.</p>
<p><strong>“Hundreds of girls were enslaved over years, lived on farms in Goias, served as wombs to get pregnant, for their babies to be sold.</strong></p>
<h2><em>“These girls were murdered after 10 years of giving birth. We have got a number of testimonies.&quot;</em></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have received reports from the adoptive mothers of their children that we sold for between £15,000 and £40,000 in Europe, USA and Australia, as well as testimony from ex-workers and local people who are tired of being complicit with John of God’s gang.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<h2>&quot;My father is a monster.&quot;</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the hundreds of allegations against Faria, <strong>his own daughter, Dalva Teixeira</strong>, came forward with a shocking statement that she was a victim of her father\'s crimes.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Brazilian magazine Veja, she said that <strong>under the pretence of mystical treatments he abused and raped her between the ages of ten and 14.</strong></p>
<p>She claimed he stopped after she became pregnant by one of his employees, after which her father beat her so severely that she suffered a miscarriage.</p>

            I have a question. did chief justice Roberts adopt his kids from this source... most people claim that his children were originally children from Ireland and the children were shipped out of country to brazil and adopted there. we know that Roberts was being blackmailed over the story... big problem is that no one has come forward pushing the issue where the children came from what if the origin is actualy a baby farm and the birth certificates are forgeries to cover the source... this is a lot of what ifs that needs to be researched by someone  at this point the highest probability is that the kids were Irish in origin the thing has me speculating is the fact that there seems to be connections to the Clintons and Orpah. What better way to control someone then to allow them to think that there illicit adoption is one thing but instead it something even worse.

              this is just speculation about there being a connection... The irish illegal adoption story has been out there for years mostly talked about on social networking site 
here are some of the storys done in the media.

              none of theses articles even examine the idea that the kids came from a source other then Ireland.  they just assume the stoy that the kids were originaly from Ireland are true not a cover story

            Yes and I believe some are in plain sight such as the FLDS compounds and the Amish community. Fritz Springmeier who has written about bloodlines of the elite as well as MKUltra mentions how the Amish have been infiltrated by Luciferians and that was one way they procured children. The FLDS breed with young girls and boy children are 'sent away' called Lost Boys because they are seen as competition for the older males. It is my belief those boys are sacrificed or sent away as sex slaves. Rarely do any of them speak out only a few have. I have made an extensive thread about it all here on voat

               No! It's fake news! She has said that she is alive! When you google her name and 'suicidio', you will find several sources where she says she didn't committ suicide! That's probably a cruel harassment campaign by her enemies.

                No. Unfortunately no. They made fake news on december 13. Today it was really confirmed hours ago that she has killed herself. News from today.

                  I looked into it, and did some digging. She had cancer, and the day before she killed herself, she learned that one of the protected victims in the John of God case was murdered by killers in London. This really tormented her.

                 <p>
                  Her son said she killed herself because she didn't want to be murdered by gangs or die of cancer (but decide for herself when to die). :-(
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So her death really seems to have been a suicide. :-(

                  May she rest in peace.

                    This guy says she phoned him the day before she died:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Sabrina Bittencourt, the greatest activist in Brazil, called me yesterday in tears for not being able to bear the pain and pressure of the threats of assassins who persecuted her around the world.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    She denounced the scheme of John of God and put him in jail. Denounced and ended Prem Baba. She spent 20 years working to help young women and women victims of abuse around the world.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Yesterday, after one of her protected witnesses had shelter invaded in London by hired killers, Sabrina called me in tears, not knowing what else to do. She only wanted to help, but the evil guided by militiamen, politicians in power at that time and powerful religious leaders, managed to win.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I tried what I could, but Sabrina could not stand the fight anymore. She changed her country clandestinely every week to escape those who wanted her dead. A week ago, a guy started a campaign to destroy Sabrina's reputation, claiming that she would be addicted to drugs and and schizophrenia and so none of her accusations should be taken seriously.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Her children had to constantly run away from killers. The invasion of the house of one of her proteges, the constant threats and the pressure of having no life but fleeing and denouncing made her call me. And unfortunately I have not been able to stop it.

                    Sabrina took her own life yesterday. What she left was not just a legacy of a fight against abusive religious leaders and gang bosses of murders, child trafficking and kidnappings. She also left all clues, witnesses and letters in the hands of justice.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I can not detail, I can not have these guys behind me, I'm not strong like Sabrina, but I beg you, from the bottom of my heart, to try to find out who Sabrina Bittencourt was, whom she put behind bars and who she was denouncing before to die.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    They are powerful people who are in control and who have managed to silence our heroine.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My pain is immense. The feeling of helplessness and failure to save your life is indescribable. The only thing that comforts me is that Sabrina did not really die, because what she did in life will last forever. Go in peace, Sabrina, find what you never had on this earth: tranquility. You deserve it.
                   </p>

                    Her son also said that she didn't want to get killed by gangs or by cancer. But I'd have to find the link to his Facebook post, not sure whether I've archived it.

            Wow, this is a whole new level of accusations. Brazilians are calling him Joao do Capeta, John of the Devil.

            I used to be intrigued by this guy, have a book about him even. I recall he'd have a hall full of people dressed in white meditating while he 'operated', he supposedly channeled their energy somehow.

            Christian goats:  I once read in a book by a hands-on healer who claimed it was all good, that Satan can't heal. Thought she said this was in Corinthians, but couldn't find it later on. Is this so?

              Here's what Jesus said:
             </p>
             <h1>
              Jesus and Beelzebul (Matthew 12)
             </h1>
             <p>
              22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. 23 All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
             </p>
             <p>
              24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”
             </p>
             <p>
              25 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. 26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? 27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. 28 But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...33 “Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. 34 You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. 35 A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. 36

                Good point! Somewhere there is also a warning to test everything, even if it comes from an angel, or something along those lines somewhere in the NT, but I can't recall exactly where it's found.

               I was musing about this in this context, since de Faria did actually help a lot of people. With the first wave of allegations you might call him a really bad sinner, now he appears to be pure evil. Who cooks up schemes such as alleged?

               I recall something else about how he operated: He claimed to be channeling spirits of famous, long-dead physicians.

                I don't know - I would say that someone who has raped hundreds of women is already 'pure evil'.

               <p>
                He also seems to have had other schemes in order to make money - illegal mining of precious and semi-precious stones, and funeral fraud (people from other countries who died on his premises where made to sign contracts before they died, and they were buried at higher prices than those usually charged).
               </p>
               <p>
                The healings some people experienced when they consulted him might have been partly due to the allgedly peaceful atmosphere at his place (for those who were not assaulted :-( ), and a placebo effect.
               </p>
               <p>
                But many people died when they were back home, or their state of health declined.

                 Yeah, not to minimize what he did, or to borrow Whoopi Goldberg's "it's not rape rape", but the first allegations were he used his authority to persuade vulnerable women that having sex with him would be healing. With underage victims, including his own daughter, forcible rape, and 600 allegations that's pure evil. Sex slavery, baby trafficking, and murder I'd even call demonic.

            Lol, my ex girlfriend was super into this dude, I knew he was a fraud. She used to go see him at seminars and I even worked at a place in upstate new york where he held his stupid bullshit. All those 'gurus' are sexual deviant frauds. Why do so many people, especially women fall for this bullshit?

           <p>
            Steve Aoki is a pedophile, or at least knows about #pizzagate. This is the only picture on his personal instagram account and his company "pizzaoki" Instagram page that has the hashtag #pizzagate. Please explore for yourself. And guess what? The picture features the WB show "Smallville" nasty woman that was indicted last year for her role in the sex cult NXIVM for alleged sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor and other nasty stuff. This is more than just mere coincidence.

            I could not Archive.today Aoki's Instagram page directly. The following links are the actual/archive.today links for websites that can mirror instagram pages.

            I would take a screen shot of Aoki's Instagram page before anything is done with this information and he has the chance to take it down directly. Please do with this information as you please. This is my attempt to help get the word out and I will be spreading the information around online as well and to various news agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the first hint I have personally found that gives any credible information linking Steve Aoki to #pizzagate. I also believe I might be the first one to have noticed Aoki's link to #pizzagate. It would be awesome if this information could be shared with the various Chans. I am unfamiliar with them.

             Pizzaoki is apparently a pizza delivery restaurant in LA. Using Allison Mack and the #pizzagate hashtag is disturbing.

            This is a big one, ties together all of the most talked about people on this sub. Are there “farms” like this operating in the US, as some of the WikiLeaks Podesta e-mails alluded to? The MSM trick is to just not report on stories like this so let’s all try get the word out as much as we can.

             Yes and I believe some are in plain sight such as the FLDS compounds and the Amish community. Fritz Springmeier who has written about bloodlines of the elite as well as MKUltra mentions how the Amish have been infiltrated by Luciferians and that was one way they procured children. The FLDS breed with young girls and boy children are 'sent away' called Lost Boys because they are seen as competition for the older males. It is my belief those boys are sacrificed or sent away as sex slaves. Rarely do any of them speak out only a few have. I have made an extensive thread about it all here on voat

              Never heard that about the Amish or the Mennonites. Got at least one small relative there with no problem. Kind of funny how Hollywood keeps attacking the Amish for being their selves, though. They picked our redneck family for our robust features, and being next door most likely. Kids can still visit anytime.

             Possible. We know that cults keep women as 'breeders'.

             But it might actually be easier in most cases to 'import' the babies from countries like Brazil or Mexico.

              Damn!!! I've been woke for over twenty years  but I have never know about the pedophelia. It is more than disturbing how deep it runs and that so many people get off of raping children. It HAS to come to light!!! People need to know.

               Have you, by any chance, read this post about Hollywood director Bryan Singer? The linked article in

                The Atlantic
               </em>
               is a worthwhile read.

                 The new documentary about Michael Jackson's assaults on boys was screened at the Sundance festival last Friday, and many film critics were shocked. Seems to have been a big redpill even for MSM journalists.

                  Actually I am surprised they even showed it. But it sure is a huge red pill. I remember when MJ would show up in PJs in the court house. I wonder what he did to his kids. They're quite damaged.

            I saw a report of charles landeros in a youtube video being called to the school for alleged abuse of one of his daughters. Need help finding information on this. Court records from their custody battler perhaps. Where did the youtuber get that info?
