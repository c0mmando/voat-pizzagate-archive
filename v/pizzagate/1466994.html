            Scotland Yard released today that the McCann investigation has reopened with the theory that child traffickers were responsible.  On MSM.  Unbelievable.

            There was an email from someone else telling Podesta to "have a safe trip" on 05-04-2007
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9364">

            This says it's from John Podesta, and to Hms, but it's signed Elizabeth, and if you view source, it also says delivered to podesta.
Confused by what that means but I recall someone saying it was someone taking care of his email for him
That only says that he was going somewhere though, not specifically where.

            I would like to know this too. Apparently there is a suspicious scrubbing of activity from the podesta emails on that date.

            According to Victurus Libertas, at the time that Madeline was abducted John and Tony Podesta were staying at a mansion that was 1/3 of a mile where Madeline was abducted from (Suffolk Police) . Also reported confirmation (FBI) that John and Tony Podesta were in Praia da Luz, Portugal the day that Madaline McCann vanished.

            Clement Freud wasn't in the country at the time, but I've heard a rumor that he loaned the Podestas his villa.  A rumor is all it was.  I couldn't find anything to back it up, either.  Best of luck.  This could still be a lead.  It's a big internet out there, after all.
