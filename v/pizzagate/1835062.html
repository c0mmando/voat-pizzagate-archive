            It is shocking the first time you read about it, isn't it? Epstein is a free man and a monster. There's so much more info on his cases. You should look into it. What I would like is for Vicky Ward to answer why she was photographed with Ghislaine Maxwell in 2009?!? I found this picture this week....

            OLD SHIT ON EPSTEIN AND ALSO WHO BUILT THE HOUSE ON LITTLE ST. JAMES ISLAND (ORGY ISLAND)
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private 
dwelling in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named “Zorro.” “It 
makes the town house look like a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, 
a 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being 
renovated by Edward Tuttle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million 
house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and 
a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, 
actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman’s 
grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS 
and economic development in Africa.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom he has 
been able to commit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and 
stock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients 
secret, bar one client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands.
 Epstein insists that ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for
 billionaires—who depend on him for discretion. “I was the only person crazy enough, or 
arrogant enough, or misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more,” he tells
 people freely. According to him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with
 his skill at playing the currency markets “with very large sums of money,” have afforded 
him the lifestyle he enjoys today.
           </p>
           <p>
            He’s a member of various commissions and councils: he is on the Trilateral Commission, the 
Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of 
International Education.
           </p>
           <p>
            One reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They 
were delivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your
 family if I don’t like the article.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model types
 have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he
 is a familiar face to many of the Victoria’s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being 
summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein’s town house, where the women seemed 
to outnumber the men by far. “These were not women you’d see at Upper East Side dinners,” 
the woman recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.” This same guest 
also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was 
filled, she says, with young Russian models. “Some of the guests were horrified,” the woman
 says.

           <p>
            UPDATE TO THE VANITY FAIR ARTICLE FROM 2002 When Vicky Ward profiled Jeffrey Epstein for 
Vanity Fair, allegations of his attempted seduction of two young sisters were excised from 
the final piece.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven’t ever wanted to go back and dwell on that dark time. But then the latest Epstein 
scandal broke, when Prince Andrew was accused in a Florida court filing of having sex with 
a 17-year-old girl while she was a “sex slave” of Epstein’s.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Epstein’s old mentor, the convicted fraudster Steven Hoffenberg, recently released from 
jail after a 20-year sentence, has been pestering me and my agent to write a movie.
Separately, Hoffenberg’s daughter has gotten in touch—and it’s gotten me thinking. There 
are some injustices that maybe only time can right. And perhaps now is the time. Things 
happened then that simply shouldn’t have, and if I don’t talk about them, then probably no 
one will.
