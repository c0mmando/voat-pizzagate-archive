            Ok... good stuff at the outset, but when Clif mentioned pyramid cities under Antarctica, that was when I pulled the chute.

             There's a theory that previous civilizations such as Atlantis moved thousands of miles from their original location when Earth underwent a major shift due to tremendous natural disasters. Therefore under Antarctica there could be remnants of a city from thousands of years ago which the more recent split in the continent uncovered.

             Yeah. I guess his program scans "chatter" on the internet and he reports on that. The information he had about pizzagate was the essential information being discussed here except for the percentages. I've wondered how many people in gov are in the pedocracy. 50% - This is the first number I've seen anyone speculate on.

            "If you knew, for instance that every single person that was in an appointed office in the federal government and every single person that was in an appointed office in any of the state governments that had been appointed in the last 15 years was.. uh... had an odds on.. um…  in other words you had the ability to say there was a 50% chance that anybody that’s been appointed to a political office in the last 15 to 20 years is a pedophile, ok,  is an egregious pedophile and may even be a murderer. If you knew that half of all these people were in fact actively engaged in such things then how could you possibly vote for them.  A lot of people would deny that and so on and put up an wall of denial and go ahead and vote on it. But the problem is the ability to keep those things secret is entirely based on the petrodollar, and its dying and these people know that."
