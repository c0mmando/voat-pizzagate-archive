<p>&quot;In effect from 1979 to 2015, China’s policy placed strict guidelines on reproduction in order to curb population growth...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those who suffered those penalties, however, got off easy, since local Family Planning Officials—empowered by the Communist Party—also had the authority to abduct women, tie them up, and force them to undergo sterilizations and abortions as late as eight to nine months into their pregnancies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;those procedures often entailed murdering infants after they’d been born. Artist Peng Wang presents photos of discarded fetuses he found in trash dumps, wrapped in yellow “medical waste” bags, as well as one deceased newborn that he kept in a formaldehyde-filled jar. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that environment, disposing of female infants was no big deal—not that China stopped there. In the early 1990s, the country began allowing foreigners to adopt “orphans,” thereby creating a booming market for Chinese girls. What Wang and Zhang reveal is that overseas adoption quickly became a despicable trafficking racket in which Family Planning officials tore second children away from their homes and gave them to orphanages (for a fee), which then sold them to American and European families who ostensibly had no clue that they were perpetuating a kidnapping-for-profit paradigm.&quot;</p>

              Lest we forget the origins of pizzagate:
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet Another Update On Baptists In Haiti:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The leader of the group of Americans charged on Thursday with abducting children in Haiti is an Idaho businesswoman with a complicated financial history that involves complaints from employees over unpaid wages, state liens on a company bank account and lawsuits in small claims court.
             </p>
             <p>
              The leader, Laura Silsby, defaulted last July on the mortgage on a house in an unfinished subdivision here in Meridian, a suburb of Boise, according to the Ada County Tax Assessor’s Office. Yet in November, Ms. Silsby registered a new nonprofit, the New Life Children’s Refuge, at the address of the house, which she bought in 2008 for $358,000. …
             </p>
             <p>
              Ms. Silsby and her business, Personal Shopper, which provides shopping services for Internet customers, have faced multiple legal claims.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to state records and officials, Personal Shopper has been named 14 times in complaints from employees over unpaid wages. Among the reasons cited by the employees for having not been paid were “no money for payroll” and “fully investor funded and investors have been hit hard by the economy.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Employees won nine of the cases, forcing Personal Shopper to pay nearly $31,000 in wages and $4,000 in fines. The Idaho Department of Labor initially put liens on a company bank account to get the money.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nevertheless, despite her questionable business history, Ms Silsby has some very loyal and very religious supporters:
             </p>
             <p>
              Clint Henry, pastor of Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, where five of the Americans charged in Haiti attend services, said Ms. Silsby had attended his church for about two years.
             </p>
             <p>
              “You wouldn’t find any finer Christian people than these people,” Mr. Henry said in an interview earlier this week."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In addition to this, it appears that Ms Silsby’s nine followers are no longer fans of hers, as the New York Times (again!) is reporting (WebCite cached article):
             </p>
             <p>
              Divisions emerged within the group of 10 Americans jailed in Haiti on child abduction charges, with eight of them signing a note over the weekend saying that they had been misled by Laura Silsby, the leader of the group.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Laura wants to control,” said the scribbled note handed to a producer for NBC News. “We believe lying. We’re afraid.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The infighting came amid a shakeup in the legal representation of the Americans, who have been charged with trying to remove 33 Haitian children from the country without government permission. …

             <p>
              The note signed by the group, which is affiliated with a Baptist church in Twin Falls, Idaho, made clear that they were emotionally distraught and divided. “We fear for our lives here in Haiti,” said the letter, which was signed by everyone except Ms. Silsby and Charisa Coulter, Ms. Silsby’s former nanny and co-founder of the group.
             </p>
             <p>
              “We only came as volunteers,” the note went on. “We had NOTHING to do with any documents and have been lied to.”
             </p>
             <p>
              It’s too bad it took being jailed in Haiti before they figured out Ms Silsby is not to be trusted."

              "Guerlaine Antoine pushed aside a tub full of laundry, wiped her soapy hands on her T-shirt and rushed barefoot to bring out photos of the 8-year-old boy she entrusted to 10 American Baptists.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Do you think I would give this child away?” she said, opening a grade school yearbook to show her son, Carl Ramirez Antoine, in cap and gown, at his kindergarten graduation. “He is my only treasure.” …
             </p>
             <p>
              Kisnel and Florence Antoine said they sent two of their children with the Baptist missionaries because they had offered educational opportunities for the children in the Dominican Republic. Ketlaine Valmont said she had sent a son.
             </p>
             <p>
              They showed school photos and academic awards to demonstrate that they had not selfishly sent their children away to lighten their load.
             </p>
             <p>
              In a country where more than half of all children come from families too poor to keep them in school, the parents said that the Americans’ offer of an education seemed like a gift from heaven.
             </p>
             <p>
              They also wanted to give opportunities for something better to their children. They said that the missionaries had promised they would be able to visit their children in the Dominican Republic, and that the children would be free to come home for visits."
             </p>
             <p>
              "It’s clear, however, that the Baptists had planned to place these children for adoption:
             </p>
             <p>
              The Americans said that the children had been orphaned in the earthquake, and that they had authorization from the Dominican government to bring the children into the country.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it became clear on Tuesday that at least some of the children had not lost their parents in the earthquake.
             </p>
             <p>
              So not only were these kids not orphaned or abandoned — and the Baptists knew this, because they had spoken with at least some of the parents — their claim of not planning to adopt them out, is also demonstrably untrue:
             </p>
             <p>
              And while the Americans said they did not intend to offer the children for adoption, the Web site for their orphanage [WebCite cached version] makes clear that they intended to do so."

             <p>
              "This scenario, at least in its barest bones, is quite plausible, according to Mother Jones, which on Friday published a deep-dive into the relationship between the Democratic presidential candidate and Kissinger, a former Secretary of State under Richard Nixon and famous diplomat. Their annual vacation together in the Dominican Republic was one of the stand-out details. From Mother Jones:
             </p>
             <p>
              The Clintons and Kissingers appear to spend a chunk of their quality time together at that de la Renta estate in the Punta Cana resort. Last year, the Associated Press noted that this is where the Clintons take their annual Christmas holiday. And other press reports in the United States and the Dominican Republic have pointed out that the Kissingers are often part of the gang the de la Rentas have hosted each year."

              The Opium War's Secret History
             </p>
             <p>
              "Along with the slave trade, the traffic in opium was the dirty underside of an evolving global trading economy. In America as in Europe, pretty much everything was deemed fair in the pursuit of profits. Such was the outlook at Russell &amp; Company, a Boston concern whose clipper ships made it the leader in the lucrative American trade in Chinese tea and silk.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1823 a 24-year-old Yankee, Warren Delano, sailed to Canton, where he did so well that within seven years he was a senior partner in Russell &amp; Company. Delano's problem, as with all traders, European and American, was that China had much to sell but declined to buy. The Manchu emperors believed that the Middle Kingdom already possessed everything worth having, and hence needed no barbarian manufactures.
             </p>
             <p>
              The British struck upon an ingenious way to reduce a huge trade deficit. Their merchants bribed Chinese officials to allow entry of chests of opium from British-ruled India, though its importation had long been banned by imperial decree. Imports soared, and nearly every American company followed suit, acquiring ''black dirt'' in Turkey or as agents for Indian producers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Writing home, Delano said he could not pretend to justify the opium trade on moral grounds, ''but as a merchant I insist it has been . . . fair, honorable and legitimate,'' and no more objectionable than the importation of wines and spirits to the U.S. Yet as addiction became epidemic, and as the Chinese began paying with precious silver for the drug, their Emperor finally in 1839 named an Imperial Commissioner to end the trade."

             I've mainly focused on the abortion side of the one child policy. I didn't think about the trafficking aspect until this documentary.

                Not sure don't go there much anymore, but they're all the southwest seen  a lot in Texas. I'm sure they're evenly distributed and use Chinese restaurants to transport and provide cover.
