            They are not panicking, they are simply maintaining their mind control of the inferior sheeple. Quit kidding yourself that they are scared. Scared  of what? They control the government top to bottom, inteligence agencies and the judicial system. Zero fear. So how is that Irwan investigation going? So how is Trumps Marines rresting the CIA story looking? Wake up or go back to sleep.

            What a piece of shit for an article.  Beyond it being nearly impossible to read - BAD WRITING - it completely omits all of the relevant facts associated with the case.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Until November 2016, the Pizzagate hashtag had mostly referred to
             <strong>
              Trump's use of a fork and knife to eat pizza
             </strong>
             . But on November 4th, two days after Hagmann's appearance on InfoWars, Cassandra Fairbanks, then a reporter for Sputnik News (which U.S. intelligence says spreads Kremlin-directed- disinformation), tweeted, "I've literally spent the last hour wondering if podesta ingested sperm mixed with breast milk with his brother." In response, another user,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/GodlessNZ">
              @GodlessNZ
             </a>
             , appears to have launched the hashtag: "Tweets assembling under #JohnMolesta and maybe #PizzaGate."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I would like to believe that was code for "I don't put my hands on the pizza, I don't molest little children."

            I have a bunch of Rolling Stone Magazine's for the nineties I should probably dig through them and see if there's any good dirt in it because it really feels like this magazine is nothing more than a CIA psyops program

             Rolling Stone and Vice are both CIA propaganda rags as far as I've been able to figure out.  I'm not saying PG isn't a russian psy-op itself, I think it was a deliberated targeted strike - an infowar tactical nuke of sorts.  That would explain why fake news trends chime with Pizzagate on Google Trends.  "Fake News" started to trend slightly before PG broke, my guess is that the CIA side got a tip off the Russians were planning something big and so the Fake News campaign was started to provide a defence against the coming strike.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yes,  there is plenty of fake news, on both sides of the infowar.  That is what they don't want to tell you, its all the Russians are doing this, the Russians are doing that, never "We're both in a full scale propaganda war with each other".  And its not to say that PG isn't based on some truth.  The Russians I think knew some of the seedier side of what was going on in Washington from their own agents and PG was a direct strike by them.

               Not at all floating "The Russians did it", that is what morons with an agenda say,or those who can't face they lost the election.  But the idea Russia is passive is nonsense.  Unless you've been living under a rock you'd be aware Russia is in an infowar with the globalists.  More power to them, I hate the globalists.  If they saw PG (they'd likely have their own spooks installed in DC cos its crawling with US intelligence types), why
               <em>
                wouldn't
               </em>
               they take advantage by making sure it got heard about?
              </p>
              <p>
               And why wouldn't the DC folk panic soon as they got wind and suddenly have to start crying "fake news" to cover it up?  Fake News was a nobody term before PG, and then all of a sudden its fake news this, fake news that.  That was NOT a coincidence.
              </p>

               If i'm a shill i must be a terrible one.

              "Fake News" was born in the DNC in an email. I saw the wikileaks email. It basically said "if something big comes out its fake news." Birthing of talking points.

              Pizzagate story broke because clever internet people understood the code in wikileaks emails. As people were pouring through the emails Julian Assange asked a question to the email diggers in a hinting way without telling them exactly what it meant. I caused people to better focus in the right areas.

             Imo, the Instagram pics are the Best Red Pilling available.  Just make sure that you show them to people that can take it.  The pics are extremely shocking to some.  Only show people what you think they will be able to process.  They will shut down if you over do.

             I'd just add that virtually every convoluted "its fake news" message is different, but I have always been successful--when trying to red-pill friends and family---with the mosy basic argument:  "Given what LEOs say the code-talk means, can you explain away with any detail the Podesta emails w/ all the references to pizza, etc....?"  NOBODY can do it.  The response to articles like this one should always be "Not listening until you explain THAT."

               There are plenty of examples of individuals who are well-informed on the case, Wikileaks postings by credible people....So you are demanding a PUBLISHED list?   The FBI has published their SYMBOLS.  Have you seen them?  Pizzas, the disgusting boy-lover logo...seen all over the Comet Pizza place and their pubs/menus....rational connections are then made by reasonable people.  On what authority do you claim that the code-talk idea is false?
You'd need just as much special knowledge to be able to prove it false as any of us would need to PROVE it true.

                It's completely made up.  It doesn't exist whatsoever prior to Podesta's emails being published.  That's my authority.  You can do the search yourself.

                You need to explain why you fell for a hoax list and continue to defend it. You claimed Law Enforcement Officers are the source of the list.  That is false.   There is zero code in the Podesta emails.

                  You're kidding right?  I ask for original sources and you bring up the the Pizzagate Wiki?   And you bring up a page that does not even support your argument.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Have you even read that page?   It confirms zero original sources for the list of code words and refers only to speculation.

                   Speculation exists about some words that were found out of context in certain leaked Wikileaks emails.

                  <p>
                   Note that even the NYTimes refers to the code in a linked article in my link.

                  No it does not.  It refers to a symbol.  I know about the FBI document on the symbols and logos and I have not questioned that.    We are talking about code, words, text.  AND YOU KNOW THIS as you refer more than once to code-talk.  You claim that the this code talk is backed up by law enforcement sources and you have just basically proven, that the entire pizzagate investigation as codified in the WIKI has found nothing.  There is no source for this list of code words, that it's just speculation and Law Enforcement has never said this PG list of words was valid.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You have proven my point.

                   Yes, its entirely reasonable to believe that they are speaking in code. MORE reasonable than to believe that two busy, college-educated adults waste time talking jabberwocky via email.

                 <p>
                  Entirely false.  The only way this seems reasonable is if you have already bought into a conclusion and you are trying to justify it.
It's not jabberwocky at all.  That email is entirely understandable to an outsider.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They are talking about Christmas gifts and Podesta surprised them by changing what he gave as a gift for Christmas.  The phrasing is a bit odd, but completely understandable.  No different from saying "on an empty stomach"   It's quite unreasonable to believe code is involved.

Cook: 15 min
Yield: 8 to 10 servings
Level: Easy
Ingredients
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    6 ounces shelled walnuts
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1 slice bread, crusts removed
2/3 cup whole milk
1 ounce grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish
3 to 4 tablespoons olive oil (preferably Ligurian)
Salt and pepper
2 pounds any flat short pasta
1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley, for garnish
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Directions
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Put a large saucepan of water on to boil, and toast the walnuts in a dry frying pan until they begin to make a nutty aroma. Put the bread in a bowl and cover with the milk. Put most of the toasted walnuts (reserving about 1 ounce for garnish) into a blender along with the garlic, bread soaked in milk, and Parmesan. Blend until it turns smooth and creamy, then pour in the oil and season well with salt and pepper before blending again.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Pour into a bowl, and set aside.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Add pasta to boiling water with salt and cook for the required amount of time. When pasta is al dente, reserve a cup of the pasta cooking liquid and then drain the pasta, but put it in to a large bowl while it's still dripping slightly with water. Sprinkle a little olive oil over the pasta to prevent it sticking together, and then add the walnut sauce, mixing it into the pasta (splash in a little pasta cooking liquid to make the sauce less thick if needed).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Roughly chop the remaining walnuts and toss them over the top along with some more Parmesan and the chopped parsley.
