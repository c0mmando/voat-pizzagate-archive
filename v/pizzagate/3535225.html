<p>Last month, the FBI released over 300 pages relating to decades-old investigations into the “Finders.” Analysis of the eye-opening documents, which include police reports and correspondence between various agencies, reveals that the group was a satanic cult and suggests deliberate obstruction of justice by feds and the CIA, which is all the more relevant in light of the recent attention to sexual and child abuse scandals connected with the rich and powerful, and the shady history of US Deep State intelligence agencies.  Those documents are linked here...</p>
<p><a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders/the-finders-part-01-of-01/view">https://vault.fbi.gov/the-finders/the-finders-part-01-of-01/view</a></p>
<p>The story began in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida, with the arrest of two men traveling with six children aged 2-11, who stated they were on their way to a school for “brilliant” children in Mexico. The men were uncooperative with police, and the children were dirty, very hungry, without underwear, had bug bites, and seemed unused to modern technology like plumbing.</p>
<p>The FBI files reveal that one of the men had two copies of the Miranda rights, one of which started with “I have nothing to hide” and the other with “I have something to hide.”</p>
<p>After picking up the men and children, law enforcement determined that they were connected with a cult called the “Finders,” which is known to have been led by a man named Marion Pettie who called himself the “Game Caller,” and would give missions to the members that could be anything from taking an odd job to traveling internationally.</p>
<p>Local police and FBI carried out search warrants on both of the Finders’ locations, a farm and a warehouse near DC. What was found there appears to be a subject of controversy. A USCS agent reported “a substantial amount of computer equipment” and “documents purportedly containing instructions for obtaining children,” allegedly including “purchasing,” “trading,” and “kidnaping” children.</p>
<p>The warehouse was also the subject of an “inquiry” involving “classified maps of underground tunnel/sewer system” in DC. At the farm, police found evidence of a “satanic/cult ritual.” Contemporary stories report that photos recovered included children dismembering goats while watched by white-robed men; a child in chains; and naked children.</p>
<p>However, the investigation appears to have been quickly taken over by the FBI. Despite everything found, the search warrant was “shut down on first day,” and a subsequent FBI walk through examined no evidence.</p>
<p>A Customs agent interested in building a case concerning “possible export, neutrality act, mann act, and child pornography violations” was denied access to the evidence, and several later parts deny that the previously listed evidence even existed.</p>
<p>There are also numerous redactions involving what was found and the people and agencies involved, meaning it is possible there was further physical evidence originally recovered which remains wholly unknown.</p>
<p>That said, there appears to be at least one point where redaction was inconsistent, revealing information. One sentence reads “As far as is known, no details of [redacted] involvement ever became public.” Much later in the document, another reads “As far as is known, no details of CIA or FCIA involvement ever became public.”</p>
<p>The connection to the CIA goes back decades, as attested to in thoroughly sourced contemporary news clippings included in the doc. One from the Washington Times reports that a “Justice Department special task force is investigating whether the CIA used a cult called the Finders as a front organization to provide computer training to intelligence agents in the 1980s.”</p>
<p>It further cites a memo likely written by the previously mentioned USCS officer, who wrote that “the investigation into the activity of the Finders had become a CIA internal matter… [The Metropolitan Police Department] report has been classified secret and not available for review.”</p>
<p>The smoking gun, however, is a written record of an interview from 1987 with a “CIA Special Agent” who confirmed that the CIA is “working on the case.” When asked if the MPD investigation is “treading on anyone’s toes,” he replied “sort of.” In addition, he confirmed that a woman named Isabelle, listed in other places among entities associated with the Finders as Isabelle Pettie, in the past was employed by the CIA.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, within a few months all charges against the men picked up in 1987 were dropped, all the evidence was either destroyed or “returned to its owners,” and the children themselves were given to “individuals claiming to be their guardians,” who were from the cult.</p>
<p>The case was then reopened in 1993 when the Department of Justice requested an inquiry into the Finders, whether there was evidence that they had abused children, and “what role, if any, was played by the United States intelligence community.” There is no indication that this went anywhere.</p>
<p>The only part possibly more bizarre are two pages seemingly at random in the document that relate to an entirely different case, that of the McMartin preschool, which was a private school at which the owners were also accused of child abuse in the late 1980s. The trial concluded with the defendants escaping any criminal convictions. The victims made accusations of satanism and tunnels under the preschool, at the time seen as fantastical.</p>
<p>However, the FBI Finders doc confirms much of those allegations, as it includes a map and description of tunnels found under the McMartin preschool, along with a litany of evidence including pentagrams and hundreds of animal bones.</p>
<p>Both events are viewed by the mainstream today as part of an overblown “satanic panic.” However, these new documents conclusively vindicate all those, past and present, concerned with the possibility of actual satanic pedophiles connected to the US Deep State preying on children. These evil groups must be thoroughly exposed and ended once and for all.</p>
<p>For those interested in continuing the investigation themselves, the FBI doc contains more information than could be summarized here. There are also surely more old sources to be dug up, and at least one documentary on the subject.</p>
<p>The documentary is linked here...</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/QwDxfoHaEqQ">https://youtu.be/QwDxfoHaEqQ</a></p>
<p>While this may be a decades old story, with the newly released docs all of this information needs to be gone through in order properly connect the dots.  It seems pretty clear that this was swept under the rug and has connections to intelligence agencies and high level politicians.</p>',

            Kristin Knauth is stil easy to find and so is Finder's child Ben Knauth. The highlights to this file are the fact that children were being traded through Hong Kong, they were kept in cages, they were photographed participating in ritual sacrifices, they were also photographed naked. Since some of the children are now adults, it surprises me not a single journalists has bothered to ask them what in the world was really happening."

              Most definitely. We know many LE wear badges with the triangle boy love symbol on them. Also Police Chief Newsham (pictured with James A) in DC. Starting at the lower level all the way to the top. I remember Etan Pats has been talked about as being  alive and supposedly being pimped out by two men. I also read about Adam Walsh having been taken and he is somewhere else as well. Plus Maddy bathetic can buy almost any Child they want. What kind of world is this becoming. It’s always been this way to some extent but now it seems it has exploded. Lord help us and the Children.
