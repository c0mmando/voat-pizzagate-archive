<p>Despite many prevailing theories about the role of the Podestas, Soros and Alefantis in the Comet Ping Pong cover-up, <strong>the contemporary art-themed restaurant appears to be tied to the Geffen Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, otherwise known as MOCA</strong>.

<p><strong>Understanding the Source Material</strong></p>
<p>Source material will provide evidence that all aforementioned names are part of a loosely-organized group that come together under the guise of contemporary art. Further evidence reveals ties to the political left, but most insidiously, occult rituals and the specter of pizza-related activity associated with Comet Ping Pong. </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/cnlXt">Billionaire and LA icon Geffen was linked to pedophile ring with Marc-Collins Rector, Brock Pierce and Bryan Singer.</a></p>
<p>This article shows the relationship between the Geffen circle and the Clinton Foundation. But the discovery of the involvement of all these parties at MOCA suggests something far more compelling--that Clinton Foundation work done under the umbrella of helping provide health access to third world country (CHAI - Clinton Health Access Initiative) is actually connected to a loosely-organized group of museums known as ‘MOCA’. </p>

<p><strong>MOCA - A closer look at the evidence</strong></p>
<p>MOCA Exterior. Known as the pioneer of pop-up exhibits, or rather, the ‘temporary contemporary’, MOCA has been an innovative force in the scene. But the motives behind its exhibit model could be related to its political affiliations. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/XlHLG">Notice the pizza slice on this mural.</a>. </p>
<p>Abramovic’s infamous decapitation dinner took place at MOCA, with the help of Hollywood actors and performers. While there’s no doubt that there’s a performative aspect to the dinner, it also suggests even closer links between globalist liberal elite and Satanic art rituals, regardless of your view on them - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TOrTaC9.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/TOrTaC9.jpg</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/XlHLG">https://imgur.com/a/XlHLG</a></p>
<p>Kenneth Anger’s affiliation with MOCA is interesting because he appears to be insinuating modern art galleries contain a lurid underground in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj5NoVOEDNg">this video directed by him</a>, one including chickens tied to the wall. But it turns out that not only is he a regular at MOCA, but they are doing a special retrospective on him. Not saying he isn’t a bad artist, but c’mon! Podesta. Soros. Hollywood bigwigs. Satanic rituals. </p>
<p>Bloggers have been made for years accusing <a href="https://unv.is/themanyfacesofthezodiac.com/2012/08/23/kenneth-anger-gets-away-with-blatant-pedophilia">Kenneth Anger of “blatant pedophilia”</a> and of having Rothschild links. THIS IS THE FUCKING LINK.</p>

<p>The combination of Rothschild/Soros/Geffen/Podesta/Pinchuk (once Clinton Foundation’s largest individual donor) is particularly troubling because it shows that they have an entire warehouse (along with an infinite network of artist’s workshops) located in that one district. One that includes a <a href="https://www.eatpurgatorypizza.com/">satanic pizzeria</a>, a Tyson Farms warehouse and what I assume is a particularly extensive drainage system going into the Los Angeles River. </p>

<p>But the social connections to celebrities are important here too. We have this strange link between Katy Perry and a Podesta-run gallery that that practices black magic. That seems like the perfect profile of someone offering themselves to the devil, and talking about “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RMQksXpQSk">playing ping pong all night long” while wearing Lolita sunglasses and pizza earrings</a>.<br />
<a href="https://imgtc.com/IFqJ7Xd">Katy Perry at Moca</a></p>
<p>Linkin Park also ran exhibits in LA Arts District - <a href="https://imgur.com/a/AXpvo">Pictured at ‘Known Gallery’</a></p>
<p>We also see the same group of artists doing strange things--like holding a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170908124435/http://utaartistspace.com/gallery/seattle-art-fair-2017/">Kurt Cobain-themed art show in Seattle</a>. Note the presence of a pizza slice and of artist Carroll Dunham, father of Lena Dunham.</p>
<p>But then you also see the presence of actual Comet Ping Pong performers at this venue. This was a part of the connection I couldn’t quite dole out in my previous post on Los Angeles. But it’s a pretty astounding one. </p>

           The combination of Rothschild/Soros/Geffen/Podesta/Pinchuk (once Clinton Foundation’s largest individual donor) is particularly troubling because it shows that they have an entire warehouse (along with an infinite network of artist’s workshops) located in that one district. One that includes a

           But the social connections to celebrities are important here too. We have this strange link between Katy Perry and a Podesta-run gallery that that practices black magic. That seems like the perfect profile of someone offering themselves to the devil, and talking about “

           We also see the same group of artists doing strange things--like holding a

           . Note the presence of a pizza slice and of artist Carroll Dunham, father of Lena Dunham.
          </p>
          <p>
           But then you also see the presence of actual Comet Ping Pong performers at this venue. This was a part of the connection I couldn’t quite dole out in my previous post on Los Angeles. But it’s a pretty astounding one.

             EXCLUSIVE! DC Housewife Stacie Scott Turner Says Co-Star Lynda Erkiletian Does NOT Run An Escort Service!

           <p>
            You may have heard rumors circulating online that The Real Housewives of Washington D.C. star Lynda Erkiletian runs a top notch “escort agency,” but these are completely false! The rumors are “absolutely not” true, co-star Stacie Scott Turner tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively. “That is a viscous, baseless rumor!”
           </p>
           <p>
            “She has run a reputable agency for models and stylists in DC for 26 years,” Stacie says of Lynda‘s T.H.E. Artist Agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though Lynda has been quoted saying that her “modeling agency” caters to
            <strong>
             “the ambassadors, to the dignitaries
            </strong>
            ,” in an interview with the Washington Post, the term “catering” does not imply anything suggestive, as many people are speculating.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, the site also says this: “No matter what your needs are, we have the talent available to produce a first-rate project.”

            Mike moved to the Metropolitan DC area to start his career in Real Estate Development. One of his first experiences in the real estate industry was as an Assistant Project Manager of the Watergate Complex. In the late 1960's, Mike established a successful real estate development company which won numerous awards over the years and still operates today under the Erkiletian name.

             Within minutes of looking into ETA I found an organisation that is tangentially linked with the "pedo triangle" as well as "aquarius" as part of their logo.  Name is AEP Arts, Denver.

            I posted a thread a few days ago that was deleted. I was recently in DC on a trip and had to make a stop at that dreadful place Comet. Let me tell you this, it's still very strange. The interior looks half finished. I was greeted by the host who seemed somewhat slightly alarmed that I was just ordering a beer there. The ping pong tables are projected live onto the wall for some reason. The angle in which the projection was on seemed to be more for the bar tenders to watch that any parents. There are two exits mind you, though the second one says anyone leaving through here can not come back this way. How could it not have a basement? The cleaners next door has one as well as the book store. Why would this place not have one?

            There's enough evidence to nail all these world leaders and billionaires on down to the lowest scumbag pedos but who's going to arrest them and prosecute them? NOBODY sure the small time pedos might get prosecuted but the billionaires and Hollywood pedo- 
creeps are untouchable as far as I can see. Also the Politicians. Sad but true (I think)

            What the fuck did I just look at. This guy Cleon Peterson is a white guy who likes to paint pictures of black people beating, raping and killing white people. His artwork sucks if you call that shit art. Who in the fuck likes this crap? It's fucking retarded. California needs to sink into the ocean. At least the part of it around Hollywood and south.

            Yes. Just phenomenal research and poignant,  clear and concise investigative reporting. Swordfish has potentially found the queenbee of the proverbial hive that runs the entire shit show.  As with other threads of this nature,  and these arts councils ability to ship material,  any material,  virtually customs free,  what we are looking at is the hub of an influence spiderweb of intrigue and espionage.  I believe Jem777's suggestion that this web extends directly to the (spaGhetty huh Jem,  scuse us iliterates millennial shame on us)  Getty Museum as well which has long been rumored to be an Intel hub for mk-ultra programming.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll tell you,  all of the predictions about this week have been becoming truer by the minute,  from the breaking of the Chester Bennington suicide,  Chris Cornell,  Harvey Weinstein revelations/Clinton collaboration (chronicled right here in this thread) ,  along with the psyop of Las Vegas and nukes from Korea,  this is shaping up to be one hell of a week.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm thinking we all better hold on to our hats.

              That might be true, I won't refute it, but I've never seen so many 10month old accounts stack up in a thread like this before. Look at it. It is different from the others. Is it not strange?

            Was recently in about six art galleries in St Tropez. The Satanism is RIGHT in your face with all their $50K to $500K artworks--Banksy, Koons and others.  In Monte Carlo the satanic clubs are right in your face. They don't even bother to hide it.

            "I think medicine education and art are very important to the community" said Gefffen.  THAT is why he did this:  Geffen, however, dismissed as “nonsense” any suggestion that he is playing favorites when it comes to coasts. L.A. has been the leading recipient of his largesse. In 1995 he gave $5 million to UCLA’s Westwood Theatre, renamed the Geffen Playhouse. The following year he gave $5 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and MOCA’s satellite location in Little Tokyo was renamed the Geffen Contemporary. Since 2002 he has donated more than $400 million to the School of Medicine at UCLA, now the David Geffen School of Medicine. And in 2013 he donated $25 million to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ museum under construction next to LACMA.  IMO, this is just going to be another place for Expensive Art to be used for Money Laundering for You Know What.

                No in fact I've been posting highly praised submissions for months under alts then swooping in with Keyhotes to point out that everyone mentioned are JUST MORE JEEEEEEEEWS -- I literally have to manipulate you FUCKING BRAINWASHED RETARDS TO SEE THE OBVIOUS, LMAO!

                 Yeah right! Now you want us to believe you make great posts under an alt? 😂 A month ago we couldn’t have peace for one day without you. We are winning. You post less. Your keyhote accounts never go quiet. For the first time it did for days. So save your lame story for some idiot. You must have had a bad weekend 😆

                 Orrr you aren’t really Donkey. He has other accounts to log into. Are you a wannabe donkeyhote? I’m thinking so! You are just trying to be funny.

               Well you must have gotten yourself locked up because we aren’t lucky enough here to have you gone. It’s been so much more peaceful. Who bailed you out? Horse Fucker? I know you didn’t go on vacation because you have no life or friends.

            You know, at first I thought all of this stuff was crazy. However, the more I read into this the more I am leaning to believe it all. Are there any communities out there around this? I would love learn more, and how you get all this research done!

               You could start a thread on GLP. Many would be interested in learning more info or in contributing what they know already. Yes some posters will be citing Biblical verses on how practitioners will get their just rewards in the after life. Others take a more analytical approach.

            Obviously, the Evil Cabal is sacrificing Harvey W. Now this should scare the shit out of a lot of people. Why? HW is a big time powerful mover &amp; shaker in HollyPedoWood! He harls done this Evil shit for yrs it seems. Yet, look how easy it was to out him! Not one person came out to defend him.
HW most of his accusers/victims have been adult women. So, the cabal throws out a line with a jig that may catch a perch. They are willing to let Trump/US have Harvey, in exchange that we/Trump stop at HW.
Like Epstein, HW will get a light ,12-18 months in a prison for millionaires(country club) with a ankle monitor. HW will get out &amp; the cabal will reward him for taking one for the team.
Ok so let's say we/Trump don't stop at HW, then who gets the boot? My guess it will be someone like Spielberg, name recognition &amp; more clout than HW.

             And the many open questions about the Vegas shooting are out of the spotlight, too.
Now its Harvey's time to proove he is a truly great spirit cooker!
Otherwise, I am afraid, the Rothschilds will  not be amused and he will become suicidal...

            I've read that Geffen and Courtney Love are good friends. It's also why you hear a Nirvana song on the radio every 5 minutes.  They get paid.

             Just in case others reading this do not know what you are talking about, El Duce claimed Courtney Love asked him to murder Cobain and ...  The mentors lyrics are like this, Mentors - Donkey Dick Lyrics,  Mentors - Clap Queen Lyrics | LetsSingIt Lyrics. This guy died behind his shack on the railroad tracks soon after the offer. Can't find the video because of graphic content censorship.

            Also keep in mind as you read this that "art" to these people means the "craft." And what they mean is the "art of witchcraft" and satanic practice.

            <p>
             The scene in question—Butler's latest and most grandiose display—was a public performance of Aleister Crowley's The Bartzabel Working. Based on techniques of evocation found in medieval grimoires, the ritual was written in 1910 and designed to manifest Bartzabel, a traditional spirit of Mars in Western occultism, through a hooded person placed in a magical triangle. The crowd, which packed the gallery's courtyard, was the largest ever assembled to witness a Crowleyan rite.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The satanic cult workings is known by its adherents as "The Old Time Religion" or The Old Religion" and dates at least back to Babylon and the Canaanites/Phoenicians and farther back than that.

             OK, in order to illustrate how fucking bad of an idea someone doing that is, let me tell you a story.
            </p>
            <p>
             In January-March 1946 (also in Los Angeles, strangely enough), rocket scientist and practicing occultist Jack Parsons, along with L. Ron Hubbard, performed a series of Crowleyan rituals called the "Babalon Working".
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working">
              Cite
             </a>
             .  Crowley himself told Parsons not to perform the ritual, but they went ahead and did it anyway.  They didn't summon Babalon.  They summoned Xenu.

               The movie: "Oh brother where art thou"  uses the reference old time religion. A lot. There is also references to selling your soul to the devil.

              I have seen it referenced several times as "The Old Time Religion" but I don't remember all the exact sources. Wish I did. I think both of these videos reference it. I read so many works by authors on ancient occult workings that I can't remember which books all the references are in.

              Pretty sure this video from a survivor makes reference to it.

            Seriously though, that needs to be digested in a wall sized graphic.  FWIW, DC has a near-nothing of a music scene compared to LA.  I think you are spot on when you say LA is most likely CPP magnitudes larger.

             The line is simply not drawn between left and right. It is good versus evil, and the partisan dichotemy has served to mask the evil and divide any opposition to the activity. All about control.

             I think most informed people know it is not partisan. But, Clinton just got out of the State Department. During that time the Clinton criminal dynasty quadrupled, or more, its criminal empire. They are ripe for the picking because they are fresh out of the gate with so many observable criminal organized crime affiliations.

            Also on  the Board of Directors list is the name Annenberg  which was closely linked to Pres. Reagan. AND Ariel Emanuel is the Brother of RAHM Emanuel.  The Emanuels are tightly woven into all of this.  Zeek had a huge part in writing the ACA.  Rahm is of course Mayor of Chicago and was Chief of Staff for B Clinton and Obama.  Arie is a very big Kahuna in Hollywood as a VIP Hollywood Agent and  brought Bokoo Bucks in for Obama Campaign.  Their father is still a practicing Physician.  Which opens a whole other Pandora's Box.

            This shows that there’s a strange connection between the Podesta/Soros group and these bands, and that Comet is not a one-off. Pizza is everywhere. And it appears it’s even Bigger in Hollywood.

            We see this again in Cannes, where amFar is raising money for the “donation” of a contemporary art sculpture by Jeff Koons. On the surface, this seems like a form of cultural philanthropy, but what they don’t tell you is that the person who bought these two paintings is actually the same guy, a suspected Ukrainian racketeer who is now being accused of his involvement with Trump admin before election.

            One way we can confirm this is that CHAI initiatives in Ukraine were done with the help of Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk, who just happens to be on the board of MOCA. This, of course, can be explained by the steel magnate’s newfound interest in contemporary art.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Exhibit with Elton John - An “instinctive eye”)[

            ]
           </p>
           <p>
            But a closer look reveals something wrong, terribly wrong with the situation. And it’s not just that CHAI and MOCA seemed to be involved with each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Podesta group we have been following suddenly aligns with the Bryan Singer/Harvey Weinstein cohort of suspected Hollywood pedophiles. Bryan Singer makes an appearance. Steven Spielberg and Harvey Weinstein travel to Ukraine to film a movie with Victor Pinchuk, who coincidentally runs the shipments of contemporary art to Venice, where he meets frequently with major globalists and who are on the MOCA board.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here we see an interesting link between the Weinstein scandal and this organization. His productions linked him between important figures around the world, and one of them just so happens to be a Ukrainian oligarch with the largest adoption and neonatal clinic network (Cradles of Hope) in
            <a href="http://ukraineadopt.com/waiting-children.html">
             Ukraine
            </a>
            . Not only that, but Weinstein’s organization was active in Ukraine before the conflict broke out in Donetsk.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://pinchukartcentre.org/en/photo_and_video/photo/11719">
             Finally, we see these strange Ukrainian connections aligning with an exhibit by Takashi Murakami
            </a>
            .

           </p>
           <p>
            These links to Ukraine may seem disparate, but they reveal that celebrity NGOs tied to people like Weinstein and Geffen are closely tied to establishments in Los Angeles. But we need to take a close look at MOCA to see why this isn't an average establishment.

             Incredibly good job!

            <p>
             More and more it becomes clear that "art" is the nerve centre:
With art they can push their satanic agenda, by promoting evil and ridiculing good and holy things.
Art is the perfect cover - because brainswashed sheep eats sh.t, if you tell them it tastes good.
Its also the perfect protection shield from criticism.
Modern art is perfect to tranfer huge sums of money and whitewash.
            </p>
            <p>
             The more I think about it, the more brilliant I find it. First creating anti-art and calling it ""modern art" and then using it as perfect tool speaks the same brilliant language as fractional central banking and slavery by compound interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other big aspect is satanism. The impact of people in power who promote evil instead of good. If bad is good, and this person has power, what are the implications?
Fucking children? Cool!
Sacrificing people? Single people at parties? Cool!
Even cooler: lets make some wars and make huge money from it.

                it wasn't an asinine grammatical error (i.e. not knowing the difference between 'you're'/'your') or a typo, but a significant mistake which made you sound ignorant. I've read enough of your posts to know you are not. But a newcomer may not be so kind...and quick to judge.
               </p>
               <p>
                Of course correcting spelling is a wise use of time. Would you submit career or school related papers riddled with flaws?

                 Okay thanks spellcheck;)....You do realize spelling errors occur on purpose for somethings right?
                </p>
                <p>
                 No time to worry about this. Submitting school or career papers is a far cry from this...

                <p>
                 Trying to expose pedorings you just start typing....misspell words unintentionally or intentionally for a specific reason...
                </p>
                <p>
                 Did you research Ghetty then searched to find it was actually Getty?
