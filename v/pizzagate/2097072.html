            This info is so important and needs to be research in great detail. How many of these places have been tied to wars or natural disasters, especially poor areas where there isn't ways for people to communicate to the others via social media.  Thank you for posting

            It wouldn't have been.  Evidence of Clintons being involved in human trafficking in Haiti has been established, so this isn't just a random post speculating about organ harvesting based on pure confirmation bias.  There is an established evidentiary basis for it.

            Although someone had "chastised" me for going back in research regarding containers and mobile medical units, I believe the connections are there. In natural disasters or war torn areas w/massive chaos, what better way to extract organs from those that "didn't survive" (who would even know if there was a chance?), extract teeth for stem cell, inject diseases or use people for Pharma experiments??

            From thread
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is behind Americares? “AmeriCares guidance includes Honorary Chairman Zbigniew Brzezinski, Ambassador at Large Barbara Bush, and Prescott Sheldon Bush, Jr.“
           </p>
           <p>
            A look at AmeriCares' advisory board shows links to both the U.S. government and right-wing organizations in the United States. Besides its links to the former CIA director, AmeriCares' board includes his brother Prescott Bush, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, former U.S. Secretary of State Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Colin Powell, and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. If asked what word best characterized this group of people, would anyone say "humanitarians"?”
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say there's some big connections beyond Alefantis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also noted on previous thread: The AmeriCares website shows that its shipments seem to find their way to wherever the CIA is most active. Special "humanitarian supplies" have been shipped to contra forces in Afghanistan and their rear bases in Pakistan. An airlift was organized for U.S.-supported forces in Eritrea and Tigre during the war in Ethiopia. During the civil war raging in the Balkans, aid was sent to Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who else claims to give humanitarian supplies?? Clinton Global Initiative

             Good post.  AmeriCares is extremely suspicious with that advisory board.  I never put anything by the late Zbigniew as that guy was an utter sociopath.  This is definitely an area worthy of research.

            I guess my academic background in microbiology is finally going to be of use despite the economic downturn. Just in a way I never expected.

           <p>
            A primer on Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria responsible for Cholera.
           </p>
           <p>
            The strains that cause disease have a plasmid (basically a mini auxilary genome) containing a gene that produces a toxin known as CTX. Plasmids can be spread through horizontal gene transfer (where a bacteria injects a copy of its plasmids into another bacteria).
           </p>
           <p>
            Cholera is spread through the oral fecal route, which along with respiratory is the optimal pathway for biological weapons. Production of killer bacteria via specific plasmids is actually quite easy to do. There's proceedures to induce specific genes into a bacteria culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            The primary cause of death is dehydration, a perfect method for those seeking to kill children for the purpose of organ harvesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            If all of this is true (in terms of this thread) then we may have a "smoking gun" (forgive me for saying that) in terms of the howdunnit of the crimes commited in Haiti along with some bits of the "whodunnit" and "whydunnit".

            Don't forget that Podesta's uncle was a dentist. Also, there was a post by a homeless victim, ( I don't remember the name) in New Zealand who was saying that the dentists were making and providing pedos with an aerosoled chloroform type drug that would knock out a victim unconscious, does anyone else remember that post?

                lots of details, it was very grim, partly why I remembered it. The ruffie spray is really scary and the other massively fucked up detail that stands out was the description of parents giving their young kids hormones to keep the boys fuckable longer (and causing them to become transgender later).
               </p>
               <p>
                NZ is where John Key was Prime Minister who abruptly quit when pizzagate broke. if you haven't google imaged his kids, (the daughter especially) take the time. its horrific.

                 It was sick that they would give the kids hormones which by screwing up their puberty is only going to further traumatize them.  There is also the stuff about

                 Oh 2impendingdoom, do you think there is a connection between that DynCorp registered agent and Tuft Medical?  I'm not quite sure, mainly because a registered agent should mainly be paperwork.  On the other hand, this is DynCorp.
