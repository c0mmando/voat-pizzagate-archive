</p>
<p>It was a Friday or Saturday night this past summer at around 5 past 1 am.  The Gateway Newsstand, not normally open was open and inside it another secret door was open and it was shedding a weird coloured light.There were three men in the area with robes.  One had a white or yellow robe, the other two had red robes. They were all rather big men.  I kept walking by until I came to a police officer who said, &quot;You\'re not supposed to be here!&quot; and then I left quickly.</p>
<p>At the time, I though nothing of it.  Just harmless old men being Masonic together, what\'s the big deal?  Well, after pizzagate dropped and I began to research the matter, I\'ve begun to wonder just how harmless it is.  
</p>
<p>Now I don\'t need convincing that the temple is there.  I\'ve seen it after all.  And doubtless my eyewitness testimony counts for a hill of beans.  I also don\'t know for fact that they\'re doing anything necessarily illegal.  If it does exist, they might be planning the next bake sale or mammogram fundraiser.  Just because it\'s secret, doesn\'t mean it\'s nefarious, does it?  A secret lair in the middle of a subway station which is by definition an underground tunnel that could be used to transport anything over the course of the night?  Surely I\'m just talking crazy, right?
Unfortunately all I have to go on is what they leave in plain sight so as to hide in plain sight. </p>
<p>Now Bayview station is perhaps the coolest decorated station.  It has artwork that doesn\'t look like much of anything unless you\'re standing in just the right spot.  Stand there and you see a strawberry.  Kneel here and see a dog.  However, if you enter from the northeast corner of the station you see this <a href="https://imgtc.com/JjlyrJx">https://imgtc.com/JjlyrJx</a> .  And if you leave by that exit you see this <a href="https://imgtc.com/sFJ8Rgv">https://imgtc.com/sFJ8Rgv</a> .</p>
<p>Does that get your attention fellow pizzagate researcher?  It got mine!</p>
<p>In order to understand some of the occult symbolism involved, please watch this video by an ex-Satanist:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FUDdOR618xE?t=6028">https://youtu.be/FUDdOR618xE?t=6028</a></p>
<p>Thanks to Mark Passio for sharing that information.</p>
<p>And here\'s the artist\'s blurb on the project from her website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From Here Right Now, 2002
PUBLIC ART COMMISSION FOR
THE TORONTO TRANSIT COMMISSION
waterjet-cut porcelain tile and custom terrazzo at Bayview/Sheppard subway station in Toronto</p>
<p>TWENTY-FOUR IMAGES depicting everyday objects (such as a ladder, stopwatch and umbrella) and simple geometric shapes were integrated into the station architecture. Each image was initially hand-drawn and then projected against the walls and ceilings of a 3D computer model of the station; the resulting images were then transferred to the walls using waterjet-cut porcelain tile and terrazzo flooring. This created a series of uncommonly large and unusually oriented images that spilled over corners or across the floor. The visual distortion, known as anamorphosis, shifts with the viewer’s movements: the image appears distorted when seen from a frontal position but when viewed from one side or from an angle it resumes normal proportions. The images shift from abstract shapes to ones that appear to hover in space, lending the illusion of sculptural form.</p>
<p>This series of images is intended to accentuate our consciousness about movement and travel through everyday spaces, particularly through these places of transition, while allowing for playful interaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you watched the video with Mark Passio, you should know now that hypercubes are associated with the dark occult.  A hypercube is a 4D object with <strong>24</strong> square faces that can\'t exist in three dimensional reality and so must be **PROJECTED **to be visible in this one.  Each of the images has a square face that resolves when viewed from the correct location.  I posit that this is no accident.<br />
(If you watched the whole video by the exSatanist and not just to the time stamp and so have a further understanding of the dark occultic mindset, the word &quot;anamorphosis&quot; in the blurb should also jump out at you.  I had to look it up.  It has two meanings.  Don\'t take my word for it, look up the second meaning for yourself.)</p>
<p>Some of the images themselves are interesting.  There are three insects that metamorphose, there are three methods of escalation (with 13 total steps/rungs), there are three fruits (strawberry, orange, apple).  I\'m not sure if this means anything.</p>
<p>The more interesting images are the spectacles and the three other odd symbols beyond the swirlie I\'ve already displayed.</p>
<p>The spectacles <a href="https://imgtc.com/HRIldnw">https://imgtc.com/HRIldnw</a> 
This is the ONLY projection that cannot be seen by just walking around the station.  You\'d have to use a ladder to see it.  (The projected image right next to it is a ladder.)  I suspect if you could get to the height where the projection resolves, you would be able to clearly see the door of the secret temple.</p>
<p>The boxes <a href="https://imgtc.com/NVpdToL">https://imgtc.com/NVpdToL</a>
This one aggravated me to no end long before pizzagate dropped.  It always bugged me that I never knew what it was.  I still don\'t really know what it is, but it does match this image.  <a href="https://imgtc.com/kE9Sn1r">https://imgtc.com/kE9Sn1r</a>
And that image is from the floor below the pyramid in the Israeli Supreme Court building.  I discovered it while watching this video @3:49 or so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roughly transcribed from video &quot;Six squares in the center represent the number of man, and the four on the outside
represent the number of the world.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That video is an excerpt from The Fuel Project, a Christian take on what in a broader sense is termed the Illuminati.  The whole thing is worth watching to get a sense of what we\'re up against.  Thank you Fuel Project!</p>
<p>Incidentally, if four is the number of the world/the Earth, well there are four green tiles in the images decorating the station and all of them have the square on the ground:  Ladder, Dog, Tricycle, and Needle/Thread.  The Tricycle is what you see immediately after the swirlie if you enter from that entrance.  Does that trigger any Pedo Detectives or am I just reaching into 4D space here?</p>
<p>The Eye</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtc.com/eZKkWgG">https://imgtc.com/eZKkWgG</a></p>
<p>Not entirely sure what this is.  It could be a depiction of sex of some sort.  I think it kinda looks like an eye.  Whatever it is, it\'s weird and occulty looking and happens to be centered like a target on where I think the secret temple is located.</p>
<p>Ok, I\'m burning out, one more thing.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtc.com/P5FHkNx">https://imgtc.com/P5FHkNx</a></p>
<p>This object is ostensibly an address for the YMCA above the station, but I can\'t help but notice that it also makes an arrow pointing down directly at where the center of the hidden temple would be.  It also corresponds with the numerology outlined in the Mark Passio video:  5+6+7=6+6+6</p>
<p>I\'ve been obsessing over this topic for weeks now.  I would like some fresh eyes to have a look at this.  I\'ve not gone into all of my &quot;evidence&quot; because frankly this occulty stuff just makes you sound loony.  But if you look into it yourself you\'ll find more. It helps that I\'m looking at it in meatspace.  Considering most of this subway line was planned and built prior to the omnipresent proliferation of the internet most of the info is not going to be found online.  How high up the chain will it go?  
</p>
<p>How is this pizzagate related:  Pizzagate is just the tip of the ice burg.  It\'s not just a matter of Washington DC corruption.  It\'s here in Toronto too.  It has ties to their spiritual commander in chief.  It has a swirlie.  If the swirlie doesn\'t do it for you I don\'t know what else will.</p>
<p>What I hope to achieve:  At the very least, Satanists will have one fewer dark places to do things in.  If it is all above board and it\'s just silly secret society meetings with no nefarious intent, those secret societies should probably be paying the city a huge sum of money considering what a bloat this largely unnecessary train line is to the city\'s infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>For the record:  Don\'t be dicks about this place.  They might be organizing bake sales after all.  I might just actually be crazy.  (What a relief that would be!)  Be Jesus like.  Ask questions, find the truth and share it, and above all no violence.  
</p>
<p>Kay, thanks for reading!  Please God, in Jesus name, let evil not prevail!</p>',

            Same at Heathrow, with artwork about the Underground (the subway).  And with underground stations that are closed off.
See the full article which refers to a defunct underground station near CPP.

            This is so interesting. This topic really rings my bells. And the reason for this is that there is a Danish journalist and researcher, Ole Dammegård, who has, for some time, claimed that the subway station in central Stockholm called Kungsträdgården doubles as a secret Masonic temple during the night when the subway is closed. He believes that there is a tunnel leading from the Masonic headquarters, which are situated nearby, to the subway station. I have been to this station many times, and I can attest that it is seriously weird. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any articles in English, but I posting links to a video and photographs of the interior. I hope you see what I mean by saying that it looks very suspicious.

            He also published a book about the murder of the Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, which you can read in pdf here:

            I haven't read it myself because I have not been that interested in the topic. But now because of the Pizzagate my interest perked up. And the reason for this is that there are strong indications that Palme was a pedophile. There was a film about it that came out several years ago called Call Girl, which made this accusation. But the filmmakers were sued by the Palme family and were forced to cut out the crucial scene. I managed to see the uncut version, however, when it first came out.

             That looks more like a temple than St Paul's Cathedral! Looks like a lot of money has been spent to make it look that way. Now, why would that be? City Mayor's don't write off tax payers money just to make a subway stn look very arty for no reason.

             Yikes, lots of symbolism going on there. It would take a while to decode. The black and white tile in that context is about the blurring of the lines of good and evil, or rather ignorance of good and evil. The various statues are telling a story though I don't yet know what.

             Incidentallly, I think there's some storytelling going on at Bayview too. The way you enter the station shows you different signs, and then leaving the same way you'd see different ones. For example to see the swirlie, you'd first see Umbrella, then a twenty seven panel mirror, then Mr. Swirlie, then tricycle, then lotus, then stopwatch, then enter the GATEWAY. Leaving the same way, you'd see a lightbulb (you are illuminated) then a staircase (ascend) then the heart swirlie and finally a bee (transformed).
            </p>

             Of course, I could be reading too much into this. It's like looking at hieroglyphs and trying to decipher it with a book on Greek.

            Thank you for posting this. I believe that these locations are important to these satanist because they hold some sort of sacred meaning to them. Rituals must be performed underground. I have done some research but so far have not found any corrobatration so I could be wrong. Clearly these locations are valuable to them and not easily replaced thank you for shining a light on them!

            That is eerie shit.  I shouldn't have to say this but bring a ladder to work Monday before they remove that artwork. Everything you linked to is in line with their symbolism - and the anamorphism part in the artwork is high-level intelligence.  Can you get a name of the artist?

             If possible, take video with your phone and use your data to upload it to a personal cloud, in case they stop you and something happens to your phone. If you want extra security to make sure they don't have access to your account, you can make your phone completely lock with a PIN required to do anything except make emergency calls as soon as you do something as simple as turning it off.

            The blue boxes remind me of the one in Mulholland Drive, all sorts of speculation as to what it symbolises - sorry, not hugely relevant but that film always freaked me out so wouldn't be surprised if the imagery was linked with occultist weirdness

            Wow that is amazing. I happened to be watching a documentary about sacred geometry earlier and how all creation comes from these basic shapes etc, and the image that looks like a target and the one that matches the floor in the Israeli supreme court were both in the documentary as each being a stage in a progression of creation and revealed knowledge. I think that's what it was about.

            How crazy that you stumbled across that, only to find a reason for that glimpse of another world months later! How come you came across it, was the station meant to be closed and someone forgot to close it, or were the trains not running at that time, which made them think they were safe? Sorry lots of questions!

             When the train line was built the TTC closed earlier. I had halfway wondered if it was timed to open as per the stopwatch projection. That's just conjecture though.
            </p>
            <p>
             A whole lot of coincidences stacked up in my life such that it proved to me the existence of God. I won't bother you with the details. Much of that which was revealed to me came immediately after prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's more to find here that I'm not sharing as I'm hoping for someone else to spot it's relevance. It'd make me feel a touch less loony.

              <p>
               (Second of two)
              </p>
              <p>
               So I get curious and start looking this stuff up.  (I really shouldn't have done this stoned.) I read the emails linked with the weird phrases, and see the now infamous Moloch email, and then see one reference to Abrimovic with the 666 in her user name.  I look up the Spirit Cooking video.  I get freaked.  I decide to look up churches in my area, only to discover there are plenty and they form a near pentagram around my nearest intersection.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus Christ, I need you!
              </p>
              <p>
               So I run to the only copy of the bible I have handy, which is The Message translated by Eugene Peterson.  My dad wrote an inscription in it that tells me how readable it is and to just open it to any page and start reading.  So this I do.  AND IT'S LIKE I'M READING THE WORDS OF AN IMMORTAL TIME TRAVELLER WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO SAY 2K YEARS AGO TO REACH ME NOW!  I put it down and think a bit more, and pick it up AND I'M CONTINUING TO HEAR THE WORDS OF JESUS SAYING THINGS THAT I NEED TO HEAR LIKE HE CAN READ MY THOUGHTS!  So I put it down again and read other things at random and the same pattern keeps happening, but much more strongly with the bible.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now that may have been just a factor of being stoned, but seeing my old pizza place mentioned in context with 666 and then finding the occult shape the churches in my neighborhood make seriously freaks me out. I invite Jesus into my heart in an emotionally drained, and sobbing moment.  Feeling as though the world is about to end.  Feeling absolute desperation.  And it feels like my heart gets pierced.  And then I break into a cold sweat and feel as though there is a HUGE spiritual battle raging inside me.  Eventually I'm able to sleep.
              </p>
              <p>
               The next day or two later, I am new to the faith.  I decide to ask God for a sign.  I know I'm not supposed to, but I do anyway.  I ask this just before walking my dog.  We go out and my dog ends up killing a squirrel.  Well, very nearly.  It's close to death, obviously in pain.  After dithering for too long, I let my dog kill the poor creature.  Then I pray about it, feeling guilty and very confused.  That night, I'm smoking a joint again and letting my dog lead the way.  My dog gets the scent of something, and begins leading me on a route I don't normally follow. Eventually we pause just outside a window.  At one moment, my dog looks up suddenly.  I look up suddenly too.  And there, perfectly framed in a stranger's window is a mosaic of Jesus, perfectly lit, with Jesus touching his heart.  At that moment, I feel a huge swell of emotion.  I think to myself, "C'mon, be a man, don't cry."  I stare at it for a moment making sure it's for real and not a trick of the light or a hallucination.  I study the individual tiles.  I half-way think about approaching and introducing myself to whoever owns the mosaic, but chicken out and go home to ball my eyes out like a man.
              </p>
              <p>
               The next day I walk back to the same spot hoping to contact my neighbor in Christ.  The window is drawn.  There's a concrete slab with a squirrel under it that my dog was probably keen on chasing.  Nevertheless, considering at this point my conception of Jesus is that of an Immortal Time-Traveller arranging a perfect moment for me across a vast gulf of time, I take that as the answer to my prayer.
              </p>
              <p>
               The next day, after reading up on the nascent pizzagate movement and the Freemasons, and the Illuminati, and all that jazz, I pray again to God, this time to find these child molesting moral deviants.  Again my dog takes me to some very interesting places.  One of which is a church that made up one of the points of the pentagram.  Not thinking about this at the time, and still a new born Christian, I decide to pray at this church.  I sit down outside the doors and pray.  Upon looking up, I see that this church is named after St. Gregory the Illuminator.  Illuminator, Illuminati... MIND BLOWN!
              </p>
              <p>
               So I then discover that these churches have landmarks that are near as I can tell exactly 666 yards a part and form a trapezoid.  At the time I was more concerned with pentagrams and the 5th point proved vexing.  I did manage to find faces of Baal at the location where the 5th point should be.  These churches surround Bayview station incidentally.  Also after praying do I find that Swirlie I posted in the main post. (Remember I said I used to draw Swirlies as a way of hiding 666?  Another mind-blow moment.)
              </p>
              <p>
               So now I'm a full blown Christian getting answers to prayers in fighting evil and it's the strangest and most terrifying and exciting experience.  I hardly feel as though I'm doing enough.  I feel like more is expected of me.  I hate that so many children and other people are completely taken advantage of by the Predator Class.  I read the Bible and hear Jesus talking to the same evil serpent we're facing today.  I'd like to be braver.  I've prayed for courage.  My family suspects I'm crazy, talking about Satanic churches et all.  Well seeing that those in power worshiped Satan and it was working for them, at least in the material sense (until it seems God appointed Trump to intervene), I decided that the opposite just HAD to be true.  So now I believe it.  I believe Jesus is the Son of God, and he was killed and then raised and beat death in doing so.  Now we seem to be in the midst of Revelation and SO FEW PEOPLE seem to know.  My local church is milquetoast, but it's better than nothing. I pray a lot.  My faith is being forged on some red hot truths I wouldn't have thought twice about six months ago.
              </p>
              <p>
               So that's my story.  I think I have some of the chronology mixed up.  I'm far less stoned than I used to be.  I've given up pornography.  I'm having trouble with in-person talking-about-Jesus in most cases, but I guess that comes with time and effort.  I thank God for everything.  Everything!  He is truly worthy of praise!  God save as many as you can and let evil not prevail!

                Wow again, that's an amazing story! I have been feeling strange lately too, I think lots of people have. It's so strange, what's  happening and how it now seems ridiculous that we ever just got  on with life as though it was all boring and ordinary, do you know what I mean? That we ever would have doubted that anything could happen or be true, given how mysterious and insane the very fact there is an is, is. Hehe, I'm wrapping my brain in knots here. Thanks for sharing your story with me :-)

              <p>
               (First of two)
              </p>
              <p>
               Okay, but as I don't want to identify myself too much I'm going to abridge things a bit.  Nevertheless it's a long story.
              </p>
              <p>
               When I was much younger, I was bored in church one day and so began reading the book of Revelation in the Bible, because that's where all the action is obviously.  Anyway I read in Revelation 13:18 the part about the number of the beast being 666 and it being a very intelligent man who discovers what that means, (paraphrased to a younger me's understanding.)   Being often complimented on my brightness, I prayed to God that I would be the one to discover what it means.  Let me tell you something, be very careful what you pray for.  I was young and proud.  Pride is still a tough fault for me to deal with.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, so I began obsessing over the number 666.  In class I would draw swirlies, thinking that it looks like a six spiraling in on itself.  One time, I was asked to call in the order for pizza to the local pizza joint and the number had 666 in it.  I remember thinking, "Could a pizza place be the antichrist?  Nah, that's silly."  That pizza place was then called Pizza Boli's.  It later renamed to Besta Pizza.  I remember my mom telling me of the name change and saying, "It means beast in Italian or something, why would they name it that?"  She doesn't remember saying that.  Yes, I was living in the DC tri-state area at the time.  (I ate Besta Pizza many, many times.  They do have really good bread for their crusts.  Now it really creeps me out though.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Years later, I move out of the area when the aura of fear got too much.  (The best antidote ended up being not watching the news anymore.)  Now living in Canuckistan, I was getting depressed and lonely for various reasons.  I decide I want a dog.  A dog of a particular breed. This particular breed, unfortunately, is one I'd likely be allergic to and would require a lot of upkeep I wasn't ready to give.  Anyway, two-ish years later, I go to a friends a few towns over for a party.  In the middle of the street is a beautiful dog, and I gasp as soon as I see it saying, "That's the kind of dog I'd like to have."  Of course, it's the same breed I wanted before, and this one is a stray besides.  My friend tells me about the sketchy breeding operation likely going on in his neighborhood.  I'm not really paying much mind, just thinking about the dog.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then, some weeks later, I decide I really need a dog to combat loneliness.  I may have said, "God, I need a dog."  Not sure of my phrasing or whether I said "God" or not, but I definitely said it aloud.  Decision firm, I'm looking up dogs I think I can get on the internet.  That weekend, I get a call from that same friend who says, "Hey, do you want a dog?  You've got about an hour to decide."  Well, my recent resolution in mind I take the offer.  That afternoon, the day before Easter, I get my dog.  My friend named the dog something that doesn't sound quite right for a dog's name.  (No offense to him.) So I rename it.  I rename it by just switching some of the letters in the given name around to something easier to say and fitting for the dog.  Then I look up what the name means online.  Turns out that name means, "God's gift."  Huh.  That's interesting.  So of course I think nothing of it.  I'm a lapsed Christian at this point, so it just goes under the "That's Weird" category in my mental filing cabinet.
              </p>
              <p>
               At this point in time I'm hardly Christian, certainly doubting Christianity but not really ready to say anything to spite it as any time I come close my heart hurts.  I still think it's beautiful as a story, so I beging mentally concocting a sci-fi story wherein future people take it upon themselves to save people in the past by reading their brainwaves at the moment of death and scanning for Jesus thoughts and downloading them to the future.  Time-travel stories in general with god-like technological influence abound in my little self-created story lands.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also at this point in my life I was smoking loads of reefer.  My brain was steeped in it.  I began having very strange ultra-vivid dream type things in my stonedest moments.  Dreams like the following:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I'm walking back an forth in my apartment.  There's a green Sims like crystal above my head.  I see other people in other rooms in my building also have these crystals. Then the whole sky turns white, the crystals bloom into great big consious bodies of green gem energy and then the building around me evaporate into nothing.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               and
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I get this strange sensation that something big is happening.  I look on my phone and it is alight with 666 AntiChrist messages.  Everything I look at points to the antichrist.  Then I send a message and the world ends shortly thereafter.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I was afraid to send a text or an email to anyone for a good 12 to 24 hours after that one.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway my anxiety in general is blooming.  I feel a persistent sense of impending doom.  Just as easily as it comes, it goes.  Mostly I spend my time with my dog and redditing.
              </p>
              <p>
               THEN one fateful day I'm perusing reddit for far too long and I get bored and decide to flip over to
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/ALL">
                R/ALL
               </a>
               , just to see what's up.  Lo and behold that just so happened to be the time
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">
                r/The_Donald
               </a>
               had it's voting algorithm spezzed to the top of ALL.  Hey, these memes are funny.  I'm not really politically active at this point, so I just start reading and getting my eyes peeled as to just why The Don is as popular as he is.  I'm laughing it up, thinking all this stuff is great!  And then the Pizzagate emails drop.  I see the video clip of CNN or whatever saying, "don't look at the emails" and then a meme with, "The emails can't be that bad... ...aaaaand they're satanists!"

             And I just ran across this crazy physics article about a new discovery - "time crystals"  that shift and move on their own.  MIght as well drop it here to add to the weirdness of our morphing awareness.

            I would say you have uncovered enough evidence for this to be considered another one of the elite satanic temples of the world. Add it to the list with denver airport, israeli supreme court, goddard base tunnel, large hadron collider, LA public library
