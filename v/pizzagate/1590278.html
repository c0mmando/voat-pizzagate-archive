            Also, all the democratic candidates posed with Mr. Potatohead for some reason.  And for some other baffling reason, this made the news...

           <p>
            Anyway, I was reading Brice Taylor's "Thanks for the Memories"...her deprogrammed memories as a presidential level MK-ULTRA sex slave/intelligence spy asset, when I came across this passage talking about the small details that Henry Kissinger would organize when preparing her for her upper level work:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Henry used me to warm up groups that his constituency was going to speak to and I often wore several different disguises and always looked different. Henry was the puppeteer and I was his puppet and at anytime he wished, he could pull my strings and make me change into a different puppet, with a different face with which to meet the public. And like
            <strong>
             <em>
              MR POTATOHEAD
             </em>
            </strong>
            , he could order what kind of face he wanted me to put on. "Squint your eyes a bit, curl up the ends of your mouth, flair your nostrils, pull your jaw forward"...all sorts of different facial mannerisms and contortions that I was programmed to perform, combined with wigs, glasses, body padding, hats, etc. It was all quite effective as I played my role creating different faces to present to the public. Not many people know about this technology yet and Henry said we had a definite edge on the others. He said that it was always important for us to strive to reach greater and greater knowledge and awareness, to stay ahead of the pack in being the first, the best, and the brightest in our latest endeavors. He was constantly experimenting with me and adding things like archival information and classified documents, in order to have the latest information to draw from."
           </p>
           <p>
            Made me think right away of the "crazy" stares the phony Batman Colorado theatre shooter does...
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I tend to believe that this innocent Mr. Potatohead on the profile of a possible human trafficker is indeed a reference to MK-ULTRA slaves.
