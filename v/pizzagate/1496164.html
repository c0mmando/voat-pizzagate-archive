            It's just a matter of time before someone on the inside breaks.  There are too many players, and someone out there has a conscience.  Eventually that conscience is going to out-scream the fear.  I hope we all realize that if and when this finally breaks in the public, it's going to be like a massive boil and there is going to be some nasty, nasty shit that just keeps coming out like a flood, things we may not have even suspected.  We're not all going to have the stomach or the minds to deal with it.   Right now the energy is all in finding it and exposing it, but we all need to stop and consider how we're going to cope when it's all out there.  We're wading in some seriously foul waters, and I don't doubt for a second that many of us are deeply affected by it.

            Psychological Pressure

           <p>
            If Heather Podesta, the ex of Tony is currently connected to the NYPD police, as a member of the board in some capacity.  The psychological pressure on "normal" members of the force is extremely high, with regards to pursuing investigations into the family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis also being friends with the police, churches, temples, politicians lends itself to the same principle.  People will either cover-up because they are involved or would be forced to confront the fact they have casually socialised with a monster.

            Alefantis is incredibly glib while talking about crimes against humanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta is known to have two personalities, rather than DID this could be indicative of borderline personality disorder.  This would explain the black and white personalities his staff discuss.  One good, one bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            This "bad personality" could serve as a template for the other cult members who were not born psychopathic but rather have been neurally altered through trauma/drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            This or cult members in their glass ceiling intellects have presumed to be beyond good and evil, implies justification cosmically for their heinous acts.  I can confirm they are sorely mistaken.

            I'm glad you're posting this. A close friend of mine, a professor at an ivy league university in my town, along with her friend, have been analyzing body language from news interviews on the topic of pizzagate the past week. Why? "For the hell of it" is what she said (it's her specialty). Anyhow, I do believe there is credence to behavior observation, not as a proof, but definitely as a weighing factor - just as it is when a defendant takes the stand in a jury trial. Those jurors may not be specialists in human behavior, but they are factoring in social cues, presentation, and even tone when deciding if the person's testimony is to believed or dismissed.

            I agree. In particular, Podesta's dead silence for over a month, then he suddently comes out with a "Russia did it" tweet? Fuck you dude, you're just deflecting. Not addressing the information in the leaks, just focusing on the source to divert attention from your ass....

            Imagine waking up each morning wondering which, and how many, of your crimes are going to surface. Anything you say could be used against you; so it's best to stay quiet and act "normal". They have nothing to gain by making public statements of innocence. Everyone is already in their camp.

            You are 100% right! A lot of pedos, psychos learn NLP, (neurolinguistic programming) just like politicians and preachers do, to convince, persuade or dissuade an audience. I'm sure they also learned NOT to do the usual giveaways of liars, like looking up and to the left, etc. The experts have really evaluated the parents of Madelaine McCann for their body language, to an extreme degree. It's very helpful to the overall picture. Looks exchanged between suspects, people rushing to their ex-lovers house to show their phone texts, etc. The old saying "two men can keep a secret if one is dead" comes to mind. People turn on each other. None of this is happening in a vacuum. "Give me a man's brother", and he'll turn on him, that quote from "Dr. Zhivago",  by Boris Pasternak. Great insight, Platypus!

             Renee (Eyes for Lies) doesn't look for those "tells", she has actually made comments to the fact of their unreliability.   She spells it out logically where the subject is lying and what makes it so obvious to her.  I believe Alefantis has already said enough to give Renee lots to go on.  She's good, she used to blog on cases in the public eye and her thoughts are still available on her web page.   Also Peter Hyatt.  Both of them have analysed the McCanns.  Peter in a youtube video and Renee on her Eyes for lies blog page.

            Psychologically speaking, what's interesting to me is that John "Pedosta" Pedesto isn't speaking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis has given some statements and softball interviews, but its interesting that Pedosta is silent on this. It's obviously not proof of innocence or guilt, but it's very fascinating to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not a psychologist, but if I was in Pedosta's position of being accused of the most horrendous crimes against children by tens of thousands or more people on the internet, I'd probably come out with a statement that first said that crimes against children are awful and that the accusations are serious, say that the alternative art scene might be viewed as strange by many people but is just a form of peaceful self-expression, I didn't do that and would never do it and would give as much evidence as possible to clear my name as I could. I'd invite the media to search my house (even if it was just for show) and outwardly do as much possible to show that I have nothing to hide. I'd also talk about my work with some piece of legislation or charity to show how much I cared about the well-being of children and how that's been a priority in his political career with the Clintons. With his media connections, he can easily get put out a professional press release to make himself look good and garner sympathy about what he's going through and make himself look like a victim.
           </p>
           <p>
            So why doesn't he do this?
           </p>
           <p>
            If he's somehow innocent, and this is a psyop in some form or another is he waiting and hoping that a bunch of Alex Jones types libel him so he could sue them into oblivion down the road?

             Have you ever had tens of thousands of people read through your emails with the intention of making you look like a monster?  Who are motivated to do so?   Who change the meaning of what you actually said to something sinister.  Who ignore all evidence to the contrary? People who seem to have no sense of humor or metaphor or nuance?  People who fit you into a template  they already have in their minds: that the most farfetched conspiracies happen all the time over decades and continents?

             If you are looking, for pyschlogical insight, start there.

            <p>
             Think of what you would do?  What exactly could be done to change this people's minds? People who have chosen to abandon reason?

             I'm curious if there are lawsuits being handed out quietly to any major news orgs and even some indie ones that have dared to mention this whole thing. Some people seem to think so. I think more than likely he thinks it'll just go away once they shut down the conversation. Apparently this entire last year has taught them nothing..

             I think it's indicative both of their personalities and how it leads them into their distinctive career paths. Alefantis is a mover and a shaker, he knows how to talk and he knows how to party. That's probably why he's so successful as a socialite in that circle if weirdos. Podesta is the opposite, awkward, weird(er) looking, gangly, stammering, can't think on his feet in social pressure situations, and that's why he's better at working in the background behind more theatrical personalities; he needs that extra layer of seclusion to perform his job. Also, both have different public personas and fronts. Alefantis is new to mainstream attention, I think he likes it, but he has that working to his advantage and is hiding behind the design of "I just make pizza, I don't know anything about anything else". His political connections aren't known to mainstream people. Podesta already is known and somewhat famous by proxy from the Cintons and Obama, so he has his own standard front protocol response like any political figure: say nothing and the problem will go away. If he says anything it could implicate his masters. Just my two cents.

               I'm not, he excels behind the scenes, but his stage presence is very awkward, especially when pressed on a hard subject. Alefentis is the opposite.

             If you've ever watched Podesta speak on TV, he's not very eloquent. He studders and stammers and takes a lot of long passes between words. U think they're worried he'll look suspicious if he's talking and nervous on TV.

             He's afraid. Probably of the Clinton's and the public. If he speaks up to save his own skin the Clinton's will throw him under the bus.

             He's in checkmate. There's nothing he can do or say that won't make his personal situation worse.

             Dershowitz sure the hell came out and denied it to the world! Immediately and indefatiguably(sp),  !!! Didn't wait a minute. For Pedosta, crickets. For Hillary, to say the least the allegations of the 33 kids in Haiti affair? Crickets. For Seth Richards and Monica Peterson? Crickets.  For all the children. Crickets. The Fake News folks have painted themselves into a corner by ignoring it. The charges here -- these are lightyears beyond even the gruesome torture scandals. this is kid torture and worse. All we have to do is focus on the 1%; that will probably take care of 95% of the trafficking.

             I'm going to crowd fund to try to set up a proxy lawsuit, threw the Russian government. I will have the Russian government sue the United States government, on behalf of the United States citizens, who have been physically, and mentally abused by the United States government our entire fucking lives. Each citizen shall receive a trillion dollars, because there is no price on life, and money is made up bullshit by parasitic world banking tribes who practice satanism/pedophilia/human trafficking/world drugs/arms trade, you fucking name it apparently

            The OP makes mention of 'psychology' a field developed by Freud a Jew and protected class here on this sub. Investigation of one Jew, will allow these anti-semites to go on a witch-hunt against all Jews. This is why we have rules here to prevent witch-hunts on Jews, Saudis, and Gays.

             </p>
             <p>
              The rules are not selectively enforced the rules are applied to all mod's, shill's, bot's and human's equally.

                  Funny thing about that,  a lot of the comments are furious people who do not appreciate being put on this list.  Something an exposed shill would not do. Secondly, I've personally had my own problems with the very mod most of these people are pissed off at kingkongwadwrong. That guy doesn't have a problem with my post as long as they don't become popular.  Go ahead and look at my post score and compare it to my top five post, bet you find a few missing votes there,  just a few
