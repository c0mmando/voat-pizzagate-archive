<p>Harold “H.L.” Moody, a former Democratic Party chairman, streamed live videos of children being raped, distributed child pornography to other pedophiles, and regularly smoked methamphetamine out of a glass pipe while seated at his desk during work hours, according to the testimony of a federal agent.</p>
<p>Jason Bennett, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, said an undercover agent took “screen shots” of Moody sitting at his desk and conversing with other pedophiles in the secret chatroom on “more than one occasion” between Aug. 29 and Oct. 12.</p>
<p>Moody, 39, was fired from his job of nearly two years immediately after his arrest on the evening of Nov. 5, when agents executed a search-and-seizure warrant at his downtown Little Rock apartment. Bennett said screen shots also captured Moody using the app while he was at home.</p>
<p>Moody was also a political consultant. He was hired by the county after a year-and-a-half stint as communications director for the Democratic Party of Arkansas. Before that, he had been chairman of the Democratic Party in Pulaski County for two years.</p>
<p>Arkansas Online reports: Bennett’s testimony helped convince a federal judge to order Moody to remain in federal custody until his trial on two counts of receipt of child pornography, three counts of distribution of child pornography and a single count of conspiring to advertise child pornography.</p>
<p>The trial is tentatively set to begin in January.</p>',

            Sounds like this guy must have beans to spill. We should keep an eye out on the outcome in January.

            "President Donald Trump has chosen Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security, the White House said Wednesday.
Nielsen currently is the principal deputy to White House chief of staff John Kelly. She was Kelly's chief of staff when he was DHS secretary, and moved to the White House with the former Marine Corps general in July.....The White House said Nielsen previously served as a senior legislative policy director at the Transportation Security Administration. She was also on the White House Homeland Security Council during President George W. Bush's tenure."

              And it all would have been swept under the rug if Hillary was President. He would probably get a meth smoking Ambassador job in Lessor Crackistan, just to look the other way. I know someone who has worked for Trump, and before he won, I asked him about the experience. He said, "he was a good boss".  Let us all hope that he is a seriously pissed off boss right now.
