<p>Wow, we\'re doing it. Sure, some of those are shills but our numbers are huge now. We should expect Pizzagate to keep increasing in momentum.</p>
<p>I just had an interesting discussion with a friend about what we\'ve accomplished so far. Think about it, most people who are supporting Pizzagate were never serious \'conspiracy theorists\' to begin with, we\'re mostly normal people who can\'t look back. That means together we\'re a digital investigation that has so far been completely crowd-funded. This might be the first movement in history that is actively tackling the crimes our elites are committing and actually <em>winning</em>. </p>
<p>Let that sink in. No matter how far it seems we are from our goals, we have been victorious ever since people on Reddit/4chan started connecting the dots and pushing the evidence. Pizzagate is now huge and it will only continue getting bigger. We\'ve been consistently gaining followers on this subverse daily and there will come a time when it will explode.</p>
<p>They tried to shut us down and they will keep trying but the issue for them is, too many people know the truth. Additionally their people have proven routinely to be incompetent, slow to react and technologically averse. By all means, we\'re the complete opposite. No matter how much they cry \'Fake News\' or try to discredit us, it only harms them more. We on the other hand grow stronger with each passing moment. </p>
<p>Why is that? It\'s because they have way more to lose than us. And too many of us are pissed off with how they are getting away with it.</p>
<h1><strong>The Future</strong></h1>
<p>That said, we have to be patient. Even though anything\'s possible, it\'s unlikely we will get them tomorrow or in the near future. Right now, we\'re on the tip of the iceberg and it\'s about to get more interesting. But we\'re not there yet, the investigation has to continue.</p>
<p>If we don\'t keep digging then it\'s all for nothing. The steam will be lost and it\'ll be remembered eternally as the \'world\'s craziest conspiracy theory\'. All the while, innocent children will continue to be raped and murdered.</p>
<p>We must maintain unity. They will try to shut us down again, voat will likely get screwed over somehow. We\'ve seen how far they\'ll go to suppress this but people have already been working on a back-up, it\'s an uphill battle to take us down. </p>
<p>They can throw shills at us too but even they have a limit. We have our strategies against them and they\'re free. Shills cost money and no matter how rich they are, they will run out of it. We\'re also completely digital, meaning as soon as we\'re taken down, we can just set-up somewhere else. The advantage has always been ours.</p>
<p>This is the reality of what they\'re against and how powerful we really are. Eventually, I can foresee people in higher levels of society fighting against the pedophila and forming internal factions supporting pizzagate. They will make their appearances here or on whatever platform we use and we should be ready to weaponise their power. </p>
<p>When that days comes, we will be able to fight them at their own game and really drive this all home.</p>
<h1><strong>Keep digging</strong></h1>
<p>Don\'t expect quick results. The worst case scenario is that it might take years before anything substantial truly happens guys, that\'s the truth of it all.

            YES! Another thing that separates this from other conspiracy theories like jfk, 9/11, etc is we have the internet! Yes we had the internet during 9/11, but not nearly like we do today, with smart phones and social media.

            Thank you for taking up this theme, glad to see the morale here is strong.  I was edited by mod crensch for this post
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1495073">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1495073
            </a>
            crensch has been called a hostile mod but I don't know if that is the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            However that post which gained over 80 new subscribers to this forum in about 8 hours to support the pizzagate investigation was supposedly deleted for the reason that they don't want to edit "hate speech" on just the Voat pizzagate forum - They say it is for ultimate free speech reasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            The post stated, "Call out racism, call out anti-Semitism, call out violence and vigilante justice. NONE of these things represents this investigation and social movement. Use wit, use humor, use knowlege, use your wisdom. YOU are the citizens that will not let this topic die without a fair and complete investigation.  EDIT: After hearing the concerned arguments from places on VOAT other than this pizzagate subverse, and making this statement clearer to them in comments, it should be added - Calling out bigotry and hate speech on THIS forum on Voat is limited to the pizzagate subverse. Elsewhere on VOAT hardcore free speech advocacy rules for good reason and that should be respected"
           </p>
           <p>
            With 400 + new subscribers in the past 48 hours, this place has a great momentum going.   10,000 is coming up like clockwork in a few days.  An achievement to celebrate.

            Advice to n00bs: There is a lot to research. Pick something and go with it. If your researching skills are lacking, work on raising awareness. Not to everyone, but to people you believe will be able to handle this stuff.

            This is the most important part. I'm really getting sick of the people who come in, whining, demanding immediate action. You're one of two categories: impulsive and possibly dangerous, or an immature brat demanding instant gratification. Either stop being those, or leave the investigation. You will not help.
