             For a while there I was doubtful much had been done to finish this place (still no news about it being completed, but they're still raising money I believe).  The video shows progress as of Nov 19, 2017 anyway...I wasn't able to listen to it last night, so just commenting on visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
             The video was posted by FEJ, and this is their founder:

            The post that claimed Comey was working with Q now has more depth.  I don't believe that we are not actively killing the enemy as the enemy has been killing our own.  That's war.  We know we are in a war.  Did Comey signal to go ahead and take Mollie out?  Committed by an illegal of all people, this surely contributes to the narrative of the good guys.

            This will sound awful, but I do believe Molly’s father “sacrificed” her for something big. This is rather common in luciferian/Freemason/Kabbalah/Illuminati circles. When sacrificing a loved one, especially a child, you are granted something great and made powerful. I’m thinking along the lines of business and money. We should watch him closely now and check records to see what he owns business wise, etc. However, these people have Swiss accounts and hide money everywhere they can. He definitely moved up the ranks, that I can guarantee. Sick fuck.

            This was a comment from an article on Heavy.  Any relation to Col. Paul Tibbetts, pilot of the Enola Gay?

            So far I discovered he had two sons  Paul III  And Gene Wingate Tibbetts    Both have passed away.   Did they have children?  Don't know yet.  What another crazy turn this would be if they were related.  But who knows.

             Wow! I see the name “Wingate” and another high-profile murder comes to mind; that of Dana Wingate who was only about 16 at the time when he was bludgeoned with a claw hammer along with 2 members of the Sharp family in what’s known as the Keddie Murders, from Way back in like 1980 outside of Quincy, California. They were murdered while the little girl Tina taken and all that was found of her three years later was her skull.

              Now that Wingate goes with Col. Paul Tibbetts pilot of the Enola Gay  his wife's name was Enola Gay, I believe.  Have not connected them to the father or any parents of Mollie T.  But would be a Bombshell really.   Would have to connect this family with the Mollie Tibbetts family.

            I do not see any where in news where Rob left his job in San Fran prior to Mollies disappearance.  He went out to Iowa to help but was sent home after several weeks to let police tend to this. Im sure he has gone back there since the discovery of her body.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rob last saw her a year. ago at his wedding. where she served as his best man. Robs background explains some aspects of this case given what we now know of HOK.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a power company with execs accustomed to schmoozing with powerful people which may or may not  be connected to satanists.  Rob may have put all his energies into publicizing his daughter's predicament and obtaining large  funds for a reward.  He may have established the reward with his own funds because he had the capacity to do so. He and HOK  are the big players accustomed to being in charge.  Can  you imagine letting the police force of a town of 1500 take charge.
           </p>
           <p>
            The description of Mollie was over-the-top due in large part to her father.  Things and people are bigger for these folks,  their offspring bigger and better.  Mollie was lovely and full of promise like millions of other coeds but in the last analysis was an ordinary girl.   Some weird elements to his interviews but California and their inhabitants are weird.  Laura Calderwood Tibbits escaped Cal.  a decade ago taking her 3 children with her.

            The farm industry and the horse industry is chock full of latin immigrants legal and otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            The building in Haiti is hideous and does not do credit to HOKs typical projects. It looks like a Motel 6 covered with bars "cleverly" in the shape of children. I bet it cost gazillions to build with actual construction costs a pittance with obscene profits for HOK in the end. HOK along with construction and architectural firms around USA were still. staggering in 2010 from the Great Recession that began in 2008. Haiti helped so many ruthless businessmen recover from the GR. Hail to the Clintons! May they rot in hell. It always comes. back to the Clintons, doesnt it.

             A pro bono case with HOK and U.S. Green Building Council. Started raising money in 2012?  By 2014 they said "next year!"....by 2017 they said "April 2018!"...still not sure if it's open.

             But consider angles, logistics (not accusing any particular person/or HOK or UGBC as a whole):  CF or CGI working deals, facilitating contracts for their donors.  Consider potential for money laundering operation.  How convenient for people to travel the world, stopping in Haiti to see how the building's coming along etc.  How convenient would it be to have nodes along trafficking  routes and other logistical (VIP?) advantages,

             I think it is a fake place just like his Sustainability site in Haiti.  He set that up and some of the Lincoln Park Band were even there with him at an event.  Sick stuff they have been passing off on us all.  Sustainability is what they are all about.  Bill C has been setting up fake Sustainability sites all over with the latest fakery in PR. Some of  the same players from Haiti.  I think you are right about how that place looks.  Looks like something someone started and then ran out of money.

              I wish Trump would outlaw the word sustainability, it is so abused and used to exploit $$. Costly projects justified by sustainability features such as LED lighting,  Bill giving his dumb blond paramour in Westchester millions and millions to retrofit a few old buildings with additional insulation.  I fervantly hope that millions of citizens pour out onto the streets in celebration of the death of one of the Clintons while the other gets to witness proof that they are despised...and all this coming from a former Democrat who voted for Bill in 1992 thinking he was the new JFK!  Ill have a stroke if I dont change the subject soon.

                 no pickle is messing with you. I think some confusion arose because Mollies mother had always kept her maiden name and father remarried a year ago to woman who took his last name.

             To me, she looks a little Asian. This post is the first I’ve heard of her having other parents (bc I don’t have cable and refuse to check MSM websites) but her mom doesn’t appear Asian, what about her dad?

              Well, he doesn't look Asian either.  AND it is hard to find personal info on them.  I mean other than your ordinary variety.  It seems almost as if info is being controlled.  Hmm.  I wonder who would be doing that.  I don't have cable either and have to depend on local news.  Just the bare minimum.  I think I would faint if they brought up the Comey in the cornfield subject.  LOL.

STALKING behavior.

               The Truth has been here since THE BEGINNING.
              </p>
              <p>
               Haven't you seen the disinformation and attacks by the mods and others involved in their desperate attempts to Hide and Silence The Truth?
              </p>
              <p>
               We are not Sarah. We are not a bot. Only a fool would believe those absurd claims.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many Good People have been threatened, doxxed, attacked, tortured and murdered to share The Truth. You may not realize how extremely dangerous it is for those who know The Truth. Jenny Moore is only one of many victims.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why do you Trust the mods who are lying to you and slandering Jenny who was a member of this very community? Did you know her personally? We did.
              </p>
              <p>
               Re-read everything that Wisconsin_is_Corrupt told you over a year and a half ago.
              </p>
              <p>
               Who did Jenny come back to Voat to meet with? What happened? Did you watch the videos?
              </p>
              <p>
               The Truth is right in front of you. Only a fool or Pure Evil would deny it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you want to accept Lies and The Mark of the Beast, or do you want know The Truth?

                 You have become confused by listening to Liars. We NEVER lie. We told you LONG ago what and where The Truth is.
                </p>

                 The Truth is clear and obvious to those who seek The Truth.

                <p>
                 Try reading everything again. Do you think Wisconsin_is_Corrupt EVER lied to you? We are not your enemy unless you are EVIL. We are here to Share The Truth with those who have the Will to Believe in Jesus Christ.

                <p>
                 Clouded by your spite and misjudgment, and confused those who wish to deceive you, you are simply missing The Truth.

                 Why do you think Jenny was murdered? Why do you think the mods ganged up to attack, dox, threaten, slide, downvote and slander Jenny and anyone who defends her and The Truth? Who did she return to meet with?

            It might be possible that the rest of Rob Tibbetts familly is being threatened to get him to cooperate with something. He seemed like he thought that Mollie was dead when being interviewed before her body was found.

             What I thought was strange was when the mother said to a reporter that she just knew that Mollie would be found safe &amp; sound and back home before they went on a vacation next week. Like, who would give a shit about a vacation at that point. Just seemed like an odd thing to reference.

             It's not just the family That Is sketch- There are dozens of People involved. Doesn't mean dozens of people were involved in the Murder- But If People don't play their roll- They are putting their own, Seemingly unrelated, Secrets at risk..

            <p>
             I don't think The boyfriend was involved in the actual murder- But I think He was out of town, And she was staying at his house watching

             I have too many things I'm working on- I simply can't do my own Research into the case- I can only speculate based on the reporting of this case,

              Interesting that the name of the town is Brooklyn. Remember last summer when Donal Logue's transgender son/daughter, Jade Logue, went missing from Brooklyn Heights? His/her father posted some strange messages, too, as if he knew who had his child.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2017/06/jade-logue-donal-child-missing-daughter-arlo/">
               For example, he said this:
              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               On Friday, the “Gotham” star also begged Jade to reach out to them as soon as possible. “I love her and I know her tribe is strong (I’ve met many wonderful people through Jade). But there are some predators who swim among their ranks knowing they’re dealing with sweet, trusting souls. We want you home Jade. Whoever knows where she is, whoever may be with her– clearly this thing has become big and crazy. The net has been flung far and wide and luckily, I have dogged teams from the NYPD, FBI, and others involved. The point is, you may have had good intentions to help her, but I’m sure you realize that this situation is bigger than you could’ve anticipated. It’s okay. 
Just drop her off. Let her get back in touch with her mother, Kasey, or me — we’ll take her back, with hugs and no questions asked. Contact us If you have any information regarding Jade’s disappearance or Detective Frank Liuzzi at 718 636 6547. There is an “out” for this situation that works for all involved. We promise.

               The deepstate/shadow government- (I know their different but it applies to both) Love their names. The same names, In different states, usually mean the same thing- Or you can expect to find the same thing...Names mean the same thing, DOWN TO the street... Hell-Even the Number Of the addresses has significance... Which we won't get into now, but Streets Include but are not limited : Euclid, Walnut, Front st, Hope, Elm, Fulton, MONROE, to name a few-  Find those streets In any given city, And you've found a ratline of fuckery.
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as what You posted about dude knowing who has the child- THEY ALWAYS DO. Always. If not the specific person, They could take a guess....OR They know its not "Random" lets just say that....And the dude says.

               Did you share that quote with me because he mentiones "The Tribe?"  Because that's exactly what I'm talking about in my Original Comment. It's like how Comet ping Pong employees refereed to themselves being in a "TRIBE"
              </p>
              <p>
               This shit isn't about People Breaking bad- They are literally born into it...we have 3 generations of Deepstate Fuckery at play.... If you find someone involved In the deepstate shit show between 20-35yr old chances are their parents, And their grandparents are also involved... You go down south or to the inner cities of cleveland, or Philly, and you got 4 generations at play- fucking great grand parents, To grand kids involved.
              </p>
              <p>
               Shit be cray cray. It's so much bigger than anyone has come close to addressing.
              </p>
              <p>
               And TO CLARIFY- THERE ARE A SHIT TON OF VARYING LEVELS...Not everyone involved, Kidnaps and fucks kids- That's simply not the case- But Regardless of the severity, They all share secrets.

I had no idea towns and street names being the same was deliberate---which reminds me that I did notice once how many towns named "St. Alban's" there are, which is odd since the first St. Alban's is the location of the original Hellfire Club, but that's another story altogether.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thanks for the insights about "The Tribe" and the glimmer of hope that not all people involved are willing participants and would hopefully be willing to expose the rest if they could do so safely. That's a beautiful thought, really.

                 Dude. I'm going to lose all credibility- But since you brought Up Hell fire club- I have a whole"Thing" on Jack tapper being a double agent White hatter.... Or, basically... HIs fucking book on the hellfire, Is a memoir.... Like I get he's the worst of the worst On cnn... But his worst of the worst, In combination with his appearances where he's NOT playing an anchor on CNN... Leads me to believe this dude is a closet Trump junkie.... And Knows that he only helps Trump, By continuing to do what he's been doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And I dunno if you're aware he just recently published a book about the hellfire club- Which Is Why I decided to rant to you about jake tapper.... Or wait- Maybe it wasn't the hell fire club he wrote about- I might be retarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That being Said, I never heard Of St albans- So considering there's a lot of those- Then yea- Probably fuckery afoot in those towns. But dude, It's like, Harder TO find A town that doesn't have fuckery a foot to be honest- Never the less... Specific Names help narrow it down.

                  Amazing. I've had a similar hunch about Jake Tapper. There's just something about him that seems decent. The only reason I brought up St. Alban's in England was because of the caves near St Alban's in Medmenham Abbey that were the meeting place for the original Hellfire Club. (I had a bee in my bonnet about caves a while back.)

                    It is crazy stuff. I first saw "St. Alban's" during the Thai cave rescue. The British caver that Elon Musk called a "pedo guy" is from St. Alban's, and there's more . . . .

             I just posted a tweet about him leaving the job about 8 days before.  Exactly.  Just doesn't sit right.  Something is all wrong with this whole thing.  Did he know ahead of time that she would be taken?  There is something really strange about Rob, I have had a weird feeling about him from the start.  Someone claims her real parents live in Minnesota as well.  Is this another Fake Story Problem brought to us by the DS Cabal?  It's starting to look like it.  Also the possible MK Ultra criminal they have pinned this on was an employee of a rich farmer connected to some DC Politician.  As usual you can't make this stuff up.  I see a movie in the offing.

                Speaking of Johnny Gosch, nothing would make me happier than for us Pizzagater’s here on Voat to dig nonstop till we find Johnny’s dad and get some answers! And dig till we find buried info that maybe other family members or friends know about. That case drives me crazy!!

                 A lot of the children that were within those elite rings were sold off by their own parents.  Now I am not saying all of them, for some were trafficked and parents are still looking for them.  But yes, it would be great to hunt him down.  I am sure he is doing everything possible to keep from being found. His life is in jeopardy if he talks.

                laziness and clumsiness with cellphone. everybody is welcome to research my info and make a post. i do walk around with quite abit of stuff already in my head as ive been an anti-establishment researcher for a loooong time.  Im not always right and will stand corrected. I also just like logic and debate. My days of hardworking advocacy are over and im enjoying the view from the recliner.

                thanks, ive read about 20+ news articles and still cant find anything about alleged departure PRIOR to disappearance. Maybe the dad got mixed up with the boyfriend who in fact left town prior to the disappearance.
