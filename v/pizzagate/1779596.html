<p><strong>Fact</strong> is that attorney <strong><a href="http://www.lawyers.com/atlanta/georgia/Thu-Trinh-Hong-Huynh-3402094-a/">Trinh Huynh</a></strong> was shot, let her rest in peace, and fact is that she was possibly targeted. <strong>Mislead</strong> is that she &quot;was working pro bono with abuse victims on several legal cases involving high-profile elite pedophiles&quot;. Let\'s break the misleading claim into parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;was working pro bono&quot;, <strong>TRUE</strong>, she was <a href="http://www.pbpatl.org/?s=Huynh">http://www.pbpatl.org/?s=Huynh</a></li>
<li>&quot;with abuse victims&quot;, <strong>PLAUSIBLE</strong>. She was in <a href="http://georgiaasylum.org/about-us/our-team/board-of-directors-advisory-board-members/">the advisory board of directors</a> in <strong>GAIN</strong>, an organization offering such legal services for immigrants, but her expertice doesn\'t fit into these kind of cases. She\'s a construction lawyer more focused into property, patent and trademark work. Still, she might have worked &quot;with abuse victims&quot; - maybe not as an attorney in court, but providing assistance, or legal advices in her areas of expertice for them.</li>
<li>&quot;on several legal cases&quot; , <strong>PLAUSIBLE</strong>, LIKELY. That\'s was attorneys do.</li>
<li>&quot; involving high-profile elite pedophiles&quot;, <strong>FALSE</strong>,  there\'s no several court dockets involving child abuse against high profile persons, not currently open, not in close history, in the Georgia Northern District Court. This claim is not possible even with her as an assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a clever mislead including a lot of truth and possible truths, only the part meaningful to pizzagate investigators being difficult to confirm as false (it really took some time). <strong>On Voat pizzagate</strong> there are several posts on this, all linking to those questionable sources, not sure if these are all. I suggest checking the senders and the comment threads closely: </p>

<p><strong>In my opinion</strong> this news is not just a clickbait (those are typically spreading similar ways within the controversial media), but possibly also an effort to <strong>debunk pizzagate</strong> in a clever way. It would be enough to pay to one of these clickbait news sites to make suck a news spread. We\'re expected to share such news for &quot;awareness on elite pedophilia&quot;, as that\'s what we love to do, but in a week or so it\'ll be easy to share in the MSM that the news was false in we were &quot;all wrong&quot;. Let\'s not buy into this without PROOF ON THOSE LEGAL CASES. </p>

            As I mentioned, in similar cases, the truth behind the motive for the hit is obscured for years; yet eventually does become clear.

            It wouldn't be a "clever way" to debunk "Pizzagate" The people making us look silly in the Mass Media don't need to "look clever" They've got the heavy artillery.

            The reason the story doesn't add up is more likely that the hit man fucked up. And then they have to cover.

            They will go to all the trouble of killing a woman , execution style, in the middle of the street, just to make "Pizzagaters" look bad.

            She was hit because she had info on the Bridge? Really? Where's the evidence for that? More supposition?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think so.
           </p>

            Why is my post how I saw the same guy on my train last month, which discusses the un-natural deaths around "Pizzagate" researchers , i.e. Monica Peterson, Breitbart, Seth Rich, buried ; while this one, built upon a faulty assumption , in my opinion, gets first page treatment?

            So why bend over backwards to avoid their "Gotcha" moment - which is strictly an hypothisis / supposition which never happened.

           <p>
            And even if it did, so what? They have a millions ways to make us look silly and they already have accomplished that

             Hit man fucked up or not, that doesn't affect my reasoning. The news remains misleading and is possibly being used for debunking in either case.
            </p>
            <p>
             My post doesn't discuss on the bridge, it's whole another case, sources and usefulness to be checked as well. It becomes important to the pizzagate investigation if someone manages to connect the bridge to trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your post I just read, it starts by supporting tha false claim. Maybe edit that part. Then it wonders around several topics, quite difficult to follow through. Maybe limit the focus or add some clearance. In overall you might be onto something but you don't manage to share it in a useful way, reagarding investigations. Just my two cents, happy if you try again. Make it worth an upvoat and you get one from here.

             That's the case in here too, important to recognize. Sharing unreliable stuff would be one way to follow that lead.  They do their best, we do ours. Let's stay strong and focused.

            , thank VERY MUCH for doing this vetting and making this post. I am flairing this "IMPORTANT" because this kind of misreporting is happening more and more often, and is easy to fall for when folk are so eager for news of action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have my upvoat, as well!
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: I have flaired all off the posts you linked 'Accuracy In Question" so we are on the record as researching this fully.

             Thank you! I just replied to you with some ++ in another comment thread.

             ps. Flairs are very useful, but how do we access the lists of tagged posts?

            thanks for posting this. i've been writing in the the threads citing those general claims you cite that it looks more likely that the killing is linked to the i 85 collapse (see about 20 min in on this vid for how suspect that collapse was and the link to the murdered attorney:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/K6ZJybxgX6w">
             https://youtu.be/K6ZJybxgX6w
            </a>
            -- there are other good vids out there too). i don't know if i can leap to the the conclusion that the link to PG is being used to (further try to) discredit PG.  I think it's more to "hide the ball" from the connection to the bridge collapse (cuz they think many don't buy pg so they'll stop looking into the murder of the attorney).  anyway i'm all for exposing pg, but i think it may not be the real story behind the sketchy murder (look into what has happened to the shooter since his arrest and the info suggesting the shooter was actually a deep state hit man named Mork - or something like that)

                Perfect, it clearly shows any lurkers how we take our case seriously here and additionally brings up another possibler lead to follow and check. This kind of mod-jobs we need more, thank you for your efforts!

                Oh if we had our front page full of this level posts, comments and important tags just for a week - what that would do to our rep and get even more ppl in taking the investigation seriously...

            Thank you for your work! I was attacked for saying that I was unsure of the story, but had not gone further to investigate whether my hunch was correct. Thank you for confirming that, and also for pointing out that we should be cautious in sharing such items until we know more. We're all cautious on the verge of pessimistic now, so even good news drums up "yeah right" banter. For better or worse, that's where we are in this fight. Thank you OP for the great work!

             Its this dis-info i reacted up on.. Sorry did not know at that time. (when relialised something was wrong, i edited my post) This is what this investigation is about. We must investigate and if there is other info, alert people about that. Keep up the good work! We are all in this together for the good cause.

            No doubt any such pending cases would be covered up, if they existed.
           </p>
           <p>
            If what you say is correct,then what was the motive for the murder and why is it so publicized? There are lots of murders that never make international news and people are not generally appalled by the murder of a lawyer are they?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think her murder was to scare people off investigating of pizzagate.

             See the cleverness. The motive could be any. It's not every day an attorney gets shot. Ask why her death made it to controversial news before MSM. Would be lovely to answer "MSM didn't want to tell this", right. You sure know which party knew about this first, now think about why a scoop interesting to the readers would be delayed/dropped like this. MSM could have shared this without mentioning anything about the motive or pedos, having a great scoop still.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clever part: "Let's have the pizzagaters spread it a bit wrong first, then we can correct them a bit". MSM will follow, gaining trust among the 90%. And they will not share that the motive is related to any pedo ring. They might say that we claimed so, especially if we go pro on these "news". ps. One can ask for the dockets from the court. Did any of the "news" sites do that?

            Maybe so, but everyone believed for years that Aaron Swartz death had nothing to do with Pedophilia networks, but the news that it likely did only got spread after Pizzagate broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact information is omitted and the detail that there were cases open on Pedo or Abuse networks that she was working on is unconfirmed, means something, but not everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            To really know you might have to go there and talk to people who knew her. And even then it wouldn't be definitive, to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, take the case of Dorothey Kilgallen - after her un natural death all new sources denied she was working on a book about the JFK "event" - But it turns out she was, but that fact was covered up.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will still be people who will deny Kilgallen was working on such a book. Her husband and her boyfriend both were afraid to talk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kilgallen's biographer was threatened over it, decades later!
And did not include all she knew in the book that was finally published.
           </p>
           <p>
            But she did confirm Killgallen was working on such a book , and that all the elite intelligentsia and news sources denied it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later the author "Israel" was framed as a forger and had her reputation ruined.

           <p>
            People in the Public, led by the Mass Media, have been making fun of and dismissing people who didn't swallow the official JFK narrative for generations.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, the term "conspiracy theorist" was developed by the CIA to combat the JFK event skeptics.
