<p>The idea the MSM will try to seed is that any high profile arrests will not be based on evidence/justice, but will instead be falsified to entrench Trump in power.</p>
<p>I thought it deserved its own post for us to collectively discuss methods, techniques and memes to combat this intended false narrative. If that Fake News narrative is effective, it may sway those who are undecided about pizzagate to disbelieve that a paedostocracy exists and is growing, and it can also further entrench and polarise those who already disbelieve it.</p>
<p>Aside from being a terrible outcome for the children and women trafficked, that also threatens the re-unification of America, as the healing and re-unification of America can only begin when A) the paedostocracy is bought to justice AND b) the Left awaken from their hypnotised state, realise that Hillary and the Globalists were using them, and understand how far they had drifted from their HUMANIST roots under the illuminati spell.</p>
<p>For my money, the following points can assist in combating the Trump coup narrative:</p>
<p>1) If you are of a conservative or even puritanical persuasion, try to refrain from political \'conflation\' - i.e. if you personally have an issue with consensual adult homosexuality, try to avoid raising that in a pizzagate context, as it may be used to paint you as partisan</p>
<p>2) the pizzagate investigative community needs to be vocal with the Trump administration if IT is showing partiality - i.e.  if there are only democrat arrests , we need to DEMAND republican paedostocracy members be arrested too</p>
<p>3) explain to those who are duped by the \'conservative coup\' meme that Pizzagate\'s most prominent journalist/reporter David Seaman identifies as a Liberal</p>
<p>4) explain  to those who are duped by the \'conservative coup\' meme that  the pizzagate investigative community regards recent republican Denis Hastert\'s conviction as evidence that the rot is on both sides of the isle</p>
<p>5) Explain to liberals who are defiantly in disbelief that they are running out of time to avoid being regarded as accomplices, that future generations will regard them as the libertarian equivalent of the German SS</p>
<p>6) Ask doubters how many children they think would have been spared has the complaints about Jimmy Saville not been quashed for decades? Suggest we have a collective culpability if we were to fail to prevent a repeat of that sorry episode</p>
<p>7) Explain that for Pizzagate to be fake news, it would have to be a series of connected previously insufficiently dealt with scandals: Saville / Franklin / Epstein / Nancy Schaefer / Silsby / Hastert -these would all have to be fake as well for there to be no factual merit to Pizzagate. Emphasis that the pizzagate movement is about bringing down the ONE same network behind ALL these, not just whoever Trump sees as expedient</p>
<p>8) I\'m sure you can add more </p>
<p>Please discuss these or contribute your own additional points</p>',

            Love the initiative! We should create a meme to explain that "pizzagate" is not the scandal by itself but only a small
            <strong>
             window
            </strong>
            that allows us to discover the biggest scandal of all time, which is: the global and systemic culture of pedophilia, child sex trafficking and satanism going on at the highest levels of governements and other elite circles.

             I understand your anger. Change in society has to be build from within society itself. If it is forced, it will not last unless the force is upheld. I do not want a military state. But I have to say, the fact that people like you exist is comforting: People that are willing and eager to use arms they already own to defend strangers against the evil of the elite. The thread alone gives us leverage.

              I think you'll find there are more of us than you would have thought. I'm not some nut job living off grid. I live in a middle class neighborhood. run a small business. Treat my kids right. I joined the Marines full of piss and vinegar wanting to follow in my fathers footsteps and his fathers and his fathers and my grandfather on my mothers side and his father and so on... I come from a military family and would have been a cop if the state of affairs was different. I've actually been considering joining the force now that I feel like we are going back to a country that respects their law enforcement. The corruption and quotas, coupled with a low bar set on entrance have really diminished our law enforcement community.
             </p>

              With all the above said, I speak for several of us when I say that we were all very afraid we were going to have to kill some of our own troops. Some of them would have refused to take action against Americans and would have followed orders they didn't agree with. The only thing we've been hoping for is a President that loves America. A commander in chief who we could all assemble behind and a Sec of Defense we would all follow into hell. We have that now. Trump isn't perfect, but anyone can see almost 40 years of him professing his love for this country and Mad Dog... Well, like I said, we would follow him into hell.
             </p>

              My only fear of the current white house staff would be that Mattis resigns. If that happens, I will panic and you should too.

             these idiot leftists are gonna push the envelope until some university campus security/trooper snaps and machine guns a bunch of the fuckers down, and then Trump's gonna look like an authoritarian, and America divides further towards civil war. So give a fuck. Please.

              I owned my first rifle at 6 years old. Served in the Marines as a Sniper. Spent half my adult life as a professional fighter. Own several weapons. Have a barrel of rice, another of beans and enough water to last me months.

             <p>
              I have literally been praying for some shit to go down so I could finally put my purpose on this planet to use. The kicker? There are millions more of me and we all vote Republican.

              So, if it's a fight they want, they might want to reconsider what they're asking for.
