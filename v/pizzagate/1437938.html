            The sad truth is theres nowhere to go from here....al the damning evidence we have is not enough to implicate anyone, so when we run out of leads and new evidence it'll eventually die away as a "remember that whole pizzagate thing"...no one will be charged no justice served...but at least w the spot light on them comic ping pong and the surrounding businesses will stop raping little kids
