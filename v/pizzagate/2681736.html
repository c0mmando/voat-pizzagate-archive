<p>Ex-Aid Worker: Abuse Of Refugee Children On Nauru Was Mostly Ignored </p>
<p>Australia has a controversial policy of intercepting refugees and migrants at sea and sending them to detention centers, paid for by Australia, in remote island nations. One of those centers is on Nauru, a tiny speck in the Pacific Ocean with just 10,000 citizens.</p>
<p>The refugees and migrants come from many troubled countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, and some of them, including children, have complained of abuse at the Australian camp on Nauru.</p>
<p>Australia\'s immigration minister, Peter Dutton, has played down these allegations, claiming most are about small issues, and reiterating that the asylum seekers will not be allowed to come to Australia. He argues that such a move would give &quot;smugglers a green light.&quot;</p>
<p>But Viktoria Vibhakar, a former aid worker for Save The Children Australia, says abuse is a serious problem at the detention camp and has been largely ignored. She was hired to work in Nauru in 2013, and spent a year coming and going to the island.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the first things I got, which was the most striking, was a deed of confidentiality, which was a couple pages and it basically said, you cannot say anything about what goes on in this facility and if you do, you are liable for two years in jail for each disclosure.&quot;</p>
<p>Vibhakar spoke by Skype with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep.</p>
<p>&quot;In the beginning we\'d go out to the detention facility, which is basically a place of barren rock, phosphate rock, with jagged pinnacles with little natural vegetation and very bright light because the glare of the sun is incredibly oppressive,&quot; she said. &quot;The asylum seekers were housed in vinyl tents, and we would go and meet with them and ask them how they were doing, and Steve, as time went on I felt like my job was just convincing people to stay alive.&quot;</p>
<p>What was the first case that came to your attention that made you think something is seriously wrong here?</p>
<p>&quot;Three days into my first rotation on Nauru there was an adolescent boy who had been sexually assaulted. The child was living in fear of this sexual assault being repeated not just to him but to his mother who was living without a partner in the detention facility.&quot;</p>
<p>Who was the alleged abuser, according to the victims?</p>
<p>&quot;So it was an employee who was a cleaner. And he actually admitted to the sexual assault, and while the security guards were making note of the sexual assault and taking the boy\'s report, the person who sexually assaulted the young boy continued to mock him. And see there was a complete lack of privacy in this detention facility, so here is a boy having to report a sexual assault and he is doing it in the open air, in front of guards, while the abuser is standing there mocking him. And see what was really amazing to me is here was a Save the Children manager there and she told me at the time that this person was going to be moved to a different detention facility within Nauru but that he wasn\'t going to be fired. And she said this just as a matter of, this was just normal, you have to accept it, this is just the way it is.&quot;</p>
<p>[Vibhakar went on to say the employee was eventually fired.]</p>
<p>What were you supposed to do when you were told of abuse?</p>
<p>&quot;We were supposed to fill out an incident report immediately, but see, there was no child protection agency in Nauru so there was no statutory protection function. And the biggest issue about children and their safety was that we were never allowed to remove them from harm. So the Australian government never gave Save the Children the authority to remove children if they felt that they were unsafe. Reporting abuse is not adequate if the child is still subjected to further abuse. But this was the case in Nauru.&quot;</p>
<p>Did anyone have the authority to remove a child from harm?</p>
<p>&quot;Only the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of the government Australia and they refused.&quot;</p>
<p>Did they have people there?</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they did but they interacted almost very rarely with asylum seekers and they refused to remove children.&quot;</p>
<p>What did you do when it became apparent, in your view, that there was widespread abuse and that nobody was doing anything about it?</p>
<p>&quot;So there was an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry into children and immigration detention which is the human rights government agency in Australia. They had called this inquiry and after reviewing the information that my organization had provided voluntarily to this inquiry, I found that it lacked very important details, namely they failed to disclose the physical and sexual assault of children and the lack of safety of children.&quot;</p>
<p>So Save the Children Australia was questioned by this inquiry and didn\'t pass on information so far as you could tell, that you knew?</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. That\'s correct.&quot;</p>
<p>So what did you do?</p>
<p>&quot;I chose to make a report, an anonymous report to the [Australian] Human Rights Commission detailing the abuse and systemic violations of human right to children and families on Nauru and I attached several thousand pages of documentation as well and I sent it to the commission.&quot;</p>
<p>How physically did you send those several thousand documents?</p>
<p>&quot;I did it by mail ... I wore a baseball cap and wore sunglasses and went to a post office farther from my house and paid cash because I was so scared of the Australian government.&quot;</p>
<p>So did you have a moment as that package went through the slot, well, that\'s two years in jail?</p>
<p>&quot;I had many of those moments. Because it\'s, each disclosure is two years in jail so I had many, many of those scary moments and, of course, I was eventually referred to the Australian federal police with nine other of my colleagues.&quot;</p>
<p>Her documents are among many that have now been disclosed about the abuse of refugees on the island of Nauru. As it happened, the Australian police never came for Vibhakar. But she did lose her job with Save the Children. That organization said Australia only let it serve the refugees, if it kept its work confidential. What, if anything, has changed for the better?</p>
<p>Clarification   August 24, 2016</p>
<p>In this report, Viktoria Vibhakar recalls being told that a man who sexually assaulted a young boy at a detention center on Nauru would not lose his job, but would be moved to a different detention center. But Vibhakar went on to say, in a part of the interview that was not broadcast, that the man was eventually fired. Still, she added, &quot;the fact that a Save the Children manager would ask me and my colleague, who was the case manager, to accept the idea that this person was just going to be transferred&quot; was a sign that &quot;there was something so wrong&quot; at the detention center.</p>
<p>Save The Children along with Oxfam is now coming forward and demanding these children be removed from Nauru Island.   Always Too Late.  After The Fact.</p>

             It's all disgusting.  The only good thing about it is that it is finally coming out but how do we know they will do what is right for those people.  They are sending the adults all over the world as well.  The children though, why are they kept there so long?  For what purpose?  I have ugly thoughts in my head. It comes from being here for almost 2 years.  Fun for the perverts?  Sick.

             TY.  I just threw out another bunch of requests.  They just keep coming day after day.  Day after day they get tossed in the trash.  What really makes me sick is the ones on TV.  The Shriner's Little Kid that has now grown up and those Poor Little Cats and Dogs.  Makes me sick beyond words.  I hope these children are taken to a good place.

            Great post.  I've been following this story for almost two years now. Its horrific, and officials have known of the rampant abuses for a long time.

             I have been called out to defend myself.  I have been called a nasty name and over emotional and basically my comments are worth nothing.  So be careful who you compliment now.  But thank you.  I saw this and it called out to me because of the children.  I consider all children Our Children, and also because of Save the Children having been in many posts as compromised. But that is just me I guess and you.  Yes, they have known for a long time and now all of a sudden when it becomes a loud noise, they are saying Take Care of the Children.  I have to defend myself on here after almost 2 years of posting and researching for Our Children.  i have never used nasty names like that for anyone one here.

            I follow a number of twitter accounts that monitor this Nauru island detention camp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to discount the possibility of sexual exploitation of minors (whether that's orchestrated for political blackmail is another connection to be made)  I'm very skeptical about 'human rights abuses' stories coming from Nauru sources because there's a 2 decade long push by Leftists to close down the centre and simply accept all refugees. Australia does end up taking in about 90% of people who go to Nauru and the ones who remain there are there because of genuine concerns about their character &amp; background (such as they may be involved in human trafficking of minors)
           </p>
           <p>
            they are given good conditions and then go rioting and do millions of dollars of damage to their state of the art conditions, then bitch about their conditions more.  I've come to lose a lot of sympathyfor them and mistrust any news coming out of the joint

              I'm happy to believe the child, but where my skepticism comes in is the allegations that they took the complaint to authorities who downplayed the incident - that's the kind of smear these activists like to pull. Do I think a janitor acted inappropriately - probably. Do I think the 'system covered it up' ? less likely

               Not really.  Authorities are always trying to cover how they have been taking care of Our Children.   the UN has been hiding the rapes of Children by many of the UN Peacekeepers and we know that Oxfam and USAID are all compromised as well is Save the Children.  They have been covering up for years.

                understood, but you should appreciate the dynamic here
               </p>
               <p>
                this Nauru detention centre isnt a charity run with the shiny feelgood veneer of philanthropy behind which U.N affiliates can exact their predations
               </p>
               <p>
                this is a facility the UN have been trying to CLOSE DOWN. Its emblematic of the Australian Government's push to restrict the very Human Trafficking that the U.N. is a front for
               </p>
               <p>
                so even if it smacks of 'coverup' - it may be defensive posturing to shield the Centre from the scrutiny / enforcement of the UN

            The first 25 refugees from the men-only camp on Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island had flown out of the capital, Port Moresby, on Tuesday for the United States via the Philippines and Qatar, Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another 27 refugees flew to Port Moresby on Wednesday from a camp in Nauru, he said, also bound, ultimately, for Los Angeles.
           </p>
           <p>
            The refugees will be resettled across the United States, including in Georgia, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and Arizona. They will be assisted with housing, physical and mental healthcare, English lessons, enrolment of children in schools, and in finding employment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama’s administration had agreed to accept up to 1,250 of Australia’s refugees, mostly from Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, in exchange for Australia agreeing to accept refugees from the “northern triangle” countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, under a US-led resettlement program.
           </p>
           <p>
            US officials say security is paramount. All refugees approved for travel to the United States from Nauru and Papua New Guinea have passed the same stringent vetting processes that apply to all refugees considered for admission to the United States, and any individual not deemed to have met US vetting requirements will not be admitted.
           </p>
           <p>
            BS.  Where are they all and I am very concerned about those children on the Island, but this must be done right.  Some men were sent to LA.  Will the children go there too?  To whom?

            Under a deal Obama struck with Australia, the refugees were to be accepted in the U.S. for resettlement.  Trump instituted extreme vetting, and the first refugees arrived in the U.S. in Sept. 2017:

              <p>
               The author claimed that Save the children, Oxfam and World Vision are all fronts for intelligence agencies CIA and MI6. So I thought I'd check them out with the Wikileaks and actually there might be something to it.
              </p>
              <p>
               SAVE THE CHILDREN - both Hillary Clinton (
               <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/23614">
                https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/23614
               </a>
               ) and John Podesta (
               <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52868">
                https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52868
               </a>
               ) seem to be involved with them. Here's a quote:
              </p>
              <pre><code>"As several of my international colleagues from the Save the Children organization joined me in Washington last week to talk about how we can expand our work for children, the worldwide influence of the U.S. was clear: when America takes the lead on global development and children's rights, its actions ripple favorably across the globe. The world is only getting smaller. Decisions made in one country will affect children for the better or for the worse half a world away. We must continue to make the argument that if we want to protect the rights of any one child, we must protect the rights of all children."
</code></pre>
              <p>
               And if you look into it there's some fishy stuff going on with this organisation. Pakistan basically threw them out of the county:
               <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/12/pakistan-shuts-down-save-the-children-offices-in-islamabad">
                https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/12/pakistan-shuts-down-save-the-children-offices-in-islamabad
               </a>
              </p>
              <pre><code>“There were some intelligence reports suggesting some of the international NGOs funded by US, Israel and India were involved in working on an anti-Pakistan agenda,”
</code></pre>
              <p>
               So apparently CIA was accused of secretly killing Pakistani children with vaccines by pretending to be Save the Children workers - that's why the whole organisation was banned from the country.
              </p>
              <p>
