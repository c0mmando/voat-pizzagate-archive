            One great one that isn't afraid of "conspiracy theories" is Charles Lawson out of Tennessee. He's very bold and absolutely not afraid to be ridiculed. I listen to him on YouTube.

            "email as many preachers as possible".......You mean the hypocritical Bible thumpers who think homosexuality is a crime, Earth was created ~5000 years ago and evolution is a crock of shit?

            That'll go over like a lead balloon. I'd argue the exact OPPOSITE would work. I don't like to paraphrase Barry Goldwater but the Religious Right will be the death of the Republican Party.

            Pedophilia isn't wrong because of religion. It's wrong because having sex with children is disgusting and wrong. Everyone knows it's wrong.

              The "they" is the average person on the street not "preachers". And just for the record most people including me don't think homosexuality is a sin as long as it's between 2 consenting adults.

            This is why Racine, Wisconsin is so important. It is a different approach that is indisputable and infallible. Racine is Paul Ryan's district and is an absolute cesspool tied to all aspects of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is a barometer or litmus test for Trump and Sessions, and will show the rest of America and the world how everything is connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            If everyone understood how this really affects them in small town USA, they would begin to open their eyes. Focusing on corruption and abuse at national and global levels is too distant and abstract for people to prove and grasp. It is hard to trust people like Alex Jones, David Seaman and others who are profiteering opportunists. It is hard to trust people like George Webb and Robert Steele, as they are too closely connected, and purposely shifting the investigations into certain directions. Focusing on a small town will show everyone how this is all connected, and how the secret societies and deep state have destroyed all aspects of American liberty and the rule of law.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have many paid actors and shills pushing everyone in the wrong directions. They definitely do not want the focus on Paul Ryan's district. Racine, Wisconsin is the right direction, and it is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

            <p>
             You are insinuating that you have some sort of knowledge of whats going on there.... why not make an independent post outlining what you know and the evidence you have to support the claim/ Why don't you do that and ask for assistance in the places where the evidence is weak?
            </p>
            <p>
             You are right that its hard to trust people in the pizzagate mix. You are right that many people are trying to distract and refocus invesigation in to unfruitful areas...... But you aren't giving anyone any reason why they should believe you. You aren't giving anyone any reason to re-focus in that direction.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not saying you are wrong or that you are misleading people. I'm just saying that you are going about it in the wrong way if you actually feel this is something that is worth our time.

              It is not insinuating, it is absolute. It is worth everyone's time to dig further. This is the gold mine that could save the world. We all need to dig. This is not a joke or distraction. This is dead serious, and Racine may be the scariest avenue to those involved because it is a weak link, not what they predicted, and not what they can control.
             </p>
             <p>
              The evidence of criminal corruption tied to Racine is already overwhelming and indisputable, but this goes way beyond racketeering and collusion. This is much bigger than Racine, and there are people in very powerful places who got Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch to stonewall investigations into Racine. This is what we need to find out. The Clintons are closely connected to Racine, and there is already quite a bit to prove that connection. We need to establish more links between Racine, Dyncorp, and the Rothschilds (they are connected to Racine also but we need more details and a family tree to establish how distant or close the relations are). What we need is to continue building more evidence linked with the national and global networks of trafficking and corruption, and to dive deeper into the connections to Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker. On a related note, there are connections between Racine, the Rothschilds and the Seaman family which may or may not be related to David Seaman, but that would be a very interesting turn of events if that can be linked.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look into the connections between Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, the Knights of Pythias (linked in Racine), and the other groups they are tied to. This is one piece of the puzzle. We already know how Weiner links to the Clintons, and we need to know who else is in the Knights of Pythias beyond what is listed on the Wikipedia page and a couple other sites. Freemasons run Wisconsin, and that is a big part of how things are covered up locally. The evidence of criminal corruption in Racine is indisputable, and witnesses are ready to come forward once they are assured protection, but there is much more going on than just criminal corruption and there are very powerful forces going to extreme lengths to stop any investigation into Racine. It is connected to the Clintons, but it goes beyond them.
             </p>
             <p>
              We need to find out what else Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker are involved with, and how they are involved in covering up the more grotesque aspects of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Robert David Steele said Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus (who he calls Judas Priebus), and Scott Walker are "road kill", and he knows they are involved and covering up something very big. Whether Steele can be trusted or not remains to be seen, however he would not make that claim unless others knew there is more to these three "boy scouts". We already know they are covering up corruption, trafficking and pedo activities among their colleagues, but there is much more to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              More information is being put together, but we need the community to help dig into these areas. There needs to be a spotlight on Racine to find out why Trump and the feds are not already making indictments. This will force Trump to reveal whether he is on the right side of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, or if he is a Fake President. The feds already have more than enough evidence to indict, and Loretta Lynch personally stopped this from happening. We need to find out who made her stop (possibly through Bill Clinton) and why.

                Is that even English? You make absolutely zero sense, but are trying to correct others? Are you a paid shill or just ignorant? Do you want to solve Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, or are you looking for a job as an editor?

                Read it again and think about what it is saying. If you witnessed a murder and saw your friend get shot in the face, did the person get murdered or do you need a video of the murder for it to have actually happened? Read the other comments. Also not everything can be posted here on Voat. Not every witness is willing to come forward when others have had retaliation and their lives ruined or threatened. It is easy for you to sit on your couch making grammar suggestions when you are not involved.
               </p>
               <p>
                Much of the evidence cannot be posted here. Why don't you do some investigation?

               <p>
                We can keep it simple for you. Start with the RICO case and pay to play big rigging, bribery, extortion, embezzlement and laundering. Once you get past that, you can proceed to 2nd grade. Do you even know what the Pilgrims Society and Knights of Pythias are? Do you understand Agenda 2030 and have you figured out who is involved? Do you know who Paul Wellstone is and how he died?

            There was a Haiti Bust yesterday.

            Putin had banned American adoptions there for a reason like this. (don't know for sure. that's what i heard).
