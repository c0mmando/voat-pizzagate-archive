<p>This chapter looks at the murder weapon itself and more on the howdunnit in the Jaws the Revenge incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Acting-What-is-the-typical-set-up-for-an-actors-trailer-on-a-movie-or-TV-set">https://www.quora.com/Acting-What-is-the-typical-set-up-for-an-actors-trailer-on-a-movie-or-TV-set</a> Given what the blind item said about trailers, the arrangements inside a trailer are relevant to this case. It seems only the directors, producers, and big name/lead actors/actresses get their own trailers. This matches the people I suspect are culprits in the Jaws incident.</p>
<p>There is a very real possibility that Sid Sheinberg used his wife’s trailer (Lorraine Gary) in the Jaws the Revenge incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://gab.com/StPepeOfMAGA/posts/104698210016308665">https://gab.com/StPepeOfMAGA/posts/104698210016308665</a> The rebuttal that started this lead. It was only on one point, the issue regarding fire arm noise. Even so, a VERY valid point was brought up that actually supported my theory regarding the murder. 32 calibur handguns are a popular weapon of choice for assassins/hitmen. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.32_S%26W">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.32_S%26W</a> Seems guns in 32 calibur are often used in asssassinations and mob hits. Easily concealed, making them excellent weapons for assassination.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.32_ACP">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.32_ACP</a> The other .32 caliber (pistol).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-damage-can-32-pistol-32-caliber-cause">https://www.quora.com/What-damage-can-32-pistol-32-caliber-cause</a> .32 is rather poor as a “man stopper” unless at close range. </p>
<p>American gun owners (police and civilians) tend to prefer 9mm and .45 as the calibur of choice for their handguns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-07-28-me-9912-story.html%3f_amp=true">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-07-28-me-9912-story.html%3f_amp=true</a> The official story claims BOTH victims were shot once in the head. Given that Josephz Barsi was an alcoholic prone to violent outbursts (not being in the proper mental state has a negative impact on accuracy), I have reason to question his competence with a firearm. Mainly regarding the murder of Maria Barsi.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h98EuTS7Bt0">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h98EuTS7Bt0</a> I know its weird to bring a video game into this, but it’s relevant. As a visual aid demonstrating how the deep state “suicides” people with firearm based homicides. Kill the person -&gt; black gloves used to conceal evidence such as gunpowder residue -&gt; keep the silencer -&gt; plant the gun in the victim’s hands. Which is how I think the .32 got to the scene of the crime.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/4004098">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/4004098</a> A thread regarding pedo blackmail. Given what I know about what Spielberg does to children, the contents of this thread caused   something to come together.</p>
<p>I believe it is highly likely that Steven Spielberg is involved in “Pedo Blackmail” ie Brownstone Operations. At least in the Hollywood front.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith\'s mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans), Danny Kapon. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LAPD, the media, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were moved post morteum. The culprits doused gasoline throughout the house starting from Judith’s room and ending at the garage. Since the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Ie, incendiary bomb involving gasoline, fumes and an ignition source set to go off at a specific time (even an egg timer could be wired as such). Of course the fire destroys the evidence. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?</p>',

           </a>
           Given what the blind item said about trailers, the arrangements inside a trailer are relevant to this case. It seems only the directors, producers, and big name/lead actors/actresses get their own trailers. This matches the people I suspect are culprits in the Jaws incident.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is a very real possibility that Sid Sheinberg used his wife’s trailer (Lorraine Gary) in the Jaws the Revenge incident.

           The rebuttal that started this lead. It was only on one point, the issue regarding fire arm noise. Even so, a VERY valid point was brought up that actually supported my theory regarding the murder. 32 calibur handguns are a popular weapon of choice for assassins/hitmen.

           Seems guns in 32 calibur are often used in asssassinations and mob hits. Easily concealed, making them excellent weapons for assassination.

           .32 is rather poor as a “man stopper” unless at close range.
          </p>
          <p>
           American gun owners (police and civilians) tend to prefer 9mm and .45 as the calibur of choice for their handguns.

           The official story claims BOTH victims were shot once in the head. Given that Josephz Barsi was an alcoholic prone to violent outbursts (not being in the proper mental state has a negative impact on accuracy), I have reason to question his competence with a firearm. Mainly regarding the murder of Maria Barsi.

           I know its weird to bring a video game into this, but it’s relevant. As a visual aid demonstrating how the deep state “suicides” people with firearm based homicides. Kill the person -&gt; black gloves used to conceal evidence such as gunpowder residue -&gt; keep the silencer -&gt; plant the gun in the victim’s hands. Which is how I think the .32 got to the scene of the crime.

           A thread regarding pedo blackmail. Given what I know about what Spielberg does to children, the contents of this thread caused   something to come together.
          </p>
          <p>
           I believe it is highly likely that Steven Spielberg is involved in “Pedo Blackmail” ie Brownstone Operations. At least in the Hollywood front.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith's mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans), Danny Kapon. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LAPD, the media, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were moved post morteum. The culprits doused gasoline throughout the house starting from Judith’s room and ending at the garage. Since the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Ie, incendiary bomb involving gasoline, fumes and an ignition source set to go off at a specific time (even an egg timer could be wired as such). Of course the fire destroys the evidence. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
          </p>

             Pointing out blackmail ops (which are 100% real btw) is NOT “pedo apologetics”.

             What kind of twisted leap of idiotic logic is that? Especially given that Brownstone ops are right out of the Mossad playbook.

            A point in favor of the theory, from an layman firearms perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            .32 caliber handguns have been around for a long time, are produced worldwide and then to be on the inexpensive side in comparison to more popular models and calibers. They're disposable.
