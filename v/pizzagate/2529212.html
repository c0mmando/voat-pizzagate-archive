<p>\'After dinner, however, beginning around 11pm, Grey drove the two back to Carrington\'s residence and parked his car, whereupon Grey began kissing Carrington all over his face, neck and mouth,\' reads the filing.</p>
<p>\'Simultaneously therewith, Carrington told Grey to &quot;stop&quot;, he declined and instead, the executive became physically violent, slamming Plaintiff\'s face into the window and restraining him by his seatbelt, which was still buckled.\'
The filing goes on to claim that Grey eventually demanded Carrington perform oral sex on him or \'he would destroy any chance Plaintiff had of building a career in the entertainment industry.\'</p>
<p>Carrington claims he the performed oral sex on Grey, and a few days later attended the premiere of The Fighter, which was held on December 6 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The following month Grey invited Carrington to an after-party being held at the The Beverly Hilton following the Golden Globes.</p>
<p>Carrington alleges in the filing that soon after he arrived, he was ordered to go wait in a hotel room for Grey.</p>
<p>\'When Grey arrived in the hotel room, he demanded that Carrington have sexual intercourse with him. Carrington declined. Grey responded that if Plaintiff did not have sex with him, he would no longer be affiliated with Paramount or any other Viacom affiliate,\' states the filing. </p>
<p>\'Carrington as expected, was conflated; crying, scared and did not want to go through with having sex. Grey demanded Carrington drink alcohol to make it easier, at which point he proceeded to pour the spirit down Carrington\'s throat, ripped off his clothes, and proceeded to anally rape him, without a condom.\'</p>
<p>He claims that he was left bruised and bleeding after the encounter, with his clothing torn.</p>
<p>A few months later, Carrington alleges that Viacom reached out to ask if he would sign an NDA in exchange for \'an envelope filled with money.\' </p>
<p>Carrington claims he turned down the offer, and as a result was blacklisted from developing any television projects.</p>
<p>The, in 2014, Carrington claims that he managed to drum up interest in another series he was working on from Brian Graden, a Viacom exec who launched the network\'s gay channel Logo. </p>
<p>Soon after meeting Graden, Carrington claims that the executive asked him to engage in threesomes and one-on-one relations.</p>
<p>\'Graden indicated to Carrington that if he wished to move forward with his reality show, and come off Viacom\'s banned list, that he would be required to have sex with Graden,&quot;\' states the lawsuit. </p>
<p>\'Carrington agreed, as having sex with Graden was now his only option if he wanted to work in the entertainment industry.\'</p>
<p>Carrington also claims that Graden sent nude images and suggestive texts, as well as one that stated: \'You keep me happy and we\'ll do well together.\' </p>

<p>THE INEVITABLE NDA</p>
<p>After this alleged incident, Carrington says he was contacted by human resources from Viacom and asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Carrington was promised that if he signed, he would receive an envelope filled with money, according to the lawsuit. Carrington says he refused and he was not allowed back on the Paramount lot.</p>
<p>&quot;However, what Mr. Carrington was unaware of at the time, was that his refusal to sign the NDA not only resulted in being blacklisted from Viacom, but extended throughout the entertainment industry,&quot; states the complaint.</p>

            I am glad to see that Victims are getting more  Confident.  The more that come out the better, it will bolster the confidence of others.  Of course, the charges are extremely sad for the abused.  The message he sent is beyond sickening.  I don't want to see any pics either.  Some of these guys I am sure they have an inflated ego.  Everyone is just waiting to see them.  Really.   Blacklisted for not accepting the Blackmail money.  There should be some heavy fines and time served handed out for Graden and Viacom.

             just read came speeding over and as always the delectable Carm beat me to it!

            <p>
             SO Carm, am I reading this right? Gay Creepo Grey was suicided before all his (even worse) transgressions/revelations came tumbling out? Kinda like

             </s>
             other HWood heads whose days are surely numbered...?

              HWood has me perplexed lately.  I don't trust them. More so than usual.  This stuff about the Academy tossing out B Cosby and Roman P.  What games are they playing.  All of a sudden they are all pious and demure.  Pullleeeeeeze.  Yes very odd about Graden.  I agree they suicided him.  I am in shock that people are still not adding up all the deaths.  Especially after Avicii.  There have been others as well.  Aviciis manager Ash has appeared with Natalia Brzezenski     who is yes, related to Mika and Zbiegnew and is married to Mark B.  Yes. Sad.
