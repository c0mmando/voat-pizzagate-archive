            Elysium was a Tor hidden service child pornography website formed in November 2016 and opened in December 2016. The site is open for all to view, however, to view pictures and download links that are posted on the site, one needed to make an account and log in. Elysium is a general child porn website, in that it has sections for both boys and girls. Like many other sites it refers to the "just love, don't hurt" paradigm, meaning that hurtcore is not allowed. The site was seized by German law enforcement on June 13, 2017.

            Elysium was owned and operated by Noctua, Ovidius, and Scorpion. A fourth administrator account, "Elysium", was used by the other 3 administrators to post important announcements. As of June 2017, the site's moderators are Aether, Funnel, GreyTheWolf, Kefka (who was GameShark as confirmed on Magic Kingdom), Midas, Panda, PetSpider, Stainless and Zeus.

           <p>
            The site is believed to be the follow-on to The Giftbox Exchange. On November 14, 2017, the two active administrators of TGE, Aesop and Timmy, shut down the site which was re-opened 2 weeks later by crazymonk. An exploit found on the site pointed to the fact that crazymonk was compromised, and on December 1, 2016, the site shut down for good. The registration dates of the Elysium administrators was November 17, 2016, leading many to believe that Aesop and Timmy began creating Elysium in the days following their initial shutdown of TGE.
           </p>
           <p>
            The registration dates of the first members were all in late-November because the site operated as invite-only for the first month of it's existence. The link to the site was leaked to Topic Links in early December, but registration was not opened to the general public until December 12, 2016.

           <p>
            The chatrooms run by The Giftbox Exchange were removed from the server by Timmy before crazymonk returned to resurrect the forum. The chatrooms were renamed from "Giftbox International Chat" to "Elysium Girl-Lovers chat" and from "Giftbox Tiny Chat" to "Elysium Tiny Chat" after the closure of TGE. Other than some superficial changes to the look of the chatrooms and changes to the URL, they kept on functioning as before, with the same staff in place.

Elysium was seized by German authorities on June 13, 2017 at approximatel 1:45AM UTC according to Noctua. As of now, what led to the seizure is unknown, but all forum staff was accounted for by Noctua. In the immediate aftermath, the "Elysium" account posted the following signed message on Childs Play, Bv4, and Magic Kingdom:
