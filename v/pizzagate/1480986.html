            Rind, Bruce (2016): Reactions to First Postpubertal Female Same-Sex Sexual Experience in the Kinsey Sample: A Comparison of Minors with Peers, Minors with Adults, and Adults with Adults. Archives of Sexual Behavior, published online October 25th 2016
           </p>
           <p>
            Bruce Rind writes about his study:
           </p>
           <p>
            ""This study examined reactions to first postpubertal same-sex sexual experience in the Kinsey female same-sex sample (consisting of females with extensive postpubertal same-sex experience) as a function of participant and partner ages. (...) Data were collected by Kinsey interviewers between 1939 and 1961 (M year=1947). Girls under 18 (M age=14.9), whose sexual experience was with a woman (M age=26.3), reacted positively just as often as girls under 18 (M age=14.1) with peers (Mage=15.0) and women (Mage=22.7)with women (Mage=26.3). The positive-reaction rates were, respectively, 85, 82, and 79 %. In a finer-graded analysis, younger adolescent girls (B14) (Mage=12.8) with women (Mage=27.4) had a high positive reaction rate (91%), a rate reached by no other group. For women (M age=22.2) with same-aged peers (M age=22.3), this rate was 86%.Girls with peers or women had no emotionally negative reactions (e.g., fear, disgust, shame, regret);women with women rarely did. Results contradicted prevailing clinical, legal, and lay beliefs that minor–adult sex is inherently traumatic and would be distinguished as such compared to age-concordant sex."
           </p>
           <p>
            It is very interesting to see that once again older minors did NOT like sex with adults more than younger minors. This is the same result as in several other studies. Here comes the new result in this issue:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Minors´ positive reaction (enjoyed "much") to first postpubertal same-sex sexual experience as a function of age at experience, in original Kinsey female same-sex sample":
           </p>
           <p>
            Minor less or equal 11 years old + adult: 100 % (n=1)
Minor 12 years old + adult: 100 % (n=1)
Minor 13 years old + adult: 100 % (n=5)
Minor 14 years old + adult: 75 % (n=4)
Minor 15 years old + adult: 100 % (n=2)
Minor 16 years old + adult: 67 % (n=3)
Minor 17 years old + adult: 80 % (n=10)
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rates of positive and negative reactions to first postpubertal same-sex sexual experience, in Kinsey female same-sex sample, by five finergraded participant-partner age groups":
           </p>
           <p>
            Minor + peer - Enjoyed "much" - 82 % (N=78)
Minor less equal 14 + adult - 91 % (N=11)
Minor (15-17) + adult - 80 % (N=15)
Adult + peer adult - 86 % (N=58)
Adult + older adult - 63 % (N=30)
Total 81 % (N=192)

            Pedophile rings are very extensive. In excess of 80% of people at the level of Congress, important think tanks, executive positions, leadership of major corporations are on video engaging in pedophilia, gay sex, orgies, etc. Blackmail of this nature is by far the strongest glue holding the old order together.

             A shill. Really? Did you run out of arguments or what? So anyone who dares to disagree with your royal highness is a shill? Must be fun to live in such a black and white world.

             If you feel depressed today, there is no reason to deag others with you, ok.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I got a huge wave of depression today, where I was literally going to leave my family for a week....because all this "other" stuff, insignificant stuff happening around me didn't really matter VS what is really going on (#pizzagate) , which is why I was getting depressed with this. Than I broke down and talked to my significant other, and he helped me come out of it, now back to research. Its messing with everyone.. Stay strong though, keep your loved ones close and make sure to TALK about it, how you feel, to your family or husband/wife, GF, BF etc. Were all in this together, don't be scared, don't let it mess you up, this is your consciousness waking up, like a bad hangover, your waking up out of a "coma", we all are, keep calm and lets get these fuckers."
            </p>
            <p>
             I come from a different background it seems. A world where knowing ones enemy is vital. This is what I am aiming for with this thread.
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand that you are emotional and a unique snowflake and feel hurt by this all, but we all are not like you.

             Right. Then again, loving relationships between adults and kids are real, most parents agree with me I think.
            </p>
            <p>
             Few would actively encourage that 3 yo to continue until climax when they rub themselves against your thigh sitting on your lap. That happens a lot too. Without adult influence.
            </p>
            <p>
             For pedoactivists the big sell point is stolen from the libfems, do children have a right to their bodies and if so do they have the right to express themselves sexually. And that is where the pedos step in. They say it's their right, no one else's, just like with women and abortion, and if the children are willing (by grooming etc sex education) who has the right to deny that basic human right from them. That's how it will be sold to the masses. And critics are labeled alt right, moralists and bible thumping bigots. Just like with lgbt agenda.

            I think there are 2 types of Pedo - Uber rich/ elite and the poor ones. 
There is a big class distinction even with Pedophiles.

             Not all poor are sadistic and not all rich are gentle..benign and malicious as pointed out by others. Well benign and benign. Seems complex.

            Yeah, I agree. We have to draw the line somewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Poverty is also a factor here, having no food makes one vulnerable to exploitation, this happens in many places for adults too.. same with domestic violence, loneliness and parents drug/psych problems.

           <p>
            All in all we need to battle against inequality too

            Interesting, but I disagree with the divide because of this: If group 1 were unwilling to hurt children, how would they ever come across children to have sex with? I guess I just imagine that there are a lot of these NAMBLA type people who think the right to have sex with consenting children is the next civil rights frontier, I just don't know how many of them really have access to consenting children, and hence don't have sex with them. Do we classify people who want to have consensual sex with children, but never do, as pedophiles?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I think that for physiological reasons, no one who actually has sex with a child, or actually wants to, can be as benign as what you describe in group 1.

             Good points there buddy. I think NAMBLA type of guys also speak of the child's right to his/hers body and the right to be a sexual being. And about human rights and civil rights...Which logically would lead to sex education for minors in that sense too, now we have only LGBT and straight sex education in schools but the trend in Europe at least is that they start this for preschoolers instead of starting it later  as it is now. So the trend is there and there are rumors that Congress will pass a law where pedophilia is counted as part of lgbt rights.. It hasn't gotten much support in the society not at least since 70-80's. But it will come as majority of pedos are in 4 professions, doctors, lawyers, cops and clergy.. and politicians too, all professions with high amount of narcissists

              Yeah I think I agree with you. I am interested in the divide between 'Epstein' pedos who want to sleep with 12 yo girls, and the people who are into toddlers etc. You almost have to think people who are into very young kids (5 &lt;) are of the torture kill breed. Also, how pesos can be divided between satanists and non satanists is interesting.

             I know. But group 2 pedos really think that way as any mention of philia (love) would mean that they are wrong in forcing, raping and molesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not saying that group 1 has it right either with seduction and grooming possibly leading to a willing child partner but it SEEMS less harmful.

               Understandable. Not an easy topic. But in my opinion things have to be spoken openly, otherwise we might get caught in the web of lobbying and legislation we disagree with

               Yes I agree, the vulnerable in the society must be protected by the stronger, instead of abusing them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Question remains; why are there so many influential people and charities out there who constantly get caught abusing while speaking of protection.

                 Last time I worked in schools and kindergartens it was apparent to me that those little innocent angels were constantly fighting, lying, stealing toys, manipulating adults and each others for personal gratification and so on.

                <p>
                 Last time I checked The Animal Channel those innocent God created creatures were devouring each other like it was Harmageddon.

                 Yes, define innocent in the context.

                I guess you are right.
               </p>
               <p>
                Found this: "The results were surprising, and alarming (I guess I secretly hoped that pedophiles sought pictures and nothing more). Unfortunately, I later researched and found a Mayo study (further supported by a later federal prison study) which found that MORE than 3/4 of persons convicted of possessing child pornography admitted to actively molesting children. Thus my dream of a slightly less-evil world was shattered."

                 are you in this forum to convince yourself that this is going on?? because that's what it seems like your doing, trying to convince yourself. Thats sick, and you should not be here unless you want to actually help, and not just help yourself. If you are not invested in exposing these sick bastards, than your in the wrong forum.

            <p>
             (2) Rich PEDOPHILES Trump, EPSTEIN, Savillie they have all the power of GOVERNMENT on their back, if they get caught they get a slap on the wrist and the child accuser get's sent to prison ( Think Franklin )
            </p>

             The USA is a  penal colony for Europe, where UK sent parents to be slaves and the kids remained in UK to be raped by Elite and that was 1600-&gt;1800's. Later UK simply told the BUSH family to cruise schools and orphanges to find suitable children.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1972 Nixon created the Petro-Dollar (PEDO-Dollar) where CIA promised to send infinite white children to saudi to be fucked to death.

              But not all rich get away with it. There was a documentary about it in Cambodia and a millionaire from USA got some prison time but it was more like a slap on the wrist really. I guess if you are powerful enough they won't even prosecute you...

             Yeah, pretty much. But in this case the "normal people" pedos are not seen that much normal by the majority of people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children are sexual, just go to any mumboard and read the "my 6mo toddler masturbates omg was she molested what shall I do now" threads and you see the amount of ignorance of most people, usually bible thumping moralists, on what is normal behavior. I know for a fact that toddlers masturbate to orgasm without any outside assistance or info input.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some people see this as healthy and guide he children to do it privately, others make them feel bad and dirty about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I said above is used by pedos to advocate their own lusts, but is a scientifically solid phenomena.
            </p>
            <p>
             Norms enjoying sex and rapists on their power trips, yeah I can see an analogy there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some think that there is a risk of group 1 pedos switching to group 2 as they are demonized anyway. I'm on the fence whether group 1 pedos should be tolerated at all or not. Just don't know enough what really is damaging sexwise to underage children. I'm no scientist. But totally against rape and violence against anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the intention is good (child protection) but age limits are placed arbitrarily, as there are cultures or were at least were underage sexuality wasn't a taboo, like in Hawaii and Polynesian islands and studies showed no negative impact learning it early... maybe it's just culture.

              It's one thing for children to masturbate--which they do.  It's another for an adult to take advantage of a child's innocence and inability to consent.  There are laws in place exactly because children do not have the wherewithal to consent.   There is a multitude of studies that show the harm done to children who have been exploited and sexually abused.  If an adult does ANYTHING sexual with a child, it is simply wrong.  The child will grow up with issues, and they do.  They don't grow up with mental health issues--anxiety, depression, dissociative disorder, etc--because there is a taboo; they grow up with mental health issues because their boundaries have been encroached upon in the most heinous of ways.  If you haven't noticed, there is a push (and it seems to be coming from Washington and the UK) to normalise paedophilia; to feel sorry for the poor men who are attracted to children.  They are lecherous, evil and sick.  Please don't fall for it.  Al paedophiles should be locked up or castrated.  Talk to ANYONE who's been abused as a child, and they will tell you of the hell they've had to go through and the devastating consequences.

               I agree, well thought of and solid logic behind too.

               Still there are people who say that minors can have sex life so to speak that's not harmful. Where I live, majority of 12 years olds have sexual experiences already, but usually with peers or just slightly older (teen agers).

               I guess the problem arises when the other party is either in a position of power and/or considerably older.

               But there seems to be a bias there too, older women lusting after younger men (16+) is seen as cool "cougar" thing, but older guys with younger girls (16+) are seen as pedopigs and molesters.

               But yeah, it's a complex thing and I think we better be in the safe side and limit the sex life of minors than expose them to greater harm by being too lax.

               But things change fast, who would have thought 30 years ago that gay couples could marry and adopt children?

               It is because of lobbying massively and I'm afraid pedo issue will be next on agenda possibly with zoophiliacs.
