            I started to say "thank you", but that didn't seem quite right, lol!  I'm having to take breaks as it is so I'll probably have to study in small doses but knowledge is power!

            WOW!  This is very helpful to know, thank you!  I would normally say "good to know" but that didn't seem quite right.  I got my crash course in what goes on in pedo world in early November and I think I spent the whole weekend crying.  I thought I knew too much but after reading all that I feel like I only hit the tip of the iceberg!  Knowledge is a double edged sword.

            I took another look at their site after reading and rereading what you wrote here and some more things popped out at me.  I took screencaps and I'm going to try and reply to and/or edit my original post with new information.  That black and white picture had a lot of weird stuff in it, like the icebox and power outlet.  It seemed strange and out of place.  I zoomed in and also noticed several hearts (outline and solid) in the background.

            I noticed they said "Bring the kids" but I did not realize it is at the bottom of every page!  Interesting that they would pick that phrase to be one of the more prominent ones.

            OK.  Had some extra time and went to Scott Weiner's twitter.  I checked out some of the people there and for Brian T Prairie there was just the logo of Roots posted!  This set something off in me and I went to his twitter page and saw a lot of hidden hearts and he also posted lots of ink drawings of little kids with hidden hearts and stars.  One had a tricycle being swallowed up.  Also a lot of mean pumpkins and a nasty picture of a ink drawn clown.   There were other things as well.  Someone with a lot more experience please take a look at this.  It could be nothing you tell me.

            Wtf i used to work for them! Damn creeps working in there. I left that place a few years. It was weird because 1 of the grill guys always talked about picking up under age girls and going to the Aragon with them. He had caught a case and never wanted to talk about it. Most of them are illegals and had a back round. The owners are creeps.

            They do have the symbols and some other very interesting things like "bring the Kids", there is a lot that looks that it could be suspicious but we must be careful. It is easy to find codes about pizza at the pizza sites haha but think about the $65,000 amount. Look into the Pedesta emails about the Lazzorettes and the pool party with children. as well as a mention of the farm house which seems very connected to "field house" and other mentions in the handkerchief email... also pool parties are mentioned a lot in respect to the hollywood predator parties. They specifically mention the age of the entertainment-- age 11, 8 and 6 I believe. Ill find the wikileaks ID #...

            Speculation but it would seem this is the "farm" such as as mentioned in Boys For Sale-- a farm is a warehouse or holding area for kids or  "pizza or hotdogs".

             I'm sorry but I'm not quite sure I understand what you are saying here?  Do you mean that it might have been cheaper/easier to not transport them from Chicago to DC?

            Did you notice the pictures of the two owners?  They are pictures when they where small boys...my guess 3 or 4 yrs old or maybe even younger.  One has his  legs spread open and underwear showing.  The other one has a stuffed animal with him.  Pedophiles often use stuffed animals to lure little children.  What?  A little odd if you ask me.  Also the hand looks rather small like that of a child.  I live in Chicago and have wondered where is the Chi-town connection. We know there has to be at least one if not more.  Is this one of them.?

             Ohhhh, I didn't even notice that before!  Actually, I can kind of see underwear in both pics.  Do you think wearing grown up clothing means something for the black and white one?  His name is also Scott Weiner and it made me wonder if there is a connection to Anthony Weiner.  The surname doesn't seem that common.

Handmade Pizza throws a knockdown, drag-out party for any

            With logos, I want to give benefit of the doubt if there is any possible explanation for them. For example, I cannot imagine who would think that the triangle spiral of Elpida has any non-pedophilic connection to the name or mission of the organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            In contrast, the logo here looks like a stylize pizza covered with sauce. The hand connects with the emphasis on hand-made, and the heart is just a heart. Unlike the pedophile symbols, there is no "little-big" symbology here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously, these guys might be the biggest pervs on the planet. But I just don't see it from this website.

             Yes, I could see how the logo could be emphasizing the handmade nature of the pizza and was hesitating about posting, but then I thought someone might have some insight I'm missing.  I'm not 100% ready to let this go, there's something that doesn't seem quite right.
            </p>
            <p>
             it is so weird going through logos and websites and keep having to remind myself that 99.99999% of pizza shops are legit and it is actually a good thing if they don't fit with all of this!  And this isn't a puzzle with 100 pieces noted on the box, we don't know if there are any "puzzle pieces" down some rabbit trails and we don't have to find something.  I just keep reminding myself that an hour researching and not finding anything is not an hour wasted.
