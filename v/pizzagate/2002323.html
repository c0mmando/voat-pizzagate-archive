            It looks like this thread relates to the individual going by Taylor Scott Amarel. I am currently researching the subject after I found some interesting videos on the deepweb (since taken down).
           </p>
           <p>
            For a connection to PZ, the best bet is this former thread

            but I have been unable to find the emails involved and the OP has deleted his account.

            If you click on "all requests" you will find a couple of requests about HSBC. There is a connection to the Clintons that was discovered when HSBC was investigated. HSBC is a British-HongKong company. --

            </a>
            --- The parent company was established in 1865 as the HongKong and Shanghai Bank, and is now a subsidiary of the London parent company. There have been numerous allegations that this bank did business with tax evaders and organized crime cartels amounting to money laundering.

            "The arrest of the head of global foreign exchange cash trading at HSBC bank may shed new light on suspicions the Clinton Foundation has been involved in illegal offshore money-laundering operations on a massive scale." ----
           </p>
           <p>
            "After the HSBC currency traders were arrested, WND conducted an investigation of the bank’s connections to the Clinton Foundation, uncovering a massive offshore financial network involving tens of thousands of transactions that extend far beyond HSBC."
           </p>
           <p>
            "On Feb. 10, 2015, the London Guardian reported $81 million from seven wealthy international donors flowed to the Clinton Foundation through controversial Swiss tax-free HSBC accounts maintained in Geneva, as revealed by leaked HSBC files obtained by French newspaper Le Monde."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Breitbart noted Giustra is one of the Clinton Foundation’s largest contributors, donating more than $25 million, while the Chagoury family in Nigeria has committed $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative.
           </p>
           <p>
            This led WND to begin an extensive investigation into the major leak of offshore banking documents, known as the “Panama Papers,” a giant leak of more than 11.5 million financial and legal records from the files of the Mossack Fonseca law firm that was archived by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Panama Papers database contains information on some 214,000 offshore entities connected to people in more than 200 countries and territories. It reveals major financial institutions, including HSBC, involved in the creation of hard-to-trace companies in offshore havens that form a complex international network involved in tax evasion and money-laundering schemes."

            You will have to provide a connection to pizzagate if you expect this to remain.  I have to say that I could not find out what Warren and Grassley were trying to get information about.  What was the FOIA in regards to?  I know that there was just a post on here about a case that White was involved with in NY about a 49M amt. NY had to pay regarding a foster program problem.  Am wondering if that was it.  Otherwise I could not see what it was all about.  Maybe someone else knows?

              Yeah, there was an article on here about the payment NY foster program had to pay out, but without admitting wrong doing.  I think this was when M J White was in NY before her stint with the SEC.  I don't know what the FOIA request was really about.  The best way to research this is to find the article about the NY payment, but again, I don't know if that is the reason.
