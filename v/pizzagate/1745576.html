            The 5-year process of wrangling apparently worked.  This bastard is guilty as hell, as well as his 2 butt buddies.  Read up about his past.  Also read up about the murder of an investigator &amp; his son, as well as the disappearance of the local DA.  The "justice" system in this country is a fucking joke!!

            Check out how Graham Spanier(ex-PSU President) looks at Bill Clinton:
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Graham Spanier:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Pennsylvania State University (PSU) President  (Sept 1995 – November 2011)
           </p>
           <p>
            One of Spanier’s personal associates while serving as Chancellor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) was a man named Ronald Roskens (a past UNL Chancellor and President). Roskens has been intimately linked to the notorious Franklin Scandal, and then received his termination notice after being photographed with young naked boys at his residence.  Roskens trained Spanier how to be Chancellor at UNL before Spanier left to become president of PSU in 1995.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Spanier and Roskens are both ‘closeted’ gay men who are sexually aroused by young boys. They are classic pedophiles." -  Brent Goodwin (former U.S. Naval Intel, former CIA field officer, private detective) November 7, 2011
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Ronald Roskens:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Roskens has ties to former Franklin Credit Union president / convicted felon child molester Larry King, and a long list of known pedophiles throughout the U.S.   Several of Spanier’s ‘military friends’ were charged in an international pedophilia scandal at the Department of Defense. Spanier and Roskens were also close friends and longtime associates of convicted child molester Dr. Daniel Schrein.” -

             http://archive.is/B1pHX
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Strangely enough, within a year after Ronald Roskens allegedly being dismissed from the University of Nebraska in 1991, President George H.W. Bush selected Roskens to head the Agency of International Development (AID).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             What happened:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            While the media likes to make the Sandusky story about PSU ex-head-coach Joe Paterno because he was fired and it makes for a great story, anyone who followed this knows that Paterno is the only one who did anything right.  When Paterno learned that ex-coach Sandusky was in the locker room showers with a 13 year old boy in 2001, he immediately informed his superiors and Gary Schultz, the head of the PSU police.  After that it was President Spanier &amp; the PSU police dept who were responsibility for handling the situation.  They both basically covered for Jerry Sandusky, only giving him a verbal warning.  The head of the Second Mile actually sat Jerry down and told him he couldn't shower with boys anymore because "it's not the 60's anymore".
           </p>
           <p>
            Although, in their defense, Spanier &amp; Schultz were only told that Jerry was "horsing-around" with a boy, it wasn't until 10 years later that witness Mike McQueary (asst coach) changed his story to rape.  That's probably why the only counts of rape that Sandusky was found NOT guilty of was what McQueary testified to seeing.  Why he changed his story is not known but many believe McQueary, being the only witness, was pressured by prosecutors after getting caught sending a dick-pic to a co-ed that wasn't his wife(now divorced).  Still, PSU staff should have informed the proper government agencies like in 1998 when the same thing happened to Sandusky at PSU.  I should note that all government agencies, with their physiologists trained to find pedophiles, all cleared Sandusky of being a pedophile in 1998.  Thus PA, NY, NJ and DE continued to send 100's of kids a year to Jerry's Second Mile program.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             What will happen:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Gary Schultz, the head of the PSU police at the time, plead guilty last week and will probably get a fine and probation.  Interestingly, Shultz after the 2001 Sandusky incident was promoted from head of the police to senior VP for finance and business. I don't know if Spanier promoted him but that seems strange to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spanier will easily get off when he appeals this guilty verdict outside of central Pennsylvania. BigTrial.net explains why:
            <a href="http://www.bigtrial.net/2017/03/jury-convicts-spanier-on-one-of-three.html?m=1">
             http://www.bigtrial.net/2017/03/jury-convicts-spanier-on-one-of-three.html?m=1
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The statute of limitations in Pennsylvania for endangering the welfare of a child is two years. The incident that Spanier was convicted of, however, dated back to 2001 -- the infamous shower incident involving a naked Jerry Sandusky and a boy that was supposedly witnessed by graduate assistant Mike McQueary.
            </p>
            <p>
             That means the jury convicted Spanier for a crime that the statute of limitations had already expired on. You may hear more about that on appeal, where Spanier's legal team is confident of victory. Once they got their case out of Dauphin County, Spanier's layers are betting, state law may be applied.
            </p>

            My mother was a professor at penn state in the 80's. My brother and I were left alone at the faculty pool. There was one guy there who would have the kids sit on his lap and he would rub the kids legs and give them over the top attention. I realized his game and got the fuck away from him, I was an 8 year old girl and no one ever thought this was weird. Ever since the Sandusky crimes came to light I wonder if that's the peodophile I got away from.
