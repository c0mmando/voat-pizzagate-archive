            Ya think?!? WTF ? And Epstein getting a slap in the wrist? 
Now we have another lawsuit filed  naming Donald Trump and Epstein together, but I don't know if it's actually a new lawsuit or if it's an old one that's been dismissed. What is going on with that? There are witnesses out there and they need to be front and center.

            The MSM has done an amazing job in simply ignoring any/all content in the leaks.. anytime a reporter even begins to scratch the surface without distorting the content to "fit" the narrative, their career is in immediate jeopardy.

            Actually real journalists would know the facts of this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            May 28th Denny Hastert is indicted for financial structuring.  Indictments mention payoffs for "misconduct."  Nothing about sexual abuse is mentioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            May 28th   This email is sent.
           </p>
           <p>
            May 29th.  The NY Times publishes that the payoffs were for sexual misconduct committed 30 years earlier.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you have the timeline wrong.  The person sending the email is Jake Siewert.  Is there anything showing he was a friend of Hastert's?

             "Are there other people from Chicago who went on to run for office whom you knew when you lived here, went to school here?
I went to college with Denny Hastert, Carol Moseley Braun, and Steve Schiff, who became a Republican congressman from Albuquerque, New Mexico. We were all in student government at the U of I. In 1965, Hastert and I were part of a two-month student delegation to Japan. We traveled around the country, taught at an English camp for two weeks, met with local YMCA leaders. We were there for the 20th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hastert was not like Clinton or Rahm. I did not see the seed of political power. We’re still friends. I knew him when he was Speaker. His personality has not changed at all from 1965 to 2013. He’s a decent, wonderful guy."

             Oh of course AreWeSure why would anyone think Dennis Hastert was even a Pedophile? I mean come on people. Yes he was appointed after the former speaker was forced to resign after news broke he fathered a child out of wedlock, never a good thing for any Republican. And that news itself was leaked by Bill Clinton after the very same speaker refused to back down over Clinton's impeachment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would anyone think Dennis Hastert was appointed speaker because his rumored sexual exploits with children would make him much more controllable.

             The problem down in DC is the Unions like the SEIU are run by rich people. It's not supposed to work that way. You need POOR PEOPLE RUNNING A UNION. Or at least people like me who spent the first 10 years of his life in extreme poverty by today's standards.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will whip the SEIU back into shape. It's grown too fat of George Soros's teet..........Ewe, I'm going to go throw up now.

              Good Lord, you cite a kook like Edmonds claiming it after it became public.   She worked 6 months as a translator and in that time has discovered information on every single American political controversy before and since.

               AreWeSure you have about 5 accounts so how do I know you're just one person? You respond with 1000 words one day and then 10 the next. I know you're SEIU but how do I know the person to account ratio is correct.
              </p>
              <p>
               And of course you're going to say I haven't kicked your rhetorical ass. You still believe 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab terrorists. You don't believe Brownstone Operations exist. Nor do you find it strange a Pakistani Mango goes 6 times more than one from Mexico.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's a thought experiment for you. Just for arguments sake pretend 9/11 was an inside job by George H.W. Bush and David Rockefeller. Wouldn't that be absolutely fucking horrible for poor people? Think of all the people that died on that day and all those poor people that died in 2 unjust wars on both sides.
              </p>
              <p>
               If 9/11 was an inside job you'd be singing a different tune. Until then please forgive me but I'm going to dismiss your claim and your opinion of my humor. If you were like me and changed your mind about 9/11 after just this Winter after having believed the official story since it came out...........well you'd find my twisted sense of humor a whole hell of a lot funnier.

                   The word "hear" means to use your EAR. Get it? Hear has an EAR. It implies you audibly heard them say they appreciated the free pizza. You provided no link to a news story so I assumed you meant you were in the know. You "heard" how they felt.

              Agreed!!  My memory serves, Dennis Hastert's legal battles have been ongoing. Charges REsurfaced and for those, he was convicted and finally sentenced and I believe via plea bargain,  which prevented any real testimony and details coming out.  So your comment about 30 years ago is fucking bullshit.

               This is what taking down the MSM is all about. Those frustrated with the pace of justice need to realize it's far bigger and far worse than they imagine and with a hostile, lying media running interference, nobody is going to believe the names that are charged.  I'm not talking just politicians. It's going to be 'stars' of entertainment and business. Big, big names.

             Interesting the reference to a Japanese island.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also interesting was that one of the other men with Tony Podesta and Hastert in Japan contacted Podesta by email around this time that Hastert was arrested. I can't remember his name but believe he was Japanese.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was it his connections to the Podestas that got Hastert into political office, but on the Republican side?

              You are right about that guy being Japanese and I believe he knew them from their trip over there about 50 yrs. ago from writing the letter.   I do not know whether he got his start because of the P Bros or not but it would not be surprising.  Just being within the pedo club may have boosted his career especially if they knew he was willing to play their game.

               I wondered if people have looked into the Japanese man. It's hard given that I believe he's lived in Japan but he was close to TP and Hastert apparently. Yes, Hastert was a teacher not in business or law, and didn't one of the  Podestas say he didn't expect him to go into politics?

                I remember there were copies of the letter on here and other info as well.  It is too bad the search button is not working anymore.  I think this is a very important piece of information I believe he might have gone back there.
