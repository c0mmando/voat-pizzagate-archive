<p>In my opinion, this is the clear evidence of a trap set by President Trump. Imagine for a moment that Trump invites Graham and the McCains for a private dinner.

What are they going to say? She can\'t say yes, but she can\'t say no. So she\'s trapped. Trump puts the pressure and spotlight on further by having &quot;two unnamed sources&quot; leak to AP. Now consider Trump actually offers her a human trafficking ambassadorship at the State Department. If she says no, then she\'ll have to bullshit a reason for refusing and it will be further evidence of guilt. If she says yes, she\'ll have to be properly vetted. Check mate.</p>

            LOL lay down the crack pipe and read my trump thread. We have labeled others pedophiles for much less than what trump has done (insist on sexualizing his 13yo and not shut up about her creamy thighs ever since)

               Oh Don, but trumpmister does play 4D chess can't you see???
               <br/>
               Just look at all the examples.
              </p>
              <p>
               Selling arms to Saudi Arabia~surely he is outsmarting them somehow/I haven't figured out how yet but I'm sure he is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bombing Yemen and the dead seal~again has to be 4D just has to be even if his parents don't see how.  Gosh I loved the devastated widow at the addressing of the congress...now that was some fine 4D don't cha think?  And killing civilians, little children, can't make sense of it myself but I'm not equipped to do so.  I'm not sure why the soldiers killed all the livestock too so the peasants have nothing but these things are too complex for my mind/I even suck at checkers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bombing Syria~that one is easy, he's showing China and Russia who's boss.  Who gives a fuck if it starts a nuke war?  That's way over my head.  Btw, have you seen DaddyOFive?  It's such great fun pranking the kiddies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Chocolate cake while bombing~lots of symbolism there, chocolate, cake~use your imagination (like he does, he's on top of it so much we can't even keep up).
              </p>
              <p>
               Filling his cabinet with bankers, brilliant, who better to straighten out the mess than the ones that created it...duh DonKey, just duh.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are mere peasants so how could we possibly comprehend much less keep up with such a brilliant mind not to mention orator?
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't you know he only talks stupid (Civil War shit) to the masses bc they can't possibly understand him.  He HAS TO speak in our language, bigly, terrific, great bc we simply can't understand complex words or thought processes.
              </p>
              <p>
               LA_Trump calls you a shill and I don't believe that for a minute.  You just don't possess the capabilities to understand such a great man.  Neither do I for that matter but I'm oh so content to let him lead the way.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gotta run now hun...off to wally world to get some chocolate cake (I could never figure out how to bake one myself being a peasant and all).  Cheers~
