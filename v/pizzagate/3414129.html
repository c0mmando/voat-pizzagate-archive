<h1 id="md-surviving-malik-yoba-we-had-sex-when-i-was-just-a-teen.">Surviving Malik Yoba: We had sex, when I was just a teen.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>For all who applaud and solute Malik Yoba for revealing he is so called ‘Trans Attracted’, understand that either because of deeper issues he has or, because of ‘society’ pushing him and others to deep, dark places, his admission to being sexually attracted to Trans women, is bound to open a Pandora’s box for him; not because the women are Trans, But because many of the Trans women he engaged in sexual exploration and exploitation with on 14th Street, Times Square and elsewhere, were minors. Including myself.</p>
<p>I started seeing him personally, with my own two eyes, cruising around the meatpacking district and Village, large black Jeep, looking for Trans fem sex workers, he preferred black trans girls; pretty, slim girls, but would pick up a latinx if she was put together and/or looked mixed.</p>
<p>That was close to 20 years ago, and I can still remember it like yesterday. i also remember the day a friend of mine said, real cool, like she was known to do “.......walk down that block..Just go! He wants You.....”. You always remember celebrity clients. It’s like time slows down. You remember every detail, Blood pounding. He was cute, and polite, don’t get me wrong. But I’m sure he knew what he was doing, was Wrong.....</p>
<p>New York Undercover was still on t.v.. I remember living in group homes and being in institutions, and giggling when he and the actor who played his partner would flash across the t.v. Screen. Most group homes didn’t have cable, so NY Undercover and all the other shows on the basic ny channels were staples. Some of the other kids could tell something was up; I knew they’d never believe my ‘story’ anyway.</p>
<p>NYs Child Sex Abuse law means Malik will have to face the music. Sorry to burst a lot of folks bubbles.</p>
<p>And I don’t give a FUCK who doesn’t believe me or feels I’m trying to ride a wave!</p>
<p>There is a trend of men of color being embraced by the Queer community, for liking Trans women, despite overwhelming evidence of character flaws......glaring signs that sex addiction, substance abuse; unchecked mental health issues and inner demons are what drive men to the bungee jumping of sex; FUCKIN or SUCKIN a Trans person.</p>
<p>That’s not love. Period.</p>
<p>What Malik paid me to do, as a 13 and 16 year old, wasnt love.</p>
<p>His ignoring that I was clearly a child prostitute, wasn’t love.</p>
<p>Paying for cheap thrills and secret orgasms; begging for unsafe, unprotected sex from a runaway Trans teen, while enjoying stardom as a successful artist and business man ....isn’t love.</p>
<p>Where was his LOOOOOOOOVVVVEEE for Trans women over the last 20 years? Where are his Trans girlfriends? Something tells me I’m not the only one who got some dirt on this individual and, something also tells me that he didn’t just up-and-decide to ‘come out’, he was pushed.</p>
<p>Careful not to make a fool of yourself supporting him and his message. I am sure I am not the only trans person who was a minor when Malik Yoba first “loved” them.</p>

            I've never heard of this guy, or any of the shows he's been on. Is he like Will Smith popular, or just popular with the negro community?

             He was in a movie called Cool Runnings about the Olympic Jamaican Bobsled team. Based on a true story. (It was a big deal in the 90a and IIRC was John Candy's last movie.)
