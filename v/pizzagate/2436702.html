            Well, I can't prove or substantiate this, there are a few stories on the internet somewhere corroborating this but like I just said it is few and far between finding anything except a few ghost stories from students who attended this school but there is ONE person that is very vocal about this claim, his name is Macon carrington, and if you don't know him I'm sure you really DON'T want to know him as I tried to befriend him but I'm afraid he is a bit too far gone. He is a rampant drug abuser and frequents prostitution as well as for claiming that he is in the KKK. However, he does have some money,  pedigree and DID attend the prestigious preparatory school on the Potomac St Johns Episcopal.
           </p>
           <p>
            But here is the gist of his story.
           </p>
           <p>
            He claims that Paul Volcker is a High Witch at the Madeira all girls school that sits right on the potomac in virginia very close to St. Johns Episcopal and  down the river from the CIA. He claims that there are HUNDREDS of children's bodies buried on the grounds of the campus, he claims all of their lives were taken in rituals and claims that the Madeira School and St Johns Episcopal is RUN LIKE THE AMERICAN VERSION OF HOGWARTS, Boys are trained at St. Johns in the male skill of witchcraft and the girls are trained at Madeira. He claims that this was told to him as Volcker's daughter and him, who were allegedly dating, walked through the woods of the campus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last time I talked to Mr. Carrington he had been arrested again for threatening POTUS. This dude was SERIOUSLY off his rocker and most likely an Mk trauma victim. I believed his testimony but unfortunately his credibility is shot. This story, however will continue to circulate until I can get more on it.

            , I'm sorry, but I don't see a clear Pizzagate connection here. It doesn't seem to be unusual to me that someone uses 'cp' and puts it before the name of his company as his Twitter handle, when he's called Charles Phillips.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please mention his name in the headline.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll give you an 24 hours 'Edit Warning' flair, please see Rules 1 and 3 in sidebar. Please self-delete (headlines can't be edited), edit and repost. If you shouldn't delete within 24 hours, we will have to do it. Thank you!
