<p>The Swedish Royal Family seem to be incredibly down to earth, and genuinely trying to make the World a better place with their resources. Amazing work from Queen Silvia, also. </p>
<p>Must be EXTREMELY hard for them to address Child Abuse directly because we know how it upsets Elites, but this proves that even up there, people want to end this cancer. This is something to be ashamed as a species... members of our own kind buying, raping, chaining, murdering babies/children.... INCREDIBLY DISGUSTING. </p>
<p>Princess Madeleine seems very genuine... if maybe we could get her to speak about #Pizzagate we could get more credibility. The USA-media will NEVER cover it as it should be done.</p>',
