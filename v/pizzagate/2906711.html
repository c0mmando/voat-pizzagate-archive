<p><em>Jury returns guilty verdict after three days of deliberation</em>**</p>
<p>A jury has found Cdl. George Pell guilty on all counts related to sexually abusing two altar boys.</p>
<p>According to sources who spoke to The Daily Beast, a jury returned a unanimous verdict Tuesday against the Australian cardinal after three days of deliberation. Further details are unavailable as the court has issued a suppression order to Australian media to &quot;prevent a real and substantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.&quot;</p>
<p>A previous trial resulted in a hung jury. </p>
<p>Pell had been accused of molesting two altar boys during a swimming trip in the 1990s, when he was bishop in Ballarat, a town northwest of Melbourne. Pell has vigorously denied the allegations, and his attorney, Robert Richter, said in 2017 that there is &quot;voluminous&quot; evidence to show that &quot;what was alleged is impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>Although multiple accusations were levelled at the cardinal initially, the court threw out most of them.</p>
<p>Pell was named the Vatican\'s Secretariat for the Economy in 2014, making him the third highest-ranking cleric in Rome. He was brought in ostensibly to clean up Vatican finances, exercising oversight over Vatican properties and personnel.</p>
<p>His proposed reforms, however, which included demands for greater transparency, met with resistance. According to Vatican expert Edward Pentin, the &quot;Old Guard&quot; resisted reform out of fears it would reveal their corruption.</p>
<p>Pope Francis restricted Pell\'s powers without notice in a motu proprio he issued in 2016. And a financial audit by the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers was cut short by the Secretary of State after only four months.</p>
<p>One source who spoke with Pentin complained that the reforms were &quot;dead, over, finished, they\'ve been blocked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The corruption continues; it’s just better concealed,&quot; the inside source added, saying Vatican finances had returned to being as bad as they were before Pell\'s reforms, and possibly worse.</p>
<p>Libero Milone, the Vatican\'s auditor general, initially put in place to implement reforms, was fired in 2017, the Vatican accusing him of &quot;spying&quot; on officials. Milone, however, claims it was the other way around: The Vatican was spying on him, and he was fired because he had discovered financial irregularities that threatened Vatican officials.</p>
<p>One week later, Pell left the Vatican, granted permission by Pope Francis to stand trial in Australian court over charges of &quot;historical sexual offenses.&quot;</p>
<p>Some have called out the pope for an apparent double standard: In September he had refused to allow Cdl. Luis Ladaria Ferrer, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to stand trial for allegations of sex abuse cover-up, citing sovereign immunity.</p>

<p>The Vatican’s third-most powerful official has been convicted in Australia on all charges he sexually abused two choir boys there in the late \'90s, according to two sources with knowledge of the case. </p>
<p>A unanimous jury returned its verdict for Cardinal George Pell on Tuesday (Australian time) after more than three days of deliberations, the sources said, in a trial conducted under a gag order by the judge that prevented any details of the trial being made public.</p>
<p>In a book published last year, journalist Louise Milligan reportedly wrote that Pell was accused by two former choir boys of sexual abuse while he was archbishop of Melbourne in the \'90s. The boys sang in the choir at St. Patrick\'s cathedral and were allegedly abused by Pell in a room in the confines of the church. Pell’s office told The Guardian in 2017 he “repeats his vehement and consistent denials of any and all such accusations.”</p>
<p>A second trial known as “the swimmers trial” is due to get underway early next year, according to sources familiar with the case. That trial is expected to hear evidence that Pell “sexually offended” two men when they were boys playing games in a swimming pool in Ballarat, Victoria. At the time of the allegations, which date back to the \'70s when Pell was a priest in the area, according to The Guardian.</p>
<p>Steven Spaner, Australia coordinator from the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) told The Daily Beast he felt frustrated and left “in the dark” following the secrecy surrounding the trial. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to know if there are any shenanigans going on—things the church did that are illegal themselves,” Spaner said. “There is always suspicion when you don’t know what is going on.”</p>
<p>Well I certainly did not expect this result.  Astounding Actually.  I recommend reading the rest of The Daily Best article.  Very good.</p>

             And he will burn.   Jesus wants the Children protected.  These priests and pope and bishops, etc.  Have never been given the authority to lord over us the way they do.  They have carried the whole Catholic Religion to extremes.  We really don't need them.  All we need is our voice and our heart to speak to Jesus.  It's all about us letting go of their control.  We don't need them.  That is the one thing they don't want us to know.

             I wish I was better at coat of arms translation, but this one certainly fits the Gorillion post.. A Milanese, of the family of Viscounts (Visconti), which bears a snake for arms.
The Visconti coat of arms had a large serpent devouring a male child feet first; sources conflict as to whether Gregory X used this for his papal arms. Snake worship came from the Hyrkanians, who came from the sea, to upper Egypt. I believe them to be Phoenician. They succeeded to marry into the royal family and split the empire, culminating in the exile of Amenhotep IV/ Akhenhaton/ Moses to Canaan, which was at the time under Babylonian rule.

            The judge has suppressed details of this, the first, case.  The second case, the swimming pool case (said to be worse than the first) will be heard early next year.

             This was called a Historic Case.  I would imagine there will be a suppression on the swim case as well.  Safely Guarded is what they are.

            We are seeing the beginning of the end of the Catholic Church. Catholics worldwide have been betrayed by those at the top--the pedophiles, the crooks and the corrupt.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to St Malachy's prophecy, the pope after Benedict XVI is to be the final pontiff. Some say that the Pope will run from Rome after the corruption is revealed. This heralds the beginning of "great apostasy" followed by "great tribulation".
           </p>
           <p>
            Many Catholics believe this is when the 'false prophet' will come forward, which according to the book of Revelation leads the world's religious communities into embracing a political leader known as Antichrist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even several Catholic priests see this happening from within the ranks of Catholicism as a result of secret satanic "Illuminati-Masonic" influences. These priests say they know about an multinational power elite and occult hierarchy operating behind supranatural and global political machinations. Among this secret society are sinister false Catholic infiltrators who understand that, as the Roman Catholic Church represents one-sixth of the world's population and over half of all Christians, it is indispensable for controlling future global elements and the fulfillment of a diabolical plan they call "Alta Vendita," which is set to assume control of the papacy and to help the False Prophet deceive the world's faithful (including Catholics) into worshipping Antichrist.

              Supposedly, it's to not prejudice the jury for a future trial next year.  More victims came forward.  I suspect the suppression order is just a way of protecting Pell though.  He was a very powerful figure.

               A gag order is what we call it here.  I fully understand the games they play.  The Church of Jesus Christ who wants us to protect Children at all costs seems to be making them vulnerable at every turn.  The Victims deserve better.

            Holy shit. That's quite a win. He was the Poper's right hand man. Was potentially even in the run for Pope himself iirc.

             Thank God he is out of the running.  I have heard that some want to oust francis.  Hopefully there is an outcry for his resigning.  There has even been talk in the Italy News.

             I have just been reading more articles on Church Militant. Stomach turning.  One man is allowing what is going on in the entire institution though and his bishops and cardinals are following in his footsteps.  They are following the pope's new ways.  They voted him in.  If he is voted out and replaced with a Traditionalist then things will change. Not until then.

            At one time, eons ago, the penalty in the Catholic church for pedophiles was death.
But of course, the Catholic Church has been compromised for hundreds of years now.

             Some things that were old should be new again.  This guy really deserves the noose.  Pope Leo XIII would have dragged him through the streets and Pope Pius XII.

              Good time to invest in rope. Good post. Did you see the Catholic Store shooter in St. Louis recently? He was a defrocked priest... 17 charges...
