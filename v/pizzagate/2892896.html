            TEHRAN – Over a dozen children “abducted from different areas of Pakistan” have been recovered from an LPG container in southeast Iran on Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reports in local media suggest Iranian border authorities foiled a child trafficking bid in the Kerman province and rescued more than 15 children from the container coming from Afghanistan into Iran.
           </p>
           <p>
            The children were abducted from different areas of Pakistan and were being taken to Iran when the Iranian border guards stopped the container, the reports added.
           </p>
           <p>
            A video of the incident went viral on social media after the officials concerned from two neighboring Islamic states were contacted but they have so far refused to comment or confirm the development.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every year, between 30,000 to 40,000 Pakistanis attempt illegal passage to Europe as well as Turkey, Russia, and the Middle Eastern countries through Balochistan and by air, according to officials.

             Thanks for posting the article. When I look at those children I wonder about those that are not rescued. How many will be forced into sex slavery, forced to work for nothing or become militants? Or will they become victims of organ harvesting?  It's just so sad.

              it makes sense.  the aga $han is evil I have read this before.  There is reason to believe he is behind a lot of it.  I remember reading about him last year sometime.  We should post about him and his loundering and other crimes.

             He is a serpent...couod be THE serpent , the dajjal figure , the anti christ...his cult hides in the form of an organisation and is a deep state mechanism to bring about satanism all across the planet...
For canada he is the driving force for the full time indoctrination of children from ages 4 in inaproprtiate sex education..
            </p>
            <p>
             He endorses fraser mustard methods as a cover to program inappropriate sexual topics to 4 and 5 year olds
            </p>
            <p>
             In his speech to the canadian parliament centred on pluralism he endorses fraser mustard at the end ..
            </p>
            <p>
             ..and this is the result of letting this serpent into ur communities.

               We have only one remedy and that is to get out of the piracy game ...and that is through the US treasury avoiding their banking system to support oursleves and serve the public...else we are under the pirate law...of which the constitution is their instrument of guarantee...for our rights..
              </p>
              <p>
               Instead of.depending on the pirate nation to guarantee our rights...we should guaramtee it ourselves by aiding and reducing the US..

              <p>
               ..There is no other way but to get out of Her ..the debt system and her statutute laws..

               There is no law and order...looking at aga khans speech and comparing his words to the reality of hus money laundering offshore companies...hit this fact home..the level of hipocracy ..thqt is encouraged and cheered by the soncalled lawmakers..
We r living inside a cartoon..
We created.the cartoon by lending our votes and credits to the cartoon..
We will not find remedy inside it..the cartoon is controlled by the one who r aware this is a cartoon...it is not controlled by us...whibbelieve this cartoon and its debt administrqtive laws  is life and reality..

              <p>
               We have to learn to get out first..and thenn adrress thebpirates and deep state ..
Trump maybe at the border of these two systems ..debt(ie war)  and peace( no debt) waiting for our instruction to turn around the war ship that is US and head it towards a world of decreasing debt ie.peace..
Till he recives these instructions..he is at the mercy of the ignorant public who out of ignorance of their powrr delegate their credit and voat into a sociopathic debt game and its sociopath agents required by the deep
State..

            Trafficking of Children and adults has not stopped.  I believe it has escalated.  Here is an article from 2014 saying that they were found in shipping containers.  We have researched before that shipping containers are used to transport those that are trafficked.

            Police in the U.K. have launched a homicide investigation after a dead man was found among 35 people who were discovered in a shipping container at Tillbury Docks, Essex, on Saturday. The people in the container, who are now understood to be Sikhs from Afghanistan, are believed to be victims of human trafficking. It's unclear where the victims, including children, were loaded onto the ship on which they were found, but the freighter's last stop before Essex was in Zeebrugge, Belgium. The 34 survivors were all sent to local hospitals to be treated for dehydration and hypothermia, and all but four have since been discharged.

             It likely has escalated. I still think much of pizzagate investigation is allowed and tolerated for the purpose of social stress testing. To see how society reacts. How many become interested enough and involved in trying to expose the crap all governments are part of. Globally, all CPS systems combined are the number one traffickers of children.

              Unfortunately I have to agree with you on CPS  They have a lousy track record.  I think possibly James's mother may have  gotten Children from there.  Just like the Hart Children, some came from Texas through CPS.  People are asleep at the wheel worrying about the Royal Spats and Chopra and Nick.  Barf.

              Here in the USA, the FBI flat out refuses to reply to any and all FOIA requests regarding how many rescued children are from foster care. The numbers are likely around 30%, but the FBI won't give the info to the people making requests.
