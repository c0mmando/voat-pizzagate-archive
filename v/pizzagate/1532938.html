<p>Join Geoff Brady host of In Other News (Mondays 11PM on WBAI) and returning guest Nick Bryant, author of The Franklin Scandal : A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse and Betrayal for a two-hour live interview on stage at the Brooklyn Commons. This production will be broadcast live on air January 2, 2017 from 4-6 PM. We\'ll also take your questions in the second hour of the interview. The massive resources being used to censor, debunk and lie about the information that could lead to evidence of a child-trafficking and abuse network in Washington DC is very telling. Lets examine the potential evidence and take your questions with Nick Bryant who will expound on the background of pedophile networks and related cover ups going up to the highest levels drawn from his 14 years of research.&quot;</p>
<p>Pizzagate talk is around 1 hour into the podcast but listen to the whole thing.

            Rachel Chandler is probably the best/most likely avenue to find potential victims....I know that her social media was archived, maybe start poring through her female associates for blog posts, criminal records, etc? (but definitely NOT contacting them!)  We know that she was the recruiter for Epstein. Remember that sexual abuse victims tend to turn to drugs and risky behavior later in life.

            I am pleased to see my post getting so many upvoats. Yes, Nick does critisise us but its constructive &amp; helpful criticism.  We should take it on board and not throw a hissy fit. Also, he is just being cautious with regards to Podesta. He does not want to get himself in trouble and this is how a journalist should behave.  I will update my original post with the youtube links.

            Since it is being revealed that so many people and organizations are connected to the DNC and pedophilia, I thought I would add this so we can start looking into this guy. I think the mods would delete this if I started a new thread so I'll post it here.

           <p>
            I just finished listening to Nick Bryant. Here's the problem Nick: You can't knock us for our "journalism". We're not journalists! We're only here because of clear evidence a crime has taken place and the MSM is doing NOTHING but try to debunk. Isn't that fishy?
           </p>
           <p>
            There's some really sketchy stuff going on here like Edgar Welch firing a rifle inside Comet Ping Pong and through miracle of fate manages to hit the very same computer that serves up CPP's web site which has a secure page where customers can download files. Have you ever downloaded a Pizza before? No? Me neither.
           </p>
           <p>
            What about the bartender crawling on the floor drenched in blood. Seen any bartenders do that before? No? Me neither.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the sketchy the WikiLeaks emails. For example John Podesta writes to his brother Tony at 3:27 AM on the Tuesday their old friend Dennis Hastert is on trial for child molestation: "This traffic is really warm and weird in the light of Hastert. Boy that's sad."
           </p>
           <p>
            So Nick Bryant please explain why traffic is "warm". The only time I've heard of warm traffic is something like an e-commerce web site reading their email traffic. "This email traffic is really warm and glowing with praise."
           </p>
           <p>
            Does that sound like what John Podesta is writing to his brother about? Email traffic? No? Yeah me either. Any sentence with the words "traffic", "warm" , "[Dennis] Hastert" and references a trial about child molestation is about.......wait for it......Child Trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            UPDATE: Turns out that "traffic" can mean email traffic. But there's still a bunch of stuff that doesn't make sense. I put a bunch of the issues here:

             traffic with heating is spy-craft talk. 
traffic means lots of people going back n forth .. investigating/searching. 
hot means stay away, (Lots of action) 
cold means all clear.  (bring him in from the cold IE your source is safe, meet with him)
so warm would be caution.

              Turns out that "traffic" can mean email traffic. But there's still a bunch of stuff that doesn't make sense. I put a bunch of the issues here:

             I'm listening now, the first hour is about the Franklin Scandal and so far with Pizzagate he's talking about problems and to proceed with caution.  Be careful about naming people not involved.  He seems to think there is something there and it is definitely worth proceeding with.  Need to find victims, which is difficult because they hook them on drugs then dump them onto the streets.  Then they get arrested for crimes and don't make good witnesses... etc.

            We need leaked videos &amp; photos of them in the act, and more emails &amp; whistleblowers. Nothing is going to happen otherwise. No one ever believes victims, just look at Cosby.

             The goal now is to get plausible exposure out as widely as possible, so that when it is exposed people are less likely to dismiss it as a conspiracy.

              I'm talking endgame here, not the next three weeks. No way anyway anyone is going to prison unless there are sextapes the public can see. We live in the era of the kardashians. There is no other way for this to transcend the conspiracy theory stigma. The videos exist.

               Around 2 yrs ago in Roma there was the Baby Prostitutes scandal. One client made a video and used to extort money to one of the girls. The girls were 14, the media never ever used the word pedophilia, only that they were prostitutes. But because the girls lied about the age the trials was only for prostitution related crimes. The mother of one of the girl got 6 yrs for pimpimg. 
One reaon videoing is almost certain is the cost of partecipating to the child sex AND ALSO the complacent voyeurism of the pedophiles. Such as the love of art they all share.
BTW nobody believes a 14 yrs old can be mistaken for a 19 yrs old once in bed. The media and the justice system actually believes it, how clueless.

                 Thanks for the link and story outline. I didn't know about it. It seems like you have to fight pedophilia by fighting it with other angles like calling it tax evasion or prostitution like you mentioned. Accusing pedophilia outright makes people resist and not want to help you. You almost have to do reverse psychology and let them discover the crimes the themselves. Very strange.

             This is kind of off topic but Fiona Barnett is my hero.  Also, after her evidence was reported in some media, the ABC via the Media Watch telly program viciously attacked her.  That in itself was pretty revealing.  The ABC is just a copy in miniature of the paedo-protecting BBC :(

            Why is Nick trying to insinuate Alefantis and Podesta are "weird" but not pedophiles? Seems odd that someone who covered pedophiles in the Franklin Scandal would be skeptical of the the overwhelming evidence against these two.

           <p>
            I can understand if he's trying to say "exploring these avenues is not a good use of time in the investigation" but he almost made it sound like there's nothing there at all. Which is obviously false.

            At the 20:15 mark in the Dec. 26 show, he discusses the upcoming (now just-concluded, if my time-zone fu is strong) visit with Bryant.

           <p>
            This is less important than the actual visit, of course, but I'm including it for the ADD/OCD/completionist crowd.

             I just had a crazy idea. Since we need victims to come forward why not contact them through Washington D.C. escort sites? I believe is best to have those near D.C to contact them because it would be best to keep this as discreet as possible for the victims and investigators safety. It's crazy but it could work.

             This is very true - but also very difficult.  How can we find and get victims to come forward when most of them are too young, too dead, or too scared?  Bryant says it too - 'kill one man, silence a thousand'.
            </p>
            <p>
             So we need people who work with abused kids/teenagers that are also comprehending of this citizen investigation to find those connected to the people uncovered here.  Anyone?

              REPOST AND SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE BECAUSE CIA SHILL MODS ARE DELETING MY GOOD COMMENTS AND POSTS. I KEEP TRYING TO POST PROOF BUT THEY KEEP INSTANTLY DELETING. THIS IS MY THIRD ACCOUNT.

              MSM will be BTFO like Nick Bryant says in his podcast if former law enforcement and victims come forward. They WILL come forward if all of them go TOGETHER  (key on together) on a major platform so everyone will know who they are. ALEX Jones is a big enough platform for these people to be safe because if anything happens to them all hell will break loose. Can we all write to him to put out something on his website that says victims and former law enforcement who know anything please come forward we are doing a week long special on this. THIS WOULD BE A HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE BREAKTHROUGH because the info would be from firsthand witnesses who no longer can be blackmailed because millions watch Alex Jones' channel.

               Oh, yeah! It would be huge. That's what this needs. Legitimacy in terms of cold hard facts. If people heard from professionals that had investigated these pedophile rings, and had direct knowledge, they'd listen. They could then transition into their thoughts on some of the language in the emails and images (the kid with the taped hands, the little baby being held with the caption #chickenlovers, and the Panda Head magazine pics. They could be asked if these are "consistent" with what is known. I don't know about Alex Jones though. I'd really like it to be a more mainstream "news" personality. What about Greta van Susteren? I think I'd rather have someone like that do the interviewing.
