              I'm not a lawyer, but as I understand it, usually only the defendant appeals a sentence. Prosecutors can appeal during the trial, I.e. for permission to submit evidence. But perhaps someone with more legal expertise can weigh in?

            This dates back to the work of Alfred Kinsey of the Kinsey Institute.  The institute was established back in like the 1950's.  Even today Kinsey's work is revered as the most renowned and prestigious studies done on human sexuality....it is the basis for higher education and law making on the subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only problem with Kinsey's work...is it was fraudulent...a Rockefeller sponsored study with skewed data to yield desired findings.  When released, the findings of his studies were shocking; a much higher percentage of people were homosexual and promiscuous than anyone would have ever thought.  Of course the findings were not a reflection of reality at the time, but with the help of media programming...from Klinger on Mash to Milk, to Broken Mountain and so much other influential theater produced and aired in the programming....those fabricated statistics have since come to pass.  News stories too played a part in the transformation of society.
           </p>
           <p>
            It can be seen how those affiliated with the institute took Kinsey's works and went door to door, county by country overturning any laws against the immoral behaviors that were falsely established to be the norm.  Once all laws against it were abolished over a couple of decades of hard work....those same organizations then went after school districts one by one, implementing their agenda into the curriculum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where it really gets weird is Kinsey's studies on sexuality in children.  That aspect of his work is in his books, but not taught until the highest levels of education on the subject.  He gives comprehensive data of children ages 11 months to 12 years reacting to sexual stimulation.  He defines indicators the child experienced orgasm as: screaming and crying, squirming to get away, far away gaze or loss of consciousness...that sort of thing...the man was sick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the years, the public questioned his data, asking where he gathered such detailed data with standardized methodology in testing children...to which eventually the official response from the institute was that an anonymous person dropped the data off to Kinsey's office.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Kinsey Institute still exists today...their studies show that sex with children does not cause harm, bur rather is good for them.  I keep saying this goes way beyond the pizza place and few visible politicians or entertainers involved.

              Yeah, there's a lot more to read on that guy and the history of him and the activities of that institute since. Notice his initial work was sponsored by the Rockefeller's. All that philanthropic work they do.. Regarding those big tax exempt "foundations"....such as the Clinton Foundation, or the Bill and Malinda Gates Foundation. There was an investigation back in the 1950's called the Reece Commission Report. It was shut down same as previous pizzagate related investigations were...all the evidence was sealed away, just in the last few years were pieces of it able to be retrieved through the FOIA. Here's an interview with Norman Dodd before he passed away in the 1980's. He was put in charge of investigating the large non profits for "possible anti American activity".

             I heard about this many years ago in school.  I was astonished about the child part.  I pressed the teacher actually about how was this man not put in jail???  she said well... and proceeded with things didn't work then like they do now BS and the class was diverted to talk of NAZI science and how we benefited from that even though it wasn't good.  That was perhaps my first confrontation with a pedo apologist and I was amazed that such people were walking among us then blending in among those of high standing then...  This has been going on forever apparently, the child abuse.

              Or Crowley an associate of theirs.....why wasn't he arrested, or even investigated when he bragged of raping and killing children, even described the best type to use?  Kinsey's work was made specifically to be the "scientific" authority on the subject....designed to be implemented as it was and to guide society towards those ends...."scientifically".  Perhaps that will help explain Epstein's association and interest in the sciences....also check our Freud, Huxley, Darwin, Copernicus...etc.  The cult has been around a long while...their works are more expansive than most can imagine......might notice that the pole with the two snakes going up it used by our medical industry.....same exact symbol  is on that "baphomet" statue of the devil they worship.  They practice magic.....like having the football players wear pink shoes to help fight cancer...as if there's no cure.  Magic....I mean if the football players are wearing pink to find a cure...then there must not be a cure.  Illusion.  I'm fairly convinced many of the children who die of cancer nowadays would have been fine if they had never gone into the hospital....it was the treatment that killed them...with the threat if they didn't take the treatment they would die...and its not the doctor's fault, for they believe what they were taught in university...its in those universities where a much of that evil lies....universities work hand and hand with the programming and everything else....with very few rebels allowed through those systems.
