            I believe FEMA is the government of the NWO. They destroy the US economy, people riot, FEMA comes to the rescue. The FEMA camps are definitely for dissidents and anyone who oppose them. Pizzagate is just the way the sick higher ups have fun and is also a way to blackmail lower level people. They relate because they are both a part of the Illuminati NWO plan for one world government.

            I hear it's this: "Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types."
