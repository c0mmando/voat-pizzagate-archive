            I feel like anybody who is interested in Max Spiers and Michael Aquino should WATCH THIS VIDEO. This man in the video was assigned to work under Aquino during the Presidio Days....and hes got LOADS of good intel.

           <p>
            Doesnt REALLY start talking about Max till about 50 minutes in, but i would wattch the whole thing anyways
           </p>
           <p>
            Starts out a little slow..a lot of "umms" which kinda annoyed me...but its well worth the watch!
           </p>
           <p>
            Little bit of info i just learned, Max's death was actually a few months before it had been reported by the mainstream media. The reason they decided to inform the world about it on October 16th is becasue that is Michael Aquinos birthday...was kind of a sick little birthday gift

            Been doing alot of reading on Aquino lately, and to my knowledge.. He became interested in nazi practices, and took notice to the way the nazis would use a form of an extreme mind control in concentration camps to create a Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) for specific military and intelligence purposes... Unfortunately, a DID can only be created by exposing a child to EXTREME trauma, whether it be physical, mental...or sexual. So, from my understanding, he was using the Presidio daycare center for these experiments...
           </p>
           <p>
            According to an article in the October 30, 1987 San Francisco Examiner, one of the victims had identified Aquino and his wife as participants in the child rape. According to the victim, the Aquinos had filmed scenes of the child being fondled by Hambright (staff member who was also accused) in a bathtub. The child's description of the house, which was also the headquarters of Aquino's Satanic Temple of Set, was so detailed, that police were able to obtain a search warrant. During the raid, they confiscated 38 videotapes, photo negatives, and other evidence that the home had been the hub of a pedophile ring, operating in and around U.S. military bases.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another article in the October 31, 1987, San Francisco Chronicle, stated that "One Presidio mother close to the probe into widespread molestation at a base day-care center said that young children have reported molestations in bizarre settings that suggest ritual sexual abuse. "From what I have heard, there is a fair number of children who describe being abused in a place other than the child-care center," said the mother, who asked to remain anonymous. "There have been children stuck with needles in various parts of their bodies, and they have reported people in costumes and robes. It all sounds very ritualized." Her descriptions of the incidents were confirmed by other parents."
           </p>
           <p>
            Aquino and his wife were never indicted in the incident. Aquino claimed that he had been in Washington at the time, enrolled in a year-long reserve officers course at the National Defense University, although he did admit that he made frequent visits back to the Bay Area and to his church/home. The public flap over the Hambright indictment did prompt the U.S. Army to transfer Aquino from the Presidio.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im completely blown away right now..they found evidence, plus the witness description of the INSIDE of his house makes it pretty clear that she WAS in his house..
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the military knew that Aquino was involved, and transffered him...protecting him
           </p>
           <p>
            Im beginning to think we are fighting a battle which can not be won
           </p>
           <p>
            I also find it odd that in the late 80's early 90's..there were so many reported Day care sex abuse scandals, that they had to make make up a fake Hysteria called "Day-care sex-abuse hysteria", i kid you not...it was apparently "a moral panic that occurred primarily in the 1980s and early 1990s featuring charges against day-care providers of several forms of child abuse, including Satanic ritual abuse." In the wikipedia article there is no mention of the presidio scandal....Would be a good way to discredit the accusations..."oh theyve got day care sex abuse hysteria!" ..
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also it should be noted that In Max's final interview he said that their were tunnels under presidio that connected to other schools in the area...Seems to be a very common ploy in these operations

             I've read the first part but don't remember Max saying that the tunnels connected to schools! That is so scary! It makes me so mad that these people got away with this and also the perverts from The Franklin case. Powerful people are above the law!

            To me, anything involving research into UFOs or aliens, has controlled opposition written all over it. But why? Well, above all, I'm sure we are part of a big public ritual. The elites WANT us to find out about their real crimes, and to rebel violently. The result is that they have a pretext to bring in their One World Order. But they want to guide the storyline as it happens, in real-time, so they can provide closely-tailored 'solutions' with altenative figureheads they also control. This Spiers story looks like an attempt to do that.

            Or, it could simply be the Daily Mail discouraging conspiracy research, since the English aristocracy itself is implicated in crimes revealed by PizzaGate.

            Watching his final interview again, and he talks about Aquino alot...Mentions that Aquino and others had tunnels running under Presidio day care center, that connected to other schools (sound familiar?)...Also says that Aquino is still doing these atrocities...
Video is very interesting, its like hes under some psychic attack, especially whenever he talks about aquino, and other sensitive material..

            Michael Aquino is a central figure in all of this.  He was high-ranking lieutenant colonel in the military psyops, and a known Satanist caught up in a pedophile ring never charged!! left the Satan worshipping facility he was at and started his own satanic religion... his Doctrine and Dogma sound much like some of these other Elite affluent people "my will be done",  "do what you will", "no flaws" xcetera very Aleister Crowley...man is all-powerful God is nothing kind of stuff.
 here is a link to one of the pages on the websites of the Satanist religion he started  do notice  where  these different  sects are located. Be sure to click on every hyperlink and read and listen to everything  I had no idea how  big Satanism was.

             I watched the video and have been reading and even went to his Satanic temple website looking thru all of this and I'm not even done yet. This is sick! He's the one responsible for Cathy Obrien and the little newspaper boy. A sound proof room in his house and all of the other evidence and kids testimonies didn't even get him thrown in jail. It makes sense how more and more people started becoming satanists during that time. This is the type of people we are dealing with when it comes to pizzagate. We can't ever give up or move on. This has happened for years and these sicko's just keep getting away with it. Hackers and Wikileaks are great tools to finally catch these sick sons of bitches.

            Fascinating interview here with Paul Bonacci..I recommend watching the whole thing. But he starts talking about Michael Aquino around the 23 minute mark.

             Wow.. I swear he said Aquino wanted to usher in the anti christ...and the US government was aware of this. He was after all a lieutenant colonel and A known practicing Satanist I'm very curious why the US Army would be allowing followers of Satan in positions of control.

              I feel like anybody who is interested in Max Spiers and Michael Aquino should WATCH THIS VIDEO. This man in the video was assigned to work under Aquino during the Presidio Days....and hes got LOADS of good intel.

             <p>
              Doesnt REALLY start talking about Max till about 50 minutes in, but i would wattch the whole thing anyways
             </p>
             <p>
              Starts out a little slow..a lot of "umms" which kinda annoyed me...but its well worth the watch!
             </p>
             <p>
              Little bit of info i just learned, Max's death was actually a few months before it had been reported by the mainstream media. The reason they decided to inform the world about it on October 16th is becasue that is Michael Aquinos birthday...was kind of a sick little birthday gift

            Thank you for bring this up, I posted this in another thread, but I feel it fits here also. As it concerns Max Spiers, and the man I (and others) believe is somehow responsible for his death. Michael Aquino...the most evil fucking man on the planet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hey, just wondering if you read my other post or not? Unfortunately i havent got time to look over all of your info yet because theres just so much there, going bit by bit... But as soon as i saw Michael Aquinos name..i thought to myself, wow..this guy again. I just keep hearing his name getting brought up all over the place from so many different cases. My first introduction to him was through Max Spiers interviews, he mentions him a few times as Max was a "conspiracy theorist" who claimed to be grooomed as a child to be a psyop "superwarrior". Im not completely sure how, but Aquino was involved (havent watched enough of max's video). Michael Aquino is a Psychological Operations Officer who was apart of the MK Ultra project...but his claims are that "it never really went anywhere" (we all know thats false). Now, a few months ago Max was planning on uncovering some dirt on Aquino and others involved in Satanic Pedophile rings in the US military. He was going to be talking about it at his upcoming speech, but he never made it, he was found dead in his apartment under very SUSPICIOUS circumstances. It was later found out that he texted his mother a few days before his death saying, "if anything happens to me, INVESTIGATE".....I have my suspicions Aquino was involved in his death somehow, as do many others.
Second time i happened upon Aquino, was his involvement in the Presidio Day Care Centre scandal back in the 80's..good read on it here (

             http://www.whale.to/b/aq2.html
            </a>
            ) Here are a couple good videos with plenty of info and dirt on him...there is also plenty more out there

            (HEAVY video, names people involved in the ritualistic murder of Kevin Collins..look into THIS)
           </p>
           <p>
            The gentleman in the above video mentions Paul Bonacci and David shurter, as being witnesses to the murder..well last night i googled "Max Spiers Michael Aquino", and got a link to a video of Max Spiers mother, interviewed by non other than David Shurter... Here is the video (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mre8R2F91AM&amp;t=2831sYouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mre8R2F91AM&amp;t=2831sYouTube
            </a>
            ) they mention Aquino quite a bit in the video, as they TOO, suspect Aquino was involved with Max's death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scary how deep these roots go, and i gotta admit, it is a little frightening typing this out. But the more people who are speaking out against these people, the less chance we have of getting shut up.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, speak up!

            The whole "programming" thing MKUltra etc has always seemed so bizarre to me. While I know that these things are real, it just seems like for some reason my mind wants to disbelieve it. It's real weird. Anyways, I was watching a video of Cathy O'Brien last night, and at one point she was talking about how the programming has become way more complex in recent years. I really don't know what to believe anymore- but at one point she was talking about her daughter, and after that guy (can't remember his name) rescued her and her daughter, her daughter had to be taken to the ICU shortly after she was beginning to become "deprogrammed", because she went into respiratory failure. She said that it was a new technique they had started to use- that if/when some of the people they had programmed began to deprogram/remember things, then something in their brain would get set off and make them very sick/die. I didn't think too much of that (because it just seemed so out there), but a few hours ago I just stumbled upon a message that Max Spiers had left on SuperSoldierForum. He was talking about how he was beginning to remember things from his past and put 2 and 2 together (the message was from 2014). I know it seems- at least to me- very far-fetched, but given everything that has come to light recently, do you think there is any connection between what happened to him and what Cathy O'Brien was saying about her daughter's programming? I feel like the ultimate conspiracy theorist right now for even thinking there may be a connection- but after finding all this stuff out- like I said, I don't know what's real anymore. Anyways, here is the link if you guys want to read it.

            Stay vigilant and know how to kill.  Keep a firearm handy and don't be afraid to use it.  Act like somebody is trying to kill you even if they aren't.

            I've done my homework. If anyone wants to read a simple layperson's book on this I strongly suggest Orphan Conspiracies that follows the progression of Operation Paperclip into the programs the US developed out of it.

            Please do not confuse the "scary" occult symbolism that is used precisely because it is "scary" as part of the pain/pleasure/fear response.
           </p>
           <p>
            While there is little doubt there are people who practice vile occult rituals in the false belief it makes them powerful, that is not why such things are used in mind control. They are used BECAUSE they are "scary" and we are taught to be afraid of them. It's the same thing as a parent telling a child not to go into the woods alone because the big bad wolf will eat them.

             Seems like I remember reading on T_D that Jeffrey Epstein's dad was a psychologist that may have been involved with the military prior to MK Ultra?

             The Nazi occult stuff kinda fascinates me from the standpoint of wanting to know what they found regarding hidden ancient technology.  Vimana's?  What exactly was the bell and did it go operational?

              You might enjoy reading Tom DeLong's book SeKrit Machines. DeLong is in the Podesta emails. I wouldn't doubt the mind control link...another great book for the layman that really makes the mind control programs and evolution of such easy to follow is Orphan Conspiracies. It all started with Operation Paperclip.
