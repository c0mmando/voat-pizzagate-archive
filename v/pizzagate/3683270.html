<blockquote>
<p>How child sexual abuse became a family business in the Philippines </p>
<p>Tens of thousands of children believed to be victims of live-streaming abuse, some of it being carried out by their own parents</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/4ukBZ">http://archive.is/4ukBZ</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is such a sad story. Such a poor family needing money,” said Hopkins. “Mum was educated to grade one. This is the irony of it – the mother was just as vulnerable. The eldest daughter had a higher level of education.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of other cases where the elder kids had very much been part of it. They need psychological support to know that it is wrong.”</p>
<p>While no blame can ever be attributed to children in these cases, the Philippines is struggling to understand how to punish crimes where the victims are deeply entangled in their own abuse, especially if parents are putting pressure on them to find an income.</p>
<p>“It was the first time we heard of parents using their children,” said the middle-aged woman.</p>
<p>Authorities considered that operation in 2011 to be a one-off case. But the next month, another family was caught in the same area. Then more cases of live-streaming child abuse appeared in different parts of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Now, the United Nations says, there are tens of thousands of children believed to be involved in a rapidly expanding local child abuse industry already worth US$1bn.</p>
<p>In some areas, entire communities live off the business, abetted by increasing internet speeds, advancing cameraphone technology, and growing ease of money transfers across borders.</p>
<p>And while perpetrators used to download photos and videos to their hard drives – providing authorities with a virtual paper trail and usable evidence – criminals have found anonymity in encrypted live-streaming programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Stephanie McCourt, the south-east Asia liaison officer for the UK’s National Crime Agency, said the Philippines provided a perfect storm to allow the crime to develop, with its entrenched poverty and high level of internet access for a developing country. But there is one thing that she said was absolutely key: a widespread knowledge of the English language.</p>
<p>“They can communicate with offenders. After we’d been scratching our heads, the penny dropped,” she said. “That’s not to say that it won’t move to other countries … There is probably a huge amount we don’t know.”</p>
<p>It is hard to estimate the size of an industry involving small anonymous payments, roughly $5-$200 a show, conducted in people’s homes and mostly operated by families rather than large crime syndicates.</p>
<p>“We think that what we are seeing, what we are dealing with, is a small part of what is out there,” she said. “It is big money. Big business.”</p>
<p>Children are made to perform around the clock, with morning live-streams catering to Europeans and Americans, and later in the day, an Australian-based clientele.</p>
<p>The number of ongoing live-streaming criminal cases in the Philippines is rising, from 57 in 2013, growing to 89 in 2014, and up to 167 in 2015.</p>
<p>But those numbers belie the true scale, according to Det Supt Paul Hopkins, the head of the Australian Federal Police team in Manila who has spent the past two years investigating the crime. Wearing a short-sleeved, Filipino-style shirt, he described the size of the trade as “monstrous”.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>That is not to say the perpetrators are only based there. The Dutch NGO Terre des Hommes analysed the industry by constructing a virtual 10-year-old Filipino girl called “Sweetie” and used the computer model to entrap more than 1,000 adults who paid for her to perform sex acts. The charity identified adults from more than 71 countries seeking out Sweetie’s services.</p>
<p>“If you do any research you’ll see it is from anywhere,” Hopkins said.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>In the 2011 case, the police thought the children would welcome the operation. But the undercover agent says Nicole did not feel rescued; she felt betrayed.</p>
<p>“I know that she is angry with me,” the woman said.</p>
<p>Apart from the scene witnessed as the raid took place, police say they had a video showing the mother sexually abusing her children. It was submitted by an anonymous source from a western country who used his phone to film the abuse on his computer screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“It was a struggle for the children to try to understand what their parents did,” said the social worker, sitting in the house where they live. “When one would start crying, the other children would collectively cry. They always converged in a small huddle.”</p>
<p>Directly after the arrest, the eldest boy, 16 at the time, did appear to be in shock, the psychologist Rosemarie Gonato said, but not from the abuse. “He was quite traumatized by the rescue operation.”</p>
<p>The two younger daughters had no idea that the abuse was anything but normal. “They said it was a business in the neighbourhood. It seemed natural to be involved in this as the other children were doing it,” she said. Police found that it was the children who first heard about live-streaming as a money maker when playing with their friends.</p>
<p>While the children have flourished – on the wall are photos of them, the two eldest beaming while wearing graduation hats and gowns – they are still unable, five years later, to understand the crime.</p>
<p>One child, now 14, told the Guardian her parents wanted the best for them. “I’d like to stay here and finish my course. Then I’d like to go home,” she said.</p>
<p>Gonato said: “In all the sessions I had [with the children], they still wanted their parents to get out of jail.” A couple of years after the raid, the children wrote a letter to Gonato, which read: “We hope you find the ability to forgive our parents.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Victims entangled in own abuse</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, there are questions about whether a parental conviction is the best outcome for the victims. Both Gonato and the paediatrician who treated the children, Naomi Navarro-Poca, believe it is in the children’s interests to be reunited with their parents and live at home rather than in a shelter.</p>
<p>Even the prosecutor, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity to protect the identities of the children, said she was hoping for a plea bargain to get a reduced sentence.</p>
<p>Several factors about the crime did not make sense. For one, the parents are unable to speak the level of English needed to communicate with perpetrators abroad, even though they are considered to be the instigators of the crimes.</p>
<p>And in therapy sessions, the eldest boy said their lives had changed for the better since they started the “shows”: the family had more money, they could eat at the local fast food chain Jollibee, and their mother could stop working in a factory.</p>
<p>Slowly, what had happened became apparent. “They saw the neighbors making money. They suggested it to their parents,” the prosecutor said. And at 13, it was Nicole who spoke to the pedophiles online, not her mother.</p>
<p>There were even times when the children did it without their parents present, the prosecutor said.</p>

            Online Sexual Child Abuse in the Philippines is a Billion Dollar Family Business
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A British man who paid to watch abducted Filipino children be drugged and raped online has been sentenced to 21 years in prison.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to police, Alan Porter – who has visited the Philippines for 30 years – had also arranged to rape street children during future trips to the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to police, he was even found with a suitcase full of chocolate bars, ready to entice children on his next visit.
            </p>
            <p>
             About 170 people have been arrested in the Philippines for the online abuse of children since the beginning of September.
            </p>
            <p>
             These arrests have led to the filing of human trafficking charges against the suspects and the conviction of at least 46 traffickers, the International Justice Mission (IJM) said in a statement today (Friday, October 12).
            </p>
            <p>
             The IJM, an organisation that campaigns against the online sexual exploitation of children, commended the efforts of Cebu Vice Governor Agnes Magpale and the Department of Justice (DOJ).
            </p>
            <p>
             As we reported earlier this month, both Magpale and the DOJ were instrumental in bringing a couple from Cordova town, Cebu, to justice for exploiting their own children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The court was told how the couple forced their six children to undress and pose naked in front of a web camera. Overseas ‘clients’ would pay from 1,000 to 5,000 pesos for each ‘show’.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sexual abuse of children has become a depraved family business.
            </p>
            <p>
             Big money. Big business. An industry worth US$1bn. And that is from 2016. The problem has continued to expand so that the Philippines has been declared by UNICEF as the number one global hub for online child pornography.

            I have a couple of questions. 1) If these families are so poor they have to pimp their kids, how can they afford the tech to do this? 2) Who provided the high speed internet they're using? How can they afford to pay for it?

             Facebook partners with DICT for High-speed Internet
            </p>
            <p>
             Duterte Government partners with Facebook for High Speed Broadband Infrastructure The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) and Facebook have signed a Landing Party Agreement (LPA) that will build an ultra high speed information highway that will greatly improve the speed, affordability and accessibility of broadband internet throughout the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             The system is expected to be on line at the end of 2019 and will provide speeds comparable to that of Singapore, Japan and South Korea.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the agreement, Facebook will construct, develop, operate, maintain and secure the submarine cable system, originating from the United States, crossing the Pacific Ocean to Luzon and then onwards to Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
             DICT, on the other hand will operate and maintain the facility and bring the bandwidth to the last mile. Finally, BCDA will build the Luzon Bypass Infrastructure (LBI) that will consist of two cable landing stations, an approximately 250-km cable network corridor connecting the two IT facilities, and four signal repeater stations along the cable network corridor. The LBI will leverage the geographical advantage of the Philippines by providing a terrestrial bypass route to international submarine cable owners.
            </p>
            <p>
             In exchange for the using the LBI, Facebook will provide the Philippine government 2 million MBPS which is almost equivalent to the total bandwidth of the 2 major telecommunications companies combined.

             Ultra High Speed Internet Connectivity
            </p>
            <p>
             This new broadband infrastructure will position the Philippines as the next information and connectivity hub of the Asia by vastly improving internet speed, which at present is one of the slowest and most expensive in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             In exchange for the usage of the LBI’s terminal station and terrestrial facilities, the cost of internet connectivity will be drastically lowered—reducing government spending from $100/Mbps to $1/Mbps, while assuring fast internet connectivity and better penetration throughout the country. Among the areas that stand to benefit greatly from this is Clark and New Clark City, properties under the stewardship of BCDA.
            </p>
            <p>
             New Clark City (NCC) will be the country's first smart, green and disaster-resilient metropolis that will be is envisioned to be one of the most liveable cities in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
             Faster and cheaper internet is among the bold solutions being pushed by the Duterte government as part of the 0+10-point agenda of the President, which details priority programs to alleviate poverty, spur inclusive growth and development, and create jobs throughout the country.

                In developing and impoverished areas, most individuals cannot afford the cost of the Internet. According to the World Economic Forum, only 20.7 percent of Africa’s population use the Internet, compared to 77.6 percent of Europe’s population.

               <p>
                The Head of Africa for the World Economic Forum, Elsie Kanza, discussed the way in which technological advancement could help bring “vast improvements in the way the region governs, feeds, lives, educates, trades and interacts with itself.”

               <p>
                On a recent “Intersections” podcast, the Brookings Institute recently discussed the issue of poverty and internet access. Laurence Chandy, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, stated, “Digital technology is changing what it means to be poor because it’s bringing poor people out of the margins.”
               </p>
               <p>
                With projects such as Internet.org and Project Loon, tech giants such as Google and Facebook have begun to tackle the goal of creating widespread internet access for reducing global poverty.

            Parents are often the abusers in the west as well. Poor kids are doubly damaged.
