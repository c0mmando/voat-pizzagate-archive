   If the media is going to frame these arrests as a "coup" by Trump, they're obviously retarded: Trump is the president of the fucking United States of America.

            SO TRUE. CNN &amp; MSNBC etc are building Trump up to be the return of hilter and that any arrests will be him being vindictive. Trump is being painted as erratic and mentally ill. Obviously if there are arrests of sitting senators (many here are hoping for this) this has coup-ish or junta elements about it, especially if the senators are only dems, Being that the dems numbers are so low, there is really no strategic need to remove any of them, they have no power at all as it stands. The inauguration was so heavily focused on the concept of peaceful transfer of power, its as if they (MSM) forgot (more likely they still in shock of having lost) that an election happened. If you assume that the media is essentially cia and banking interests who is used to staying in power despite elections, to them a coup has happened. I don't know if its normal for all new presidents, but Trump's first thing, going down to CIA on a saturday was interesting.

            One one hand it is semantic use of the word coup, but it is also the overthrow of "deep/shadow" gov. power which for the media branch of that, is indeed a coup. My concern is that "they" will start claiming that child sex charges are baseless and used when no real evidence is had, as sort of 'go to" smear charges, and reassert the russia hacking crap, only this time, russia planted CP evidence.  I don't know, I guess if I were Hillary and Podesta, I would rather be brought up on child porn which you can claim is a smear job rather than funding ISIS (treason) of which there is clear admission in her own words.

           <p>
            Either way, the media making such a frenetic attempt to paint Trump into a crazy monster just shows to me how afraid of him they really are. And yes for them to call it a coup is both retarded but reveals that "they" aren't used to the presidency having power.

            agreed, saw the discussion earlier and thought to myself..
           </p>
           <p>
            how can it be a coup on private citizens?  (clintons, podesta etc)
           </p>
           <p>
            a coup is when a government or leader is overthrown
