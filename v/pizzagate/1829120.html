            In Kuhn’s deferred sentencing agreement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Rosen signed off on dismissing Kuhn’s charges should Kuhn apologize to Deploraball organizers, and do 48 hours of community service. Kuhn’s “community service,” according to court documents, is being done at Grassroots D.C., an alternative media outlet, to which Kuhn has long been a contributor, dedicated to fighting social justice causes like gentrification and the deportation of illegal immigrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to nonprofit filings obtained by GotNews, Grassroots D.C. is in part funded by the “charity” Alliance for Global Justice, or AFGJ. As we reported Thursday, AFGJ is a financial front for revolutionary communist street terrorists.

NAMBLA supporting BAMN(By Any Means Necessary)and her offshoot, Antifa, who's Pizzagate terrorists and self professed pedophile Luke Kuhn, and Scott Green, were filmed by Project Veritas planning terrorist activity inside James Alefantis' Comet Ping Pong and Pizza in Washington DC.

            There's a similar modus operandi between how these organizations recruit marginally intelligent far left leaning members using cult techniques such as otrasizing parents and making members financially dependent on the organization, there are also reports that female members are encouraged to participate in what looks eerily similar to David Berg's 'flirty fishing'.

             Gloria Jarecki
            </strong>
            , the wife of physician and investment mogul Henry Jarecki. The Jareckis are so far into the global 1 percent they actually

            If someone ever decided to make a documentary entitled “Capturing the Jareckis,” the family in question would look a lot more like a 1970s version of J. D. Salinger’s Glass family than the Friedmans. It would feature a brainy group of serial overachievers, a commitment to film and social justice and a politically engaged soundtrack by Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aside from disparate documentary urges, an upbringing in expensive suburbs and several male offspring, there is very little overlap between the Friedmans, the dysfunctional Great Neck, N.Y., family whose sex abuse case provided the basis for Andrew Jarecki’s Oscar-nominated documentary,
            <strong>
             “Capturing the Friedmans
            </strong>
            ,” and Mr. Jarecki’s family, which includes high-powered parents and two other accomplished filmmaking siblings.

            Production[edit]
           </p>
           <p>
            Jarecki initially was making a short film,
            <strong>
             Just a Clown
            </strong>
            , which he completed, about children's birthday party entertainers in New York, including the popular clown David Friedman ("Silly Billy"). During his research, Jarecki learned that David Friedman's brother, Jesse, and his father, Arnold, had pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, and the family had an archive of home movies. Jarecki interviewed some of the children involved and ended up making a film focusing on the Friedmans.[3]
           </p>
           <p>
            Synopsis[edit]
           </p>
           <p>
            The investigation into Arnold Friedman's life started after the U.S. Postal Service in 1987 intercepted a magazine of child pornography received from the Netherlands. In searching his Great Neck, New York home, investigators found a collection of child pornography. After learning that Friedman taught children computer classes from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students.

             In one of the few negative reviews, Los Angeles Times writer Kenneth Turan wrote a critique of both the film and Jarecki, stating, "Jarecki's pose of impartiality gets especially troublesome for audiences when it enables him to evade responsibility for dealing with the complexities of his material."[12]
            </p>
            <p>
             Criticism intensified as Jarecki's role in deliberately choosing not to pursue his firm belief in the Friedmans' innocence became publicly known. In his review, Ebert had recounted Jarecki's statement at the Sundance Film Festival that he did not know whether Arnold and Jesse Friedman were guilty of child molestation. Ebert roundly praised Jarecki for communicating this ambiguity.[11]
             <strong>
              It has since emerged that Jarecki funded Jesse Friedman's appeal
             </strong>
             .[13] Writing for The Village Voice, Debbie Nathan – who was hired by Jarecki as a consultant after having been interviewed for the film – wrote of Jarecki, "Polling viewers at Sundance in January, he was struck by how they were split over Arnold and Jesse's guilt. Since then, he's crafted a marketing strategy based on ambiguity, and during Q&amp;As and interviews, he has studiously avoided taking a stand

             80 others
            </strong>
            that “agree with the AFGJ vision”—to whom AFGJ can offer tax assistance, donation collection and processing, payroll services, and group health and liability insurance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nonprofit filings unearthed in a GotNews investigation reveal various elite figures funneling the largest amounts of unrestricted money to AFGB, and then effectively to Refuse Fascism, an antifa terrorist group whose initiator, Carl Dix, is an open member of the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). RCP members helped start leftist organization World Can’t Wait, one of the biggest, and longest-time, recipients of AFGB monies.

            Great post! Solid investigative work. And, yes, it's always the same MO. Let's start putting together the template that's being used to expose these frauds for what they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish I could find the article I found a few years back. It was about the dems and the plan to use minority groups. It was a rabid liberal then and foaming at the mouth, but that article I believed ... even through the brainwashing. I've tried everything and no can find. It's been scrubbed. I will keep looking, but there's no way that they'd let that stay ... not when they're this far along.

             She's a Professor of Psychology at Colombia and expert on adolescent thinking - interesting if they're targeting this age group in their 'recruitment'. Is it not a bit inappropriate for an educator to be linked with a group promoting violence? But then I guess Falarca is a middle school teacher 😳

              I spent a couple hours digging, and you are onto something. Those bozos in AZ (redneck revolt, John brown gun club, something like that)are linked to Brown Shirts, Black Panthers, and a number of their posts were liked by members of CAIR (Muslim brotherhood). Same idiotic ideology (xenophobia yada yada) as Soros sponsored bullshit groups. I'm continuing digging and will get my findings more organized. Great work on your part and look forward to more.
