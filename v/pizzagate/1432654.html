<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackOps/comments/4fs7a8/question_why_would_there_be_30ish_wifi_networks/">https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackOps/comments/4fs7a8/question_why_would_there_be_30ish_wifi_networks/</a>

<p>I\'m interested in this because what he found did seem strange, although I apologise if this eventually ends up not being linked to Pizzagate. Don\'t want to sound concerned but OP of the blackops post hasn\'t posted for 2 months after he posted &quot;I\'m in a pretty good spot. They won\'t get me easily.&quot;, although he did say it was a throwaway account, he did use it for 5 months.</p>
<p>Firstly, someone with a device that has their mac address on the networks can remotely view the area without going inside. 30 means that there are at least 30 cameras inside or 30 camera nodes. Kiddy Camstudio maybe? Possible underground server farm or meshnet too.</p>
<p>Pictures of the property: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/v5PBg">https://imgur.com/a/v5PBg</a> (sorry it’s on imgur)</p>
<p>One of his comments was &quot;I\'ve also recently connected my old boss to Ebay accounts [CheesyBay] selling &quot;faulty hard drives&quot; and &quot;faulty&quot; electronics for strange prices. The buyer feedback is very bizarrely enthusiastic and there are lots of disturbing mentions of &quot;very happy kids&quot; and &quot;no fakes&quot;
I think i stumbled on a possible human trafficking and child p*** ring.&quot;</p>
<p>If you look at what he replied further down, it seems that there are huge caverns below his old property which was actually built together with his boss. Funny thing is, the entire neighborhood is on a lease hold by the same person, not sure who. His boss was also running a fishy Ebay business (<a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/cheesybay">http://www.ebay.com/usr/cheesybay)</a>) selling faulty hardware for high prices, and receiving stunning reviews. Side note: Around 30 out of 47 reviews were made by the same person (<a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/bargainhuntersapplyhere">http://www.ebay.com/usr/bargainhuntersapplyhere)</a>), having 1000+ reviews but i could only see them selling a single product.</p>
<p>CheesyBay account linked to a man using two different aliases. Dave Flintstone and Bif Skipman. Social media profiles make it very obvious these are both the same person. Dave Flintstone apparently sells wine in Hawaii.
Hacked email from daveflinstone@gmail.com highly suspicious for human trafficking.
Another email correspondence between Flintstone and booking agent for Washington D.C. pizza parlor discusses &quot;providing reference&quot; for Clinton Foundation board member.
TL;DR Mystery shack in Hawaii may be an underground pedophile bunker being used by members of the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>On 4chan (Here\'s the archived post: <a href="https://archive.fo/Wm8C2">https://archive.fo/Wm8C2</a> ), there are some interesting comments, more recent and mentioning Pizzagate too. I\'ll include the snippets directly relating to Hawaii.</p>
<p>Anons referencing Wikileaks:
Someone said something about &quot;mickey mouse&quot;...
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6534">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6534</a>
&quot;Belay my last. Now I\'m sitting at my desk eating an Afghan knock-off &gt;&gt; Dove ice cream bar.&quot;
&quot;Are they good? The Mickey mouse ice cream bars were excellent. Our crowd &gt; ate very many of them.&quot;
...ice cream = white kids? Kidnapped from fucking DISNEYLAND maybe?? That\'s why they\'re harder to get than other races they can get from Hawaii etc?
I don\'t know if it connects to an email where they are talking about a &quot;hotdog stand&quot; in Hawaii.
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231</a>
The next three months are going to be rougher internally than in Beijing. Between 7th and 1600, no fun. Hope you\'re doing ok. I\'m dreaming about your hotdog stand in Hawaii…</p>
<p>“Trumps\' joke at the roast was &quot;Hillary believes it takes a village...like in Hawaii where she\'s taken many of them.&quot; ” (What if he meant it literally, Trump goes to elite parties, and said he doesn’t drink. He may have heard some things being said offhandedly, but he can’t say it or people will think he’s just trying to put Hillary in a worse light.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure what this comment was, but an anon posted a 32x32 image, claimed it was connected to the “hotdog stand”, with some code in it, and you have to take out all the punctuation and read down the 4th line. Not sure what he meant by that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once again, I\'m not sure how relevant this is to the Pizzagate case, but it may be somewhat connected to shady operations.</p>

            Oh man, when I watched this speech, without knowledge of pizzagate, I was curious why both guys, left and right to Trump reacted so strange. I played this moment two to three times back and forth analyzing these nervous tells. Now, I know.

            The left guys reaction, with this fast movement and eye contact with somebody, stays in contrast to his otherwise thinking-before-moving attitude. The right guy, puts his tongue into his cheek, keeping somekind of pokerface.
