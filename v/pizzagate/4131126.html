<p>Heir John Gilbert Getty, a rock musician age 52, was found dead in a hotel a couple of days ago according to <a href="https://archive.vn/wip/mYfwP">TMZ</a> and <a href="https://archive.vn/wip/E0dMY">Heavy</a>.

<p>His mother, Ann, dropped dead of a heart attack in September at age 79, and his brother died from meth in 2015:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2015, Getty’s older brother Andrew died at age 47. He was found unconscious on a floor near the bathroom of his Hollywood Hills mansion, according to TMZ. The outlet initially reported that when paramedics arrived, Andrew Getty was naked from the waist down and bleeding from “traumatic injury to the rectal area.” TMZ reported that police “initially believed Getty died under suspicious circumstances” but that he had been “having severe stomach problems” for months.</p>
<p>His autopsy report later revealed that he had a toxic level of methamphetamine in his body, according to the New York Post, and his cause of death stemmed from an ulcer-related hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Getty’s mother Ann, who was a well-known philanthropist in San Francisco, died after suffering a heart attack in September 2020, as reported by NBC Bay Area. She was 79.</p>
