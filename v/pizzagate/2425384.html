            Please understand that the aethstetic of satan and pizzagate and the NWO is attractive and an effective marketing tool. Im not saying whether or not anything nefarious is going on with these people, but its unlikely. Submissions such as this need a post like mine for people who wander in here and think we go all in on everything. We dont.
