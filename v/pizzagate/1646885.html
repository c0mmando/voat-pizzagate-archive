            This. So much. Jailbait / statutory rape is not pizzagate material. Shills were out in full force yesterday tho for something.

            To claim that any/all of the busts that we have been informed of so far are NOT related to Pizzagate is absurd. **What do you people need? A pedophile actually eating pizza while he/she traffics kids across state lines? **
           </p>
           <p>
            The same people who are breaking up these rings are also investigating Pizzagate. The more the public hears about these kinds of arrests, the more accepting they will be to the truth when it comes out.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's been the real problem with internet sleuthing...unless it fits into your paradigm, you reject it as irrelevant. That's not how investigating works, and it's not how this operation will be run. Pizzagate will take another year or so of gathering EVIDENCE before the real masterminds are hung from the gallows...Be patient and gather all the facts!

            One thing pizzagate has shown me is that child prostitution is being swept under the rug by our society. When was the last time the media really paid attention to it? It's like there's no real victims, but just the perpetrators, or it's all "theoretical." The media always wants us to feel bad for this or that group, but these children seem to be forgotten. Bringing up these arrests is important for us to remind ourselves that this is really going on, since the media really doesn't cover it. And I also think we are getting info from these stories that likely does relate to pedophilia by elites. Some of the same human traffickers might be involved, for instance.

            Why is no one mentioning Sandusky's wife?  Apparently, child rape victims testified that she was present and had to hear them screaming (small house, on the other side of door)....  Now the kid is busted, but no one is going after the wife???  My boss brought this up today.  Says she needs to be made a lesson of to send a message.

            I agree.  Last month was Human Trafficking Month or some such BS.  All of these stings were done for PR, publicity, fund-raising... Over 95% involved adult johns with adult prostitutes.  It seems that a hooker and a pimp has been redefined as human-trafficking. It's complete BS.  I'm completely against human trafficking and child rape, but they're trying to water down the definition to make it seem like they're doing something.

            I am extremely happy to see other people here that understand and agree with this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish I could mod this forum and remove or group the bullshit arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's literally TV shows about these stings. It's always happened, and always will. They are just pimps, that's all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Haiti one was real, legit human trafficking. That's what needs exposure.
           </p>
           <p>
            All these standard sting operations have NOTHING to do with pizzagate and you are only HURTING our cause by posting them/sensationalizing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            &amp; what David Seaman does and has done is incredibly easy. You can do it with a $30 webcam and an internet connection. He doesn't have "sources"
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm glad he's doing what he does, but as someone in here stated, the Sandusky arrest is not connected to any of this shit. He was just trying to fuck around with his girlfriends daughters.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to focus on what matters and stop cluttering this site with all this nonsense.

            Yes! This is driving me crazy too --&gt; how there is so much excitement about these typical, very low-level arrests.

            Please, let's not continue assuring them that we are impressed or somehow even placated by such "news," while CPS and other agencies are running rampant across so many children's lives.

            I see both points of views expressed here. That's why I didn't like it when David Seaman claimed that the Sandusky raid was PizzaGate and this arrest was the high profile official he was talking about. Other than being a son of a pedophile, I don't see anything high profile or trafficking about Sandusky's son, who molested his girlfriends daughters.  It didn't fit at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there is always a possibility that a child molesting or child trafficking case will be connected somehow to the elites. I say we still post them. There are so many of them lately there could be something happening . Plus the PizzaGate community feels good when these guys get caught.

            Who the heck do you think is on the receiving end of the kids they pimp out? The people in Craigslist and Backpage. This is a mutli-BILLION dollar industry, and you better believe that the elites get their share of that pie. As for the stings, the cops following up on this is crucial. Like the Ohio post. Those cases had gone three years without any follow-up. So I hear what you're saying, but things are not that clear. For instance, would you really call the jackals JA hangs out with elites? Look at Carisjames. Where do you think she is? Who do you think has access to her? Or Evie's Crib? Who was Luzzatto pandering to when she advertised raw and uncensored video time? There is no demarcation. This is one big mess.

            I 100% agree
It looks dumb when Pizzagaters for example go "OMG Jeff Sandusky was arrested They are starting to catch em guys!'
Sandusky and some sting at the Detroit Auto Show has nothing to do with Podesta, Alefantis, etc

            I can completely understand looking into the Haiti bust because of Clintons ties there. Or even the Norway bust considering it was the largest bust ever. But the smaller ones are just business as usual

             Aren't you just assuming Sandusky has no connection to the DC pedo network? Hillary's brother was coached by Jerry Sandusky it seems -

            <p>
             Also this is one of Jerry Sandusky's adopted children. Adoption and CPS are a linking factor in the pedo and trafficking networks. This could reveal more from a different side than we expected.

              the reason you are wrong is that even if Podesta and Clinton themselves are arrested, but the CIA operation Brownstone / Boho Grove rings elude the spotlight and are free to grow in the shadows, it will only be , what? half a decade, a decade? And we will be right back where we started

              smh That's just a pure coincidence man. 
Jerry Sanduskys son was a pedophile because most likely Jerry Sandusky molested him. Its a common theme in these scenarios. Kids who are molested have a high chance to become the molester.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jerry Sandusky was defensive coordinator. Hugh Rodham was back up QB. He wouldn't have even hardly talked to Sandusky as they are on different sides of the ball

              Its grasping for straws. They did not arrest Jeff Sandusky because of...............Pizzagate! Its not a Pizzagate bust. Its irrelevent

               It might be irrelevant. But the problem is bigger than pizzagate. To actually stop the problem you have to hit it on all levels. It's likely they've coordinated the arrests with a strategic order in mind. I don't see any pedo or trafficking bust as anything but a win, and I don't care what anyone calls it.

            While I agree that there is a difference between "common" sex trafficking busts and the pedophile/pizzagate stuff, I would argue that it IS important to note all of the recent operations. I suggest this for two reasons:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              It legitimizes the issue of human trafficking and brings awareness to the masses -- and for those who deny pizzagate, they can't ignore the arrests of hundreds of men/women selling children into slavery. It's our way in...
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There have been a SIGNIFICANT number of rings busted recently, which indicates that better intelligence has been gathered, more guilty people are flipping and giving up their handlers and the right people are in charge of handling the investigations.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The problem with defining "pizzagate" and limiting to just the Podesta/Clinton syndicate is that it is how the MSM has been able to officially "debunk" it. You tell a person with no knowledge of pizzagate that there is a little pizza place in DC with highly suggestive links to pedophiles and they tell you you're paranoid. But inform someone that 25 children have just been rescued from sex trafficking operations and suddenly you get their attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point is, keep investigating if that's your goal. Collecting data related to it should not distract you...
           </p>
           <p>
            Never forget -- it's all connected ... and we're on the same side (presumably).

             1) It legitimizes that they "are doing something about" trafficking. Not... not much.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) These "significant" busts are much. less. significant. than the true heroism-level bravery it would require to take down the real Pizzagate criminals.

             No you missed their point.

            <p>
             They want everyone to stop talking about the flurry of worldwide busts because they totally totally don't count and definitely definitely definitely won't lead back to Sanduskys family friends and charitable organization thats connected with the Clintons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also anything that doesn't happen inside CPP to James Alefantis isn't actually pedogate and we're all crazy for connecting these dots.
            </p>
            <p>
             So just look where they tell you to look because looking anywhere else or talking about anything else might discredit pizzagate and Trump.

              look, if you're talking about some bust in Bangladesh, fine, no connection. But how can you possibly know that a bust in Idaho doesnt, amongst its client list, include the Idaho reps who go to DC and also partake of the direct DC networks. How can you say the Idaho network isnt propped up by Operation Brownstone? You absolutely cannot categorically rule it out, and Pizzagate is not just about Podesta/Alefantis , if it is about anything at all it is about an international deliberate agenda to use perversity for control and consolidation of power

            Totally agree. Recently we had 752 busts (if I recall correctly) and only 29 of those were traffickers.
           </p>
           <p>
            However traffickers could mean just an independent pimp with a few prostitutes.
