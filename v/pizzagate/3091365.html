            A family friend was caught selling a five year old girl for $600 for sex to an undercover cop. WHO was this family friend and why is Nicky being a hypocrite? She was programmed as a child sex kitten alter in the MK Ultra program with her sister and Casey Johnson now deceased.

            Speaking about 5 year old rapes..... I am banned from posting this:
Interview with professor James Fetzer PhD.

           <p>
            The Jewish pedophile asshat who organized the Australian Marriage Equality Gay Marriage Vote (Christopher Puplick AM) is on the public record defending a gay Catholic Priest Robert Dolly Dunn who raped 5 year old boys. The government is trying to jail us for CONTEMPT OF COURT for exposing this BEFORE he became a judge. That's right - he wasn't a judge but it's contempt of court if they make him a judge after the fact you exposed him defending pedophiles, and covering up the rape case done by the first transgender to use a woman's toilet anywhere in the world. The links below expose it all!
           </p>
           <p>
            To stop this going to supreme court and justice being done they are trying to jail him now for the crime of retweeting a mainstream news journalist, that he didn't even do as breech of bail conditions, the special gay police aka FB/policeglbti did it themselves after siezing his phone to frame him up. We fear for John Sunol's safety in jail! He will be in court this Friday - here's the proof:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all exposed in the video, that has all the supporting links and documentation on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is an audio version of his submission to the court on Friday:

            I called up the Catholics. I think they will use this case to expose the Government Gay Lobby leadership who ran the anti-discrimination board defending a gay catholic priest pedophile as GROUNDS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ALL FAGGOTS WHO WANT TO WORK AS PRIESTS.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF THE CHEIF OF THE GAYS SAYS IT'S HOMOPHOBIC TO HATE GAY CATHOLIC PRIESTS WHO RAPE BOYS - THEY WILL GET GROUNDS TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION TO DISCRIMINATE :)
           </p>
           <p>
            They will also probably use this to deflect all the flack they are getting about the 2nd in charge of the Vatican Cardinal Pell.

            There is a picture of what Puplick Said in Support of Gay child raping Catholic priests and here's the contact details for the guy in police internal affairs told about the gay police cyber crimes aka #donkeydickgate on twitter they covered up last year. Now the gay police are doing yet more cyber-crimes with the phone they stole to frame up, silence and murder in jail an innocent man so he can't seek justice in the supreme court and expose the Gay Lobby's links to instiutionalized pedophilia in the Supreme Court case that is scheduled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the description for the video:
           </p>
           <p>
            This is an emergency ad-hoc broadcast, because this Friday OTO Child Sex cult Occultist Dr Gregory John Tillet founded special gay police (facebook.com/policeglbti) are trying to jail John Sunol for their own fabricated hate crimes done using his stolen Samsung Galaxy Tablet they took. We realized forgot to sign out the twitter app on the device. His alleged crime - retweeting a mainstream newscorp employee Miranda Divine's article published this Janurary. Even if he did it the breach of bail charge brought on by Lesbian Detective Trisha Leech is insane, so insane she is breaking the LEPRA Act and refusing to issue a charge/fact sheet to John Sunol. Even the gay police are so ashamed of their latest malicious prosecution in a string of 150 they can't put it in writing.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Sunol has also been directly from the OTO child sex cult for religious vilification. A cult the Guardian newspaper calls a "Satanic Sex Cult", for disrespecting it's prophet that wrote the Ballard to Passive Pederasty in his book white stains.
           </p>
           <p>
            They can't allow John Sunol to go to the Supreme Court to defend himself against the charges he "allowed" me to disrespect the king of the Gay Lobby in Australia Christopher Puplick AM who literally wrote the book on gay marriage on his blog by exposing he perverted the course of justice (before being recently appointed a gay judge) to stop the Wood Royal Commission investigating the crimes of Robert Dolly Dunn and Colin Fisk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the prosecution began against us (Sunol &amp; I) for disrespsecting state sponsored rapists of women and children, the very same rapists we talked about (or there partner) have raped more WOMEN AND CHILDREN as exposed here:

            Then the Federal Government makes him a gay judge AFTER we exposed this - and then say because you exposed him BEFORE he became a judical officer - we are prosecuting you for contempt of the court!

            Yet they dragged Vivianne Legg and Dyson Devine directly to jail without trial or even appearing in court (contary to the law) so OTO leadership could muse about their rape and murder. Details here:

              He may be back at this again, but this time it seems to make a little more sense. I could actually understand what he’s trying to say here. He just needs people (ones here) to support him. Hes been called crazy and shillish and maybe he is, but to totally discredit all that he has proven to be up against is unfair. Just my opinion that maybe he’s coming back to voat (even though he was ran off) because he knows that there are people here who truly want this evil to end, mixed in with some who want it to continue. This is just my opinion based on what I have seen in the past. I have no proof, but if someone else has proof that Luke M is a fraud, then by all means, please show me .

            , our submission rules require linked support for each claim (Rule 2). I need a url that goes directly to the story. Perferably an archive of the page in question. Alternatively, screenshots of the pages (upload to catbox.moe or another image host and paste the url here), along with the link you've already posted. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Thanks.

             </p>
             <p>
              click that
             </p>
             <p>
              click share, I usually use messages
             </p>
             <p>
              on message page you can copy address then past here
