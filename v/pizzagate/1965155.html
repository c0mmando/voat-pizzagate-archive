            I disagree, pizza gate is a specified subject honing in on cpp alefantis, podesta, Seth rich, etc. All residing within a larger conspiracy.  Beyond that is pedogate, the broader subject, encompassing players like epstein, and all other high level pedophilia.

            And yet No videos or photos have ever been released. We know they exist and the fact videos and photos of powerful politicos are used to control them never gets any media attention. That is the most incredible aspect. I think this is why so many elite media people freaked out when pizzagate first started getting attention. At least 75% of elite media have to be going to sex parties with powerful politicians where kids are the late night entertainment. Stephen Colbert and Jake Tapper are the best examples they are both friends of Podesta they both went crazy over the Comet Pizza social media firestorm when this first broke. Colbert and Tapper know this is all true and they are terrified of it.

            They require these government types to buy in with their children. They are the currency. After all, who is worse the pedophile or the parents who pimp their children to the pedophile? Just watch all those sitting senators pimp their daughters to be groped by that sleazy ass Joe Biden.

            For me, the biggest redpill from Pizzagate was discovering that sodomy is the key to enlightenment to these occult creeps. Before PG, I had no idea about the dark side of the ritual abuse, sacrifice, etc. beyind just Ozzy Osbourne lyrics or something like that. It's very real. I would say the Dutch Banker confession was the final nail in the coffin for my confirmation.

            Thank you for stating this.  One of the moderators removed one of my videos on this subject I believe because I used the all encompassing term "pedogate" for this epidemic.  I have tried to explain to them that pizzagate is simply an inclusive component of pedogate which is made up of global pedophile networks, not just the U.S. or a DC pizzeria.  No response and no answer to my question.  I just try not to post to this particular pizzagate category as I see the moderator only removes my links.  Glad to see there are people here who understand this is a global issue that is perpetuated by the Illuminati.  Many people involved, even when participating in the rituals don't always fully realize where it all stems from.  Many who do not call themselves illuminati are involved in clubs like rotary club, knights of Columbus, etc. and they only see the good works.  I would post a video, but the moderator who targets people would surely remove it.  They do not understand the controlling factions in this group are generational and participate in luciferian rituals.  It was started as part of the paper clip program after WWII as part of the diabolical practices used on enemies, spies and even allies to maintain control.  They would involve them in nefarious practices including pedophilia or implicate them in activities to make them appear complicit then use it as blackmail.  Referred to honey pot or honey trap.  I didn't realize we could only refer to the MSM co-opted term pizzagate when I joined this subverse.  No matter as long as you informed people are still able to make people aware.  Keep up the great work and  #KeepFightingTheGoodFight

             Australian Cardinal and Aide to Pope Is Charged With Sexual Assault

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             SYDNEY, Australia — Australia’s senior Roman Catholic prelate, and one of Pope Francis’ top advisers, has been charged with sexual assault, the police in the Australian state of Victoria said on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
             The prelate, Cardinal George Pell, became the highest-ranking Vatican official in recent years to face criminal charges involving accusations of sexual offenses. The case will test the credibility of Francis’ initiatives to foster greater accountability after abuse scandals that have shaken the church around the world.

            Our CIA/corporate media very much knows what Pizzagate is about and all it involves which is why they work
to keep it hidden.  But the public is coming to understand the deep corruption of our government and all of its
agencies -- and pretty much all of our government officials.
           </p>
           <p>
            This kind of political blackmail -- especially connected to "sex" -- has been going on in DC since LBJ and Bobby Baker
were running a prostitution ring where Congressmen would be invited to a hotel with rooms offering ladies of the night/day.
Watergate was not only about prostitution rings, but about pedophile rings according to Det. Jim Rothstein/NYPD.
           </p>
           <p>
            None of this could exist without protection and cover up by our government -- 
our military is involved in human trafficking which was confirmed by Det. Rothstein in his video --
and he makes clear that issue is "little mentioned."
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is at the very end of the interview where Det. Rothstein mentions our military.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in.

             Yes! They kill to keep it hidden! Does the public that is awakening to the truth know that ALL TOP officials are corrupt? i.e.TRUMPS? 
Listen people its all a SHOW the positive/negative - light/dark  - Evil/ LOVE .... THE DUALITY SHOW!!
I feel the newly awakened still want a savior from the government...which is why the Sick Cult is trying to take the Narrative and all of a sudden many "INFOWARRIORS" are now praising the likes of SEAN HANNITY and FOX NEWS!! FOX TRUMPS ARE NOT GOING to SAVE THE WORLD! If they did flip  the chances are still slim to none!
            </p>
            <p>
             Look into your own self and start from there! WE the 99% need to shake things up and turn our Power Structure upside down! shake all the excess filth out so to speak and then CREATE  transparent societal institutions ! US vs THEM

            PizzaGate started with Obama's 30k$ "pizza and hotdog" party, where the "pizza and hotdogs" were "flown in from Chicago" to the White House.  The White House where no outside food is allowed to be served.  The "pizza" and "hotdog" code words were then found throughout Podesta's emails leading to the hashtag #PizzaGate.

            "Alefantis is without a doubt s as hell but I still don't know how much of a role he or CPP play in all of this."" Seriously? He plays a major role. How are you confused about this part? If you think he is guilty as hell, how can you then question how large his role is? He puts together art exibits where the money is laudered and children are selected by the buyer, we had a thread showing his father is a member of a Greek Masonic society, he is connected to Rothschilds, Soros and the Clintons. He has partys in his basement where creepy host tell pedo jokes and pedo themed bands are the highlight of the party. I question why you felt the need to make a point of Alefantis significance. Thumbs up to the thread anyway.

             Younger goats might not be aware, but in the 90's ADL spying on individuals with the cooperation of local police departments was exposed in SF and LA and other areas. This might be a good top-level post for someone to research:
            </p>
            <p>
             "SAN FRANCISCO -- A private intelligence network with ties to an American Jewish group and South Africa is under investigation for illegally tapping into police sources and collecting information on the political activities of more than 12,000 people, authorities say.
            </p>
            <p>
             As part of the investigation, San Francisco authorities say they have confiscated files containing personal information on a wide range of political activists, ethnic advocates, writers and other U.S. residents. Much of the information allegedly is from confidential government data banks and police agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
             One former San Francisco police intelligence officer, who allegedly funneled police files to the spy operation, is under investigation on allegations that he sold confidential information about hundreds of people to the South African government. After he was questioned in November by the FBI, which began the investigation, he fled to the Philippines."
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             'The 12,000 computer files seized by police include information on 12,000 people from across the United States and data obtained from several police agencies, including the Portland, Ore., police department.
            </p>
            <p>
             'The ADL is running this all over the country,' said one source close to the investigation. 'The ADL set up this great system for collecting information and South Africa tapped into it.'

            The blackmail theory to me is insufficient to explain this pedogate.  Whenever pedophiles do get arrested, wether it be in the church government or business they never allude to the involvement and arrests of others. It's impossible for me to believe that they all just dummy up. To me it seems more plausible that pedophelia is the power structure itself that people at the top become initiated into and draw strength from other members.  It's absurd that they would ever "out" somebody through blackmail as this would chip away at their own power and threaten to undermine the power structure of the whole world.

             Good question....
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course this begins with CIA/MKULTRA and mind control which seem to be a project originally run under
Hitler/Nazis.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems to have been centered in kidnapping of children who were physically/sexually tortured to create "split personalities" which are now called "disassociation."  Those new personalities could be programmed to speak other languages and for photographic memories.  These children were used as homosexual prostitutes and drug runners, for espionage/spying and blackmail.
            </p>
            <p>
             At earlier times, simply adultery was sufficient probably to have a member of Congress forced out, but later it took something like pedophilia to have that happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Presumably there may have also been other "benefits" offered to members of Congress who were being blackmailed
as they would have been cooperating on votes and issues and likely other "deals" were made to reward them
financially.  This is about total corruption of the nation for the benefit of Elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many of the children who were used had been sexually abused by their fathers before being turned over 
to the CIA.  Cathy O'Brien mentions that fact as being part of the pattern but also that the fathers were 
often financially rewarded or helped with business deals, as well.
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             A related program was Monarch but those records seem to have been destroyed by Richard Helms when he retired as Director of the CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another complication of this is that our pedophile population can increase to some extent as those who are sexually abused may go on to sexually abuse other children.  HOWEVER, not all sexually abused children will become pedophiles; only a small percentage of them do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further complicating this is the fact that while MALES are our sexual abusers of children they are heterosexual males.
Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child.  (That's according to studies and if you want more info
on that, I'll post it to you.)
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I've been reading, it seems that pedophiles actually have no sexual orientation -- though they do have preferences
by gender and age.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, again, there is another complication which is called "situational" pedophilia which is based in a heterosexual male preferring sexual relations with a female, but when there is no female available he will sexually abuse a child.
            </p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also keep in mind that often when pedophiles reach the prison system they are often murdered by other prisoners.

             Agree with you that pedophilia has become the power structure at the top.

             Something operating perhaps like "Skull &amp; Bones" where one's fellow members are moved into government and other high level positions.  (And that model is also carried out at other colleges -- "Cap 'n Gown": another example.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a power structure -- but also remember that our Founders in our Constitution also created an Elite Patriarchy,
endowed them with land grants and gave them immense influence and control over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.  Immediately, those same Founders saved and protected the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy.
The RCC came in to give license to enslavement of Africans here as well as the genocide vs the Native Americans here with their Edict to "Enslave or kill them."  So this all begins a very long time ago.  Hidden right before our eyes in a document we were taught to honor and esteem as children.

             But again, it's about total corruption and it also involves our military in this trafficking and drug running.

           <p>
            The media did not come up with the term Pizzagate.  Your quote above was a major focus of this very board for months.   Pedogate only came into fashion when it was apparent, the Comet Ping Pong genuinely functions as a restaurant.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court filing you have above is basically an unproven accusation, yes?                 I actually think the first part of that accusation makes more sense about ingratiating himself with powerful people.  If he was blackmailing people, I think that gossip would get around and his access to powerful people would get cut off.  I think it would be hard to do both.  If people know you're a blackmailer, they could hurt you in other ways, like an anonymous call to the Palm Beach police department.

             Some restaurants have had dual use forever. Gambling in the back, speakeasy, drug drop off, to mafia meet-up to child menu. Also, there never was a real investigation into the basement shared by CPP and Buck's, as specified in the invite that tells to enter CPP through Buck's. Can't do that if not connected. Also, why did the DCPD lie about an investigation? What do they get for lying? With all the unanswered questions you still make definitive statements? Yes it moved on as the authorities didn't seem to care, acted out an obvious false flag with Welch, and the information branching out to many other places and people(we're not fucking done with Pegasus, ya hear?)
The speculation was never proven or disproven, really.

              This is true. But except for kitchen and offices, the whole of CPP is open to strangers to visit. Do you actually think children were kept there or at Bucks?  Where you don't have control over who walks through your door?
             </p>
             <p>
              You believe Welch is false flag, because you believe in false flags as part of your ideology.  There's zero evidence he was.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's no evidence CPP and Bucks are connected. That is a MASSIVE assumption people have made. 
The invite told you to go to Buck's first.  You could then go on to CPP just by walking down the sidewalk or walking through the back parking lot.  There's nothing mysterious about the invite.
There is an unrelated business between the two, so I don't know how the connection would work.

              Nor was ever worth investigating.  If you walked into a police depart with a pizzagate flier and appropriate amount of investigation would be the look at it and spent as much time as it takes to file it in the circular file.

            Don't these diddlers know they are being filmed? Or do they know it and also feel above the law? The laws don't seem very harsh either. I remember reading about a case of voyeurism in which an apartment of young women were being filmed without their knowledge and the "sentence" the perp received was  like a slap on the wrist as I recall.

            Upvote and a hurrmmpphh!  When unmasked, I think the level of blackmailing will be staggering.  I would guess DC runs on blackmail, and would further guess that world politics do as well.  But..I do believe the "control" or highest levels of this fecal nightmare are gone or neutralized...

            50 percent of the population has an IQ below 100.  That's how things like this happen. Also, judgment goes out the window when penises and drugs are involved.

            It's power. Think about the people who respond to Nigerian scams. Those emails are written to appeal to dumb people. Regular people close the email and move on. The people who identify themselves as stupid respond to the email.  Then they become the Mark.
You think the political power comes first (that Epstein courted already powerful people, but that's not the case. They target and develop their cronies. They get the easily controlled to self identify then they fill them with ideas of power and install them in government.

            From there the next steps are easy. Get evidence of wrongdoing on their behalf. Make them do what you want. Rinse and repeat. How many of Congress and the Senate have been installed this way? More than 50%. Maybe more than 75%.
