Corey said he was abused when he was 14 when his attacker was 42.</p>
<p>Based on Corey\'s birthday, the attack was in 1986 (or Dec 85), which means the attacker was born around 1944.
The Enquirer says the attacker hired (abuser) Brian Peck in the past.</p>
<p>D-nny D-Vito hired Peck for &quot;Man on the Moon,&quot; and was born in 1944.</p>
<p>These two points alone are very significant.</p>
<p>Based on this some people thought it was Martin Sheen (although not as good on the age), but Kelly Oxford has specifically said it is not him, and that it is someone more &quot;obvious. &quot;
D-Vito\'s humor is notoriously dirty, on &quot;It\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; -- as in this skit about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmDcCpD1gc">Not Diddling Little Children</a></p>
<p>By searching for his and Corey\'s name together, a superheroes forum came up where someone who may possibly be D-Vito posts prolifically -- 13,000 posts since 2011. Their name is subtitled &quot;I am D-nny D-Vito&quot; and their avatar image is the evil clown from IT.</p>
<p>There are many interesting screen shots -- here is one apparently discussing food that anyhow references <a href="img src=&quot;http://i.magaimg.net/img/1lyy.png&quot;">&quot;young cheese&quot;</a>
He also has been commenting on the Weinstein case, and even the Haim case.
He also mentions Bryan Singer and how no one cared. Screen caps below.</p>
<p>This person claims not to live in the US but also asserts and, indeed, demonstrates an insider\'s knowledge of Hollywood.
He is a major D-Vito fan, and also claims to BE him in one example below.</p>
<p>I do not know if this is actually him or not, but it is of concern. </p>
<p>If this IS really him we should get as many screen caps as we can before this account is taken down.
(Is there a way to bulk archive?)</p>
<p>(The site is kind of difficult to search at first -- you put in the username and search field, then complete the image puzzle, then scroll down and click &quot;posts&quot; and the button.)</p>

<p>According to this was 72 years old as of last Sept with 2 children, while this theory would say he was 71 then with 3 children: <a href="http://www.rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=32827&amp;start=75">http://www.rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=32827&amp;start=75</a></p>
<p>Also note: Feldman said the event occurred on the set of &quot;Lucas&quot;, but Haim always said he was 14 at the time, which makes it 1986 (or, a remote possibility, the last week of 85, though that wouldn\'t have been during filming). My thought is the attack may have occurred on the set of the Lost Boys, and Feldman is just doing a slight protective twist here. Haim always said he was 14.</p>
<p>So this is my theory. I do not claim that it is true, but that it merits further investigation.
I think that is true, regardless of whether this online poster is in fact him, based on the good matches to the first clues above.</p>',

           D-nny D-Vito hired Peck for "Man on the Moon," and was born in 1944.

           These two points alone are very significant.

           It's not Martin Sheen, and it's someone more obvious:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           D-nny D-Vito was definitely A-list actor in the 80s
          </p>
          <p>
           According to this was 72 years old as of last Sept with 2 children, while this theory would say he was 71 then with 3 children:
           <a href="http://www.rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=32827&amp;start=75">
            http://www.rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=32827&amp;start=75
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Also note: Feldman said the event occurred on the set of "Lucas", but Haim always said he was 14 at the time, which makes it 1986 (or, a remote possibility, the last week of 85, though that wouldn't have been during filming). My thought is the attack may have occurred on the set of the Lost Boys, and Feldman is just doing a slight protective twist here. Haim always said he was 14.
          </p>
          <p>
           So this is my theory. I do not claim that it is true, but that it merits further investigation.
I think that is true, regardless of whether this online poster is in fact him, based on the good matches to the first clues above.

            Charlie Sheen starred with Haim in Lucas and Good Time Charlie has always been Bi he admitted it recently last year when he was exposed paying off women he had sex with but he never told them he was HIV Positive. Charlie is the most likely suspect. Rob Reiner is possible but DeVito is way down the list of likely suspects.

            Haim was always on something for his last 20 years (even when he was not using hard drugs, he was medicated).  Do we really want to accept that he was 100% right on the age of the dude (or even his own age)?

            I thought it might have been Schumacher until i did a little digging. Apparently in feldman's book it sounds as though the person he holds responsible (?) Did this to haim at a very young age, well before the two met. On lost boys, haim was already bisexual and looking for random hookups. So that leaves out Schumacherer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though here's an interesting bit. How much you wanna bet this is Harvey: "So Feldman reluctantly suggested a man who is called "Tony Burnham" (not his real name) in the book. According to Feldman, he knew that Burnham (whom he describes as overwieight and unatractive) had a crush on Haim, and so the meeting was arranged. Feldman says he tried to convince Haim not to get sexually involved with Burnham and to find someone else to have sex with, but Haim insisted because he told Feldman that it would be "a favor" to Haim if Feldman arranged the hookup. After that encounter, Burnham began to treat Haim as his "boyfriend," according to Feldman."

             No, it almost certainly was not Harvey Weinstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1984-85, Weinstein was making his first feature film,
             <em>
              Playing For Keeps
             </em>
             , which he co-wrote with his brother. He assaulted a woman on the crew. (See
             <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-harvey-weinstein-abuse-history-20171014-story.html">
              the Chicago Tribune article explaining all this
             </a>
             .) There's nothing connecting him to Feldman in those years, or to boys at any time. He was barely a producer at that point and never was an actor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Feldman says Haim pestered him for sex when they were both working on
             <em>
              The Lost Boys
             </em>
             in 1986. That was Feldman's very next movie gig after shooting
             <em>
              Stand By Me
             </em>
             in 1985. Read
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_by_Me_(film)">
              the section in Wikipedia describing how Reiner cast the four main characters on that film
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Reiner chose Feldman for the role of Teddy knowing specifically that Feldman was being abused by his parents, and was angry and miserable. He groomed him for that role. He may have groomed him for other things as well.

            is one of the prime suspect.

            Look at the bath tube scene with Corey Haim in Lost Boys..
           </p>

            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJM-jvwWqcY">

           </p>
           <p>
            Corey Haim said he was 14 when i got raped on the two Coreys. He was born in 1971. So in 1985 he was 14.
And .. He made Lucas the same year. The producer and director
            <strong>
             David Seltzer
            </strong>
            .. also wrote OMEN..
           </p>
           <pre><code>“At some point during the filming [of Lucas], he explained an adult male convinced him that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all "guys do" (...)
So they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers, during a lunch break for the cast and crew, and Haim, innocent and ambitious as he was, allowed himself to be sodomized. (...)
[That man] walks around, one of the most successful people in the entertainment industry, still making money hand over fist": 

quote from Corey Feldman's memoir:
</code></pre>
           <p>
            If you don´t know what Omen is.. its a movie of the Antichrist being born to this world.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would probably look at this guy too..
           </p>
           <p>
            With all the spirit cooking and shit that goes on in Hollywood.. Who knows, Right!!

             Haim was born on 12/23/1971, so he turned 14 on 12/23/1985 -- one week before 1986 began, and after "Lucas" had finished filming.

             Tons of the guy's jokes on that show are based around "diddling kids." And the episode where he's in his tighty whiteys on a playground. The child pageant episode. For all we know, "Frank Reynolds" is just the dark side of Danny DeVito put out there for the world to see, and because he's a character on a show, people would NEVER think that he's that way at all in real life.

             These people being exposed is rocking the world, we all loved watching these programmes, innocently enjoying the humour.  Q. How could we have been so blind?.... A. Because we are not like them, it would never have entered our minds.  I was a teenager when I watched celebs like Freddy Mercury and Elton John 'dressing up' for entertainment.  I didn't realise gay was even a real thing, what a sheltered life I must have lived!  No wonder it all went over my head.

            My theory for about the past year has been that it's Rob Reiner. He made
            <em>
             Stand By Me
            </em>
            in the summer of 1985 with Corey Feldman.
           </p>
           <p>
            See
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJOAGILeiAY">
             this video of Al Franken joking that Rob's father Carl routinely raped Rob as a child
            </a>
            . Very strange joke even for a roast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reiner has been hysterically opposed to Trump since he became a candidate. When the Russia narrative fell apart, it was Reiner
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cjrZZyxowo">
             who got Morgan Freeman to say "we are at war with Russia"
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Reiner counts as both an actor and a mogul. He is approximately the right age (born 1947). He is a family man, not single or gay, something Feldman stipulated.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not certain it's Reiner, but I find him the most likely among the names put forward to date.

            Didn't Corey Feldman say that Corey Haim's abuser was a hollywood "mogul". DD is an actor, not a mogul. Harvey Weinstein is a mogul. Good post tho.

            Very compelling. Obviously, his ego is much bigger than he is, so I wonder if there's somebody out there who can quote him bragging about his exploits.
