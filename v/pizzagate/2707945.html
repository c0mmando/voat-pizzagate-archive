<p>Asia Argento:  17-Year-Old Jimmy Bennett Sexually Assaulted Me </p>
<p>Asia Argento says Jimmy Bennett -- who had sex with her when he was 17 years old -- is lucky she didn\'t file charges that HE sexually assaulted and then extorted her.</p>
<p>Argento\'s lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, tells TMZ, his client\'s text messages that TMZ posted tell the real story about what went down at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Marina del Rey, CA.  The text in question read, &quot;The horny kid jumped me ... I had sex with him it felt weird.&quot;  She goes on to say she was &quot;frozen&quot; when he was on top of her.</p>
<p>Heller says, &quot;Asia chose at the time not to prosecute Bennett for sexually attacking her.&quot;</p>
<p>As for her statement after the story broke -- &quot;I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett&quot; -- Heller says she was being honest because it was a one-time only encounter and not a relationship.</p>
<p>Heller goes on to claim Bennett smelled a payday and tried to extort Argento, especially when he found out she was dating Anthony Bourdain. He says Bennett &quot;chose to intrude on that relationship and demand financial payment from Bourdain in consideration for not embarrassing Asia and indirectly Bourdain ...&quot; </p>
<p>Heller says Anthony chose to protect Asia by agreeing to pay $380k even though she did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>And, Heller says, Bourdain paid $250k up to this point, but Argento will not pay the balance.</p>
<p>Heller ends by attacking Bennett, saying, &quot;Asia does not intend to prosecute Bennett for his conduct and recognizes that his unfortunate past, his stalled acting career, and a lawsuit against his own parents for allegedly misappropriating more than a million and a half dollars from his account might explain his desperation to seek money from Asia and Bourdain for this falsely alleged incident that took place more than 5 years ago.&quot; </p>
<p>The attack against Bennett is odd ... because Argento has spoken out against shaming alleged victims in sexual assault cases.</p>
<p>Bennett claims he was indeed sexually assaulted by Argento.

<p>Asia Argento Accuser Jimmy Bennett Will File Sexual Assault Police Report </p>
<p>Asia Argento has just poked the bear, because we\'ve learned Jimmy Bennett -- who was 17 when he had sex with her -- is going to the L.A. County Sheriff\'s Dept. to file a sexual assault claim against her and cooperate with the investigation.</p>
<p>Bennett, who is now 22, has been on the fence as to whether he\'d cooperate with authorities, but he\'s now decided to go full steam ahead. </p>
<p>We\'re told Bennett\'s tipping point was the statement Argento\'s lawyer released Tuesday, attacking his character. Her lawyer, Mark Heller, talked about Bennett\'s &quot;unfortunate past, stalled acting career ... his desperation to seek money.&quot; Heller also referenced that Bennett had been a drug user. </p>
<p>Bennett\'s lawyer, Gordon Sattro, tells TMZ, &quot;the attack on my client\'s character has no bearing on the events that took place on May 9, 2013. These are statements that are meant to intimidate, shame and insult my client.&quot;</p>
<p>Argento, who has accused Harvey Weinstein of rape, has been vocal in the #MeToo movement about shaming alleged victims of sexual assault ... something her lawyer did in a big way with Bennett.</p>
<p>Argento\'s lawyer claims Bennett was &quot;a horny kid&quot; who jumped her in the hotel room. She says she did have sex with him but implies it was not consensual because she was &quot;frozen.&quot;</p>
<p>This photo was taken after the sexual encounter in the hotel room. Bennett\'s people say it flies in the face of Argento\'s claim she was not a willing participant.  (Photo Included)</p>
<p>And, they point out this photo which Argento, who was 37 when they had sex, posted in the hotel room before Bennett arrived. The caption reads, &quot;Waiting for my long lost son My love <a href="https://voat.co/user/Jimmy">@Jimmy</a> Bennett in trepidation.&quot;  (Photo Included)</p>
<p>The maximum penalty for statutory rape in California in a case involving a 17-year-old is 3 years in prison.</p>
<p>Attorney Heller tells TMZ, &quot;Asia encourages anybody, including Bennett, to come forward with any allegation concerning a sexual assault, and she is prepared to take any and all steps necessary to continues to protect her reputation and defend against any false allegations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These are statements that are meant to INTIMIDATE, SHAME and INSULT my client.&quot;  This is every pedophile\'s dream.  To Shame the Victim.</p>',

             I think you are right on the money, but she didn't sic mossad on him, she made a call to someone of a much higher power and they did.  Possibly DG.

            Jimmy Bennett said he was motivated by Argento's hypocrisy in speaking out in support of MeToo, but he was okay with taking $380k to drop it, only going public when he didn't receive the full amount.

             Thanks for responding. I understand what you are saying, it would have been better.   I agree that it would have been  better to share the story of what happened.  Possibly Bennett knew he would never get justice in a court of law.  I can't fault a Victim for I have not been one and will never know how it feels and what they have suffered through and how going public would only do more damage to an already fragile heart and soul.

            Asia's flipflopping on such a critical sexual encounter is probably going to help Harvey Weinstein unfortunately.  There are a number of his other accusers who don't pass the sniff test, Rose McGowan amongst them.

             I am wondering if this is how they want to kill the whole MeToo campaign anyway.  As usual, they are controlling things.  I have to admit it did dirty Spacey to the point of his last movie not taking in much money, and now Jimmy Bennett getting up the nerve to call her out too.  If anything, MeToo has emboldened Victims, and that is always a good thing.  It may help Weinstein, for the moment, but the fact that his own have thrown him under the bus, well hopefully he will still do some jail time.  But who knows, it could be another slap on the wrist. God I can't believe I just had to type that.

             No.  Narcissists have no shame.  It's always all about them.  By coming out with this bazaar accusation the eyes are on her.  Now let's hope the tables are turned.  I feel bad what happened to her many years ago, but she nor her father did anything to stop it or get serious help when it was necessary, who knows who else she has done this to.  Possibly though she is like those stalkers, A one boy woman.

            Asia, most certainly is a histrionic BPD, and probably has some SRA trauma in there. Bordain...obviously had his own issues not to mention not having enough and ample sample set \womanizing experience to spot the BPD crazy...This chick is insane and probably a 9.5 on the Hot \ Crazy Matrix Axis...hopefully Bennett's legal team takes it further to get a payout and help expose the Hollywood pedo cabal.

             He was hoping to avoid all this because I am sure it has caused much pain and many horrible parts of the past to resurface. She has no qualms about making him suffer.   Yes, we have discussed her life with her father and his being a Director of Horror Films.  I am sure she had an extremely horrid past which is plays into how she is today.  Horrid.  This is how it is passed on.  Let's hope Jimmy Bennett gets some serious help.

              Right...of course when you have a father who's sick (all indications point to it) its going to filter down. No doubt traumatized at an early age. On another note , beyond the horror flicks\perversions from her father, everything you read about current SRA survivors cite the generational issues of 'pedo' stuff..that...seems to be a re-occurring template...

            In the text messages that TMZ published, she says he didn't rape her.

           <p>
            It seems that Rose McGowan's new trannie lover was the one who texted her, and then sold their convo to TMZ.

             So back and forth we go, and we are suppose to believe her.   MeToo was cooked up by Pedowood.  Possibly to confuse people so they don't know who to believe.  The picture says it all.  Rose is a case unto herself.

             She says he did but I don't believe her for one minute.  This is her 3rd lawyer.  I think people are going to get really angry with her and disgusted.

              I don't believe her either. She groomed that boy. She's just as sick and nasty as the male pedophile, but she thinks she derseves a pass because she's a woman. No way!

               She is a sick and perverted pedophile.  A true Narcissist.  And yes, we here have always believed the children.  Really, the picture tells it all as well.
