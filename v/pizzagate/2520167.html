            Allison Macks public instagram had a post of a video of a brown kid reciting some bullcrap they made him memorize. It was her latest post saying wow this kid is so wise. Was it to promote the schools? No one knew who this kid was. I reported the post and her account and the next day the post was gone. Wish i screenshot it.

            Rainbow Cultural Garden is geared to the wealthy – at $125,000 per child per year!
           </p>
           <p>
            Keith Raniere's
            <s>
             ‘revolutionary’
            </s>
            lucrative babysitting program Rainbow Cultural Garden...for "greater brain development".  He has never published any peer reviewed scientific study and is not known to have published any scientific study.  Mr Raniere, holds no master’s or doctorate degrees, but does have a bachelors degree.  He majored in biology, mathematics and physics.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             However Mr. Raniere runs a sex cult and is reported to have sex with the children of his sex slaves.  He promotes incest.
            </em>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Mr. Raniere does not speak any foreign languages. He can speak only English.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               Mr. Raniere’s program provides each child in the Rainbow Cultural Garden seven different foreign babysitters, whose native language are one of seven: Spanish, English, Mandarin, Arabic, Hindi, Russian, German and Japanese.. Each babysitter is paid $10-15 per hour to speak ONLY in their native language to the child.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The babysitters are called ‘Multi Cultural Development Specialists’ [MDS].
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               There are no evaluation tests to ascertain how fluently a MDS candidate speaks her own language.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Many MDS are hired from online advertisements.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             An MDS:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <ul>
              <li>
               does not have to hold a college degree or have a background in early child development.
              </li>
              <li>
               does not have to demonstrate advanced linguistic skills in their native language.
              </li>
              <li>
               has to be willing to work for $10 – $15 per hour and be able to speak one of the seven languages as their native tongue.
              </li>
             </ul>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The “Full Rainbow’, with all seven languages, costs $120,000 per year per child in the USA.  There is a discount per child if more than one sibling is enrolled.
             </li>
             <li>
              The weekly schedule is that each of the seven babysitters watch the child alternatively for a total of 90 hours per week of foreign babysitting. Each of the seven babysitters is with a child about 13 hours per week.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
             <ul>
              <li>
               When an MDS is with the child, parents are encouraged not to talk to their child so that the child imbibes the foreign language of the MDS who is present.
              </li>
              <li>
               At 90 hours per week, the Rainbow program engulfs the average child’s every waking hour.
              </li>
              <li>
               There is no kindergarten, no early childhood education, or any set curriculum associated with the program.
              </li>
             </ul>
            </blockquote>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Like all of Mr. Raniere’s enterprises there is a strong business model.
Rainbow operates on what retailers call ‘Keystone.” Keystone is to sell services or products at double the cost. At 90 hours per week, and $10 +/- per hour, it costs Rainbow about $50,000 per year for babysitting services.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some parents do less than the full seven languages.

             this is highly disturbing! Imagine how confusing this would be to a young child?!? And on top of it, where are their parents? 90 hours a week of "babysitting"? So dad has more time for golf and banging his secretary, and mom can get Botox and her vag rejuvinated? Be parents!

              <p>
               Some of the Rainbow children are reportedly having trouble with their language skills and speak in a multi-linguistic babble. A child who completed years of Rainbow could not speak any foreign language at age eight. Another child could not speak his native language. He chattered in a mixture of languages.
              </p>
              <p>
               The children in Rainbow may be experiencing psychological trauma, as they are taught  multiple languages by unqualified teachers in an unlicensed school or an unlicensed daycare operation. And although the State of New York has known about this illegal operation for at least 7 years, it has NOTHING to shut it down, NOTHING!
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                Rainbow operates as an early childhood education center and/or a childcare center without a license for either operation.
               </li>
               <li>
                Many of the Nannies in Rainbow, [called Multicultural Development Specialists] are from foreign countries and are here illegally.
               </li>
               <li>
                Many of the Nannies had no visa to enter the United States and have been harbored illegally by NXIVM.
               </li>
               <li>
                Many of the Nannies obtained Visitors Visas by falsely claiming they were travelling to the US to take courses with NXIVM. Once in the US, they became Nannies and were paid under the table.
               </li>
               <li>
                With NXIVM’s Vice President of Operations, Clare Bronfman, as their sponsor, many other foreign nationals were offered Work Visas [H1-B visas].  NXIVM claimed the applicants would perform highly specialized jobs at specified payments. But after the visas were obtained, the applicant did not work as specified. Instead, the applicant worked as a Nanny at $10 per hour.
               </li>
              </ol>

              Some women did get the payment specified in their visa application but had to kickback everything they received over $10/hour to Clare Bronfman, or perform work as her personal servant.

              Multiple sets of bookkeeping records are being maintained to cover up this scheme. The scheme is so widespread that there are literally dozens of witnesses.

               Among the rich and famous who placed their child in this “scientific innovation” is actress Penelope Cruz. DOS branded slave, Michelle Hatchette was overseeing the experiment on Ms. Cruz’s child, which was conducted in Miami.  Michelle Hatchette is in the same slave pen that India Oxenberg is in and her slave master is Allison Mack.

               And people on places like Reddit have got the nerve to argue the toss about whether they've been arrested for crimes against children.

            Sounds like the same goals as current "progressive" Marxist-liberal schooling, tbh.

            I wonder, why all this new found concern for NXIVM now?
           </p>
           <p>
            How long has the US, Canada, Mexico known of this group?
           </p>
           <p>
            from what I have read, complaints have been coming in for a long time
           </p>
           <p>
            I need to make a list of all their fake charities and LLC's
           </p>
           <p>
            there are so many of them
           </p>
           <p>
            grant you their members are money, but they must be moving a LOT of money
           </p>
           <p>
            to where I dont know, except war in Libya, the rest, who knows
           </p>
           <p>
            do they have that many groupies?
           </p>
           <p>
            and what besides money was coming from Mexico?
           </p>
           <p>
            The more I read, the more questions pop up
           </p>
           <p>
            has he blown that much money, or is it sitting off shore?
           </p>
           <p>
            hope to get some time tonight to go looking too

               The system in place in these pre-schools is EVERYWHERE.  The only differences are the details of the 'program' that is in place. Behind the scenes, it's all SRA abuse, all of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Acting? Have you ever in your life seen a video of an actor 'preparing' for a role?  We hear about it all the time but no documentation exists. Because it's MK Ultra. Every top level actor. Every top level musician. All of them. That is why we see a unified and psychotic front against Trump.  IT'S A GIANT CULT.
              </p>
              <p>
               Police forces. The FBI. The CIA. Judges.  &lt;&lt; these are the protectors I referred to.  The umbrella of protection had to be removed before any arrests could be made.

                 I can't stomach Rainbows and every time I see one I want to burn it down. Unicorns, too.

                 Orlando has been RUINED since the Pulse FF.  It's now a faggot city and an extension of Disney. Rainbows are proliferated all over the city now.

             Excellent points! Whenever something blows up in the news I always ask myself why now? What is the purpose behind letting us peasants know about this now? Same with fat sleazy Weinstein!

              I've been seeing sites that usually doesn't cover trafficking
             </p>
             <p>
              wonder what will happen when it comes out about what he has been doing to kids, Will they still report or will that hit to close to home?

             <p>

            The child pointing to 666 thing was dated the 13'th of February, 2018. The earliest known origin of Valentine's Day might just be from an ancient Roman festival called Lupercalia, that was celebrated from February 13 through February 15th. Probably just another coincidence.
