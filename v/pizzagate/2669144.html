            I heard that a major player amongst the secret societies of the world were offshoots of the Nazis basically, and that they have infiltrated the US, along with other societies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look into the Vril, Thule and Black Sun societies. There may be further segmented offshoots of these societies, but during WW2, these were the occult societies within Nazi germany (as far as I remember).
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is this relevant? She makes a comment w.r.t the American government being white supremacist. Now, considering that she was brought up in this DUMB as part of an elite family, its entirely possible that her view is distorted and based only on her own experiences. Hence the the link between her white supremacist comment and Nazi or as I like to call them post-Nazi occult societies.

             Hey man, I know this is old but; that is complete bullshit. She never said she "supports pedophiles", that's disgusting of you to insinuate from a 13 minute video, which was one of many on the subject. She absolutely abolishes paedophilia, has always advocated people to get help, or rectify the past, and not turn destructive and take it out on the defenseless.
            </p>
            <p>
             I get so protective of Katy because of all this stupid attention and discarding sentiment from people who expect a certain reaction, like they ought to know what they'd say, like there's nothing complicated that goes on inside the head of a victim, like they never worry about losing their souls, becoming self-destructive perpetrators themselves, being programmed paedophilic, like her whole life isn't a conflicting mess of poison from not knowing love as a child. Like she doesn't deserve being listened to, in context, without you generalizing something as fucking stupid and simplistic as that. God you make me sick.

            Not saying it's related but I know that there has been some deaths of soldiers at Fort Hood, that are really questionable and that's in the general area. Right before Trump was elected. One soldier was missing for weeks and he was found,  in his car, on a road at the base, but in bushes decapitated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then a few weeks later a soldier shot another soldier in the head behind a building.

            Also stratfor is close by, and they had that strange email about elves.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             CHRISTIANITY, YAHOO'S AND VAMPIRISM All religions have their roots in the Khazar religion; hue-man sacrifice, diabolical rituals and cannibalism/vampirism - which was noted by many Roman Generals and historians. Most people don’t understand that these practices continue to this day under the canopy of religion, politics and globalisation. The global elite are parasitic vampires. When the early Christian generals of Rome were ordered to ‘sort out’ the barbarian hoards of Europe, they found that these tribes were already Christians [Crypto-Jews]. Historians have always told us that it was Rome who brought Christianity to Europe but it was actually the other way around. The Moors dominated the world at the time regarding culture, science and art and it was these Moors who shared their knowledge with the Khazars. I say, 'shared' very loosely because there was a long his-story of conflict between the Moors and the Khazars; in fact, the entire world seemed to be at war with them. AFTER CONQUERING THE ROMAN EMPIRE - THEY RENAMED IT, 'THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE' BUT THERE WAS NOTHING 'HOLY' AND NOTHING 'ROMAN' ABOUT THIS EMPIRE IT WAS PURELY GERMANIC AND MOST SCHOLARS AGREE, THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED, 'THE HOLY GERMAN EMPIRE' These Germanic tribes from the Caucasus Mountains invaded the indigenous peoples of Europe, including Greece and Rome. And by the fourth century, the Roman armies were almost entirely composed of Germanic tribes under the banner of the Christian army - they renamed the 'Roman Empire' they had conquered, ' The Holy Roman Empire' and established the Vatican. The new Vatican was entirely Germanic and the source of its power remained in central Europe, particularly Germany. Everyone knows that the Germanic Vatican priesthood retained their pagan [Khazarian-Jewish] practices under the guise of Christianity [Crypto-Jews] They took on the identity of those they conquered, not only assimilating them but becoming the ultimate vampiresque parasite. THE JEWS CLAIM THEY'RE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST IN ORDER TO CLAIM PALESTINIAN LAND / ANTI-SEMITISM These Germanic tribes assimilated other tribes and became known as the Phoenicians/Shepherd kings /Scythians/ Huns /Khazars /Turks /Sea-peoples and many other names. They split into groups; some became Christians, others Jews [Ashkenazi] and others adopted Islam. There was never a genuine conversion to these religions and they always remained faithful to their Khazarian roots and Talmud which they created in the 8th century after they created Judaism - which has nothing to do with the real Hebrews or Israelites. The word, 'Jew' is also peculiar to the Khazar-Ashkenazi's and was not used until the 18th century editions of the bible, when they first conceived the idea of persuading the world that they were the original Israelites of the Biblical Middle East. Not everyone accepted this idea and they were challenged by many scholars, including their own, so the German, William Marr coined the term, 'ANTI-SEMITISM' in 1879 so that Ashke-nazi Jews could bully and harass anyone who denied they were from the Middle-East or challenged their behaviour towards the non-Jews. Ashke-nazi Jews also have a long his-story of slaughtering and enslaving the real biblical Israelites in an effort to replace them. They fear the Hebrew prophecies and writings of the ancients which reveal a life-span of 6,000 years for their DNA, they fear genetic annihilation, which drives them towards the psychotic destruction of everyone else. [Google, 'the Sampson Option', regarding Israeli policy in case anyone attacks them] - in short, '..If we go down, we take the world with us..' RELIGIONS USED TO MAKE SHEKELS FROM THE GOYIM AND MASS RITUAL SACRIFICES Religions are used to make shekels from the Goyim and as a means to call upon ‘holy wars’ [mass ritual, sacrifice and cannibalism/vampirism] and to control the masses - just as Constantine, the Druid had done. Historians can never get their heads around the fact that the worst barbarians in his-story such as Hitler [Crypto-Jew] were also Christian but it’s not so difficult to understand when you know that they were also predators/vampires/cannibals/yahoo’s who were hiding behind religion in order to give them access to wholesale slaughter and wars. The similarities between Christian and vampiric culture virtually go hand in hand; the resurrection of the dead, the special feasting of Christ’s body the drinking of blood, torture [of Christ] and so on. The Vampire folklore of Europe is no different from Christian mythology. It is also noteworthy that few Christians understand the Ashke-nazi hatred for them in particular and there has been mass ritual slaughtering of Christians historically by Jews, which is also expressed in their Talmud - the Satanic verses. .

              Many Jews settled in Germany and Eastern Europe. There could be a connection here, but the Germanic tribes had their own pagan religion. The Celts and Germanic peoples did trade with the Phoenicians and much of the Druidic religion came from the Phoenicians.

             Yeah they aren't even genetically connected to Sephardic Jews. I'm like 14% Ashkenazi and am one of the whitest people I know, blonde hair, blue eyes. Those people did not originate in Israel despite what they claim, it's funny how the history of khazaria is buried so deep, looks like their censorship has spanned ages.

               What's also funny is that I Am agreeing with the khazarian "theory" which isn't "Jew disinformation" it's actually considered anti Semitic by a lot of people
Just because someone has jewish DNA doesn't mean they are pushing disinformation, or are you the shill? Seems kinda weird you
Would just jump on me like that for no reason. Just kidding, I don't actually think you're a shill, but that doesn't feel very good does it? Seriously don't be a jerk dude, I have no time for that.

              Well, I think that what he says in the quote above I cited is certainly wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think of the Celts, and of the Germanic tribes who had their own, Nordic pagan religion. And the Christian monks even several hundred years later had quite a lot of difficulties in convincing them to adapt the Christian religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many Roman soldiers were into the Mithras cult though, which had some similiarities to the Christian faith, and later some became Christians.
             </p>
             <p>
              (And you certainly cannot speak of 'Crypto-Jews' in that period in Europe, when there were not even Christians there.)

               That last part leads into the Christianity is front for the continuation of the new/old god dionysus cult, a la thomas allegro, speculation. Not saying it's true, my good christian Voat peeps, just that this category of speculation is out there.
