<p><strong>As it IS worldwide!</strong></p>
<p>This is fully sourced in article.</p>
<p>I will put some sources here, rest in link.</p>
<p>Pizzagate related because This is ALL Connected and Many of us work to show others either beginning their journey or continuing their journey How it is a Vast Web of deceit in which they use &quot;honey pot&quot; style tactics to induct, indoctrinate, program, proliferate and continue the ritualistic abuse down through the generations.  Done through entertainment, rituals, parties, trips, government, etc.  
</p>
<p>It all tries to create a cocoon around any who will give them interest in the Distractions they provide through media, movies, their owned MSM, music, social media, etc.  They easily entice, entrap and blackmail continuing their cycle of abuse and rituals that have literally been in place since the dawn of time.  Since there was a fallen being, along with his cohorts they tamper with the human genome and try to prey upon God\'s most innocent of His creation <strong>because humans are made after God\'s own image and Satan Hates it and US!</strong></p>
<p>Think of that. . .we ARE the God particle, but they are always searching for an alternate god, the anti-god, the anti-christ.</p>
<p>They do so by trapping people and tricking them into sacrificing more of God\'s creation.  
</p>
<p>They use their symbols to signal one another whether it be through their &quot;secret clubs&quot; like free masonry or touting their cabal, Kabbalistic  beliefs.  Constantly giving off aires of superiority in their &quot;mystery religion,&quot; of, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We know more than you susceptible, mere humans.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their goal, as the fallen is to destroy as many humans as possible by leading them down the Most Destructive path possible!  One of those paths is </p>
<p><strong>Kill as many babies and children as Possible!</strong></p>
<p>**Reprogram as many as you can to prey upon the innocent to include fracturing the brain God created, so the prey will become the predator. . .if not. . .the sacrificed on an alter dedicated to Baal, molech or whatever evil name satan enjoys calling himself with his baphomet agenda of transgenderism going into transhumanism.   
</p>
<p>Beware their agenda, as high Tech companies continue to protect them, orchestrators on boards infiltrate and pretend to be one of the Guardians. . .they are sneaky like the serpent!  
</p>
<p>Beware as they attempt to get you to sympathize and fall for their ploys to normalize, blur the lines, be dismissive of their vile behavior and titles like NAMBLA , whose name Says it All. . .North American Man Boy Love who people don\'t realize have been using mob style tactics since the Franklin Cover-up and Before!</p>
<p>To be clear, I must make this statement due to infiltrators claiming they have to pay to read on steemit.  <strong>That is FALSE.</strong></p>
<p>No account needed, no requests for money. . .**This is about the Information and We the People accessing it censor free without their controls including those of the <em>mobs</em> as we recently witnessed on reddit.  Many on reddit were discussing steemit as an alternative because All Platforms Can and some Have fallen.</p>
<p>Go in, read, no need even for upvotes as This is Not a Game as some posers and Gamers attempt to use their media matters friends to distract from You and Me getting the Truth.</p>
<p>**If you hate steemit. . .let me know you want more of the info pasted here.  But DO NOT use the media matters tactics of attacking info just because a platform is being used that Doesn\'t Censor!  That is a distraction method to Keep People from TRUTH posers are paid to Censor!</p>
<p><strong>We Will Not Be Stopped!</strong></p>
<p>We are the Guardians of these Children and will Continue in spite of compromised people on various platforms and boards to use mod style tactics to Silence.  I am saving this if there are issues to Prove a recent case.</p>

             Probably should have been a side note as it's true their is no evidence as to which side he was on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can't help but think he must have known something.

             He did call out certain bits of info on Hillary.  I always thought that was once of the reasons he was in my opinion killed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Died around same time Kate Spade died with same red scarf or red hanging object.

             It was alleged she made wearable articles for people out of victim's_  .  These people are sick, when Q says that, there is no stretching of the truth.

             I would suspect it's been around far longer as Hunter Thompson was pretty bold about telling about his sick hunting expeditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was a victim of the Franklin Cover-up who spoke of at  least One of Hunter Thompson's snuff films and I heard his audio, Thompson himself, speaking of a party he went to at a Rothschild mansion.
            </p>
            <p>
             After seeing their artwork and several different mansions owned by them, there is no doubt who and what they pay allegiance to.

             Bourdain's girlfriend was one of the signalers and focusers of the metoo movement, which appeared to be a distraction on sexual harassment concerning adults so people didn't poke around in the greater problem of the sexual child abuse which was prevalent and known by the 80's and 90's.
            </p>
            <p>
             Concerning Asia Argento,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Her father is Dario Argento, an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter, well known for his work in the Italian giallo genre and for his influence on modern horror and slasher movies.Her mother is actress Daria Nicolodi
             </p>
             <p>
              Argento has said that as a child she was lonely and depressed, owing in part to her parents' work. Her father used to read her his horror scripts as bedtime stories.  At age eight, Argento published a book of poems.  At the age of 14, she ran away from home.
             </p>
             <p>
              Argento has mentioned in interviews that she does not have a close relationship with her father.   She has mentioned that he was absent when she was a child, and has also mentioned that, because of this, she did not have a happy childhood.  Regarding her relationship with her father and her reason for acting, she has stated that:
             </p>
             <p>
              I never acted out of ambition; I acted to gain my father's attention. It took a long time for him to notice me – I started when I was nine, and he only cast me when I was 16. And he only became my father when he was my director. I always thought it was sick to choose looking at yourself on a big screen as your job. There has to be something crooked in your mind to want to be loved by everybody. It's like being a prostitute, to share that intimacy with all those people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Asia Argento began to act at the age of nine,  when she was cast in a small role in a film by Sergio Citti.  When she was 18, she starred in her father's film Trauma (1993). She received the David di Donatello (Italy's version of the Academy Award) for Best Actress in 1994 for her performance in Perdiamoci di vista, and again in 1996 for Compagna di viaggio, which also earned her a Grolla d'oro award. Argento subsequently began to appear in English-language movies, such as B. Monkey and New Rose Hotel (both 1998). Argento also performed in French-language roles, beginning with Charlotte de Sauve La Reine Margot (1994).
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             She's been in a variety of films, been involved in music and other "entertainment" ventures.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bottom line, you could be correct about Bourdain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some thought he Was going to expose some of the Hollywood elite.  No verifiable evidence of course.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously he knew Something, or they wouldn't have taken him out.
            </p>
            <p>
             BTW did you see that artwork his girlfriend was involved in and her past with a producer dad who worked on some very gory films?

             Here is an article link you probably already heard of where Argento was accused by an alleged victim of abusing him and paying him off.
            </p>
            <p>
             In another article it stated,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Documents obtained by the paper indicated that Bennett met Argento in a California hotel room in May 2013 — just two months after his 17th birthday — where he said she sexually assaulted him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bennett’s lawyer, Gordon K. Sattro, had sent Argento an intent to sue her for $3.5 million in damages for infliction of emotional distress, lost wages, assault and battery, according to the Times.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Now this is interesting,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Although Argento initially remained silent over the allegations, on Tuesday, the actress released a statement in which she strongly denied the alleged sexual assault. Moreover, she said her late boyfriend Anthony Bourdain, “personally undertook to help Bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life.”
             </p>

            Seems there are more than one Mark Greenburg's. This one sticks out to me,"From 2009-17, Mr. Greenberg worked at the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. He served as ACF Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy from 2009-13; Acting Commissioner for the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families from 2013-15; and Acting Assistant Secretary from 2013-17. ACF includes the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has responsibility for the refugee resettlement and unaccompanied children program, and has a strong research agenda relating to the programs under its jurisdiction. Among these are a wide range of human services programs, including Head Start, child care, child support, child welfare, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families."

                Hmm.  Well, there is much in there that has now been unapproved, evidently.  If you think you can work it up and still keep the spirit of it alive, then post again in pg.  If you believe you will lose the spirit of the post then go to whatever.  It is hard to keep it the way you intended.

                 Thanks carmencita.

                 I've been doing this for two years now, so probably like you see where all connects.

                 The challenge comes in where some people don't know the background and physics involved with CERN and the laboratories under government funding that were part of the background and foundation.  I do understand how they want links.. .many abound.

                 Difficult to take every strand of this web to show people, as you know one strand veers off into several more.

                 It's okay, I can dig up what is needed and take out the real battle info going on.  Some know, but I realize rules are rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thanks for your insight.

                  I understand your having to remove some, hope it still keeps the spirit you hoped to convey.  Its hard to post our feelings sometimes.
