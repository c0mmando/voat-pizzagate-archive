<p>Jimmy Saville, who has over 500 pedophilia complainants including those of murder, necrophilia and occult ritual abuse, close friend of the British Royals, after decades of rumors and whispers actually had some tentative police inquiry, and Keir Starmer who has just replaced Corbyn as Labour Leader was in charge of the Department of Public Prosecutions at the time</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jimmy Savile could have been prosecuted for sex offences while he was still alive but for blunders by police and lawyers, it was revealed today. Britain’s chief prosecutor apologised for the failure to pursue four separate allegations against the BBC star, one made as recently as four years ago. </p>
<p>Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there were failures by police in Sussex and Surrey and by the principal lawyer in dealing with the allegations. He issued a personal apology for the mistakes by the Crown Prosecution Service and announced a series of changes to improve the investigation  of allegations by child victims. </p>
<p>A review of the CPS decisions and the police action concluded that a prosecution could have been possible in three out of the four cases. At the time the CPS lawyer concluded that because none of the victims wished to give evidence, no prosecutions could be brought. However, the review of their actions by the DPP found police should have told victims they were not alone in making complaints, and that the CPS lawyer should have challenged police conclusions.</p>

            So the British Labour Party, whose official policy on Pakistani Muslim child rape gangs culturally enriching English children is, "Shut your mouth for the good of diversity", whose former luminaries Patricia Hewitt and Harriet Harman lobbied Parliament on behalf of PIE (the Paedophile Information Exchange) to lower the age of consent to 10 and decriminalise CP, whose former leader Tony Blair slapped a D-Notice on reporting senior members &amp; aides of the Labour Party were caught purchasing CP, have now elected as their new leader a man who quashed an investigation into BBC paedo/satanist Sir Jimmy Savile, replacing former leader Jeremy Corbyn, a man who for decades has covered up the local Labour Party in his constituency (Islington North) having turned the Islington children's care home system into a child prostitution ring?  They are nothing if not consistent!
