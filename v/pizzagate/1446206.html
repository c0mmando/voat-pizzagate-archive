            I may be remembering wrong, but I believe there are legal restrictions on what can and can't be done with that information. Also a lot of jobs have very strict policies on what is allowed to be used and how. In the military you could be discharged for publicizing information from there without permission (this may have changed but it was the rule when I was in JAG).

            I'm just saying I would consult an attorney first. It's easy to track who logged in to look at the information etc.

            So I just got done watching Conspiracy of Silence on YouTube, about the giant pedo ring in Nebraska that flew kids to Washington DC for sex parties. At the end of the video an investigator said that he tried to get transcripts of the trial in DC but they were sealed. Any chance OP could get those? The guy said they would have the names of politicians and other power players.

             If it's in the federal courts, my guy says he'll have to pay money to access those records. I'm not willing to ask that of him unless (a) he volunteers to pay for it or (b) we all pitch in and somehow figure out how to anonymously donate the money to him, and I don't know that I'm willing to ask that of this community. I'll let him know about this though, maybe he can get something.

            Thanks for the ideas, everybody. I don't wanna overload him with ALL of these, but I'll send him the biggest ones and report back. We can all see if we find anything interesting and go from there.

            It could be a coincidence, but he's even said "I love children" in that video where random people walk up to him to talk with him nicely.

            Also, it doesn't just sound almost the same, his name is nearly an anagram if that is his real name.

            James Alefantis scrambled is J'aime les Afants .

            You're right though it's not the main importance, although it's another sign of his vanity and seemingly pride in what he does, because he is aware of it.

            I would like to know if James Alefantis is his real name. I suspect not. Who is this man? Also, are there any details of sexual abuse in the Kids for Cash scandal? Now we enter the multi-billion dollar world of juvinelle justice.

            need reduce cognitive bias by using the opinions of others' to support criminality. i bet there are lots of records in the clerks office. whatever opinions developed here would need to be validated by other recorded testimony

            Give him one thing and if he comes back with valid information then you add gold star to his trust record :)
How do we know his mate isn't shredding all the linked case files?

Why:
1. Killed senator, which claimed child adoption agencies were involved. Her court documents could be interesting (what did she know).
2. Today someone discovered, that LAURA SILSBY was CEO of a child adoption company (personalshopper.com).

            So the two names I think could have interesting court documents:

           <p>
            How about this:
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look into the lawsuit records of James Alefantis (owner of Comet Ping Pong) what comes up is a suit filed by Devoya Robinson and her co owner of Boas 5 Star Elite Cleaners. Devoya Robinson runs this cleaning company. The suit claims "abuse of process". We believe there are previous legal filing filed by Alefantis against Robinson but they are currently sealed. We obtained the files via Westlake
           </p>
           <p>
            What we do know: Boas 5 Star Elite Cleaners was hired to clean Comet Ping Pong. Sometime in late 2011 something occurred that ended the business relationship but began a legal one.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theory: Boas Cleaners either found something they weren't supposed to or got too close and Alefantis is tying them up legally or threatening their business with endless litigation. At which point Robinson lawyered up and fired back with the Abuse of Process suit which is exclusively used in tort law. It's also entirely possible that it was a business falling out that isn't nefarious but I would love to see the full court docs. But like I said sealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turns out James Alefantis has a history of lawsuits under his other company Bucks Fishing. Including one with another cleaner as well as a AC/Plumber contractor based in DC
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.vitoservices.com/">
             http://www.vitoservices.com/
            </a>
            contractors website
           </p>
           <p>
            I also found out that the case with Devoya Robinson was very strange. It looks like she got out lawyered. She present her case and a judge ordered a summons. Alefantis lawyer immediately filed to dismiss the case. The case proceeded but it appears that Alefantis did not appear in court and ignored his summons as last warnings were issued. At least I think that's what it says
            <a href="https://www.dccourts.gov/cco/maincase.jsf">
             https://www.dccourts.gov/cco/maincase.jsf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe someone more legal litererate could tell us exactly what's going on. The link there for the court records is the DC courts search system you can look up Bucks Fishing Cases as well.

            Comet Ping Pong registered as a trade name in DC.   Can we see those documents?
           </p>
           <p>
            Comet Ping Pong is a d/b/a for Big Cheese, LLC.  They were sued in 2015.  Over rent?   Can we see a copy of that lawsuit and subsequent filings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone claimed Comet was in bankruptcy and also owed a janitorial service 25k.    Any bankruptcy filings by Big Cheese, LLC, James Alefantis?
           </p>
           <p>
            Any other corporations set up by Jimmy Comet around the country?
           </p>
           <p>
            David Brock settled a lawsuit from an ex-boyfriend for $800,000+.    Can we see that lawsuit?

            yep can you look up donald trump and see how often him and Jeffrey Epstein stayed in the room they used to rape 12 year old girls over a 20 year period?
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you search for other police complaints against trump for rape that might be sealed?

             I looked into this personally and the only rape I could find by Trump was on November 8th of this year when you got all butt-hurt because America rejected Hillary.

             Well we do know that the Epstein flight logs show ZERO trips with Trump.
And we also know that nobody has come forward as a the supposed "victim" of Trump in that case.
And we know that the charges were dropped (because it was a bogus frame attempt).

            <p>
             So there's that.
