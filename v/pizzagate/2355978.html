            The boys on the tracks case has continued to bother me since I first learned of it. I'm certain they were murdered for what they saw and I blame the bullshit criminal activity that the clintons were involved in for the killing! I detest having to see hillarys puffy face and jacked up overbite on tv pretending to be some decent human being when I know what kind of evil bitch she is!

            <p>
             In the early morning hours of August 23, 1987, a 75-car long Union Pacific train was approaching the small city of Bryant, Arkansas during a regular nightly run from Texarkana to Little Rock. Just after 4:00 AM, the crew noticed a "dark spot" on the track just beyond a railroad trestle. When the engineer had finally determined what the mysterious shape on the tracks was and had thrown on the locomotive's emergency brakes---leaning all the while on the horn---it was too late. The bodies of local teenagers Kevin Ives, 17, and Don Henry, 16, had been run over and mangled by the passing train, whose crew was helpless to stop it. The crew reported that the boys were lying across the tracks in a "completely relaxed state", arms at their sides, upon impact, and that they had not moved a "flinch", even when the three locomotives of the mile-long train were seconds away from them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The state medical examiner initially ruled that the boys had smoked over 20 marijuana cigarettes, laid across the tracks, and had fallen into a deep sleep resulting from the "psychadelic effects of THC." Only after the boys' bodies were exhumed and autopsied by an independent, out-of-state examiner was it discovered that Henry and Ives had actually been dead and unconscious, respectively, before they had even been run over by the train. What would unravel over the next 20 years would be a series of lies, coverups, obstructions and miscarriages of justice---and even death---that would haunt the grieving Ives and Henry families for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever happened that dark Sunday morning, Kevin and Don clearly walked upon something they were not supposed to have seen. And local, state, and federal authorities seem to know just what that "something" is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Twenty years have passed without the Ives and Henry families gaining the answers and closure they need. Let's be an informed, active public who will see that those 20 years don't become 30.

            Kevin Ives is one of the boys who died on railroad tracks in Arkansas
           </p>
           <p>
            Police said they fell asleep after smoking some weed on the tracks, some say they were already dead when put on the tracks
           </p>
           <p>
            I think all witnesses are also dead
           </p>
           <p>
            These boys are part of the Clinton hit list
           </p>
           <p>
            It is suspected he and his friend, Don Henry witnessed a drug deal, probaly with Mena
           </p>
           <p>
            A judge supposivly reopened the case

             If I remember correctly, the medical examiner was declaring people with 2 gunshots to the head suicides, and Bill Clinton said these horrible judgments were a result of being overworked, so he gave him a raise. The shit is absolutely crazy.

            LP, can you add a little more info? Maybe a link to the original, rather than just a screenshot? I don't know who these folks are. It would be best to remove and repost as a Discuss post with multiple links and a little explanation. If you do it in comments it will get buried. Thanks!
