I was getting prepared to do a post on the MeToo movement and why I think it is being used as weapon in an internal war going on in Hollywood, but there is so much to be discussed about the history of the Farrow Family, I\'m going to have to split it into two parts.</p>
<p>Let\'s start with Ronan\'s grandparents John Farrow and Maureen O\' Sullivan. John Farrow was born in Australia, his mother Lucy died at the age of 19 when John was 3 years old from <a href="[http://www.farrow-osullivan.com/CurseoftheFarrows.html](http://www.farrow-osullivan.com/CurseoftheFarrows.html)"> pneumonia and
\'tubercular ulceration of the intestine&quot;</a> (is that another term for perforated colon?)  John later moved to Hollywood and became a director, screenwriter and producer. Maureen O\' Sullivan was a actress best known for playing Jane in the Tarzan movies.</p>
<p>They had seven children. Oldest son Michael was killed at 19 in a <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127644431/michael-damien-farrow">plane crash</a>  Patrick died at 66 from what was first called a suspicious death and later ruled a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5563507/Mia-Farrows-brother-commits-suicide.html">suicide</a> Prudence best known for inspiring the Beatles song Dear Prudence also <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/03/28/woman-who-inspired-the-beatles-dear-prudence-once-dated-robert-durst/">dated</a>  killer and real estate heir Robert Durst. John Farrow Jr. was convicted in 2013 of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2478439/John-Villers-Farrow-Mia-Farrows-brother-jailed-sexually-abusing-2-boys.html">molesting</a> two boys.</p>
<p>Then we have daughter Mia, Ronan\'s mother. Mia got her start in Hollywood at age 19 on the tv series Peyton Place. At age 21 she married 50 year old Frank Sinatra.  At age 23 she starred in her most known role of Rosemary Woodhouse in Rosemary\'s Baby. A movie that is much speculated about. She still remains close to director Roman Polanski and even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mia-farrow-defends-polanski/">testified</a> in his defense in 2005. In 1970 she married Andre Previn after an affair and the birth of twins broke up his previous marriage.</p>
<p>She then became a muse to and had a 12 year relationship with director Woody Allen. A notorious relationship that ended when Allen\'s relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi came to light. Soon-Yi\'s real age in unknown, as there were no records of her birth, but she was thought to be around age 9 when Mia and Woody started dating.</p>
<p>Mia had 14 children. 4 biological and 10 adopted. Three are now deceased, Tam Farrows death at age 19 was listed as heart failure but brother Moses claims it was actually suicide from an overdose of pills. Lark died at 35 from a AID\'s related illness and Thaddeus who was paraplegic passed away at 27, he was shot in the torso and his death was ruled a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3804903/Mia-s-cursed-family-Years-Brangelina-Mia-Farrow-collected-adopted-family-world-one-child-ran-lover-Woody-Allen-suicide-week-means-THREE-died-tragically.html">suicide.</a></p>
<p>Somehow even though she had 14 children, Mia became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2000 an advocate for human right\'s in Africa, has traveled to Darfur many times and  is also a board member of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Darfur Women Action Group, along with many more <em>causes</em> to numerous to list...</p>
<p>With all we have learned through our pizzagate research, is any else\'s alarm bells going off!?</p>
<p>Okay, now I am going to go into pure speculation mode. My gut tells me Mia is MK Ultra and Frank Sinatra was her handler. Remember the pixie cut she was famous for? She did it herself with <a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/remembering-mia-farrows-pixie-perfection-honor-her-70th-birthday">finger nail clippers</a> A trip to India in 1968 along with her sister, The Beatles, Donovan, The Beach Boys in order to study mediation, was it really for programming? This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEpPGq4Qxw">video</a> was taken on the set of Rosemary\'s Baby, right after her return from India, she seems very childlike for a married 22 year old. I think as she aged out she became a pedo peddler and that is why she had all those children. It is my belief that she very well knew Woody Allen liked them young and that it was only when Woody decided to run off with one of her charges, she had a fit and all his dirty laundry was exposed. If she was so against child molesters why defend and testify for Polanski? Why is her own brothers conviction never mentioned? Why the many tragic suicides, deaths etc. of her children and extended family? </p>
<p>Is this a multi-generational abuse family and is Ronan Farrow a sort of soldier being used to push an agenda and seize control from one cabal to benefit another? I will explore that theory more on a future post.</p>',

            Interesting thread since both sides are presented in subsequent posts. I had no idea about her close family members. Knowing someone who committed incest (admitted it) and seeing how the family closed ranks around the abuser including the victims, investigating the family history may give us a clues to the personalities involved. What about Woody Allen - anything known about his family history?  Woody Allen was given a free pass by many. Mia may be programmed to accept this type of behavior from those around her. When Woody took up with his adopted daughter, this may have been the final straw for Mia.

             She flew to London in 2005 to testify for Roman in a libel suit that Polanski filed  over a Vanity Fair article in which he was accused of propositioning a woman on the way to the funeral of his murdered wife Sharon Tate.  If you are talking about supporting him against the charges of rape of the 13 year old. I don't think she has ever publicly stated anything regarding that.

            I agree 100 % that you have gone off into "pure speculation mode"   regarding Mia Farrow perhaps because you spent so little time researching her.  An October 2013 article in Vanity Fair might change your mind about Miia for starters although there is much  more to explore.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am a contemporary of Ms. Farrow and we both suffered polio in the same year and birthed our boys in the same week.  She was an incredible sensation in the 1960s . Her pixie haircut was  more likely influenced by the English model Twiggy and while she might have first cut off her gorgeous long blond hair with nail clippers,  all photos show a professional pixie cut for several years until  she let it grow out for her performance of Joan of Arc and never went back to short hair.   She had been model in California as a teenager at the same time Twiggy became an overnite sensation on both sides of the pond and Mia was often compared to her.  While still in her teens she began her successful 5 year  stint in the very popular TV  series Peyton Place watched faiithfully by teens such as myself along with our mothers. Frank Sinatra was at his peak professionally  at the same time and swept this Catholic girl , still a virgin , off her feet at age 21. Despite divorce and  two more marriages for each of them,  they stayed friends and lovers till his death.   Perhaps once imprinted on an older man, she contined her attraction to much older men.  Her performance in Rosemary' s Baby  electrified  moviegoers and launched her film career.  She had 3 children with her second husband Andre Previn and together they adopted 3 more children and thus her role as earth mother began. She managed to balance motherhood with acting while married to Woody Allen   wherein  she had her first personal experience with sexual deviancy by all accounts. Who would have thunk?  Woody was at the height of his powers also at the time, had bedded and wedded beautiful women and was generally viewed as a neurotic but lovable and talented film director and actor. Folks were  as upset about the  sex abuse allegations and even more shocked by his affair and marriage to his adoptive daughter as Mia was shocked.  Aside from a few discreet affairs with another round of older and accomplished men,  Mia became devoted to her children,  which  included one more biological son Ronan and some more adoptions reaching a total of 14.  Her acting career fell by the wayside as she embarked on  genuine  advocacy for the damaged  lives of children in Africa.  Her adopted children were quite damaged themselves through  abandonment, or blindness or cerebral palsey, starvation or paraplegia.  Despite the premature deaths of  three out of 14 in a modern world plagued by drugs and AIDs,  ( think of the Kennedy clan's tragedies)  the rest  of her brood live very  successful lives .
           </p>
           <p>
            I would speculate that her defense of Roman Polanski who launched her movie career was based upon loyalty to a mentor and friend and that his derelictions are forgiven in light of the horror of the murders of his wife and friends commonly referred to as the Tate Murders. I could certainly envision Mia being genuinely protective of him out of compassion rather than an affinity towards pedophlia.
           </p>
           <p>
            This theory of MK Ultra  control of Mia by Frank has no basis  in fact.  Sinatra's starring  role in the Manchurian Candidate  did not celebrate mind control but instead exposed it as rumors of  nefarious CIA mind control experiments began to circulate.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the insinuation of perforated colons,  be advised that tuberculosis attacked the intestines as much as it attacked the lungs. And there were no antibiotics in the days that Mia's paternal grandmother suffered and ultimately died from this very common and dreaded disease.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are uncovering real horrors here  but please dont let a fertile imagination  indict  persons on such flimsey  associations.

             I think it's good to have a rebuttal so that people can look into things further, read both sides and judge for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first part of my post contained history of the family and factual information that I believe not a lot of people are aware of. Much has been reported about what a saint Mia is and how she was a victim of Woody Allen, while more unflattering things tend to go unreported. Have you read this
             <a href="https://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html">
              statement
             </a>
             released a couple of months ago from her son Moses where he accuses Mia of abuse?
            </p>
            <p>
             I was very upfront that the latter part of my post was pure speculation, but your defense of her is quite biased and almost reads like something a publicist would write. Incredible Sensation?  Earth mother?  A few discreet affairs with accomplished men? Devoted to her children? A catholic virgin until she married Sinatra? You don't know these things to be true, you are
             <em>
              speculating
             </em>
             also. Seems like you have a quite a "fertile imagination" too.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not going to change your mind and your not going to change mine, but you don't have to be such a condescending ass about it just because I dug further into the life of one of your personal heroes.

              I relied on facts reported in the media.  She is not a hero of mine altho I do admire her. Since I was a contemporay of hers, I can report on her life as others reported on her  over the decades. The terms I applied to her  were terms used by the media. She was indeed a sensation in her day for better or worse. Her affair with Andre Previn was scandalous at the time as she conceived her twins out of wedlock and broke up Previn's marriage none of which causes a stir nowadays. Sinatra, Previn and Woody Allen were much older and accomplished, how can you say they were not? She had flings with renowned author Philip Roth and with Havel  both of whom were again  much older and accomplished.
             </p>
             <p>
              Her remaining 11 children live professional and successful lives according to the Vanity Fair article, facts which I presume came from the doting mother herself when interviewed. Her relationship with Polansky predated his dastardly deeds which seem less harmful than Woody Allen's who took advantage of his  young child (5 yo?) and then his own adopted daughter, thus committing  incest. So she most likely came to Polansky's defense out of friendship which is what friends tend to do even when ill advised, not because she endorses pedophelia or has an affinity for it.
             </p>
             <p>
              By the way there is a much publicized photo of Jeffrey Epstein on the streets of NYC with a very young girl. Nobody has pointed out that a few paces behind him is Woody Allen and his wife/daughter. Was that a coincidence? Do they socialize? Has Epstein ever provided young girls for Woody?
             </p>
             <p>
              I apologize for the condescending attitude and at the same time thank you for the film footage which I had not seen before. Perhaps your second installment will prove me wrong.

               I appreciate the apology. It's just hard to put a lot work into researching something, connecting dots, spending the time to write it all out, include all the links etc. and then be told things from other posters things like nice screenplay, I have a fertile imagination etc.  While so many posts with one link and a sentence get twice the recognition. Okay, I know, I am sounding like a whiny, salty brat right now...but it really doesn't help my motivation to want to spend quite a bit of my time and energy doing a part two.

               Pizzagate was started by
               <em>
                speculation
               </em>
               of the Podesta e-mails and the true meaning of the coded language it contained and linking people together. We get enough flack from the outside about our crazy imaginations.  One thing we all have in common is that we are skeptical people, who don't just believe everything the media or anyone else tells us. I'm not looking for everyone to take what I laid out as complete truth and am fine with debating and questioning of my interpretation. Just as long as it s a well thought out rebuttal and not just a personal attack.  And in your defense you did take the time to put together the reasons as to why you thought I was wrong, it just went a little south towards the end.

               It's all good, I don't want any division, just unity. We all may not agree on everything, but members here do agree on the one most important thing and that is we need to get justice for these children and that's a battle I am proud to fight with you.

                I concur...I get a little anal about proofs, thats my job /career and I do care how we look to outsiders. Building credibility is important to keep in mind when posting. As I have said several times here that I dont post because it takes hard work.  And  hunches undoubtedly can lead to valuable evidence so.keep up the good work.

            Strange ties to the movie Rosemary's Baby. As mentioned above Mia was with The Beatles in early 1968. Upon her return she begins filming the movie. Upon The Beatles return home they are inspired by their trip and write, record and release The White Album that same year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charles Manson became obsessed with The White Album and said it contained subliminal messages, ordering him and his family to murder people and start a race war.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_Skelter_">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_Skelter_
            </a>
            (Manson_scenario)  The song Helter Skelter was written in blood at the LaBianca home after the cult murdered the husband and wife.
           </p>
           <p>
            Members of Charles Mansons cult also famously murdered director of Rosemary's Baby Roman Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate and five other people at his home.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Lennon of The Beatles was later murdered in front of his apartment building The Dakota in 1980.The Dakota was the building used to film Rosemary's Baby.

             Another interesting thing with
             <em>
              Rosemary's Baby
             </em>
             , when Kate Middleton was presenting the Royal Baby, she was wearing the same exact dress worn by Mia Farrow in the film.

             You just gave me chills. I studied the Manson murders in highschool for a class report (90s). I remember Sharon Tate, but at the time the name Roman Polanski ment nothing to me....Wow! I had no idea.

             So glad I could entertain you. Armed with your glowing endorsement, I am ready to head to Hollywood and sell my comedic screenplay. I heard James Gunns job is available... oh wait, never mind, you have to be a Pedo in order to get job at Disney. Maybe you should apply instead....

            She was Angelina Jolie before Angelina, collecting children! I know Ronin aka Satchel is supposedly Woody's son, but whenever I see him I can't help but see Frank Sinatra. Mia even "joked" that Ronan was franks if I remember correctly.
