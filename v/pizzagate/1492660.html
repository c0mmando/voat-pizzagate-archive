square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it 
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the

<p><strong>My own take:</strong> I cannot for the life of me conceive that they could be talking about real cheese here. </p>
<p>Let\'s break it down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place.I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can learn from the very first sentence that there is a &quot;strategy&quot; which have been in place for a long time... and the 2nd sentence tells us that this strategy concerns somehow a square shaped box. It is fair to assume that Mary and John send &quot;boxes&quot; to one or several recipients in a recurring manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it 
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets really bizzare from here. What John and Mary send in a recurring manner to at least one person are pasta and sauces. Also, does it make sense to use the term &quot;strategy&quot; when referring to the delivery of food?</p>
<p>Anyway, the change in strategy appears to be that instead of delivering pasta and sauce as usual, this time John and Mary sent an assortment of cheeses.</p>
<p>Oh and the use of the words &quot;lovely&quot; and &quot;tempting&quot; for describing cheese is kind of suspicious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am awaiting the 
return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that 
we can demolish them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me this is the most puzzling part of the email. It\'s the part that makes me think that maybe, just maybe, they are talking about real food and nothing else. </p>
<p>So the person in the email awaits the return of his children and grandchildren to &quot;demolish&quot; the assortment of cheeses together. Wow, if it\'s real food, it\'s fine. If it\'s something else (like: pictures/videos that pedophiles like to consume), this is completely insane and sick.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you go. The line that makes it crystal clear that they are talking in code. This sentence makes no sense at all if there are no hidden meaning. No one plays dominos on food. Hell, who plays dominos anyway? And why would &quot;John and Mary&quot; care about that?</p>',

            </em>
            , but there is something that is way off about the placing of those terms within the context that they are presented in the emails. Often in the emails the desire for pizza/etc seems to reach a tone almost of desperation and excitement, sometimes with people seemingly going too far in an email at times . The language is so specific and consistent (and uncommon to typical email communication) that it suggests that there is something being discussed that is very particular and known to this circle of people and requires a code to avoid detection.

            An interesting aspect of these leaked emails is the specificity of the language. Like, for instance, there are roughly 171,476 individual words in the English language, and just a very small percentage of them come up in these emails. Either these people have an extremely limited vocabulary, or the words that are used are symbolic somehow. For instance, the word "walnut" is mentioned around 40-50 times in the wikileaks emails, but "peanuts," "almonds," or "cashews" are not mentioned once. Either these people are all really into walnuts, or this is code for something. Most insidious seems to be "maps," which seem to be items left behind that can be somehow incriminating.

              I dunno, you should go through all of the emails and count the instances of the word "map." I would, but I have to work and sleep during huge portions of my allotted life moments.

            So you don't think that "doing dominos on pasta" is as weird as having "pizza for an hour" I guess? Looks like we'll just have to make do with that cheese that you gave us at Christmas.

This indicates that the delivery is of a sensitive nature. At the very least, a change in the usual "strategy" was enough to make the recipient uncomfortable enough to open the letter with this warning. It seems that they are very happy in the end however, and either he will be demolishing these cheeses with his progeny and their spawn, or possibly demolishing them using the cheeses? 
And of course, the P.S. is one of the most important questions to emerge from wikileaks...
"
            <em>
             Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?
            </em>
            "
This sentence completely negates the notion that the "cheese" mentioned in the earlier part of the email was literally cheese (your know, from milk). Typically, cheese is put on pasta, and dominos are known as an inedible game played nowhere near food necessarily. 
The idea that he was possibly referring to the influence of the consummation of "just cheese" or "only pasta" and its effect on his game of dominos seems illogical. He seems to be speaking in code, which surely calls into question the other content of the email.

             For example, you might find it suspicious for someone to describe cheese as "lovely and tempting."  But it might be true that people do.
            </p>
            <p>
             People describe food all the time as tempting, especially if they are prone to gaining weight.

              Also I think you're missing an important clue in the email.  It's Christmas time.  The  gifts they give out to many people are Christmas gifts.  They are recurring because they give them out every year.  I have a "strategy" at Christmas time for my sister who is hard to shop for.  I pick a dollar amount and then buy her that much wine.  Some years it's 4 bottles, some years, it's six.  I've probably done this 15 years in a row.

            I can see people referring to actual food as "tempting" and "lovely". Being tempted by sweets, for instance.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Notice" when "changing strategies" on a food gift, however, is a bit out of place. Also odd is how they "knew" based on the shape of the box. Are they persnickety to the point of only liking circular gift boxes?
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the email seems like it could be explained away, even with the "strategies" thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then you get to the PS, which is the real nail in the coffin. There is no practicality in trying to play dominos while using foods like pasta and cheese as operating surfaces. Depending on the game, it'd be like trying to stack a house of cards on the treaded surface of a bicycle tire.
           </p>

            This email is a good example of coded messages based on food. However, we know there are others where food is quite plausible.

            If they were hiding shady activities amongst regular messages, there has to be some way they would "know" it wasn't about actual food. Either they are aware based on offline communications, or there is another code word used as a "trigger" to activate their Shady Sauce Decoder Ring.

            I took it that the entire email was normal conversation with no hidden meanings... until you get to the P.S.  which isn't related to the email.  It would be like me sending you an email telling you about my day and then at the bottom say "BTW, how much is your sister charging for oral sex this week?"  I don't think we should read too much into anything but the P.S. and for the life of me can't figure out what the hell it means.
