            I agree that the memes have their place. People react to memes very easily, and this can be used to expose hypocrisy.

            I will absolutely continue working on memes. One thing that sucks is, submission voats don't count toward downvoating ability. There have been several obvious shill comments that I can't downvoat, meanwhile, I see people making valuable contributions being downvoated by shills. Memes will prevail.

             There are too many posts and comments to down vote. Don't worry about them. Finding the gem in the pile of manure, and then up voting is better.

            Somehow I got 2 downvoats for this thread. Why is this being suppressed? This is legitimate discussion, and so far the only dissenting opinions seem to not address anything in my post, and make illogical arguments. If memes must be segregated, why can't the mods state so explicitly in the subs rules?

            Internet memes don't spread ideas, they're just easy to share.  If anything they hurt your cause.  Post what you'd like friend, but seeing an image with some text place on it doesn't convince anyone of anything. And even if the Mem got them to look it up, as soon as they do they trust the articles written against it over the memes in support of it.  It's why they've all moved on.

             No one suggested censoring articles. Memes and articles do not need to be mutually exclusive.

             Not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean that memes have moved on? Because people are still making memes. They are just being segregated. Please read my original post.

              Memetics is the idea that we pass down ideas and habits over generations and that process has had a non-genetic effect on our evolution.  Internet memes don't spread ideas.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're right, no one suggested censoring articles.  I am saying that if you think memes spread the ideas, that even if they did manage to expose someone to this pizzagate, when they went looking for more information they would read the articles posted by major publications, all of which have written you off as a niche conspiracy group, and denounce you as well. Again, memes don't spread ideas.
             </p>
             <p>
              By "they've all moved on" I was referring to the people who don't believe you who you would be making the memes to spread the ideas to.  If you think it's spreading the idea, it needs to go to people who aren't already on your boat, and they've all moved on.

               Memetics is the idea that information is the core component of evolution. Information's ability to reproduce and be mutated creates a diversity through which selection pressures can act. Genetic variation and biological evolution is a subset of memetic evolution.
              </p>
              <p>
               The internet allows for information to evolve on a much faster timescale than human generations.
              </p>
              <p>
               I noticed that in your response, when you peddle a defeatist attitude regarding pizzagate awareness among the masses, you use the pronoun "you" instead of "we". If you are not interested in pizzagate awareness, why are you here?

             The existence of the meme thread is not obvious. It also doesn't undelete discussions that were happening in a deleted thread. Can you explain when this meme segregation rule was created? Can you point to where it is in the rules?

             As it stands right now, memes, along with their discussions are being deleted.

                Moreover, it results in memes being segregated to a "thread" that isn't obvious to find, and doesn't allow the full feature set of voat curation to take place.

               If you read my post, you'd know I'm aware of this little link in the sidebar. It is not obvious. It is absolutely not "big and fat". Also, it does not address the deletion of discussion. Memes are being treated as second class citizens. I want to know why.

               You have not addressed this. Why should memes be kept in an old thread? Even if you argued successfully to my points above, and convinced me that memes don't belong in the main pizzagate subverse, how can you say that the current meme thread is a better than a sub dedicated to pizzagate memes?
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, if posts are going to be deleted for any purpose (along with the discussions that went with them), I think that should be stated clearly in the rules. Currently, it is not.
