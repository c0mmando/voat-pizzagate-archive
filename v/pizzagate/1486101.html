<p>One of the sites on that list is orderformforrentapizza.jimdo.com This site will give you another link to rent-a-pizza.weebly.com When you get there, click the link which says &quot;We get our cheese for the pizza through this link.&quot; This then takes you to called TheCheeseHistory (www.thecheesehistory.weebly.com)</p>
<p>On TheCheeseHistory\'s homepage, press the About button in the centre of your screen. This will take you to a website called PicklesForever (www.PicklesForever.com) There\'s not a whole lot on this site, but it does have a GoogleMaps option which allows you to \'Start a new pickle chapter in your town\' and leave a flag. In the top right corner it mentions PicklesForever are mentioned in a book called <em>Pickle: The (Formerly) Anonymous Prank Club of Fountain Point Middle School</em></p>
<p>This is where it gets weird and I need your help. I did some research on the book and I stumbled on a website which has the first chapter. I was shocked to find this chapter gave specific details to go to www.picklesforever.com, go to a certain part of the website, click on a certain word on that page which takes you to a restricted section of the website. It even gives you the password. If anyone wants to take a look, <a href="http://topsecret.picklesforever.com">here is the restricted part of the website.</a> Oh, and the password? It\'s <strong>cheese</strong>.</p>
<p>When you get into the restricted section, the &quot;Pickles&quot; them changes to a website called &quot;Pranks and Trick Association (PTA)&quot;. In the &quot;pranks&quot; section, there are hundreds and hundreds of random comments about people discussing different sorts of pranks - but I\'ll be fucked if I believe. Another section of the site is called &quot;encryption tools&quot;, which gives you codes=letters for each different admin of the site. </p>
<p>In the pranks section, if you browse through the different categories, you\'ll see mention of cheese, some comments with code, and a comment saying  &quot;I think that anybody who has read the book knows that if you give the PTA milk, they\'ll give you cheese&quot;.</p>
<p>I\'m at work so I can\'t dig too much deeper into this, but I thought I\'d unleash this new lead to Voat to see what your brilliant minds can work out.</p>',

            You know what's odd about the PTA site and the comment section about pranks? There aren't any dates on the comments. That's very weird, usually comments have a time stamp on them so you don't respond to something from like 10 years ago. Strange:

            It looks like it is a kids book with a "top secret" online component. The password is probably in the book. The comments are all kids talking about the book.
           </p>
           <p>
            Possibly it's only a sick "joke" that "cheese" points to this site (seeing that the password is cheese and the comments section is full of kids). That said, the image gallery is kind of creepy. Maybe they tie in to the book somehow though.
           </p>
           <p>
            The path to the site from the rentapizza sites is very strange and does not look like it is related to the book.
