<p>EXTORTION PLOT: Women Sexually Assaulted by Schneiderman Turned to Trump &amp; Cohen in 2013; Then Schneiderman Targeted Trump</p>
<p>Disgraced former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman may have wanted to unseat President Trump from the White House to help keep his alleged sexual assault of women a secret, according to new shocking court documents.</p>
<p>The lawyer for two unidentified women — who claim they were sexually assaulted by Schneiderman — said in recent court documents he reached out to Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen for help in 2013, long before Trump announced his presidential aspirations.</p>

<p>So this alleged \'\'shakedown\'\' sets the stage. But let\'s see what else Schneiderman was doing at this time. This article was published on November 22, 2013: </p>

<h1>Eric Schneiderman’s shakedown racket</h1>
<p>‘There are more big paydays to come.”</p>
<p>These words come from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman this week as he celebrates the shakedown of a successful American financial institution.</p>
<p>By shakedown, we mean the $13 billion JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay in a deal with the Justice Department to settle claims stemming from the sale of mortgage-backed securities. ... </p>
<p>On top of this, JP Morgan will also shell out $387 million to low-income homeowners hit by Superstorm Sandy. The state’s legal reasoning is apparently that our banks must also be held liable for the weather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We get an idea of the looting going on so Schneiderman was into way more than allegedly beating up women [something I\'m sure he\'s very proud of and that he\'ll put on his resume]. </p>
<p>So two unidentified women go to TRUMP AND COHEN FOR HELP. Logically that would mean: that Cohen had evidence of what they said in his what? Yes, his files! Let\'s dash ahead five years. It\'s Stormey Daniels\' and Q\'s time. And what did Q say?</p>

<p>Think logically! Mueller stole the wrong documents! Instead of getting what Daniels promised, he got proof of Scheiderman\'s guilt! And there\'s no telling what those women said, so there probably was much more! And again, Think Logically! If two women turned to Trump for help, others very well might have also! So if Daniels were in trouble ... where would she go? More: </p>

<p>Are we starting to see? But let\'s go back a few years into timelines. THINK LOGICALLY! Corruption doesn\'t just happen; it GROWS like a CULTURED GARDEN: </p>

<p>So The Clintons knew of Keith Raniere in 1992. Knew he was a narcissistic POS! In other word, that he was like them. Probably like looking into a mirror. In 1998, Raniere begins the infamous NXIVM sex cult and SKANKLES follows on his heels beginning her solo politcal career where? IN NEW YORK! What a fucking coincidence! Everyone wondered why she came to NY, but we wonder no more. THINK LOGICALLY. Who was Attorney General at that time? ELLIOT FUCKING SPITZER! </p>
<p>Pataki was governor when NXIVM was formed, but who followed Pataki? ELLIOT SPITZER! Yes, Spitzer was elected governor in 2007! But is this the same Elliot Spitzer that was forced to resign due to a sex scandal? Oh, you would be so right! </p>

<h1>How Eliot Spitzer’s penchant for illicit sex caused his downfall</h1>
<p>He was not prepared for what Spitzer said next: “I have to resign — as early as tomorrow, the Times will report that I have been involved with prostitutes — I can’t continue as governor.” ...</p>
<p>By the afternoon of March 10, 2008, as Spitzer met with Constantine in what had become the frantic huddles — including his wife, Silda, and sister, Emily — at his Fifth Avenue home, Spitzer was identified as “Client 9” by The New York Times. The Times referenced a federal indictment against Emperors Club VIP, a high-end, international escort agency that provided call girls to clients in New York City, Washington, DC, Miami, London and Paris for between $1,000 and $5,500 per hour</p>

<p>Think a man obsessed with prostitutes and illicit sex is really going to care that a sex cult is starting in his backyard? THINK LOGICALLY. But what about the allegations I raised in the title of this little ditty? Here ... read it and rejoice! </p>

<h1>Special Prosecutor, Schneiderman, Cuomo, Hochul &amp; Hochul and NXIVM – intertwined in the swamp?</h1>
<p>To begin with, Gov. Cuomo did that on Wednesday. He appointed Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas to serve in that role and she’s promised to “vigorously investigate” the allegations.</p>
<p>So, problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Well, not exactly. Cuomo moved quickly to get this investigation into the hands of a political friend – just like he quickly pushed for Schneiderman to resign – mostly because he hates Schneiderman and views him as a dangerous political rival. So, just because we have a Special Prosecutor handling the case, don’t expect justice to necessarily prevail.</p>
<p>Schneiderman deserves the same kind of treatment he was so good at dishing out.</p>
<p>But Cuomo, who still thinks he has a shot to be President, has his own unopened closet. And Schneiderman supposedly had the keys to it. Of course, those keys won’t work anymore unless Schneiderman passes them on to someone with “clean hands” (Good luck finding such a person in Albany).</p>
<h1>And let’s not forget that while he was Attorney General, Cuomo did a number of things to help out NXIVM, the sex slaver cult.</h1>
<p>First, he refused for months to investigate the “mystery child” who turned out to be Raniere’s own kid, Gaelen, Then, when Cuomo was finally pressured into doing something, the NYS Police who were assigned to do the investigation quickly moved away from looking into Gaelen’s origins and, instead, opened up an investigation that led to bogus criminal computer trespass charges being brought against three of Raniere’s most outspoken critics: John Tighe, Joe OHara, and Toni Natalie.</p>
<p>Cuomo launched a half-hearted effort to investigate some of the other criminal activities that Raniere and NXIVM were involved in. But as soon as the Bronfman sisters’ names came up, the two Assistant AGs who were assigned to the case actually sent an email saying, “Please don’t send us any more materials on NXIVM.”</p>

<h1>“Please don’t send us any more materials on NXIVM.”</h1>

           So The Clintons knew of Keith Raniere in 1992. Knew he was a narcissistic POS! In other word, that he was like them. Probably like looking into a mirror. In 1998, Raniere begins the infamous NXIVM sex cult and SKANKLES follows on his heels beginning her solo politcal career where? IN NEW YORK! What a fucking coincidence! Everyone wondered why she came to NY, but we wonder no more. THINK LOGICALLY. Who was Attorney General at that time? ELLIOT FUCKING SPITZER!
          </p>
          <p>
           Pataki was governor when NXIVM was formed, but who followed Pataki? ELLIOT SPITZER! Yes, Spitzer was elected governor in 2007! But is this the same Elliot Spitzer that was forced to resign due to a sex scandal? Oh, you would be so right!

            He was not prepared for what Spitzer said next: “I have to resign — as early as tomorrow, the Times will report that I have been involved with prostitutes — I can’t continue as governor.” ...
           </p>
           <p>
            By the afternoon of March 10, 2008, as Spitzer met with Constantine in what had become the frantic huddles — including his wife, Silda, and sister, Emily — at his Fifth Avenue home, Spitzer was identified as “Client 9” by The New York Times. The Times referenced a federal indictment against Emperors Club VIP, a high-end, international escort agency that provided call girls to clients in New York City, Washington, DC, Miami, London and Paris for between $1,000 and $5,500 per hour

            Special Prosecutor, Schneiderman, Cuomo, Hochul &amp; Hochul and NXIVM – intertwined in the swamp?
           </h1>
           <p>
            To begin with, Gov. Cuomo did that on Wednesday. He appointed Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas to serve in that role and she’s promised to “vigorously investigate” the allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, problem solved, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, not exactly. Cuomo moved quickly to get this investigation into the hands of a political friend – just like he quickly pushed for Schneiderman to resign – mostly because he hates Schneiderman and views him as a dangerous political rival. So, just because we have a Special Prosecutor handling the case, don’t expect justice to necessarily prevail.
           </p>
           <p>
            Schneiderman deserves the same kind of treatment he was so good at dishing out.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Cuomo, who still thinks he has a shot to be President, has his own unopened closet. And Schneiderman supposedly had the keys to it. Of course, those keys won’t work anymore unless Schneiderman passes them on to someone with “clean hands” (Good luck finding such a person in Albany).
           </p>
           <h1>
            And let’s not forget that while he was Attorney General, Cuomo did a number of things to help out NXIVM, the sex slaver cult.
           </h1>
           <p>
            First, he refused for months to investigate the “mystery child” who turned out to be Raniere’s own kid, Gaelen, Then, when Cuomo was finally pressured into doing something, the NYS Police who were assigned to do the investigation quickly moved away from looking into Gaelen’s origins and, instead, opened up an investigation that led to bogus criminal computer trespass charges being brought against three of Raniere’s most outspoken critics: John Tighe, Joe OHara, and Toni Natalie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cuomo launched a half-hearted effort to investigate some of the other criminal activities that Raniere and NXIVM were involved in. But as soon as the Bronfman sisters’ names came up, the two Assistant AGs who were assigned to the case actually sent an email saying, “Please don’t send us any more materials on NXIVM.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>

I flip-flopped back and forth, but then the dramatic evidence of that branding emerged. It resonated as true for me, but all the pieces weren't there yet.

            Stormy Daniels is not good for Trump.

            At the very least Stormy Daniels revealed that Trump was with her when Melania was pregnant.

           <p>
            At the very worst, the Stormy Daniels case is exposing Michael Cohen's business dealings which seem to a pay to play scheme for access to the Trump.

            This is nonsense.  She moved to NY because it's a reliably Democratic State and the Senior Senator from NY just announced he was not running again

            And Chappaqua is not near Albany.  It's much, much closer to NYC heart of financial power and media power and the UN and where Bill Clinton would open his office.  It's the perfect place for an ex-first lady to launch a political career.

             As a matter of fact,
             <strong>
              Raniere – who led NXIVM with an iron fist – hated Hillary Clinton
             </strong>
             . He called her “a cunt” many times. He gave her money, true, but that was only to get her to help him get enemies indicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Raniere preferred Trump for president.
             </strong>
             I know of no instance where Trump ever met Raniere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Overall, Raniere preferred Republicans, but Democrats were willing to help him. Raniere hired Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand’s father [her stepmother was a member of the cult.] He ordered Clare Bronfman to support Gillibrand financially.  Clare and Sara Bronfman and Nancy Salzman attended the Clinton Global Initiative.  NXIVM supported Albany County DA David Soares, now disgraced AG Eric Schneiderman and Lt Gov. Kathy Hochul.
            </p>
            <p>
             Democrats were willing to take Bronfman money. Raniere was willing to use them to protect his cult and go after enemies.

            Skankles moved to Chappaqua because it's ritzy and exclusive, close to Manhattan where Bill was setting up offices post-Presidency, and she could scam NYers into voting her into the Senate by becoming a NY resident.  Also, Chappaqua is over 100 miles from the very un-ritzy Albany, it's a 2 hour drive at least.

             But the point was why New York? She never lived here. What did she do? Throw a dart at a map of the U.S.? An old map -- one that had borders? [couldn't resist!] Even if she chose the state because it's traditionally lib, there was a huge obstacle in the way -- JFK, JR. Oops, obstacle gone! It's amazing how everyone just seems to die from these bizarre accidents ... although some swore they saw a missile strike the plane. But you know the media ... they're paid to look good and not to investigate. They probably have a lot of secrets in their closets, also.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the move to Chappaqua needs to be looked at from the viewpoint of overall strategy ... and the uniqueness of it following upon the heels of Raniere moving to NY, Spitzer winning as AG, etc.

             Just want to make sure you saw the recent add in the comments section about Stormy Daniels also being known by ''Stormy Water''. Q's WATCH THE WATER post really begins to make sense as does the setting of the stage and watching ''THE SHOW''. Doesn't that sort of mean someone is acting? And Daniels' attorney is facing all sort of trouble now. Maybe he's connected to something and a weak link. By Daniels saying she didn't pay, it'll set off a firestorm to find out who is paying Avenatti ... this is getting interesting.

            While this is very interesting, I don't find the images of Stormy's alleged branding scar to be very convincing.

             Well, the photos are convincing to me IF they're not Photoshopped. That's the question for me.

             The guest poster drew his conclusion from watching video of Daniels. Now all of us are not willing to sit through hours of porn, BUT it would be the determining factor for me. If that raised brand is underneath the tattoo like the pictures show and what is purported by this person, then she has been branded and that's it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other evidence ... and it is more of a nudge in the direction of it being real .... was Daniels' own statements. First, she said it wasn't there .. and then alleged it was the tummy tuck incision. Why didn't she just say the photos are fake and to watch her videos? Instead, she lies, lies again, and points to more photos which would have been Photoshopped. Plus the fact that branding is not huge. It wouldn't even be apparent in most shots. The light would have to be right. That's why watching the video would be the only way since she's moving and the angle of the light is constantly changing.
            </p>

             But thanks for the read. Appreciate it.

               When I read what she's doing, I really do doubt her -- and this. I guess the thing is the pieces fit both ways. Like Stormy Daniels being friends or at least friendly on Twitter:

              <p>
               I mean, you could look at it the usual way and say, "Of course, they're friends! They're on the same side!"
              </p>
              <p>
               Or you could look at it the other way and say, "Of course, they're not friends! Daniels is a mole and being a mole she would get close to Legend/Teigen to find out more."
              </p>
              <p>
               Yeah, so what I'm saying is I'm going through what you're going through. And Q might not have been talking about her ... but there's her attorney going ballistic talking about collussion and other nonsense that has nothing to do with breaking non-disclosure agreements.

              Yes.  Also I felt Guiliani disappeared after the election to work on prosecution.  I dont think this fake letter was an accident either.

               I read that message from Giuliani within hours after he posted it on his webpage.
There was a flurry of denials and obfuscations surrounding its authenticity and then Rudy immediately dropped off the radar. This all occurred just as Pizzagate notoriety  was picking up steam.
I have no doubt that it was a genuine piece by RM and this entire matter will shortly see the light of day as the now 30,000 plus sealed indictments are revealed.

                Yes I feel exactly the same, I absolutely loved Guiliani as a mayor, and a prosecutor.  In my lifetime NY has never seen or experienced   a better representative.

             Maybe I' so infatuated with the idea that I'm making it so, but things can be seen through that perspective and fit. And the hot potato is in the pedo's corner. Stormy's lawyer now has to explain how he knew about Trump's bank intel. What he comes up with should be interesting.

            It fits well with Trumps 2013 tweet about Weiner, Spitzer and Schneiderman being creeps. I am still unsure though about Stormy being a plant for team Trump. She would go with whoever paid the highest dollar. Like the new nickname... Scarfy Shankles, gotta hide that back brace, lol.

             And I don't have a problem with people having their own opinion. Seems all hell is breaking loose amongst pizzagate independent journalists. Just because someone doesn't agree with something somebody's said doesn't make them a traitor. And the battle lines are being drawn because of Q. I included what he posted because it goes along with this scenario. But whether Q is right or wrong, or whether she's a plant or not remains to be seen.

             Yes, it is plausible, but did it happen? I believe it did. Unless she were being blackmailed to bring the lawsuit against our POTUS, then I can't see she'd have a reason to go public this way. I mean, the money would be there either way.

             Thanks so much! Appreciate it. As for the question:

             <p>
              “I’m not here to talk about my movies or my physical attributes or go on television and act like an air head,” Daniels told a New Orleans TV station. “I take my country and my government extremely seriously.”

            <p>
             I think that about sums it up. I have no doubt it was what caught the attention of NXIVM. They were all about honey traps, but also in building a political constituency. She'd fit that role perfectly. They could have done a lot with her and by dangling The Executive Success Program [or whatever they were calling it back then], they might have convinced her to come onboard. Especially when they were affiliated with so many politcians and big-time donors.

             It could. Or NXIVM might have been demanding it of her. Forgot the percentage they demanded.

            Oh, and another article wouldn't fit either. It concerns that Chappaqua home acquired in 1999. There was a teensy-weensy fire, but I'm sure it was nothing to see so move along ... especially since it was updated in 2018? Why? Did the original copy say too much?

             A fire broke out and was quickly extinguished Wednesday at a building on the property of Bill and Hillary Clinton in Chappaqua, New York, a town north of New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fire was in a facility used by the Secret Service on the Clinton property in a building not connected to their home, Nick Merrill, a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, tweeted.

               Yes. it was. And it was DeBlasio who a staffer arrested. Jacob Schwartz was President of the Manhattan Young Democrats.

                On Thursday, 29-year-old Jacob Schwartz was still considered to be a rising star within New York City’s Democrat machine, holding a position in Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration and the presidency of the Manhattan Young Democrats.

                On Friday, it was revealed that Schwartz had been indicted for possessing one of the most sickening caches of child pornography imaginable.

            And the proof of the overzealous, set-up-by-a-porn-star prosecutors unintentionally seizing the evidence again 2013 evidence against Schneiderman is validated in the link below. Due to those goddamn word constraints, I couldn't squeeze it in above. Curses, VOAT! &gt;

            <p>
             The FBI raid on Michael Cohen may have captured information about two women who say they were “sexually victimized” by ousted state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a lawyer claimed Friday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Upstate attorney Peter Gleason wrote to Manhattan federal Judge Kimba Wood — who’s overseeing a review of documents seized in the raid on President Trump’s “fixer” — asking her to seal any files concerning the two alleged victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gleason says the two women individually came to him in 2012 and 2013 claiming Schneiderman had been “sexually inappropriate” with them.
            </p>
            <p>
             He says he advised the women against going to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance because the DA had ignored his cases in the past — but he discussed the matter with pal and ex-Post reporter Steve Dunleavy, who said he’d bring it up with Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time, Schneiderman was suing the future president’s failed Trump University — and Trump was flirting with the idea of running for governor.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He said, ‘I could get that over to Trump or to Trump’s office.’ The next day, I got a call from Cohen,” Gleason told The Post, adding that he got the women’s permission to speak with Trump’s personal attorney.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I thought it would’ve been good because if Trump had followed through with his pledge run for New York State governor, then he’d be a sympathetic ear.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Dunleavy told The Post on Friday that he remembers Gleason telling him about the women — but that he never spoke to Trump about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly after Gleason says he spoke to Cohen, Trump tweeted: “Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone – next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner,” referring to disgraced state politicians Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner.

            So now that they realize the mistake, they're scrambling to undo it by having Kimba ''Playboy'' Woods suppress it.
