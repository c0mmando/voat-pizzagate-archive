Carrie Fisher was for child protection. Can\'t find ANY quotes, but I remember she wrote that what humans had protected children from for centuries, children can now see every day, over and over, on TV or the internet. She may have been more deeply involved in child protection than we know. And her mother would have known. They both grew up in Pedowood. I wouldn\'t be surprised. Carrie was good people. She was adamant that her daughter not go into show business, although she has.
Remember that anything investigative out in the open isn\'t real. Only the covert is real.</p>',
