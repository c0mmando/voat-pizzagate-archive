            What is it with stupid misspellings? Do people think it's a sign of authenticity? Like being uneducated means you're honest? When I see a common word like 'arrest' misspelled twice in a headline, I consider that reading the post is a waste of time. If you know you can't spell use a spell-checker.

            Would be nice and encouraging, knowing that there's an army of people power chomping at the bit too dig through any info legally available, if just once someone from some agency would step up and put the masses to work on some socially responsible investigating, as in give some specific direction as to what we can provide them that would be helpful, even FBIanon didn't really do that, just dropped some breadcrumbs and stepped back to see where the we went next. Don't want to be controlled op, but have to think that something along the lines of "any information you have on x, would be helpful, submit to y". Nothing if the sort of course, as some have said, crickets. But I do think there is mixed emotion about this brand of vigilantism and association with it, where there is some risk of running off the rails on witch hunts. The CPP fake news story was an easy one to tell playing on people's fears of unsubstantiated allegations, ala Salem witch trials, et al

            I don't give a rat's behind about FBIanon, 4chan, 8chan, or whatever.  All I know, is that MK Ultra exists, CP exists, the articles in the papers were for real about Reagan and GHW Bush and the Boys Town Boys and Barney Frank supplying his apartment for sex.  But yes, so many people on here have been cheering for Trump and Sessions like they will be the saviors our children will be waiting for.  Well, guess what, I thought BO would be my savior too.  Am I hoping they are?  Yes!  But I also know that we may just have to be the saviors our children have been waiting for.  I am hoping the big arrests go down this week and the pedo elites will be taken in handcuffs, with my fingers crossed.

            I am with the OP. Every day that goes by without an arrest or elite suicide I am losing hope that PG is real. We may have all been played by 4chan trolls. And no, I am not a shill from CtR. Stating a number like 72 is quite precise, which makes the timing being off questionable - the poster was precise as to the number that would be busted, but totally off as to the timing? That discepancy is hard to accept.

             Just because this possibly gets covered up again, doesn't mean it isn't REAL! These well organized, and powerful pedo rings have been operating in this country for decades. This is well documented back to Boys Town, the Presidio scandal, and the McMartin Preschool case to name a few. If you research all of those you can see how they are connected to each other. They have been successful in making the public believe these are all isolated incidents and unreleased to a broader "conspiracy", but once again that's a lie to keep the larger system in tact! We ALL need to brush up on our pedo ring history to learn more about what's happening now, because nothing has changed except some of the names.

             Regardless of if there are ever arrests - PG is real I was looking it all up myself from day one, 4chan trolls can't create mountains of legit circumstantial evidence.  If comet ping pong dude wasn't such a creepy freak this wouldn't have had legs

            So there was more than one? This might explain things. Thought the earlier one was the same as the one who did the Q and A.
