<p>Based on the interview, the identity of the man who talked about Heather being skinned had a back office on the set of Home Alone 2, meaning that that man’s identity must be one of these people OR an executive at Hughes Entertainment. Fox was merely a distributor, so its unlikely that a Fox executive was involved.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h1B_vcarg1E">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h1B_vcarg1E</a> A Family Again. Remember that video in the Heather O’Rourke thread when Winkler claimed Heather’s death was a suicide? This video explains all that. Henry Winkler was the producer. Judith Barsi played a major role. That interview talking about Heather O’Rourke mixed up stories regarding Judith Barsi. I have reason to suspect that Winkler might know what happened to Judith Barsi.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greatertalent.com/speaker/henrywinkler/">https://www.greatertalent.com/speaker/henrywinkler/</a> Henry Winkler was a YALE graduate. Massive red flag. Greater Talent Network is a subsidiary of United Talent Agency.</p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Happy Days: </p>
<p>*Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. </p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Chris Colombus (depends on of film directors are executives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           Relevant thread regarding the Black Friday Reveal of the Harry Potter series being rife with sexual abuse. Keep in mind, Chris Columbus was the director of Harry Potter.

           A Family Again. Remember that video in the Heather O’Rourke thread when Winkler claimed Heather’s death was a suicide? This video explains all that. Henry Winkler was the producer. Judith Barsi played a major role. That interview talking about Heather O’Rourke mixed up stories regarding Judith Barsi. I have reason to suspect that Winkler might know what happened to Judith Barsi.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>
             Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.

           *Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.

          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>
             Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.

           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Chris Colombus (depends on of film directors are executives).
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag.
            </p>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

            All this talk about Hughes freaks me out bc, as some of you know from long ago posts, I live 5 mins from a now-defunct college that John Podesta once worked at. My husband is from this small “old money” town along the North Shore of Chicago... to the point that you guys aren’t gonna believe this... a guy he grew up with and currently works for bought and lives in John Hughes old home, the home he lived in with his family up until his untimely death, after which he was buried in a non-descript plot in the local cemetery.

            Not sure if this has been brought up, but when you read the comments on that blind( 1'rst from bottom?), they are all arguing on the inception of the DVD being a basis for the timeline. Maybe the ghost writer was a little drunksy wunksy and meant LaserDisc - Wikipedia. I remember them, and they were the technology that eventually made VCH obsolete. To give those machines away would cost a wasted fortune in those days, but would not only be affordable to Hollywood, but might have been gifted by MCA DiscoVision in the United States in 1978. One might say she died 10 years later than that, but it would still be inconsequential to the investigation because we do not have a timeline for the blind. Asia was still renting those things while the USA was quietly switching to DVD. Up to 2002 is the real timeline for the foggy blind, in my opinion. Scumbags gave the kids free candy and outdated electronic devices in boxes.

             That stuff about laser disc is very interesting. They could be “proto DVDs”.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree Hollywood could easily arrange to requisition some of that stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the requsistion theory is correct, then I’d place the timeline at the early 90’s. If not, then 2002 is likey.

              No, they would have owned warehouses of those things set to go to Yokahama. They would also have gotten a hold of the next technology! That would explain the further use in Asia and the quick switch to DVD. Funny thing is, that the blue ray was actually better technology than the next step at the time. Proto DVD's? What part of play a movie on a shiny spinny thing do you think is different? Size?

               Either way, the main point of showing the blind is more about the commentary regarding Columbus, which was certainly eye opening.

            Hi! I’m new here, but have somewhat followed PizzaGate for a few years now. I know the rabbit hole goes deep, but I’m not familiar with all the details.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ve heard the suspicions about Heather’s death, and given what I know about Hollywood, I don’t doubt the suspicions at all. I am curious though about her cause of death and any injuries she may have had. Is this simply speculation or have y’all stumbled across something that outright states these injuries were present? I’ve tried to scan through the things about Heather, but this is my first time using Voat, and I can’t  find parts 1-10.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m a nurse, and as disgusting as the entire topic is, I would be very willing to help investigate the physical affects of sexual trauma on a child. Ofc it will all be wildly under reported given the nature of how the injuries were sustained. I tend to roll my eyes at the assertion that sepsis rarely kills child rape victims. The average person isn’t going to let a child lay there and die of septic shock, it’s an ugly way to go and you have a decent bit of warning that the child needs medical help (especially if the parents may be unaware that their child was raped and have no reason to feel like they need to hide anything). I feel like the studies on this are deceptive and would be more interested in seeing the numbers of septic shock cases in general rather than just the deaths. I will say though that in nursing we are taught how to digitally assist someone that is compacted (tmi, I know) they STRESS how important it is to be VERY gentle because of the risk of injury that could lead to sepsis. The risk is huge when using only 1 finger in one quick and clean motion during a medical procedure, so wouldn’t the risks be even higher in the case of sexual trauma with a child? I’m rambling, and the tldr is I just find it doubtful that there are few cases of sepsis involving this type of abuse.

             Ronald Reagan almost died from eating white bread. A small cut out of sight, or doctors finger can lead to major problems quick. The antibodies start attacking the immune system. Autoimmune disease.

             I had also always been under the impression that her “official” cause of death was relating to being horribly compacted (which REGARDLESS of the reason behind it is never imo an acceptable reason for a child to die. This isn’t a condition that happens in one day and then BOOM the person dies.) Is this true or am I just mistaken in the official narrative?

              The cover up was in an alleged congenital stenosis along with Chrons disease. “The most effective lies are based on a truth.” The truth being that Chrons is more common in females.

             <p>
              I’ll have to look up the other parts (this is a year’s worth of investigation), but I have stuff about how the congenital is BS (ie barring a statistical anomaly how did she have that yet go completely asymptomatic until the last year of her life?)

             Is this of any help?  I have been having a hard time finding anything about execs with Hughes Entertainment.  The co. is now defunct but he partnered with quite a few cos. like Warner and Disney at one point.

              Thanks.  I have been on the down low but will help all that I can.  I presume that is Hughes as in Howard.  Hope I come up with something.

             The reason the awful stuff keeps happening is the silence !!!  The family guardians must speak up!  Our children need a voice.  If we narrowed it down to these suspects then we all know the police can do even better!

              It's like the Police Dept's Code of Silence.  I believe that most of the Guardians are probably scared out of their wits to open their mouths.  Look at all the stars that are dropping like flies.  Also some may be involved themselves.   You are correct though.  If 2 or 3 banded together and stood strong with a really good lawyer.  It might make a really big difference.

               The Police were chosen for their corruptness, as were the parent's most likely. Compromised, or taken advantage of. Those are the choices out there.

                Makes sense.  The LAPD is corrupt to the core.  Also yes, the weaker the parents the easier to get to their Children.  I can't believe that so many parents never had an inkling of what was happening.

                  When I see Children from the old sitcoms (and new ones) it makes me sick.  I know that almost all of them have been abused.  Some severely.  So many have committed suicide.  Or have been suicided when they speak out.  This is still happening.   Yep.  PDs label it a suicide and the papers announce it as same and before you know it the person disappears.   What in the world goes through the minds of people that accept this as truth.  Sad and sick.

            You know what occurred to me? Your series on Heather would be even more powerful if we all dug up some statistics and or medical treatment information on health complications related to child rape. I did a cursory look, and there wasn't much. Someone who knows a physician with better access to medical journals may be able to find more. Most relevant was this:

            <p>
             Homicides exclusively due to genital trauma have not been widely reported, and anorectal trauma in sexual assaults is uncommon. We describe a case of a 45-year-old white woman who sustained devastating homicidal colorectal trauma that served as a primary cause of death in the setting of rape. Our patient sustained a 15-cm laceration of the anterior rectal wall and ultimately died of peritonitis and sepsis.
             <strong>
              Death from rectal perforation and sepsis in the setting of sexual assault is rare and has only been documented in 3 other cases, 2 pediatric patients and 1 elderly debilitated patient.
             </strong>
             Other representative and unique methods of perforation are reviewed along with a brief discussion of the development of peritonitis after perforating colorectal trauma.

             I know it happens when babies and toddlers get raped, so I doubt it is
             <em>

             </em>
             rare, it's just not documented.

             I imagine when a child is anally raped by several people, it will happen even when the child is older. (Sorry,

             , I might not remember the details correctly - I think Heather was raped anally?)
            </p>
            <p>
             It may also happen when a child/adult is penetrated with objects.

              When I was but a lad. I was forced to play with another kid who constantly reeked of poo. A funk he carried all day. (We were both eight or nine at the time.) My mom worked with his. She told me he was back from a special hospital. After a couple play dates I told my mom I didnt like going over there. The smell was too much. My mom was upset for my reasons but let me stop. Fast forward to high school. I am in the same class and friends with his cousin. I ask why he always smells of ass. To my utter horror he replies he was raped for years as a small child and lost the ability to control his bowels at a normal level. That hospital he came home from was for sexual abuse. Sometimes kids can be assholes. I feel bad for the dude.

                I yelled at my mom later that evening. She knew what happened. If I was told he was hurt by people and this was the after effect. I would have sucked it up and still played with him. I still feel bad for the dude.

            I can barely make it through your posts but I never miss reading them. As heinous as the details are we must continue the posts and comments or the truth will never come out. The new addition with Chris Columbus is one of extreme interest and makes sense. Yes there has been talk about Harry Potter stars being abused as well. Thank you for your tireless efforts in uncovering this horrid crime. No one,especially a Child should suffer such horrors. RIP Heather and Judith.
