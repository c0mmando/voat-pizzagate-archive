            Amazon is quite a communications and trafficking network --
And they seem to be working with right wing to destroy our Post Office or co-opt it ...
You'll see Post Office trucks out on Sundays delivering for Amazon.

             Great point, but right wing? You mean Deep State, but the issue you raised is correct.
            </p>
            <p>
             There had been talk of privatizing the USPS and I'll bet Mr. Jeff CIA Bezos would love the opportunity to read through our mail. Think of the Cannibal Cabal of having no more fear of "things" .... we're talking "dirty things" that make them a lot of money ... going through the mail without fear of them being reported.

              Right ... right wing ... 
Unless you somehow think Elites in control of our government and both parties are liberals?
The GOP a long time ago set up the US Post Office for failure/bankruptcy by making them pay
something like 70 years in advance for benefits for workers ... some of whom weren't even any 
longer with them.  It's a scam.
And Post Office was set up by Constitutional power.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nor have Dems being making any noise about it.
Generally, Bernie Sanders has been the whistleblower making clear what's really going on
and how they work their crimes and corruption.
             </p>
             <p>
              They'll privatize anything if we let them ... even water and seeds.
             </p>
             <p>
              Right wing has been selling "privatization" for decades now -- 
Wall Street Journal headed up the campaign to destroy Social Security ...
Social Security actually costs our government NOTHING.
In fact, Social Security Trust Fund PAYS the government 3% every year
to administer the program.
             </p>
             <p>
              Only reason Social Security is in the budget is to use the SURPLUS to hide
the true costs of the MIC/Intelligence Complex -- probably about 80 cents of 
every tax dollar going to them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Social Security was never intended to run a SURPLUS as it was a "pay as you go"
system only intended to raise as much as was needed each month/year to cover 
what was required to pay benefits to retirees.  It was re-engineered to create a SURPLUS
which is probably well over $100 BILLION a year now ... which the right wing continues to
"borrow" and use for tax cuts for rich -- and for wars which benefit Elites.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Deep State" also refers to Elites who control government and national parties.
Call them Elites -- whatever.  Basically Royals morphed into corporations -- and
we have corporate-Fascism.  All the same thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again -- Devils, Demons, Satan don't exist -- 
The violence, however, is real and intended to scare you.
"All the world is meant to live in fear."
             </p>
             <p>
              They'll use whatever they can to create FEAR.

               <p>
                Koch Bros. recruited Bill Clinton for Democratic Leadership Council which was the corporate wing

Koch Bros. and other large corporations had their representatives on the DLC Executive Board.

            It seems the Newsweek article is about guys who visited prostitutes.   I don't know if this meets your definition of participating in sex trafficking.  It seems that some pimps required a work email to determine if the customers were not cops.

            I would guess these guys would be guilty of solicitation, not trafficking.

              Misogyny (/mɪˈsɒdʒɪni/) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls. Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including social exclusion, sex discrimination, hostility, androcentrism, patriarchy, male privilege, belittling of women, violence against women, and sexual objectification.[1][2] Misogyny can occasionally be found within sacred texts of religions and mythologies, and various influential Western philosophers and thinkers have been described as misogynistic.[1]

            All it says is MS and AMZ employees solicited prostitutes and reviewed their services online.  We're some girls trafficked? Probably. We're some underage? Unlikely since they were going after posters on review sites. Children don't get "reviewed" though it's possible for some to mistakenly slip through temporarily.

            The fact that Amazon was allowed to operate and grow for 20 years without needing to show a profit should be reason for suspicion. The intended function is to totally dominated and subjugate as much online sales/ sellers as possible.

             Many of the organic products that I used to buy at Whole Foods were switched over to 
Amazon.  Now that Amazon owns Whole Foods those products are reappearing on the
Whole Foods Shelves.  Meanwhile profits that would have been made by those organic
companies were lowered by Amazon ... not only by decreasing the prices when sold by
Amazon, but when customers no longer were familiar with the products they used to see
regularly on Whole Foods shelves.  Big loss of profits for organic companies.

              They have to explain away why all these companies are doing bad around America, while they lie about the economy, so they credit the success of their spook front company, even though it also loses money. The economy is finished but is being propped up indefinately by Central Bank magic money creation. They neeed a big  event to eventually explain why their great economy turns to disaster. There is no plausable reason other than they have been lying and hiding it. Enter their Trump card. At some point, they will fabricate an event, and blame the implosion on the event. That is when you can expect white hat Trump to put things on lockdown. plan we have seen coming for some time now.

               Also remember that our nation operates on a criminal economic system -- Capitalism.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was invented by "Christianity" -- Vatican -- when Feudalism was no longer sufficient to run
their Papal States.
              </p>
              <p>
               Capitalism is a system intended to move the wealth and natural resources of nations from the 
many to the few -- and it has done that successfully all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               Capitalism is an evil which can't be regulated.
              </p>
              <p>
               Capitalism isn't about competition ... it's about killing the competition.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obama never provided sufficient funds after '08 to get the economy going again ...
Obama's advisers gave him a figure deemed necessary and he only agreed to 20%
of that figure -- and then actually even less was given over to the economy.
Meanwhile, taxpayers paid for the crimes of our banks/financial institutions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Iceland had the right idea in sending them all to jail.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obama saved those corrupt companies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our US banks are laundering something like a half a TRILLION in drug money every year.
              </p>
              <p>
               Capitalism is fascism.

             That's been my point all along. Who the hell funded Bezos? Whose deep pockets were allowing Amazon to hemorrhage money all that time without complaining? Everything had to have been planned and Amazon was no normal entrepreneurial venture. Business owners needed to turn a profit. Normally, there's a bit of a cushion, but twenty years? Without Bezos panicking? Without investors panicking? No way.

             This could go in many directions. Hope the trials are covered by the media, but who wants to bet they'll be buried by REALLY important articles like our POTUS drinking diet cola.

            God, how I hate Bezos and Amazon.  We can see Bezos's thoughts on sexism by how he covered for Weinstein, but it goes a lot deeper.  His company is able to do a lot more to help in trafficking with all their shipping operations.  I propose there will be other up and coming problems for Bezos regarding the sex trafficking than just his employees being charged.  High level Amazon directors shows that possibly it could go a lot higher, up as high as the Top Dog.  Bezos himself.  Not Impossible.

             I despise Bezos and Amazon as well.  The problem is is that it could be brought down very easily, however, people are completely sucked in to online purchasing and fast shipping.  People have become conditioned to be consumers, they will never stop.  Most people who have blogs promote Amazon and at the same time are totally clueless to the fact that they are feeding the beast.  I, too, purchased from "it" at one time and tried to close the account, once I realized that it's a part of the NWO crap.  A couple years later and I still can't.  It is almost impossible.  If people would just stop consuming crap that they don't need amazon would be non-existent.....sigh.

              Hmm.  I bought a few things too.  Not much before I woke up.  I don't think I ever joined.  I think I always purchased as a Guest.  That's pretty scary not being able to unsubscribe.  I had that problem with a couple of emails I kept getting.  They are getting very cagey.

             Definitely the shipping is problematic as are all his huge warehouses. We know that warehouses are sometimes used in human trafficking. While that hasn't been proven in Bezos' case, it is a reality. And now his CIA connections? I don't know what he's positioning Amazon to be. An octopus with an arm in every industry/sector of business/politics/covert operations?
            </p>
            <p>
             Has anyone probed his background in how he managed to keep Amazon afloat for all those years while losing money? Whose deep pockets were backing him? And he never seemed worried. He was content to have a business hemorrhaging money ... why? Any other person starting a business would have panicked and not had the funds to sustain the enterprise, but Bezos? Hey, no worries! He was fine with it and now? Now he's poised to be this conglomerate that controls everything. Why people voluntarily buy and install that stupid Alexa in their homes is beyond me! Think I want Bezos spying on my family? Or, if not spying, giving him or other creeps the opportunity to. No way! Throw those Echo things out the window and smash it till it can't function.

              I was at a large party over the weekend and there was a child that received an Alexa product for a gift.  They plugged it in and it does what you tell it.  Turn the music louder, turn light off in the other room, etc.  Everyone was enamored with this thing.  Except Me.  I don't know if that thing can do the spying thing, but it scares me.  This child will probably take it home and put it in their room.  I made one small comment about how we don't know what will come out on the news about that product and how it will be one of those items that can be hacked into or has a seeing eye in it.  Wow.  Was I brought down quick.  I was accused of being a Conspiracy Monger at best.  OK.  Just Wait.  I agree.  Remember when we researched the Alexa product on here.  Not good.  Not good.

               I had the same experience! Everyone, especially the child, thought it was so awesome! It took all o had to keep my mouth shut and tell them all how stupid it is to actually pay for something to spy on your child!

                I don't know what to do about this.  Now that I know what these are all about, I feel a responsibility.  But you and I know that we will be shut down.  What to do?  I know these people, but not THAT well.  Really don't know what is happening to people that they don't see this.  I am so ditzy when it comes to tech stuff, but even I get this.  These are college educated people.  My husband said that some very educated people have the idea that they need to educate us, not the opposite.  This is really scary.  To Speak or Not To Speak.

                 It will not be shut down. It will be expanded.  Nothing wakes up sheeple, they are sheeple. Cut them lose, they will fight you more than the elite.

                Thank you for that info.  I truly believe it.  I have a feeling that soon there will be parents up in arms due to some pervert idiot hacking into these and getting info on people's kids, etc.  There was a case with a doll that had something in her that could let someone outside the house see into the child's bedroom.  It was on the news, and not some hidden article.  I hope this blows Sky High.

               This also sounds more like surveillance (of the user) than providing security:

                This is my feeling as well.  Also, I just don't trust the whole idea of him having the contract for the CIA cloud.  How do we know that info is not being shot right up into the clouds?  Anyone in bed with the CIA is not up to any good, especially for us.  Billionaires are interested in making more money not doing good for us.  I remember reading info before that this is not a safe item to have in your home.  Thanks for the link, will read.

                   NSA is as bad or worse than CIA. Their enitre existance is to put citizens under the microscope, nowhere to run nowhere to hide. Collect all data in the event anybody gets brave enough to make a stand. Then they pull out their data storage and their investigation is done.

               oh yes it can definitely do the spying thing, there was a court case ruling a while ago stating that anything these device hear can be used as evidence, which means they are storing everything and its easily retrievable.

            Amazon is a CIA front, so it is no surpise that they would be linked with this kind of conduct. The owner Jeff Bezos received a 600 million contract from the CIA. He is also the sole owner of the propaganda rag Washington Post. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla and Apple are all spook fronts, facebook likely being NSA. Recntly, I was locked out for my comment habbits, and I was informed I can only return by using my real name and giving my liscense or passport as well as other picture ID. I hate FB to begin with, so I won't be returning.

            Another interesting thing about these companies is they are some of the most heavily propped up stocks on the rigged stock "market". Central banks print money and buy their shares at  any cost despite years of losses, especially Tesla. At one point, all the companies above saw their stock crash at the same time, on the same day, and they were reset back to where they were with the manipulators citing 'software error", as if they were testing during "market" hours.
           </p>

            Yeah, keep digging on Amazon and you are sure to find more than inappropriate illegal behavior. I expect massive criminal acitivty. CIA, that is all you need to know.

             You're the first person I can recall that commented openly that both Apple and Tesla were spawned by the gov. Not to steal your thunder but to follow along those lines, this leads us to certain conclusions about some famous individuals. Steve Jobs. What exactly did he do? Following the official narrative of Elon Musk's career leads to some serious belly laughs.
            </p>
            <p>
             My personal favorite Musk propaganda is this article by Marie Claire...

             Note the 3 tricycles in the photo. You see?! It's so obvious that Elon is a hetero male with 3 kids by his ex wife. Brilliant!

              Steve Jobs did nothing. He made phones. They already existed. They used the propaganda press to make a cult of personality out of Jobs like they do to all their spook babies like Musk and Jobs. Musk has lost 100's of billions for a decade and produces an ineficient high costing car. His batteries are toxic so the cars aren't even green. We never went to Mars, NASA was a front, now Musk runs the front companies because it is private and not under scrutiny like a Gov company would be. I read Miles Mathis paper on musk, and although Miles Mathis is likely a British spook opperation, the paper rang true from start to finish.

              That was the first thing noticed, that is the agenda. Rothschild is behind PG&amp;E gaining right to water, and Amazon is gobbling up food distribution. You can expect GMO galore from all sources, which is the point of these mergers. agenda 21 calls for the seizure of sources of fuel, food, water, as well as population relocation via forced urban relocation, stripping away land rights, population reduction and more evil. The people won't do anything ever, so make plans for your own survival. This is gradual but moving at a faster pace as we speak. I would just get out of Cali, and eventually get out of the States. South East Asia is the right destination.

             I just wrote the same thing.  I also expect criminal activity.  I suspect that they are aiding and abetting in the global sex trafficking operation run by the CIA for profit and pleasures of the Elite.  Yes, I believe we have dug before, but maybe not deep enough.  It is there for the finding, I agree.
