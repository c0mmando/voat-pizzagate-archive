<p>The fictional \'Castavettes\' couple of \'Roman and Minnie Castavettes\' were clearly in reference to the real life Greek actor John Cassavetes , who played the role of Rosemary\'s husband in the film.</p>
<p>Before anyone says &quot;that \'s impossible, because the movie was based on the fictional book by Ira Levin...which included the character Roman Castavettes and his wife Minnie.&quot;..... you will have to note that the film Rosemary\'s Baby was incredibly strange , because the movie rights to the novel Rosemary\'s Baby were bought from Ira Levin, by William Castle, before Levin had even published it or even written it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>here\'s the official story , which , imo , is probably a bogus cover for the fact that Rosemary\'s Baby was probably a screenplay and film FIRST, before it became the book, hence the \'fun\' Levin had with the names in the book.</p>

<p>So , anyone ,</p>
<p>tell me how in the F else we ended up with the coincidence that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the film was being conceptualized and financed etc. before the book it was purportedly based on had even been published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the book and film ends up with main characters with names that are nearly exactly the same as the name of the actor hired to play arguably the main role in the film</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This gets even more bizarre when you learn that Greek actor John Cassavettes was, in real life, a close friend of the man who owned the Dakota apartment in which Rosemary\'s Baby was filmed.</p>
<p>Greek actor John Cassavetes acted alongside Robert Ryan in a film they made together a year before John Cassavetes acted in Rosemary\'s Baby. John Cassavetes and Robert Ryan worked together in the the 1967 film \'The Dirty Dozen\', as you can see confirm by the following movie poster for the film, listing its cast at the bottom of the poster here:</p>
<p><a href="http://letsrollforums.com//imagehosting/691258bf08cab8f21.jpgJPG">http://letsrollforums.com//imagehosting/691258bf08cab8f21.jpgJPG</a></p>
<p>So here are with the novel Rosemary\'s Baby being written with characters named after the real life actor who will play one of the lead roles, Greek actor John Cassavetes: Roman and Minnie Castavettes.</p>
<p>Further, all indications are that the characters were named after the actor, because the novel and screen play were written at the same time as the movie cast was being assembled. Further , all indications are that the novel was written about the real life apartment of Robert Ryan , because the novel had been written around Ryan\'s real life friend John Cassavetes. The main cult leader is given a Greek name , Castavettes, which is obviously just the fictional bastardization of the name Cassavetes.</p>
<p>So the clear implication by Ira Levin is that the cult has a Greek origin. Further , the name \'Roman\' Cassavetes implies a Greek-Italian aspect to the cult. (ie: A Greek Roman, or Greek Italian, Greek Orthodox) A Greek Roman would predate a christian Roman. So the name alludes to ancient pre-christian Greece. Ancient Greece has a storied history of child sacrifice. The main couple leading the cult in Rosemary\'s Baby are Greek, and occult child sacrifice is depicted in Rosemary\'s Baby.</p>
<p>Further, the film Rosemary\'s Baby implies elements of vampirism and cannibalism to the cult.</p>
<p>trivia : Rosemary is given a pendant to wear said to contain a strong smelling herb known as tannis root. Tannis root is said to be fictional, and to exist only in the film. But there is the real-life Tansy herb, used in witchcraft as an abortifacient and to bring on early menstruation, used in Ostara/Easter/Ishatar spring rites</p>
<p><a href="http://www.witchipedia.com/herb:tansy">http://www.witchipedia.com/herb:tansy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.herbal-supplement-resource.com/tansy-herbs.html">https://www.herbal-supplement-resource.com/tansy-herbs.html</a></p>
<p>This raises also the question of why they would try to mislead people and put forward the lie that the film  Rosemary\'s Baby had been &quot;based on a novel by Ira Levin&quot;.</p>
<p>When in fact all indications are that the film was conceptualized, written and produced as a film project from start to finish, and later fleshed out into a novel.</p>
<p>So, why did they not just state this as having been the truth , from the start?</p>
<p>Because it was a CIA project film from star to finish?</p>
<p>We can surmise that they probably knew that if they told the truth,  it would stand out like a sore thumb. 
Ira Levin gets this assignment to write a screenplay from William Castle.  And then Castle has to explain
why he hired Levin to write a screenplay, and for what reason he, William Castle, suddenly wanted 
a screenplay written about a satanic cult.</p>
<p>The truth is that  the CIA were  probably setting the table for the La Vey/ Manson lie to be played out a couple of years later.  The purported Manson sex cult is set to be unveiled to the news- watching public in a couple of  years.
It is going to have to both</p>
<ul>
<li>seem plausible to the general public</li>
<li>catch the interest of the public</li>
</ul>
<p>so ...
lets set up some \'conditioning of atmospheres\' , or  predictive programming , a bit in advance.
Watching this film will pique the public interest in such topics, so that when we roll out the Manson hoax on the news,  while the sex cult film Rosemary\'s Baby is still playing in movie theaters.....  the public will eat it up.</p>
<p>They\'ll not only believe every word of it, they will be interested in hearing all about it. Because they will be 
bombarded with stuff of a similar genre , like our fake Zodiac killer in 1968
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer</a></p>
<p>and fake tales of MicK Jagger delving into satanism ( \'Sympathy for the Devil\' song 1968)
etc. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy_for_the_Devil">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy_for_the_Devil</a>
Yep, we\'ll saturate rock radio with \'satanic stones music\' for months before we roll out Atkins and
Manson.</p>
<p>By the time we get done,  the public will be busting down the door for more information on Manson and his purported satanic cult.</p>
<p>And they will believe every word of it.</p>',

             right you are, and the ancient Greeks built many of the huge Egyptian ruins and temples .  Ties in with the Eleusinian Mystery Schools which Aleister Crowley was studying  and also the Greek society elite frats and sororities...the kykeon and the secret rites.

                  when people at ellis island were asked to write their names, some couldn't write in english and had to mark an x. 
since the cross is superstitious in jewish culture, they had to draw a circle, or in the language Yiddish, a "kykel."
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  a racial slur for jewish people

                <p>
                 so this is interesting ...
Could kykeon reference the yiddish word for circle also?

                <p>

             I disagree. Sharon Tate was not murdered. The Manson murders have been exposed as an elaborate psy-op conducted by the 7th Psychological Operations Group led by Colonel Michael Aquino and ASCI Colonel Paul Jame Tate, Sharon Tate's father, who worked with Colonel Michael Aquino at The Presidio San Francisco
            </p>
            <p>
             ACSI Colonel Paul James Tate was assistant chief of staff for intelligence at the Sixth Region Army Air Defense Command at The Presidio/Fort Baker.

               Mathis pilfered some of my Manson research off of letsroll forums, I am almost certain . He posted his Manson
paper about three weeks after I broke some of the most important clues to the hoax at letsroll.  It could
be coincidence, but I doubt it.

               yes, extremely poor-quality crime scene and autopsy photos...finally explains why.  Those blurry crime scene photos of Tate....come on ...it was 1969, they had better quality cameras and picture resolution in 1969....yet you can barely see a thing.  It looks like she lay down and they poured red dye all over her and that's about it. The autopsy pics are even worse, extremely crudely altered.  go look at the Folger autopsy pics, like someone blotted 'wounds' onto the pics with a bingo blotcher.  ridiculous

               if so, its been very well concealed, I checked the geneology sites, found not much, but its probably rhe same group of people. The Folgers family  now owns huge slave-wage level ops in Vietnam to grow coffee, which was their family incentive to derail the peace movement and help fake the Manson hoax.
They wanted the lucrative coffee and cocoa and opium- growing regions  of Vietnam and stopped at nothing to get them.  Folgers helped Skull n' Bones wipe out Vietnamese resistance to Mao. Skull n' Bones got the opium, Folgers got the coffee, and please help research this ,  I would like to find out now Nestle ties in with Operation Chaos, because Nestle has a huge stake in Vietnam now too. I dont' have time to research it.

             A third woman came forward Tuesday to accuse Roman Polanski of sexual assault when she was a minor, four decades after he went on the run for raping another girl.
The woman, identified only as Robin, told a news conference in Los Angeles she was "sexually victimized" by the legendary French-Polish film director when she was just 16, in 1973.

             Is it the same? Not doubting it, just wondering whether you've seen a close-up. Also: Why would she wear this pedant? Why did she come forward, and accused him?

             disregard previous question, I realize that I must have clicked on your image link , and it was showing
in your post, I must have forgotten that I clicked it. I thought that it was embedded in some way to
show automatically.  thanks for your help editing!

              I believe that when you copied and pasted the link, you included the second JPG.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that you have taken that out the link works.
             </p>
             <p>
              If that doesn't answer your question then I'm afraid I don't know.

               how did you get the movie poster image to show up in your post? 
when I post the link to the image it only posts an image link, not as the image itself.
