Rabbi Nuchem Rosenberg—who is 63 with a long, graying beard—recently sat down with me to explain what he described as a &quot;child-rape assembly line&quot; among sects of fundamentalist Jews. He cleared his throat. &quot;I\'m going to be graphic,&quot; he said. 
A member of Brooklyn\'s Satmar Hasidim fundamentalist branch of Orthodox Judaism, Nuchem designs and repairs mikvahs in compliance with Torah Law. The mikvah is a ritual Jewish bathhouse used for purification. Devout Jews are required to cleanse themselves in the mikvah on a variety of occasions: Women must visit following menstruation, and men have to make an appearance before the High Holidays, such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Many of the devout also purify themselves before and after the act of sex and before the Sabbath. 
On a visit to Jerusalem in 2005, Rabbi Rosenberg entered into a mikvah in one of the holiest neighborhoods in the city, Mea She\'arim. &quot;I opened a door that entered into a schvitz,&quot; he told me. &quot;Vapors everywhere, I can barely see. My eyes adjust, and I see an old man, my age, long white beard, a holy-looking man, sitting in the vapors. On his lap, facing away from him, is a boy, maybe seven years old. And the old man is having anal sex with this boy.&quot; </p>
<p>Rabbi Rosenberg paused, gathered himself, and went on: &quot;This boy was speared on the man like an animal, like a pig, and the boy was saying nothing. But on his face—fear. The old man [looked at me] without any fear, as if this was common practice. He didn\'t stop. I was so angry, I confronted him. He removed the boy from his penis, and I took the boy aside. I told this man, \'It\'s a sin before God, a mishkovzucher. What are you doing to this boy\'s soul? You\'re destroying this boy!\' He had a sponge on a stick to clean his back, and he hit me across the face with it. \'How dare you interrupt me!\' he said. I had heard of these things for a long time, but now I had seen.&quot; 
The child sex abuse crisis in ultra-Orthodox Judaism, like that in the Catholic Church, has produced its share of shocking headlines in recent years. In New York, and in the prominent Orthodox communities of Israel and London, allegations of child molestation and rape have been rampant. The alleged abusers are schoolteachers, rabbis, fathers, uncles—figures of male authority. The victims, like those of Catholic priests, are mostly boys. Rabbi Rosenberg believes around half of young males in Brooklyn\'s Hasidic community—the largest in the United States and one of the largest in the world—have been victims of sexual assault perpetrated by their elders. Ben Hirsch, director of Survivors for Justice, a Brooklyn organization that advocates for Orthodox sex abuse victims, thinks the real number is higher. &quot;From anecdotal evidence, we\'re looking at over 50 percent. It has almost become a rite of passage.&quot; 
Ultra-Orthodox Jews who speak out about these abuses are ruined and condemned to exile by their own community. Dr. Amy Neustein, a nonfundamentalist Orthodox Jewish sociologist and editor of Tempest in the Temple: Jewish Communities and Child Sex Scandals, told me the story of a series of Hasidic mothers in Brooklyn she got to know who complained that their children were being preyed on by their husbands. </p>
<p>In these cases, the accused men &quot;very quickly and effectively engage the rabbis, the Orthodox politicians, and powerful Orthodox rabbis who donate handsomely to political clubs.&quot; The goal, she told me, is &quot;to excise the mother from the child\'s life.&quot; Rabbinical courts cast the mothers aside, and the effects are permanent. The mother is &quot;amputated.&quot; One woman befriended by Dr. Neustein, a music student at a college outside New York, lost contact with all six of her children, including an infant she was breastfeeding at the time of their separation. </p>
<p>Rabbi Rosenberg inspects a ritual purification bath, known as a mikvah. In 2005, he witnessed a young boy being raped inside a similar bath. 
Seven years ago, Rabbi Rosenberg started blogging about sex abuse in his community and opened a New York City hotline to field sex abuse complaints. He has posted appeals on YouTube, appeared on CNN, and given speeches across the US, Canada, Israel, and Australia. Today, he is the lone whistleblower among the Satmar. For this he is reviled, slandered, hated, feared. He receives death threats on a regular basis. In Yiddish and Hebrew newspapers, advertisements taken out by the self-described &quot;great rabbis and rabbinical judges of the city of New York&quot; have denounced him as &quot;a stumbling block for the House of Israel,&quot; &quot;a public rebuker and preacher of ethics&quot; who &quot;persists in his rebelliousness&quot; and whose &quot;voice has been heard among many Jewish families, especially young people in their innocence... drawn to listen to his poisonous and revolting speeches.&quot; Leaflets distributed in Williamsburg and Borough Park, the centers of ultra-Orthodoxy in Brooklyn, display his bearded face over the body of a writhing snake. &quot;Corrupt Informer,&quot; reads one of the leaflets, followed by the declaration that Rabbi Rosenberg\'s &quot;name should rot in hell forever. They should cut him off from all four corners of the earth.&quot; 
When Rabbi Rosenberg wants to bathe at a mikvah in Brooklyn to purify himself, none will have him. When he wants to go to synagogue, none will have him. &quot;He is finished in the community, butchered,&quot; said a fellow rabbi who would only talk anonymously. &quot;No one will look at him, and those who will talk to him, they can\'t let it be known. The pressure in our community, it\'s incredible.&quot; </p>
<p>The powerful men—and it is worth noting that this community is regulated by men only—who govern the world of ultra-Orthodox Judaism would rather their adherents be blind in their faith, their eyes closed to the horrors Rabbi Rosenberg is exposing. Like the Catholic establishment, the rabbinate seeks to cover up the crimes, quiet the victims, protect the abusers, and deflect potential criticism of their institutional practices. Those who speak out are vilified, and the faithful learn to shut their mouths. When the father of the seven-year-old boy whom Rabbi Rosenberg rescued from the Jerusalem bathhouse showed up to collect his son, he couldn\'t believe his son had been raped. Trembling, terrified, he whisked his son away to get medical help but was still too scared to raise a formal complaint. According to Ben and Survivors for Justice, &quot;The greatest sin is not the abuse, but talking about the abuse. Kids and parents who step forward to complain are crushed.&quot; 
As for Rabbi Rosenberg, when he voiced his concerns to the rabbinate in Israel, he was brought up on charges by the mishmeres hatznuis, the archconservative Orthodox &quot;modesty squad,&quot; which regulates, often through threats of violence, proper moral conduct and dress in the relations between men and women. The modesty squad is a sort of Jewish Taliban. According to Rabbi Rosenberg, the rapist he caught in the act was a member of the modesty squad, which charged him with the unconscionable offense of having previously been seen walking down a street in Jerusalem with a married woman. &quot;But it\'s OK to molest children,&quot; he adds. 
The abuse and its cover-up are symptoms of wider political dysfunction—or, more precisely, symptoms of socially disastrous political control by religious elites. &quot;</p>

            In Monroe NY is a Hasidic Jewish community called Kiryas Joel. They have had numerous case studies of child abuse. I also found an article discussing human trafficking there. I'm at work, but if anyone is interested, look into Kiryas. I've been digging into them recently, just started, but I believe more is going on in there than we know about.

            That's hate speech because it triggers the JEWS :) I've seen that too and put it on my blog before the police got a court order to take it down.

            This also triggers them too. JEWS EXERCISE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN AMERICA - THE FREEDOM TO SUCK BABY COCK AND KILL THEM WITH HERPES also repeatedly spoken of in the Jerusalem post as "Oral Suction".

            Speaking of the JEWS I just exposed another shill who is talking about the jews believing in the the All Seeing Eye, Jupiter aka Lucifer as their god from a guy talking about teaching his own KIDS THE JOY OF OTO CHILD SEX MAGICK. The pedo is friends with Mark Passio. Go figure.

             I already posted this here showing how the Australian Executive Council Jewry is working with the PIZZAGATE's Ordo Templi Orentis Child fuck cult that podest, clinton and alefantis are linked to in so many ways.

             The videos on there proving how the Australian jews are working with the Australian OTO child fuck cult got censored by the vid me fags so you'll need what's on the next link.

            This is incredible - VICE is a good source.  Thank you for posting.

            I'd like to post this article here too as SENSITIVE the improperly named mod saw fit to delete it the other day - I saw a figure in the above article that reminded me of it.  40 percent of teachers in a study in Australia reported seeing disturbing sexualized behavior in primary school students which is alarming enough.  the other problem was that they were not abe to determine whether the kids were abused or they got the behavior from the internet.

             vice is no good... seriously. I canceled my pay tv subscription because they provided us the outdoor channel switching to VICEland in the evening. Every day they are showing faggots doing this faggots doing that, bears having orgies in the pool etc...

              Agree that you might not like their subject matter, but they are do quite a bit of news and are building that side of their operation, and their reporting is done to journalistic standards, unlike neonnettle, sorcha fal and the washington post (ha ha).  What I meant by good was that this report can be considered legitimate.
