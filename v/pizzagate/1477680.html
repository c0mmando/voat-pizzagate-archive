<p>&quot;The Secret Metro Tunnels
The Washington Metro is a subway system that serves the Washington DC area. It &quot;officially&quot; has 106 miles of track serving 86 stations in the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland. Planning for the Metro system began in the 1950s during the height of the cold war. President Eisenhower created a secret rail planning commission that directed the development of a secondary secret underground rail system built alongside the public one.</p>
<p>This secret tunnel system currently connects the White House to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door, the New Executive Office Building (NEOB), the bunker under the Blair House, the bunker under the VP Residence at the Naval Observatory, a hotel near the White House, the U.S. Capitol, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, the Pentagon, the State Department, and some other federal buildings in between. There is also a secret train that runs between DC\'s Union Station and Mt. Weather and is under the protection of the TSA Federal Air Marshals.</p>
<p>Long-term plans call for the expansion of the White House tunnel system to go south past the Pentagon; west past the CIA to Mount Weather; and north past Camp David up to Site R in Pennsylvania. The estimated completion date and exact route of this ambitious tunnel expansion plan remains classified. &quot;</p>
<p>This is about the &quot;underground tour&quot; of tunnels to Camp David. It\'s creepy that now the tours are cancelled: <a href="https://whitehouse.gov1.info/camp-david/index.html">https://whitehouse.gov1.info/camp-david/index.html</a></p>
<p>During Obama\'s tenure, a huge hole was dug in the WH garden, ostensibly for a &quot;bunker&quot;. I hate to refer to the NYT but there are many stories about this and I liked the headline: 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/us/big-hole-on-white-house-lawn-prompts-speculation.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/us/big-hole-on-white-house-lawn-prompts-speculation.html</a></p>
<p>Could any of these tunnels be connected to tunnels of interest on CT avenue? A YouTube account that had a video about the geometric relationship of Comet, WH, etc. revealed on google maps has now disappeared. I could not find it on vimeo either.</p>
<p>(Sorry if everyone has already looked into this, but I am new and just thought this might be of interest.
I really blew it with my first thing I posted and although I have asked, no one has told me how I can edit it.)</p>',

            Great info here, but I believe it all pertains to getting the Top people out of DC if/when a disaster occurs. Camp David is in Thurmont, MD about 50 miles +/- from DC. (been there many times trout fishing). Also, they had a secret bunker in the Greenbriar hotel in WV for many years during the cold war that has since been outed. One other strategic mention is route 295 that leads from DC to Baltimore and is controlled the the Park Police. Limited access and entry and nearly a straight line for a political 'Escape' from DC. You could easily do well over 100 mph if the road were empty, probably closer to 150. I have driven it many times and it passes right next to the NSA compound at route 32.

            Never heard of 'Site R' in PA. - interesting to say the least.

             This subway isn't a "secret," it has a Wikipedia page:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_subway_system">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_subway_system

             The idea that there are more tunnels that aren't publicly acknowledged is certainly very plausible, but it's not even that hard to get into this part of DC. You just have to be the guest of a public official in DC. I've been on it, actually.

              Yes, I realize it isn't a "secret" but when you search for it you find it's often labeled as the "secret capital subway". It takes the heat off the real secret subway that probably begins where this one ends.
