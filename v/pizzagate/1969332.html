             Revrend Henry J. Lyons (who has affilations to both CLINTON AND BARAK OBAMA) was just recently kicked out by the church over dubious finances of the "CHILD DAY CARE CENTER", which was being run by his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
             But no one is syaing as to what exactly was dubious about them.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is being being hushed. That is what I AM AFRAID OF.
            </p>
            <p>
             We must bring light to this.
            </p>
            <p>
             We must ask questions as to what was transpiring there.

            Lyons is a pedophile. I have a copy of an FDLE investigation into the sexual abuse of minors in the black churches of Pinellas and Hillsborough counties. ( This was actually a fed ring that ran up to Kentucky). On page 19, the last page is a diagram of the pyramid of players. The top brick is Henry Lyons. He did jail time for the money embezeling but not for the sex rings. The media only told part of the story. Much like Larry King of Franklin cover up. He did time for the money laundering, but also not charged for harming children. Both black Baptists who were religious were having child sex parties. But never charged. I have a PDF copy of the actual investigation. Can i upload it here?. This has been built up all over the country! They are both out of jail now.

             PS. There is also a democratic party operative and a democratic elected state official in the ' pyramid' of players. That would be Daryl Rouson, a 'former' crackhead who continues to get reelected. He was a republican however when he was named in the investigation, and later became a democrat when maps were redrawn. Then the electronic voting machines take care of the rest.

             This isn't about the bible. It's about religious institutions being utilized to carry out human trafficking and the religious leaders possibly being in on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The initial article was to provide background on the corruption of the religious institutions and leaders which seem to have a very prominent role in WASHINGTON DC and close affiliations to the politicians who have served therein. I didn't write it. I came accross it while researching this matter.... sorry I notice that forgot to the link the original source. I will try to find it and link it.

            — The second coming of the
            <strong>
             Rev. Henry J. Lyons
            </strong>
            was not as celebrated or lucrative as his previous life.
           </p>
           <p>
            The one-time** leader of the largest black Baptist organization in America** — toppled by infidelities and imprisoned on fraud charges — has kept a relatively low profile while running
            <strong>
             a century-old church in Hillsborough County the last dozen years.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Lyons no longer has the ear of the President of the United States, and his empire does not include the same luxuries as during his heyday in St. Petersburg in the 1990s.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet the final, uncomfortable hours of Lyons' reign at
            <strong>
             New Salem Missionary Baptist Church
            </strong>
            have a disturbingly, familiar echo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Church leaders have accused the** 75-year-old Lyons of misappropriating funds for his personal benefit**, and voted Thursday evening to remove him as pastor, ending what had once looked like a story of personal redemption.

That he wanted to be the shepherd of our flock. We forgave him because he served his time. We thought he had went through his rehab, but apparently he was just the same old Dr. Henry J. Lyons.''
           </p>
           <p>
            So, to be clear,
            <strong>
             the church is accusing Lyons of theft?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <strong>
             Yes

            Sitting with his wife Willie in the formal living room of his New Tampa home on Friday,
            <strong>
             Lyons dismissed the charges as coming from a disgruntled faction of church members.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <h3>
             He said most of the allegations appear to be directed at

              New Salem Ministries' day care center, which is operated independently from the church
             </strong>
             by his wife.
            </h3>
            <h5>
             Willie and Henry Lyons said they have not had time to research the list of allegations handed to them at the Thursday meeting, but said most of them** appear to involve grant money from five to seven years ago.**
            </h5>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They suggested any apparent improprieties were either easily explainable or inadvertent mistakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have not yet contacted an attorney, but Lyons said he was inclined to dispute his termination.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I really would rather fight, to be honest with you,'' Lyons said. "I've had a great tenure at this church. It's just been overwhelmingly good with blessings, and things going well and looking well. I'd like to go maybe another year, a year and a half, or two at the most. Because it's really time for me to retire.
           </p>
           <p>
            "So I'm facing that. I've already faced that.''
           </p>
           <p>
            Lyons said the church put aside a $25,000 retirement package for him last year, and owes him another $25,000 this year. Melendez said that was part of the church's agreement with the pastor, but
            <em>
             officials decided Lyons no longer deserved the money.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            "We put a stop to that,'' Melendez said. "Based on the evidence we found, we felt he's been paid in full.
            <strong>
             I don't think he deserves any more money from us.
            </strong>

            Included in dossiers passed out at Thursday's meeting were copies of handwritten notes asking questions such as

             "Why did Dr. Lyons get salary of $1,700 from New Salem Ministries?'' on a page that included COPIES OF CANCELLED CHECKS.

            In 2007, Lyons tried to regain his old job as

             PRESIDENT OF THE FLORIDA GENERAL BAPTIST CONVENTION
            </strong>
            . After losing the election, Lyons created the

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The new convention includes about
            <strong>
             20 CHURCHES AROUND THE STATE and is run by LYONS OUT OF NEW SALEM.

            Several notes in the packets handed out at the church seemed to question
            <strong>
             THE MINGLING OF MONEY BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND SOME OF THE NON-PROFITS, SUCH AS LYONS' CONVENTIONS.
            </strong>
            The termination letter alluded to the possibility that
            <strong>
             WIRE OR MAIL FRAUD HAD BEEN COMMITTED.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "I don't think I'm doing mail fraud. I'm only mailing to the people in the organization. And my organization is growing every year, praise God for that,'' Lyons said. "I stood up the other night at a meeting and said, "Look, y'all need to tell me what in the world is mail fraud.' I don't really understand the monster but y'all keep on saying, "Pastor, you're doing mail fraud.' Tell me what it is.''

            Church deacons and officials have been trying to get a handle on New Salem's finances for several months, hiring a** MANAGEMENT FIRM OUT OF ATLANTA **to begin monitoring the books.
           </p>
           <p>
            The relationship with Lyons began to turn ugly, church officials say, when he and his:

           <h3>
            his wife
            <strong>

            <strong>
             the finances for THE DAY CARE.
            </strong>
           </h3>
           <p>
            Lyons said church officials asked him to resign twice in recent months and he refused. A third meeting, Lyons said,
            <strong>
             almost turned violent.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            On Thursday night, church leaders presented Lyons with their financial investigation and then voted to fire him. The vote of trustees and deacons was 10-6 in favor of termination, with one member abstaining.
           </p>

            "The people haven't spoken, just this small group,''
            <strong>
             Willie Lyons said. "What I'm learning is that they are scaring (church members). They're telling them the IRS is going to come in and take the church. Those are the things they're telling them, they're going to lose the church.''

           </p>
           <p>
            Willie Lyons returned to the church Friday morning to tend to
            <strong>
             the HANDFUL OF CHILDREN in day care
            </strong>
            but a pair of church members told her
            <strong>
             THE BUSINESS NEEDED TO BE SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            She was inside the church with two officials when
            <strong>
             a Tampa Bay Times photographer heard a woman shouting

            Willie Lyons later told the Times that
            <strong>
             SHE REFUSED TO LEAVE
            </strong>
            , and church officials called the
            <strong>
             Temple Terrace Police Department to have her removed from the property.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "That's what's happened to us,'' Henry Lyons said. "So here we are.
            <strong>

            Lyons was once one of THE NATION'S LEADING RELIGIOUS FIGURES, rising to a position of prominence during a 25-year association with
            <strong>
             BETHEL METROPOLITAN BAPTIST CHURCH in ST. PETERSBURG.
            </strong>
           </h6>
           <p>
            A Gainesville native, Lyons became
            <strong>
             PRESIDENT

            of the
            <strong>
             FLORIDA GENERAL BAPTIST CONVENTION
            </strong>
            in 1982 and, a decade later, was elected to a five-year term as
            <strong>
             PRESIDENT

            His influence over millions of devoted Baptists made Lyons one of the most sought-after ministers in the country.

            <strong>

            sought his COUNSEL, and
            <strong>
             PAID DEARLY for HIS STAMP OF APPROVAL.

           </h2>
           <p>
            Lyons flew first class, hired a personal chef, and bought multiple homes. He showered female friends with gifts and drove luxury cars. And it all came crashing down because of a domestic dispute. His third wife Deborah discovered Lyons had purchased a house with another woman, and she attempted to burn down the $700,000 home in Tierra Verde.
           </p>
           <p>
            Deborah's arrest led to closer examination of Lyons' lifestyle and business dealings and he was soon
            <strong>
             convicted in state court of grand theft and racketeering charges.
            </strong>
            He later reached a plea agreement in federal court on tax evasion and bank fraud charges. In all,
            <strong>
             Lyons spent nearly five years in prison
            </strong>
            and had to forfeit much of his wealth to pay restitution to corporations he defrauded, as well as back taxes.
            <strong>
             WITHIN MONTHS OF LEAVING PRISON IN 2004, LYONS WAS OFFERED A POSITION AT NEW SALEM.
            </strong>
            The church initially saw an increase in membership with the charismatic Lyons in the pulpit, but later fell on hard times.
            <strong>
             The church in downtown Tampa was on the verge of foreclosure when a fire destroyed it.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Using the insurance money from the fire, the church relocated to a facility in Temple Terrace two years ago.
            </strong>
            Membership has continued to decline, and the church is once again facing financial troubles. The church has been forced to dip into savings, and one official said funds were quickly running out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Melendez said the church has retained an attorney, but has not yet decided whether to pursue criminal charges or try to recoup any money it believes Lyons misappropriated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Church members will likely be split on whether the trustees and deacons erred in removing Lyons without putting it to a vote of the entire church, Melendez said.
            <strong>
             Officials there, however, felt they could wait no longer.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "It broke my heart,'' Melendez said. "I really didn't think he would do that to us. And yet here we are. It still hurts me.''

            <p>
             The New Life Children’s Refuge case was a legal case about an incident which occurred in the chaotic aftermath of the January 12th 2010 Haiti earthquake. On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children, most of whom were not orphans and had families. The group, known as the New Life Children’s Refuge, did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on child trafficking charges. The missionaries denied any wrongdoing and claimed that they were rescuing orphans and leading them to a Dominican hotel which was being transformed into an orphanage. Nine of the ten missionaries were later released but NLCR founder Laura Silsby remained incarcerated in Haiti. By the time she went to trial on May 13 the charges had been reduced to "arranging irregular travel" and the prosecution sought a 6-month prison term. On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial]

           <h4>
            New Life Children's Refuge:
           </h4>
           <p>
            The New Life Children’s Refuge (NLCR) was founded in November 2009 by
            <strong>
             Laura Silsby (now Silsby-Gayler)
            </strong>
            and Charisa Coulter, who are both members of the
            <strong>
             Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho.
            </strong>
            The organization described itself as a
            <strong>
             "non‐profit Christian ministry dedicated to rescuing, loving and caring for orphaned, abandoned and impoverished Haitian and Dominican children, demonstrating God’s love and helping each child find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ."
            </strong>
            The charity claimed to be in the process of acquiring land to build an orphanage as well as a church and school in Magante on the Northern coast of the Dominican Republic. NLCR further intended to provide adoption opportunities for American "loving Christian parents". On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by a major earthquake and NLCR quickly formed the
            <strong>
             "Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission"
            </strong>
            , a group of ten people from the
            <strong>
             Central Valley Baptist Church
            </strong>
            and the
            <strong>
             East Side Baptist Church in Twin Falls, Idaho

           <p>
            The mission's plan was to go to Haiti and bring a hundred orphans to Cabarete, Dominican Republic, where NLCR had leased a hotel to serve as a temporary orphanage.

             Shawn Davies was a youth minister at one of those Baptist churches in the suburbs of Kansas City, M... 20-year sentence for multiple counts of sexual abuse in Missouri and Kentucky. Davies seduced teenage boys by acting like one of the gang. He talked about girls and sex with the teenagers. He took them on trips, invited them into his office, and showed them pornography. And he took them downstairs or behind the sanctuary to sexually assault them....
             <strong>
              Eight boys were sexually abused at the Missouri church by Davies.
             </strong>

             Ken Ward is a Southern Baptist pastor and teacher in East Texas, who has admitted to molesting
             <strong>
              more than 40 boys
             </strong>
             . He said that being
             <strong>
              A TEACHER AND MINISTER IS THE PERFECT JOB FOR A CHILD MOLESTER, BECAUSE IT PUTS THE MOLESTER IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.
             </strong>
             "I [was] attracted to a certain child, and in my case, it was primarily
             <strong>
              prepubescent boys
             </strong>

             Ward preyed on children for decades. One of his victims, Tommy Lee Burt, came forward about the abuse as an adult. He believes that Ward damaged him for life, and
             <strong>
              used his God to abuse him
             </strong>

              the minister publicly confessed to "making a terrible mistake"
             </strong>
             last November after a woman sued, claiming she'd been
             <strong>
              raped as a teen

             .

           </ul>
           <h5>
            The Church members responded by throwing the minister a retirement party and raised $50,000 as a "love offering." To this day, he has a church building named after him.

           <ul>
            <li>
             The Southern Baptist Convention said the problem is neither widespread nor systemic, despite a recent rash of cases. But just last week,
             <strong>
              a pastor of a Florida church -- Lyle Whittaker -- committed suicide
             </strong>
             after he was charged with sexually abusing an

              11-year-old-girl

             .
            </li>
            <li>
             The Southern Baptist Convention said the biblical and best way to handle these terrible cases is by the local church, which should call the police.
             <strong>
              But former minister and sex offender Ken Ward stayed under the local radar and moved from church to church for years, and he said the church can't do it alone:

              </li>
              <li>
               The lawsuit describes “a simple yet effective marketing scheme,” where Second Baptist Church entices preteens and teens in public schools with lunches provided by places such as McDonald’s or Pizza Hut. Youth counselors befriend the children they speak with and invite them to church activities.

               Paramount Baptist Church lied about what was going on. They told parents that adults would be with children at all times. Instead they assigned this pedophile, [Patrick Farmer], to a Sunday school classroom where he was the only adult there, and that's where the molestation began.

               The former pastor of a Florida Baptist mega-church charged with sexually abusing 21 women and one man when they were children won't face his accusers in court. Bob Gray, 38-year-pastor of Trinity Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla., died Saturday, just days before his criminal trial was scheduled to start.
              </li>
              <li>
               Trinity Baptist Church was part of the Southern Baptist Convention before Gray, a close friend of the late Jerry Falwell, led it to become an independent Baptist church in the 1960s.
              </li>
              <li>
               The congregation is also part of the Southwide Baptist Fellowship, a group of independent Baptists reaching out to a Southern Baptist Convention they now see as purified by the so-called "conservative resurgence" of the 1980s.
              </li>
              <li>
               Jerry Vines, a past president of the SBC, spoke favorably of Trinity Baptist Church at a conference in 2006, reportedly without mentioning the pedophilia scandal.
              </li>
              <li>
               While the church is no longer affiliated with the SBC, a victim advocate, Christa Brown of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, says the type of collusion alleged in lawsuits against Trinity is all too common in the Southern Baptist Convention.

            Dr. Billy Graham in his new book indicated that adulterous President Clinton made a big impression on him during the Oklahoma City bombing tragedy. He said: “Seldom have I seen anyone express so movingly and sincerely a genuine sense of compassion and sympathy to those who were hurting. I felt that he, not I, was the real pastor that day.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Evangelical Graham went off the deep end and stated:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             President Bill Clinton would make a great evangelist, Billy Graham told U.S. News &amp; World Report in a interview. Graham said he was impressed with Clinton’s charisma and ‘with some of the things he believes. … From a biblical point of view, we should be headed in the direction of goodness and righteousness, away from crime and immorality,’ Graham said, ‘and towards one’s neighbors who are in need. I’m encouraged by the emphasis President Clinton (a Southern Baptist) and Hillary are putting on that.’
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It’s a fact that Christianity Today founded by Billy Graham did not report immediately on one of its own pastors Ollin Collins** Senior Pastor of Harvest Baptist Church in Fort Worth, and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary’s board chairman.** A man who resigned amid sexual misconducts allegations when he was accused of having sexual relationships with two women who sought counseling.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it did report about the adultery of a black man and a National Baptist but not about the adultery of a white man and Southern Baptist. An adultery that was more hideous and gross because Collins raped unsuspecting trusting women, while Lyons adulterous relationships were consensual.
            <strong>
             It has been said that Lyons will go down in the history books as “Hugh Hefner of the New Testament.”
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now concerning the fallen hero, the church had suspended Pastor Collins with pay pending an investigation. He resigned from his board position one day after a story in the Fort Worth Star- Telegram reported the women’s allegations and their intent to sue.
            <strong>
             Southwestern is the world’s largest evangelical seminary, with 3,000 students on eight campuses.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            But of course neither the Seminary nor the Church did anything for the real female victims but they did help and console the aggressor? Just like Billy Graham stated about Bill Clinton “I forgive him . . . because I know the frailty of human nature, and especially a strong, vigorous young man like he is. “He has such a tremendous personality that I think the ladies just go wild over him.” In other words it was the fault of the victims not the victimizer?
           </p>
           <p>
            They are all hypocrites and thieves their lack of accountability by their CEO’s proves it. They are nothing but crooks and con artists and their smooth words do not change this fact! Otherwise hypocritical Baptist leader who preach integrity to others would not hide their salaries but be honest and state the “total compensation” of their five top employees, including Billy and Franklin Graham!
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Doesn’t Rule His Own Household?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             3:2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; 3:3 not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; 3:4 one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all reverence. 1 Timothy
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Billy Graham has raised up two sons Ned and Franklin who are as deceitful as their father. Ned Graham, the son of Billy Graham, Southern Baptist minister, president East Gates International, a group that distributes Bibles in China told Christianity Today in an interview that he had abused alcohol and spent an “inappropriate amount of time” with two women on his staff.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Grace Community Church, Southern Baptist Convention, in Auburn, Washington–which counted Ned Graham, his wife, and their two sons as members established the fact that Ned Graham was an adulterer, alcoholic, wife abuser, and drug user and revoked Graham’s ministerial credentials. It directed Graham to stop using the title reverend.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Yet in a style reminiscent of Jimmy Swaggart, who refused to be defrocked by the Assembly of God denomination, Ned Graham left that congregation for another church.

            <p>
             Mr. Graham apologized in regard to the Nixon tapes which were recently broadcast. Although Mr. Graham had no memory of what he had said, he felt it was appropriate at this time to give an apology. He does not actually feel about Jewish people in the way the words were said. Mr. Graham has made many friends over the years among the Jewish leaders and rabbis and has a great respect for them. Please pray for Mr. Graham and our Association–that we will be truly faithful and obedient to our Lord. May God bless you.

            A response was sent by me to Barbara Webb on May 23,2003 which stated:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dear Barbara,
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you for your reply concerning Billy Graham’s memory lapse!
            </p>
            <p>
             I have an important question to which I would like to have an answer does Dr. Billy Graham at 84 years of age still take a 100 percent salary as a employee and chairman of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Organization and work less than 25 percent of time?
            </p>
            <p>
             The sad part about Billy Graham’s refusal to accept real responsibility is his use of the phrase “Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon … some 30 years ago.” You will appreciate Bill Clinton the former President of United States and a great liar also used a similar phrase to avoid answering questions asked of him during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and would state ” I don’t recall.” But God has a perfect memory and he recalls all things and so do others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Graham’s two faced hypocrisy also came out in a 1989 when a Graham memo to Nixon was made public. It took the form of a secret letter from Graham, dated April 15, 1969, drafted after Graham met in Bangkok with missionaries from Vietnam. These men of God said that if the peace talks in Paris were to fail, Nixon should step up the war and bomb the dikes. Such an act, Graham wrote excitedly, “could overnight destroy the economy of North Vietnam”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Graham lent his imprimatur to this recommendation. Thus the preacher was advocating a policy to the US Commander in Chief that on Nixon’s own estimate would have killed a million people.
            </p>
            <p>
             This disclosure of Graham as an aspirant war criminal did not excite any commotion when it became public in 1989, twenty years after it was written.

             Yet in a style reminiscent of Jimmy Swaggart, who refused to be defrocked by the Assembly of God denomination, Ned Graham left that congregation for another church.

             Most of the staff and board members of East Gates International resigned amid controversies. East Gates, in Sumner, Wash., withdrew its membership in the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability after Ned replaced the board members with his sister Ruth Graham McIntyre, brother-in-law Stephan Tchividjian, and business leader Peter Lowe. Graham’s sister Gigi Tchividjian has joined the office staff and Ned Graham continues as East Gates president. The ECFA the self-policing organization Billy Graham helped start requires that a majority of board members not be related by blood or marriage, which is no longer the case for East Gates. Nepotism is alive and well in Evangelical ministries?

             A December East Gates fund-raising letter included a note from his father saying that “Ruth and I are proud of and grateful to God for our son Ned.” East Gates has distributed 2 million Bibles to Christians in China, Billy Graham said, encouraging Christians to “back this unique and effective ministry.”

             It is interesting to see the most famous “evangelist” (some say) not being able to educate his children, especially Ned. At the same time, having a bunch of so-called Christians following the leadership of such wreckless person. Franklin Graham wears jeans, boots, denim shirt, and leather jacket. He was a teen rebel who drank, smoked, fought, and led police on high-speed chases. He was kicked out of LeTourneau College. He used to be a rebel and a ‘bum’ got religion and become more sophisticated and formed “the Samaritan’s Purse’ so that he can fly around the country and charge things to his non-profit corporation. As a result his ministry, Samaritan’s Purse, had a run-in with the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. The ECFA suspended Samaritan’s Purse while it looked into Franklin’s (Graham) compensation and use of the company plane.

             Although Billy Graham encourages religious leaders to be open about their salaries and publish their finances none of the Grahams reveal their total compensation nor release their personal income tax as President Bush does and former President Clinton has done. It’s the law of the land that all non profit chairman of corporations must reveal their total salary and that Billy, Ned and Franklin do not to their donors speak volumes of their hypocrisy?

            <p>
             Yes, Jesus told us to beware of hypocrites like Dr. Billy Graham.

            SOUTHERN BAPTIST BILLY GRAHAM A FALSE PROPHET

            If one claims that Mr. Graham has been even remotely faithful to the written Word of God then that person is either woefully ignorant or a willful liar. The facts speak for themselves. Southern Baptist Evangelist Billy Graham has many faults and errors including bad theology and bad company.

            No one who promotes the killing of unborn children, as Clinton did during his presidency (even partially born children), desires** “to serve God and do His will” (Proverbs 17:11; 21:10)!

            Even though Apostle Paul told Timothy in chapter 4:1-5 that the work of an evangelist was to rebuke, Billy Graham rebukes nobody including his friend and pal sexually immoral adulterous Bill Clinton:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             4:1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: 4:2 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; 4:4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. 4:5 But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. 1 Timothy

Hmm.  I hope they did not sneak in some little boys or girls for the Minister.  You know, through those tunnels. Or probably just brought in to visit in Limos, you know like they did with the boys from Boy's Town?  That would be a travesty, after his whole life of Serving the Lord.
