He would get paid a small amount for his sexual &quot;services&quot;, while the relative who brought him to the events would get paid a large amount of money. As he got older, Mick was no longer used for sexual purposes by the group but was required to recruit new younger children. When he was old enough (in his 20\'s), Mick was able to escape the group but they continue to contact him with threats.

<p>“… the victims who were abused as part of this network as children can testify to the fact that police officers we’re actually being paid off so that this criminal network remained untouchable.”

<p><em>A tightly organised, mafia-style, hierarchically structured crime syndicate has infiltrated every aspect of Australian society including Parliament, judiciary, church denominations, law enforcement, military, child protection, hospitals, educational facilities and childcare centres.  The network has numerous branches and many thousands of members who profit from various illegal activities including drugs, arms and child sex trafficking.  It is a well oiled, clandestine machine fuelled by public ignorance and distraction. Ritual abuse is part of what they do. one Sydney rape counsellor estimates from her contact with therapists that about 300 women in NSW are being treated for ritual abuse. That estimate is supported by the Herald’s own calls to “survivor” groups, therapists and sexual assault workers. Phoenix Van Dyke, the organiser of the ritual abuse support group Beyond Survivors, says she has been in contact with more than 200 women who believe they are survivors. The Sydney Rape Crisis Centre has had more than 100 cases in recent years and one major Sydney hospital about 30.  This view has been fuelled by allegations, currently under investigation, that NSW police have been bribed by pedophiles. One therapist claims to have seen infra-red Federal Police photographs of nocturnal forest rituals. A Child Protection Services official talks about covens meeting around Australia on certain days of the year.  Even the official NSW Government booklet on ritual abuse – distributed to hundreds of health workers since 1993 – dismisses the growing body of contrary evidence as an example of society’s collective “denial.”</em></p>
<p>Dr Michaelson and her family were physically threatened to the point where they were forced to relocate three states away, the alleged pedophile network was never investigated, the alleged perpetrators were never charged, and the alleged victims remained at risk.</p>
<p>OTO began a defamation case against Gaiaguys.net who published an article which accused them of ritual abuse in Victoria.  The Victorian Civil Administrative Tribunal found in favour of the OTO and ordered the website founders, Dyson Devine and Vivienne Legg, to remove the offending material.  The couple did not comply with this order and in 2008 they were sentenced to nine months prison.</p>
<p>A related problem for Satanic Ritual Abuse survivors in contacting the Victoria Police and that is their badge! It prominently features an upside down five pointed star. This inverted pentagram is only used  in Satanic symbolism.

            These pedophiles are still suing and jailing people in Australia.  I have videos of them admitting they drink blood, and semen and include children in their child sex magick ceremonies.

            Those videos will be presented by Laywer Matyn Ilnes of the Australian Christian Lobby against David Bottrill and his pedophile gang in the case of John Sunol vs David Bottrill. See what's going on in the videos here. The OTO is the religion of homomsexual and child sex magick. It's prophet Alister Crowley publishes poems about sodomizing children and killed his own son, that's why he was sent to the madhouse. Also the legg and devine kidnapping you speak of has been ruled unconstitional illegall action as the VCAT tribunal had no jurisdiction in NSW according ot the NSW Supreme Court of Appeals. Donate to BernardGaynor.com.au to win in the high court against the OTO's pro-bono lawyers who jailed legg and devine (piac.asn.au).

            I am the new webmaster for lukesarmy.com and when I finish writing up affdavits to support John Sunol I'll bring back the site hosted in Russia. A lot of my posts have been being deleted from the moderators / BO that seem pro faggorty. This proves the OTO is the religion of anal sex sodomy. The videos proving they drink blood and include children will come out later.

            Well written and sourced. The difficulty selling this will stem from the unrealness of the facts and the inherent trust people have in "reputable organisations". People who don't question and don't want to rock the ship might have trouble with this
