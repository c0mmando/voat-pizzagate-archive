           <p>
            1995
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             HOLLYWOOD, April 10— Michael Ovitz, who helped to create the Creative Artists Agency more than a decade ago and has overseen its remarkable growth into a behemoth that represents superstars like Tom Cruise, Michael Jackson and Sylvester Stallone, is the source of considerable speculation as the choice of the Seagram Company to run the entertainment giant MCA Inc., which Seagram bought on Sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Ovitz, who is 49 and has moved into advertising, corporate finance and the convergence of entertainment, information and communications, is a close friend of Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of Seagram, the Canadian liquor giant, and was one of the brokers in the MCA sale.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only would the departure of Mr. Ovitz from Creative Artists ripple across the movie, television and music business, but it could also in many ways have a seismic impact on the talent agency business, which Creative Artists has dominated for at least a decade.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Bronfman, who made his foray into the entertainment business on Sunday with the purchase of 80 percent of MCA from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company for $5.7 billion in cash, could not be reached for comment today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Ovitz, a formidable deal maker in Hollywood, has publicly denied any interest in running MCA, the entertainment conglomerate that controls Universal Pictures; Putnam, the book publisher; MCA and Geffen Records; Universal Studios and theme parks.
            </p>
            <p>
             People close to Mr. Bronfman said he had offered an honorary chairmanship to Lew Wasserman, who as the chairman of MCA has run the company for decades along with Sidney J. Sheinberg, its president.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because Mr. Bronfman wants to maintain warm relationships with Mr. Sheinberg and Mr. Wasserman, MCA's new owner also planned to offer Mr. Sheinberg an unspecified position at the studio. "Edgar has no interest in antagonizing Sheinberg, but it's clear he will get someone else to run the place," one person close to Mr. Bronfman said today.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There are several reasons that Mr. Ovitz might want to leave Creative Artists...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mr. Ovitz, though wealthy, hungers to be in the same financial league as his friends like Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, and Barry Diller, former chairman of Fox Inc.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Mr. Ovitz left Creative Artists, he would be compelled to sell his majority share in the agency to his fellow agents to avoid conflicts of interest. That would open the way for a potential struggle for control of Creative Artists, Hollywood's most powerful agency. Mr. Ovitz's share could be as high as $200 million, according to some estimates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ron Meyer, president of Creative Artists and co-founder of the agency with Mr. Ovitz, runs the day-to-day operations and is widely trusted not only by movie stars but also by executives like David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, as well as others, who have chilly relations with Mr. Ovitz. But Mr. Meyer could face restlessness and a potential insurgency by ferociously ambitious younger agents who are anxious to reach the upper tier at Creative Artists.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any crack in the fortress-like solidarity of Creative Artists would be exploited immediately by International Creative Management, the William Morris Agency and United Talent, the three largest agencies after Creative Artists.
            </p>
            <p>
             At stake are some of the biggest personalities in town: actors like Robert Redford, Demi Moore, Kevin Costner, Paul Newman, Bette Midler, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman and directors like Barry Levinson, Ivan Reitman, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone and Mike Nichols.
            </p>
            <p>
             As speculation centered on Mr. Ovitz, Mr. Bronfman and his father, Edgar M. Bronfman, had lunch today with Mr. Wasserman, who is 82, and Mr. Sheinberg, who is 60. Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg have made it clear that they are angry at the way Matsushita treated them and essentially kept them in the dark about the negotiations to sell MCA.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1990 Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg sold MCA to the Japanese company, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars in the process but complaining in later years that Matsushita was treating them poorly and, in essence, like employees.

            Owen Benjamin was kicked out of CAA when he took a stand publically in a comedy set and called out a Hollywood big-wig for putting their toddler on hormone blockers.

           <p>
            He speaks a lot about CAA being a dirty mafia and calls them "Hollywood Handlers"

            CAA associated with mobbed up MCA -
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ovitz helped negotiate Sony Corporation’s $3.4 billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment in 1989. A second blockbuster deal followed in 1990; with Ovitz as advisor to Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the Japanese firm successfully courted and conquered MCA, owner of Universal Studios, in a $6.6 billion buyout. This deal earned CAA anywhere from $8 million to $40 million and garnered Ovitz the title of “Mike the Manipulator” in Spy magazine.

              These big power brokers all have relationships and PG kiddie-traders may use their biz connections to do terrible things. Just connecting people so far, not events. But good to have the info lined up in advance as this #metoo fig leave will fall apart soon (opinion).

               What you’re looking at are direct links between the Clinton Foundation, Chelsa Clinton and CAA.
              </p>
              <p>
               CAA is literately the thread that connects Pedowood (via many Hollywood luciferians and pedos), the mob (namely the Bronfmans) and the deep state (Bush, Clinton, Operation Mocking Bird via one of the founding members being a high up at NBC) all together.
              </p>
              <p>
               CAA being the talent agency that the producer of Fatal Vision (likely co-conspirator in Judith Barsi’s murder) was a founding member. His client.....Steven Spielberg.

              because I have that Clinton Foundation blog  any time I see come company up to no good I look it up with CF in a search engine and usually they are big donors.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why are all these blue blood bankers on the board at CAA? I think Hollywood big budget movies serve as a big money laundry for drug money etc. - but just opinion. Movies all have funny accounting.
             </p>
             <p>
              Looking at Oprah being in the pocket of CAA explains how Tom Cruise was always touted by her. CAA used her to  prop up their "stars" - who had not-so-much-talent in my opinion. I read in Spy magaziine a long time ago all the glossy mags are blackmailed by CAA. Unless they feature CAA client on a mag cover they will get locked out of accessing any in the future for cover stories. So all the mags play ball. Explains why Meryl Streep was always on mag covers for NO reason.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if CAA has Bruce Jenner as a client. That whole Cait rollout looked so contrived. And when all media supported it I thought of the CAA magazine blackmail.

               Uma supposedly shacked up with the wife of El Chapo in LA. It was in a Bl of CDAN.  Total possibility you just mentioned. If the Emanuel brothers are involved you can bet on it. Ari met with the pope last summer. I believe he can get a meeting with just about anyone.

            Whoa, Hollywood kikes are a criminal mafia and collaborated with actual kike gangsters and both sent ridiculous amounts of material support to kike gangsters who founded Israel and blackmail our politicians into supporting them?   Wow quite the revelation someone from 1952 could have told you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next youll tell me Trump is deeply connected thru kike fixers/lawyers like Roy Cohn and Michael Cohen (who was also childhood friends with kike gangster financier Felix Sater) and really blow my socks off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then youll tell me only kikes and cults started by kikes have long documented history of murdering children like in OP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its almost like the problem is kikes, full stop.

The founder and namesake of what’s said to be the world’s oldest and largest talent agency, William Morris, born Zelman Moses, not only missed the Lusitania’s last voyage in 1915 but also the Titanic’s first and only attempt to cross the Atlantic three years earlier.

             On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were merging to form William Morris Endeavor.[10] Endeavor executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell were widely recognized as the architects of the deal and ultimately took the roles of WME Co-CEOs.[11] Following the official announcement of the merger, nearly 100 WMA employees and former board members were let go. One of those leaving was Jim Wiatt, who came to WMA in 1999 from International Creative Management, where he was Vice-Chairman, in 1999. He had joined WMA as President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and had risen to Board Chairman.[12]

             [They are talking about Obamacare...]
79:25 min. - 
" . . . but here's what this study just came out in the journal American
Medical Association it was conducted by researchers associated with Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical and Harvard Medical School not exactly 
conservative bastions looked at 
hospitalizations between 2005 and 2015. 
It found that the 30-day post discharge 
mortality in other words the number of 
people dying within 30 days of being 
discharged for the number of people who 
died within a month of leaving the 
hospital increased for heart failure 
patients after the meet readmissions 
penalty program was implemented through 
Obamacare.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rate of increase became 
more rapid after Medicare started 
penalizing readmissions. In addition 
mortality rates amongst pneumonia 
patients which had been stable all 
increased fewer people were being 
admitted readmitted to the hospitals but 
more people were dying. While some people 
say, okay so a couple people died, wait a 
minute -  this is not the first study to 
conclude that the program increased the 
death rates.
            </p>
            <p>
             ... so they wouldn't re-admit them 
because they were afraid of being fined?
            </p>
            <p>
             Right. That was a policy, a part of the policy implemented by 
Obamacare.
            </p>
            <p>
             I should say remember this is 
not surprising because one of the 
architects this guy Ezekiel Emanuel,
             <br/>
             who is Rahm Emmanuel's brother,  had 
published a study in the British Medical 
Journal Lancet called the complete 
lives model ...  and here's 
what it is in essence and this is why 
this should not surprise anybody.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why I went after these guys back in 2009 
that model said only people between the 
ages of 15 and 40 are productive members 
of society and people less than 15 years 
of age of over 40 should have limited 
health care resources allocated to them.

            for getting this subject rolling.  I have  a lot of comments to share with you later (can't stay on computer long right now).  Involves going back to NYC back in night club heyday. Both Club Kids timeframe and before.  Madonna and many other stars came out of the NYC club nightlife.  I believe the Limelight Club started in London. Read recent comment of mine

            While I haven't read that book (and won't) I read he was very involved with Fritz's brother,

            Jules Stein, founder of MCA, knew Baron Heinrich Thyssen enough to send a letter apologizing for missing a meeting they were supposed to have. (sadly his daughter Jean jumped out a window at a late age, an odd method of suicide but whatever)

            Dennis Shields) knew something about the seedy side of historical NYC club scene as well as Andy Warhol's friend Stuart Pivar, who died in the fire.  Andy Warhol's name comes up too many times during research, which is why I believe it.

             I've often wondered if the some of what we're seeing is the continuation of  older investigations into  organized crime.  Too many times the same names (mafia connected or proximity) keep popping up, and Trump knows them, Rudy Giuliani knows them, Robert Mueller knows.. etc.  Deep State has many tentacles and spheres of influence.  If so, no one will speak about anything in an ongoing investigation, so we'll have to wait and see.  I'm not speaking anti Trump here, but one can see how DS jumped out their skin when he got elected.  They know he knows they knew he knew LOL

              And please don't tell me that Trump didn't know about Epstein's activities with underage girls. He only threw him out of Mar-a-Lago after a father complained about Epstein, not earlier.
