            she also lived in the Dandenong ranges a few minutes drive from me. She's still alive, 90 yrs old or something, has dementia I heard - and still has some millions in a trust fund, and there's a number of folk who will undoubtedly start a shitfight over the estate.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I have been wondering how she acquired her fortune - and whether CIA enabled her to perhaps create some paedo 'infrastructure'

            I truly hope that is the case.  Early mind control at those levels will dissipate at some point unless tuned up regularly as an adult.  It disturbs me he is held prisoner at an embassy in London.  LONDON?  New World Order/Banker central!  Who knows what is really going on in there.  Embassies are often used for nefarious purposes.  Besides....unless he is being protected by some really powerful people or God himself, they could be forced to turn him over.

            I truly pray for Trump and cheer him on daily.  I see so, so, so many wonderful things he is doing.  Truly appears to be a champion for America.  Truly appears to be hated by all the right people.  But in the back of my mind, when I see the crowds chanting "America, America, America" at the rallies, I can't help but remember this unattributed quote:  “When fascism comes to America, it will come wrapped in the flag and waving a cross”.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words, when I get reflective, I worry the other shoe is dropped and be made to feel the fool for supporting him.  Until then, thank god Hillary isn't president because I was 100% certain whose side she was on.

            And his mother (Christine Ann Hawkins) was/is an artist...so many ties to that community eh?.  I never fully trust Julian because of his exposure to that cult.  Is he running from it or has he been thoroughly mind controlled and being used as a tool for exposing our government?  Eventually the destruction of America and move to world government was on the menu anyways.  Was the drip, drip, drip of corruption within our government part of that plan?  I always wonder.

            This is one of the scariest articles I have ever read.  As of late, I have really come to believe that they are all together in this, all of the same thinking and no real parties.  It has been going on longer than we think.  I believe that Lynn Cheney is much more involved than her husband, Dick.  Also, I think one of the best ways to fight this is to challenge their discarding our history.  Changing history in our children's books and on the internet.  Demanding the eradication of cursive writing will cause our future offspring to not be able to read historical documents and ancient scripture.  Hillary's involvement surprises me not one bit.  She is an evil character down to her bones. An heir and air of aristocracy.  I hate her and her cohorts down to my bones.  I would love to know your thoughts.  Also I wonder how the dying of the hair fits into all of this, except of course the Aryan theory.  I wonder if Julian Assange is just another ruse.  I am trusting no one.

             I believe Julian Assange has confirmed the cult he was forced into as a child was "Children of God" there are pictures of him as a child with bleached hair. Little known truths are that this cult like most are CIA mind control operations. This one was as well. The mother or leader was at one point working at a psychiatric hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "Children of God" involved actual teachings written by their pedophile leaders that children and parents should have sexual relationships with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             They changed their name to "The Family" later on and are known by that in the US. They visited HRC when Bill was president.
            </p>
            <p>
             The cult is different from the D.Coe group it is believed, very different. Some famous actors were also members of the family... River &amp; Phoenix.
            </p>
            <p>
             Very disturbing abuse. Julian recently tweeted about the MK Ultra program. Most people did not pay attention. It was his personal twitter. If he was a victim and is trying to stop it might make sense?
