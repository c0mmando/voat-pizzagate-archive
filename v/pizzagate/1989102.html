            I think I found something on the Seattle music industry that may deserve its own thread eventually, but this is literally the first article I've read on Seattle music industry but I know there's lots more. I think the MK ultra victim was telling some truths. Either way, he gave some new potential leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking into Seattle there are some ties one could say as well as a port with access only by ferry and a bridge called Deception?? Here's a snip from an article - check out the article/column title
           </p>
           <p>
            Sunday Old School: The Acc√ºsed posted Aug 12 2012 at 9:05 AM by sonictherapy. (3 Comments) Whidbey Island, Washington isn't that remote, but is only accessible via the Port Townsend ferry on the Olympic Peninsula, the Mukilteo ferry north of Seattle and the Deception Pass bridge up by Anacortes. It is in this splendid isolation that one of America's most revered seminal crossover bands, The Accused, found its inspiration. The time was 1981 and the place was the town of Oak Harbor.
           </p>
           <p>
            This article talks about the beginning of the music industry in Seattle and this band, "the accused", had a "mascot" that was a in horror type zombie costume called "splatterhead Martha" She would come out on stage and go after the pedophiles?!
           </p>
           <p>
            Quote from article "The Accused coined the phrase 'splatter rock' since they were all horror movie buffs. The first EP, "Martha Splatterhead," was released in 1985 on their own record label Condar Records. The EP derived it's name from The Accused's official mascot Martha Splatterhead, who was a vision from keen illustrator Tommy Niemeyer. Martha was a zombie who came back from the dead to mete out justice to the dregs of society - pedophiles and rapists. The concept took hold and most of The Accused's releases included Martha on their covers and titles"
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's a track titled "Fuc#### Bucks"! Then look at the rest of the titles and a band they toured with or did something with (can't remember) named Revolting Cocks:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The 1986 debut full-length "The Return of Martha Splatterhead" was the first album ever issued on Earache records. The bassist was asked to leave, being replaced by Alex 'Maggot Brain' Sibbald. That first Accused album became a classic, containing a reworked version of "Fucking 4 Bucks" (which shows up a lot) and "Wrong Side of the Grave." 1987's "More Fun than an Open Casket Funeral" was released on Combat records, bringing with it classics like "Halo of Flies" and the tradition of The Accused putting cover songs on its albums. "Devil Woman" was one of many covers The Accused would do, it's intro coming from a 40's radio show "Lights Out." Tommy stated at the time that a band should either nail a cover spot-on or completely fuck it up and make it hilarious. Usually The Accused would do the latter, and Cliff Richard never sounded so warped in their rendition of his song. In terms of covers, these guys gave the Revolting Cocks a run for their money. Over the years, The Accused almost became better known for its covers than its originals. They do straightforward renditions of bands such as the Angry Samoans, and then do completely random versions of artists like Olivia Newton-John. "Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told" was released in 1988, signaling the departure of the original drummer and making way for Steve Nelson and eventually Josh Snider. That third album brought with it the scene favorites "Psychomania" and "Starved to Death," and also began a longtime collaboration period with producer Jack Endino. The most bastardized cover ever, "I'd Love to Change the World," appeared on this album. The beautiful acoustic guitar sounds just like you're about to hear Alvin Lee in the beginning and was the work of none other than Metal Church's Kurdt Vanderhoof. On most albums, they brought in a guest star. 1989 saw the release of a three-song split with Morhphis, on which they did the track "Brutality and Corruption."
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's a title "Baked Tapes" Could that be deterring to video tapes? "2003's comeback release, "Oh Martha," was put out on their label Condar Records. They figured that at least when you release something on your own label you have the rights to it. So many of The Accused's back catalogue albums get re-released due to being out of print and some being the victims of a bankrupt label like Nastymix. The reunion was short-lived, Tommy doing the vocals himself on tracks such as "13 Letters." Nuclear Blast ended up reissuing it in 2006 as a double LP "Baked Tapes," with a 34-song archive from 1981-86. The Accused also appeared on the Louder Than Hell compilation in 2005 along with Hirax, Municipal Waste and two other bands."

           <p>
            And there's something in there about chickens I think. Anyway, I'm going to look into this port.

            Here was a recent submission on Leo Zagami, with posters being skeptical of him:

            I am not sure about this.  This anon is rambling like crazy.  Really crazy stuff (although we know they are into that).  But he said this:  Mattis and Leary were from his same hometown.  Then someone said that they were really born on different sides of the country.  So what do we believe?  Like I said before, we do not know when we can believe these rants by the anons.  Someone else did say that this was a really good and informative book by someone that was with the Vatican.  Windswept House by Malachi Martin.  Also someone said that Cardinal Bernadine was a sell out and asked for a gay choir to sing at his funeral.  There is a lot of rambling though from the anon. Check it out and say way y'all think.

             Yeh.  One of the other anons caught that.  His response was this:
"Reread it. I didn't say Leary was born there. It was where Mattis was born. Leary merely attended college there. Sorry for the confusion. BTW check out this art staircase thats on campus. Clearly he left a mark on the culture"
            </p>
            <p>
             He seems super crazy like Catherine Agnew in some posts but in later posts he's not as crazy sounding. The lack of consistency makes me wonder more than the craziness itself.  Crazy talk from an mk ultra victim doesn't surprise me, but flipping from crazy to normal(ish) back to crazy again is odd

             I think I found something on the Seattle music industry that may deserve its own thread eventually, but this is literally the first article I've read on Seattle music industry but I know there's lots more. I think the MK ultra victim was telling some truths. Either way, he gave some new potential leads. What do you think?

             Looking into Seattle there are some ties one could say as well as a port with access only by ferry and a bridge called Deception?? Here's a snip from an article - check out the article/column title
            </p>
            <p>
             Sunday Old School: The Acc√ºsed posted Aug 12 2012 at 9:05 AM by sonictherapy. (3 Comments) Whidbey Island, Washington isn't that remote, but is only accessible via the Port Townsend ferry on the Olympic Peninsula, the Mukilteo ferry north of Seattle and the Deception Pass bridge up by Anacortes. It is in this splendid isolation that one of America's most revered seminal crossover bands, The Accused, found its inspiration. The time was 1981 and the place was the town of Oak Harbor.

            <p>
             This article talks about the beginning of the music industry in Seattle and this band, "the accused", had a "mascot" that was a in horror type zombie costume called "splatterhead Martha" She would come out on stage and go after the pedophiles?! Quote from article "The Accused coined the phrase 'splatter rock' since they were all horror movie buffs. The first EP, "Martha Splatterhead," was released in 1985 on their own record label Condar Records. The EP derived it's name from The Accused's official mascot Martha Splatterhead, who was a vision from keen illustrator Tommy Niemeyer. Martha was a zombie who came back from the dead to mete out justice to the dregs of society - pedophiles and rapists. The concept took hold and most of The Accused's releases included Martha on their covers and titles"
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there's a tracking titled "Fuc#### Bucks"! Then look at the rest of the titles and a band they toured with named Revolting Cocks:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The 1986 debut full-length "The Return of Martha Splatterhead" was the first album ever issued on Earache records. The bassist was asked to leave, being replaced by Alex 'Maggot Brain' Sibbald. That first Accused album became a classic, containing a reworked version of "Fucking 4 Bucks" (which shows up a lot) and "Wrong Side of the Grave." 1987's "More Fun than an Open Casket Funeral" was released on Combat records, bringing with it classics like "Halo of Flies" and the tradition of The Accused putting cover songs on its albums. "Devil Woman" was one of many covers The Accused would do, it's intro coming from a 40's radio show "Lights Out." Tommy stated at the time that a band should either nail a cover spot-on or completely fuck it up and make it hilarious. Usually The Accused would do the latter, and Cliff Richard never sounded so warped in their rendition of his song. In terms of covers, these guys gave the Revolting Cocks a run for their money. Over the years, The Accused almost became better known for its covers than its originals. They do straightforward renditions of bands such as the Angry Samoans, and then do completely random versions of artists like Olivia Newton-John. "Martha Splatterhead's Maddest Stories Ever Told" was released in 1988, signaling the departure of the original drummer and making way for Steve Nelson and eventually Josh Snider. That third album brought with it the scene favorites "Psychomania" and "Starved to Death," and also began a longtime collaboration period with producer Jack Endino. The most bastardized cover ever, "I'd Love to Change the World," appeared on this album. The beautiful acoustic guitar sounds just like you're about to hear Alvin Lee in the beginning and was the work of none other than Metal Church's Kurdt Vanderhoof. On most albums, they brought in a guest star. 1989 saw the release of a three-song split with Morhphis, on which they did the track "Brutality and Corruption."
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there's a title "Baked Tapes" Could that be deterring to video tapes? "2003's comeback release, "Oh Martha," was put out on their label Condar Records. They figured that at least when you release something on your own label you have the rights to it. So many of The Accused's back catalogue albums get re-released due to being out of print and some being the victims of a bankrupt label like Nastymix. The reunion was short-lived, Tommy doing the vocals himself on tracks such as "13 Letters." Nuclear Blast ended up reissuing it in 2006 as a double LP "Baked Tapes," with a 34-song archive from 1981-86. The Accused also appeared on the Louder Than Hell compilation in 2005 along with Hirax, Municipal Waste and two other bands."

             And there's something in there about chickens I think. Anyway, I'm going to look into the port.

              While I am not a fan of this music I did try to listen to Halo of Flies (and all I could think of was Halo of Lies).  There is enough of dark stuff in there to warrant some research and the Chicken thing is another reason.  Go to it and develop a thread it is certainly worth it.

             It's really bizarre stuff.  I read the whole thread though.  Some things were eye opening whether he's truly mk ultra or not.  He has a lot of insight to the music industry
