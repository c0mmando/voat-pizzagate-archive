<p>&quot;I HAVE THE DEMS END GAME ON DT JR MEETING. HE\'S A DISTRACTION, THEY\'RE GOING AFTER TRUMP WITH THIS. ALL INFO INSIDE. (self.The_Donald)

They\'ve already started running what I wrote below!! <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/new-details-emerge-moscow-real-estate-deal-led-trump-kremlin-alliance-190126219.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/new-details-emerge-moscow-real-estate-deal-led-trump-kremlin-alliance-190126219.html</a>
I\'m pretty sure I\'ve figured out the long game with the Russian meeting that they\'ve set Trump jr. up with. They\'ve had this connection planned since May before anyone was ever &quot;hacked&quot; back in May 2016 via the DNC emails. I have their oppo research and all the players are there for what they\'re going to say. Their end game is to use this against Trump We know from the DT jr\'s email that someone named Emin Aglarov pushed to set the meeting up, he initiated it. We also know that this Emin is connected to the president of a country which is why he\'s pictured with John Kerry and knows Hillary Clinton <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev</a>. All the connections are here <a href="https://i.redd.it/uwbd7vrrx19z.jpg">https://i.redd.it/uwbd7vrrx19z.jpg</a>. The top meeting is in May of 2016 (same time as the DNC oppo research at the bottom AND one month before the meeting was set up).
As we see from this article that was just posted <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/07/well-lookie-russian-lawyer-veselnitskaya-pictured-obama-ambassador-russia-8-days-trump-jr-mtg/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/07/well-lookie-russian-lawyer-veselnitskaya-pictured-obama-ambassador-russia-8-days-trump-jr-mtg/</a> . The Russian lawyer is sitting right in front of Emin (who set up the meeting) 8 days after the meeting happened in congress right behind Obama\'s Russian ambassador (he could coordinate everything). We also know this isn\'t just any Russian lawyer, she is connected to Fusion GPS which is connected to the DNC paid for foreign agent acquired piss dossier <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/News/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jr-russian-lawyer-steele-dossier-natalia-veselnitskaya-gps-fusion-a7834541.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/News/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jr-russian-lawyer-steele-dossier-natalia-veselnitskaya-gps-fusion-a7834541.html</a>. Here is the Russian oppo research from the DNC in May 2016 (one month before the meeting and BEFORE ANY HACKING TOOK PLACE). <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/10436">https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/10436</a> (search for Emin and he is their entire link to &quot;Putin&quot; because President Trump is in one of his music videos).
So in closing, the DNC in May of 2016 BEFORE THERE WAS ANY HACKING planned to use Emin to connect President Trump to Putin since he was in a music video of his. Kerry met with Emin\'s father in law in May of 2016, one month before the meeting was requested with DT jr. in June. The Russian lawyer who attended the meeting was spotted with Emin 8 days later in Congress (who let them in?) AND is connected to the Fusion GPS fake piss dossier.
MOST IMPORTANT PART (summary). This DNC hit job to connect Emin to Putin and then Emin to President Trump was planned BEFORE THE DNC WAS &quot;HACKED&quot; BY &quot;RUSSIA&quot;. This was their end game all along. Their next &quot;bombshell&quot; will be &quot;Who is this Emin that set up the meeting? Oh wow he\'s connected to Putin and here is President Trump in his music video&quot;. This is how they\'re going to use this bullshit cooked up meeting to go after President Trump. All planned since May of 2016 before anyone was fucking &quot;hacked&quot;. And they weren\'t his name was fucking Seth Rich you fucks.
EDIT. HERE IS THE EMAIL WHERE THEY GOT THE TRUMP MUSIC VIDEO OF EMIN, THEY EVEN SAY &quot;PUTIN CONNECTED&quot;. ALL BEFORE THE HACKING EVEN HAPPENED. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/11812">https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/11812</a>&quot;</p>',

            You needed a Reddittor to tell you this?  Let me ask you this question Don Jr, Kushner and the Trump's Campaign Manager take a "high level and sensitive" meeting set up by a Russian oligarch family who are personal friends and business partners of the Trumps and nobody tells Donald?  Do you really believe that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also cooked up?  Have you read the email?  Do you know who Emin and Aras are?  Are you claiming personal friends of the Trump's are working with the "Dems?"
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Good morning
Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.
The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.
What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?
I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.
Best
Rob Goldstone

             The email was bizarre - loaded with code words and terminology that allowed Obama to go after a FISA warrant, then the woman discussed NONE of that in the meeting. Kerry met with one of the people involved in May, the Trump Jr. meeting occurs in June and then the "Russian hacking" occurs.  Seth Rich is murdered for being the real leaker and destroying their setup and threatening to expose the DNC voter fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             The woman may have done this to get her adoption film seen or she may be part of the get Trump gang.  Either way this is all a farce - Obama/Clinton were the ONLY ones involved with Russia.

              This email has nothing to do with a FISA warrant or Obama.  It just came out this week. And there's no doubt it's authentic as Don Jr released once he heard the NY Times had it. The person sending the email and the people mentioned who vouch for the woman lawyer are FAMILY FRIENDS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS of the Trumps.  You know there's video right?

              And you know that based on what?  Based on what they said?  JR lied about this meeting about four different times this week.  Why would you take his word on this?

                Yeah, the email was sent in June 2016 and by came out, I meant that knowledge of this email just came out.  The emails were discovered after Jared Kushner ammended his security clearance to include this meeting.  His lawyers then discovered the emails.

               <p>
                There's no part of this story that says a FISA warrant was granted.  Why do you claim it was the basis of a FISA warrant?

                 The FISA warrant wasn't granted - it was when it was requested.  Then Obama just spied anyway and had Susan Rice unmask everyone.

               We got the Clinton's selling out our uranium supply to Russia.  That is a yuuuge national security risk.  But heck, let's go after Trump for tweeting.

                Nope.  We have steady supply of Uranium.  It's also super cheap to buy right now.  You can get some for $40 on Amazon. We have a bunch and our friends Australia and Canada have the most in the world, we could just buy more from them if we needed more.  A lot of our mines aren't not even producing right now, because the prices are so low.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Uranium One deal did not involve an American company.  It was a Canadian company that had mines in the US and Kazakhstan.  It's the Kazakhstan mines that the Russians really wanted.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's a process that the US Government set up to review transactions like this.  It's called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  It involves many parts of the US government and the CFIUS board is headed by the Treaury Department (not State). Congress has an oversight role.  This process was followed in the Uranium One sale and the US government (not the Clintons) decided this sale presented no threat to the US government, because it didn't.  The State Department's representative on the CFIUS board said Clinton had nothing to do with this transaction pro or con.   One of the key reasons it posed no threat to national security is uranium mining has very strict oversight and you need a special export license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to export the uranium from the United State and Uranium One doesn't have one.  So the owners of this mine can bring the uranium from the ground and sell it for a profit within the United state.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the US 1126 tons of uranium were mined by various companies.  23 were mined by Uranium One.  That's 2% of US Production.

                Uranium prices have dropped considerably.  Had the Russians waited a couple of years, they could have made that purchase must cheaper.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 After Fukushima, uranium prices fell from $73 a pound to a low of $18 a pound. While pricing has rebounded slightly, the current $20 level isn't sustainable as it remains below the cost of production.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Uranium One isn't even producing at several mines because the prices are too low for it to be profitable and in 2016, they sold a bunch of their mines to another Canadian Company called Anfield.
