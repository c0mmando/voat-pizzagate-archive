            I think there was a thread about this. They were dismantled because they are lawyers, and cannot misrepresent themselves (cops are allowed to lie, for under cover, or just because).

             seriously, have you read any of the emails? Because everybody here has. And you will not change our minds. I highly suggest you actually read the emails. you will find that being with her aligns you with criminals or at the very least makes you vomit.
