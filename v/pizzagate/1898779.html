I have listened to this video several times (to my own detriment) just to make sure that i was hearing the same thing and was not mistaken. Till this day i have not changed my mind.</p>
<p>I do not believe that the person in the fatherhood video is Jerry Fogle because it doesn\'t sound like Jerry Fogle\'s voice - at all. </p>
<p>It was LONG after i heard the fatherhood video that i came across another video that a youtuber  uploaded which happened to combine the fatherhood video and  the video of Heavy Breathing talking on stage at Comet Pizza about a person called &quot;Jerry&quot; . Even then i didn\'t connect the two!!! (Yes i know).</p>
<p>I put up the link for this video on an earlier post BUT it was taken down because it made reference to J.Podesta  being the abuser instead of saying &quot;alleged&quot; abuser. So the post was removed. </p>
<p>The reason i put this link up originally was to ASK voaters who Heavy Breathing was referring to when talking about &quot;Jerry&quot; . Jerry Who??Many voaters said that Heavy Breathing was referring to JERRY FOGLE who had been arrested for crimes of pedophilia. </p>
<p>To be completely honest i only knew Jerry Fogle as Jarod Fogle. At first i thought who is this JERRY Heavy Breathing are talking about and who is this Jerry the child mentions in the fatherhood video!!!!
The only Jerry\'s i knew at the time was Epstein and Jerry Sandusky. I didn\'t know Jarod Fogle had the nickname Jerry. It just didn\'t occur to me. </p>
<p>Please note: I have sensitive hearing. Two people may be talking loudly but i hear it more loudly. A door may be closed but i hear it shut loudly etc etc. I have had this my whole life. So if people cannot hear or have not heard the child in the fatherhood video say the name Jerry it may be because you can\'t hear it as clearly as i can. Like i said earlier i have listened to this video over and over to make sure that i heard the name Jerry and i can say 150% that i most certainly did. </p>
<p>So.....why is any of this important. 
1/ Jerry Fogle frequented COMET PIZZA in DC
2/ Jerry was friends with Comet Pizza owner James Alefantis
3/ The child in the &quot;fatherhood&quot; video said the name Jerry when asked &quot;What is my name&quot;.  I also heard the name Jarod said by the child but much less clearly than the name Jerry. The child said two separate names because they were asked the SAME question what is my name.
4/ Heavy Breathing a band who has very close ties to Comet Pizza and James Alefantis talked on stage about a Jerry many believe they were talking about Jerry Fogle.</p>
<p>These videos can be found on Youtube. Some are better copies than others. Please pick the one\'s that are the most clearest to you to have another listen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>If anyone has anything they would like to add to this please do in regard to Jerry Fogle and any links you have that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>The aim of this post is to establish WHERE this fatherhood video took place. I am trying to join the dots. I am NOT trying to make a theory fit. What would be the point of that. I am only interested in FACTS and would not lie to myself or anyone on here to make a theory fit. My main concern is for the children and establishing where this torture took place and who the FUCK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!!!!!!!

            It also sounds a lot more like "JOHN!" than "JERRY!" in the fatherhood video.
