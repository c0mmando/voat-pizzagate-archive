<p>Starting at 12:21; Michael Scott says Michael: I don’t get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. I joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives. They’re adults, for godsake.</p>
<p>Starting at 12:40 shows Michael Scott\'s tape of him as a child; on a show called \'Fundle Bundle\' Michael references what an amazing body the female adult role has.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they\'re having a pizza party.</p>
<p>17:51 gets weird. 
Michael: Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a user name, and, I have a great one. Little Kid Lover. That way people will know exactly where my priorities are at.</p>
<p>Little kid lover, weird covered in humor.</p>
<p>19:53 Dwight: The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren’t enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. (Laughs) They didn’t eat the children. It never came to that.</p>
<p>Honestly sounds like cannibalis, reference.</p>
<p>Also at the start of the video,  a Hansen and Gretel reference, which is a story about a witch eating two kids.</p>
<p>It ends on that note, tbh, it felt a little out of tune compared to other episodes, could tell they were tying to throw subliminal in.</p>
<p>Thanks pizzagate, for ruling my favorite comedy, sigh.</p>
<p>The episode is filled with innuendos( I think) but I showed the significant ones.</p>
<p>Sorry for the times not being linked, my internet is being annoying.</p>',
