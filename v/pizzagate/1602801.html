<p><strong>WHO IS MARY SUE AND WHY IS SHE A POTENTIAL PERSON OF INTEREST?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a <a href="https://archive.is/EbaIF#selection-877.0-877.209">Molly Hightower blog post</a> dated <strong>9 Sept 2009</strong> she speaks of  <strong>Vern, Mary Sue and Thomas</strong></li>
</ul>

recently moved to the DR where Mary Sue works at the embassy, and visited us earlier this week.</strong></p>

<li><a href="https://oig.state.gov/system/files/168266.pdf">This</a> embassy inspection report from <strong>May 2011</strong>, where Consul General <strong>Mary Sue Conaway</strong> was head of the visa department, states a decade of weakness and deficiencies. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Although embassy officials acknowledge the high-fraud atmosphere of the Dominican 
Republic, the management section’s internal controls have been weak for a number of years, 
as reflected in the past three OIG inspection reports. The arrival of a new management 
counselor in the summer of 2010 has reenergized the operation, with more attention to 
accountability. However, a number of deficiencies continue, particularly in motor pool, 
procurement, housing, facilities, and maintenance. Staffing gaps have had serious negative 
consequences, but they do not explain the decade-long weakness in the general services area. </p>

<p><strong>LAURA SILSBY CONNECTION TO THE US EMBASSY IN THE DR</strong></p>

<p>Laura Silsby Lawyer, Jorge Puello, always insisted they had the correct paper work from <a href="https://archive.is/lMmHp#selection-1197.0-1197.193">DR officials</a> but never showed them. </p>

</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ms. Silsby</strong> said her authorization to collect Haitian orphans and bring them to the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong> was from an <strong>unnamed Dominican official</strong>, according to Ms. d\'Adesky\'s email. <strong>&quot;I informed her that this would be regarded as illegal even with some \'Dominican\' minister authorizing, since the children are Haitian,&quot;</strong> Ms. d\'Adesky wrote, adding that she directed Ms. Silsby to U.N. agencies helping the Haitian government handle orphans and adoptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister didn\'t want them to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Prime Minister of Haiti Max Bellerive</strong> <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-01-31-haiti-orphan-baptists_N.htm">stated</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;knew what they were doing was wrong.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It is clear now that they were trying to cross the border without papers. It is clear now that some of the children have live parents,&quot;</em></p>

<li>In the same article dated 31 Jan 2010 it <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2010-01-31-haiti-orphan-baptists_N.htm">states</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Haiti\'s overwhelmed government has <strong>halted all adoptions unless they were in motion before the earthquake</strong> amid fears that parentless or lost children are more vulnerable than ever to being seized and sold.

<blockquote>
<p>Devastation when I went to the hospital to discover my Jolene girl had been transferred to an unknown orphanage the evening before. I don\'t know where she is, but I\'m trying to find her to force her caregivers to bring her in for physical therapy. She was so close to walking on her own, and they left her orthopedic shoe behind. They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>Nov 2009</strong> <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> was scheduled to visit somebody at the NPH orphanage in Haiti, Friends of the Orphans, which is the orphanage that <strong>Laura Silsby</strong> was given children from. <a href="https://archive.is/Q75wg#selection-251.0-251.85">https://archive.is/Q75wg#selection-251.0-251.85</a></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Vern and Mary Sue Conaway</strong> (who had connections to the orphanage) visited the orphanage 2 months previous to the children getting <em>shipped out</em> on <strong>8 Nov 2009</strong> according to the timeline of Molly Hightowers blog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Sue Conaway</strong> worked at the US embassy in <strong>DR</strong> at the time <strong>Laura Silsby</strong> was caught trafficking children across the boarder to Haiti. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conaway</strong> worked in, and was eventually promoted to head of, the <strong>DR</strong> visa office which had problems with fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conaway</strong> had ties to the NPFS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conaway</strong> left as General Consul (in charge of the visa office) to the US embassy in <strong>DR</strong> 2 months after a damming inspection report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Prime Minister of Haiti</strong> stated <strong>Silsby</strong> did not have permission to remove the children to <strong>DR</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silsby</strong> insists she gained documents from an unknown <strong>DR Official</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conaway</strong> was previously <strong>Abduction Chief</strong> for the office of <strong>Children\'s Issues Abduction Unit</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conaway</strong> was previously the <strong>Special Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of State</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both the judge (Bernard Saint-Vil/Sanvil) and one of the accused (Jean Saint-Vil/Sanvil) share the same surname <a href="http://haitiinnovation.org/holier-thou-missionaries-behaving-badly?page=1">ref</a>. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Judge Bernard Saint-Vil dropped kidnapping and criminal association charges against Silsby and nine other missionaries who were stopped while trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country...........The judge ruled that Silsby and Jean Saint-Vil, a Haitian-American pastor who is not related to the judge, will stand trial on the charge of arranging irregular travel. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post says they are not related but I feel it is still worth noting considering the circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Sue Conaway</strong> was Special Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of State.<a href="http://www.expose-the-war-profiteers.org/archive/legal/2008/20080422-1.pdf">ref</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/yd9SElW">http://imgur.com/yd9SElW</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Deputy Secretary of State</strong> at the time was <strong>John D. Negroponte</strong> who has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Negroponte">involved in <strong>human rights violations</strong></a> in the past.</p>

            Devastation when I went to the hospital to discover my Jolene girl had been transferred to an unknown orphanage the evening before. I don't know where she is, but I'm trying to find her to force her caregivers to bring her in for physical therapy. She was so close to walking on her own, and they left her orthopedic shoe behind. They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra).

             Many rumors are still circulating within the extended NPH volunteer community regarding the outstanding weekend-retreats the Conaway family, namely Mary Sue, Vern and their son Thomas, provided throughout the 1990s to the volunteers who served in the NPH Mexico home. Based in Mexico City, the Conaways generously invited volunteers to spend their weekends in their family home and the concomitant rest, change and treats were highly appreciated.

            <p>
             Monday was a little sad for me, because I went to the hospital to get Eveline for swimming only to find that she had been moved to a “more permanent setting” away from the hospital. I then asked if I could take one of the other girls from that room, Shnaika, only to be told that she had gone to the same place! I’m not even sure where they are, probably some other orphanage or medical center for abandoned babies and I’m not sure if I’ll see them again. I took my other two girls, Jolene and Liliana instead, but now I’m getting nervous that my babies will keep disappearing without me being able to say goodbye!

             Monday was a little sad for me, because I went to the hospital to get Eveline for swimming only to find that she had been moved to a “more permanent setting” away from the hospital. I then asked if I could take one of the other girls from that room, Shnaika, only to be told that she had gone to the same place! I’m not even sure where they are, probably some other orphanage or medical center for abandoned babies and I’m not sure if I’ll see them again. I took my other two girls, Jolene and Liliana instead, but now I’m getting nervous that my babies will keep disappearing without me being able to say goodbye!

Secret NPH task force for special operations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many rumors are still circulating within
the extended NPH volunteer community
regarding the outstanding weekend-retreats
the Conaway family, namely Mary Sue, Vern
and their son Thomas, provided throughout
the 1990s to the volunteers who served in the
NPH Mexico home. Based in Mexico City,
the Conaways generously invited volunteers
to spend their weekends in their family home
and the concomitant rest, change and treats
were highly appreciated
            </p>
            <p>
             The Conaways stayed in touch with the NPH
family even when Mary Sue’s job commitment moved them away from Mexico and
after various stations, to the Dominican Republic (DR). While Mary Sue, who appears
to pull the strings behind the scene, served as an important advisor on immigration
issues to the NPHI Medical Services team in the recent years, Thomas and Vern
formed a secret NPH task force for special operations with a wide range of activity.
Whether it was in the aftermath of the January 12th earthquake in Haiti, where they
tirelessly worked on the ground and guarded countless transports with lifesaving
supplies from the DR across the border, or as patrons of the newly created cancer
program for pediatric patients from Haiti in our Dominican Home, the NPH family
can always rely on them. In the most recent weeks and months Thomas and Vern have
been an outstanding support to the NPHI Medical Services team and with regard to the
treatment of one of our chronically ill Haitian pequeñas who had to visit the DR for
better treatment options.
