            Frontex is Italian coastguard.  They are making a direct connection to regime change to increases in immigration to Italy for the time that Hildebeast was SecState.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The emergence of Libya as a collecting point for African migrants has long antecedents. Until 2010, Libya’s prosperity offered good job opportunities for migrant workers from African countries, who either used it as a final destination, or as a transit country where they could earn money to pay the smugglers for the last leg of their journey to the EU.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sea route has long been popular. In 2008, nearly 40,000 migrants were detected, mostly near the islands of Lampedusa and Malta, the majority of them from Tunisia, Nigeria, Somalia and Eritrea. The migration almost completely stopped in 2009 following a bilateral agreement between Italy and Libya. The situation changed dramatically in 2011 – the year of the Arab Spring. Between January and March alone, some 23 000 Tunisians – most of them economic migrants hoping to find jobs in France – arrived on the small Italian island of Lampedusa.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, between March and August 2011, more than 40,000 sub-Saharan Africans arrived on Lampedusa and, to a smaller degree, on Sicily and Malta. Many had been forcibly expelled by the Gaddafi regime. A large number of them applied for asylum in Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
             With the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in August 2011, the flow of migrants again almost entirely stopped. Detections remained very low throughout 2012. By 2013, however, the smugglers had reorganised themselves – and there was no shortage of customers desperate to escape Libya as the state imploded and violence escalated. In what was a de facto failed state, smugglers have been operating with impunity in the absence of effective law enforcement to counter their criminal activities.
