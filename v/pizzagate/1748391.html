            Well the pill does fuck with the body by tricking it into thinking it's preggo which apparently affects what kind of partner you find attractive so no contraception is perfect.

            If I was an evil overlord who wanted to make more babies, I would remove any stigma and shame associated with sex and encourage people to have as much sex as possible!

            I used a website to track my cycle and bbt daily when I was trying to get pregnant. After that I also used what I had learned about my cycle and the very small window of time each month that you can actually get pregnant to avoid getting pregnant again. It works, you just have to be careful. It's not hard at all to do but women have been sold on the idea that they must depend on pills that screw up their system. I hear what you are saying about increased abortions = more organs, but women really need to get educated on their bodies and take control themselves.

            So your saying that by pushing a birth control method that relys on abstaining on certain days when your craving it, they are in effect creating more pregnancys therefore making more unwanted babies which can be used in pedogate activities?

            It's one of the more unique ideas out there unfortunately I lack the perspective to contribute and I'll get labeled a creep if I ask around so I'll pass it to one of the lady researchers

            Ok.

            Basal can be effective birth control, esp when combined with the pill; avoiding sex when ovulating.

            Abortion is a terrible way to harvest organs. The surgical method doesn't remove things in one chunk. The size of the fetus during the first trimester is too small, like the size of a bean. The further along in the pregnancy, the less willing doctors are to perform abortions due to the increased blood flow to the uterus.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they want to harvest organs, they are better off pushing the adoption angle. That way they have legal custody of the infant and it's socially acceptable, whereas abortion carries a stigma, especially among those who've never had one. If people are harvesting organs, they wouldn't want a method that'd garner media attention like abortion does.

             The abortion thing appeals largely to religious ideals that a lot of goats here have.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we abandon the religious ideology for a second, we can easily understand that abortion isn't at all a conceited practice. Instead, it's an efficient and pragmatic solution to a lingering inconvenience brought on by biological demand.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, I'm not here to argue about people's views on abortion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frankly, this guy makes a great point and I never understood why abortion was brought in to this at all.

              However abortion is not completely safe and risk free. It can. Abuse a host of problems for a woman but PP doesn't advertise that. Once again prevention is the best option even if that means not getting screwed each and every time you possibly can!
