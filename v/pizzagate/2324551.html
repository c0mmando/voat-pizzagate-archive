            What could be bothering a man so much that he would kill his entire family? If it’s not mental illness, then something was tormenting him. I wonder if he was about to be exposed for something and couldn’t stand the thought of his family going thru it or what.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s SO sad. Especially looking at that little boy. He was so cute. It shows the mom had worked her butt off in a year to lose weight. The daughter worked hard and just graduated. All for nothing. Just to have their life taken by the one that should protect them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it’s definitely worth looking into more.

             Getty’s support enabled Anger to make his most recent short, another recontextualisation of vintage pop culture. ‘Mouse Heaven’ (2004) is a record of a rare collection of Disney memorabilia ‘started back in 1928 by my friend Mel Birnkrant, who’s a toy designer himself. He has a much better collection of Disney toys and artefacts than the Disney company.’

            Vot ze fuck... probably... reading now.

            Definitely something off there...

           <ul>
            <li>
             The wife was running daycare out of the home, but, only on 2/7 days per week.
            </li>
            <li>
             No immediately discernible motive to warrant murder OR suicide.
            </li>
            <li>
             Seems to be a LOT of coverage on it and the family members(including an array of family photos), all things considered.
            </li>
            <li>
             Police already ruling out other suspects(deemed murder-suicide performed by father/husband) despite all victims suffering gunshot wounds to the chest.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Motive would be handy here, but, bit hard to get motive from a dead guy who left no suicide note...
