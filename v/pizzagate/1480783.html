<hr />
<p>I posted this earlier as a link only. New here, I didn\'t know about the &quot;discussion&quot; option. Here is a remark, and my response, from that (deleted) post:</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://voat.co/user/HarveyKlinger">@HarveyKlinger</a> &quot;Considering how they pieced the video together with BS footage and how oddly this was spliced in, I\'m not holding my breath this is anywhere near the pizza place. It\'d be REALLY damn stupid (and nearly impossible) for them to be doing something illegal with cops inside and outside the building. &quot;</p>
<p>Response: I appreciate your argument, but consider listening to the second podcast. These guys are being sincere about what actually happened. He admits this part is really strange even to him. He admits and relishes in the parts where did do deceptive splicing. His second podcast was meant to be the big reveal about how they made idiots out of all of us. The last thing he wanted to do was admit to something that would make us look legit. There is also no way to stage something that could look THIS MUCH like 5 trafficked kids being rushed away. Anyone in DC can go check whether this is indeed from behind Comet. And I think someone with some expertise could figure out if there is deception here, maybe by the lighting, by interviewing the videographer, etc.</p>
<p>Consider too that the cops were said to be out in the front, but they weren\'t in the back, and weren\'t said to be inside. Moreover, the cops have been covering for him. They came in and kicked one guy out just for livestreaming. I wouldn\'t argue that people who are this well connected in DC need to worry about hiding much from the cops. Alefantis has been very keen to display his dark side, and I think he might get off on the &quot;in plain sight&quot; part of all of this. He can flaunt it in our faces. He has pentagrams on his signage! He produced a movie about how to make satanic cults sound enticing. I can imagine he and his friends continuing on at some level. What\'s harder to imagine is that he would have anything to fear from the cops or the media!</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, this is probably the last chance anyone ever had to capture something like this. My comments about how disturbing this scene was, received more downvotes than any others. This topic gets me trolled harder than any other. But on Twitter, my followers were profoundly moved. And I am speaking up on their behalf. It isn\'t only me who finds this noteworthy.</p>
<p>I believe they have sent shills here to slap down any suggestion that this scene may be of interest. I am sure they also have moved every last bit of their operation, or heightened security, to the point where the possibility of getting footage like this is now nil.</p>
<hr />
<p>Because <strong>this was a last chance</strong>, we should not allow what may be possible evidence to be thrown away. </p>
