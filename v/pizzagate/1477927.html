            why are you shilling for the Real True News fucktard who faked all that. Do you think we're stupid. That asshole was debunked in five minutes once I got hold of him. His entire story was fake. The menu, even the KP was photoshopped. And it wasn't CPP, it was WTP

              I am not sure if the threads here were deleted or not. If you search this forum for menu you should be able to find it if it's still here. It was100% debunked and he deleted his OP and ran. It got legs in conspiracy forums, but didn't get far. I do information analysis for a living, and that ashole ran like the rat he is once I exposed him as the same bragging "I write fake news" RTN "writer". It's almost impossible for a person to disguise their writing style. Also he was sort of stupid putting "pizza" in scare quotes for a document only meant to be seen by people who knew what pizza was and didn't need scare quotes. Also, he was counting on people being too afraid to look at the photo files, which were basically photoshopped war photos/kids. And his entire story on the OMG me and my friend helped the FBI...are you kidding me? It was such a stupid story I couldn't believe anyone fell for it.

                Because he was lying and when I caught him out he deleted his post and ran. That's all. We have a responsibility not to be complete and total idiots believing everything people post, because they're doing it to make us look like fools. That's all.

                 Yeah that whole drama. What a cuck.  His story was so unbelievable that it was incredible anyone believed him. He got the banhammer from reddit..he must have been completely stoned writing it. Me and my friend helped the FBI...ok yeah. Cause the FBI asked citizens to help...and then he said that his friend "guy 1" unplugged the WTP computer. OH jaysus. I could not believe anyone believed him.

                   It wasn't true sadly, and a good thing too as they would have ruined evidence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I want evidence as much as the next person. But here's the thing. I do information analysis as part of my job. I'm REALLY good at it (yay good at something!) and I remembered what happened post 9/11 when real, valid issues were being questioned. Truthers started digging, crazy shit, dancing jews, the NORAD tapes (I actually cried listening to them) and the leaks were springing..so..what did they do? They sent in disinfo agents..countless "there were no planes" videos and other insanity started getting added to the REAL &amp; VALID questions...and guess what happened? Pretty soon 9/11 truth was seen as crazy and people stopped listening and asking questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This person who created that whole fucked up pile of OMG was either larping, doing it for the lulz, or...deliberately injecting stupid shit so people would stop listening. No one was ever going to believe that a FBI agent asked two idiots to help him hack a pizza place...when they weren't hackers. Literally. Guy tried to cover for his lack of "story" by stating he barely had experience with computers...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Evidence gotten that way would 1. been inadmissible 2. unbelievable 3. and unviewable so what was the point? The guys who opened the photos spotted the shoops straight off. I spotted the idiocy in the "menu" SOME of the phraseology was from the endchan evidence of pizza/terms from the dark web. And the rest he pulled out his ass. It was stupid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I may not be good at a lot of things, but don't even try to pass written stuff off on me cause that, I'm good at.

                    I didn't see where they said the FBI asked them, that's fucking hilarious! I brought the whole 9/11 shit show for years but admittedly didn't research it. It wasn't until a few years ago I saw YouTube clips of conspiracy theories among the 'real news' videos and had a look for a laugh. Now, I had always been sceptical of the moon landing and thought the CIA had a hand in JFK but when the evidence of the 9/11 sham was in front of me my world crumbled and I'm not even American. Then it took many months to see through the hologram, vicsims disinfo crap that was being thrown in to muddy the movement. So now I don't believe anything that comes out of the idiot box or a politician's mouth. I even now believe the Port Arthur massacre over here was a psy-op to take our guns and I always believed in gun control like the good little hippy socialist that I was.

                     Yeah, he and his fried, "guy 1" 1 were asked by another friend, and FBI agent to help him get evidence on WTpizza. The story ended with guy 1 dead or missing, the OP and I guess the FBI agent on the run, after OP, with practically zero computer experience, masqueraded as a computer repair guy and managed to mirror the hard drive and he was risking his life to post the menu. I kid you not, and people believed him.

                     I saw 9/11 right away. I knew what I was seeing, the buildings collapsing having been blown up, building 7...then the media told me I didn't see what I saw. I was like...but I saw...and they said ah man,  no ya didn't..I was so confused. I heard the reports of the "arabs" celebrating. Much like we listen to live scanners today. The bomb filled van in the tunnel...all that stuff poofed within a few days. Like the eye witnesses at the Sikh temple shooting said four men dressed in black...that was all over the news..then the cops said..no it was just one guy. Someone leaked the NORAD tapes of that day. There was a military operation going on simulating the exact same thing. (planes into buildings). So when reports started coming into NORAD everyone was confused. Pilots were asking permission to scramble, HQ kept saying it was an operation...it was surreal. You'd need some knowledge of military communications to realize just how bizarre it was for them. "Dispatch HQ" whatever sounded freaked, confused, didn't know what to say....rumor has it Cheney ordered them to stand down, but it didn't sound like the pilots wanted to. Some were insisting this wasn't a drill, others were insisting it was. I'm going on memory here as I only listened to them once. Don't know if they're still findable. But NORAD is really all that was needed to prove we knew it was going to  happen, and we let it.  As far as bld 7 old Silverstein got into the act and saved his ass a shit ton of money not having to remove the asbestos.

                      Oh wow whoever was doing the larping needs to work for Universal studios or write suspense  novels, very entertaining!
I have heard the Norad tapes and yes it was a complete shamozzle with all of the misdirection and confusion. I think I heard them on the documentary "The New Pearl Harbour" but i could be wrong, I've watched so many. Cheney denied he put a stand down order in place, of course.  I can't get over the amount of coincidences the public is willing to disregard.
And good old Lucky Larry with his skin rash on that day that he didn't go to breakfast! If you ever want to learn about Australia's equivalent to 9/11 look up "Fool Me Twice" on YouTube, a doco about the Bali bombings. Fuck The government's of the world, this is the uprising right here.

            calm down.  I just thought it was interesting.  it is a public person's personal testimony, therefore it is not "nothing".  There has been information elsewhere about the heavily encrypted areas on the CPP website.  Enough now chill.

            oh, I missed that.  Won't you kindly tell me the exact place on the video where he says he screencapped?  or are you mistaking it with when he said he had tabs open on posts and information so he archived them.

            could be bull, could be true.  Everyone was caught by surprise no doubt.  I did not post to defend but report.  I wouldn't have posted at all if the guy wasn't a public personality to some degree at least.

              More like 1) We have evidence to act on, or 2) we don't. Not saying it's automatically a hoax, we just can't act on evidence we don't have.

                Right. I didn't mean to imply that it was or wasn't a hoax, only that it might as well be if no evidence results.

                 Again, I respectfully don't agree.  In and of itself, a person's testimony has meaning.  That is why witnesses are called to the stand to testify about things where there is not supporting evidence.  I have not delved into this, don't plan on it, but the amount of vitriol and drama that this simple statement by this guy produces here tells me there's something about it that definitely triggers certain people.
