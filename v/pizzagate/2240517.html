            I saw a blip of an episode of the 2 Corey's. Haim was pissed at Feldman (for getting fed to the wolves by Feldman) and Feldman says to Haim, 
"I was molested too, Corey. I told you that." Feldman didn't say it with CONVICTION, he was trying to CONVINCE. 
I'm sure Feldman &amp; others were &amp; are victims of Hollywood. However, I truly believe Feldman sold Corey out from the beginning, in hopes to get ahead. Feldman IS a victim AND, an opportunist. If Feldman HAD been fucked with, don't you think he would steer clear of leather bondage outfits for the stage and instead of inviting real friends to his birthday parties, he invites strange (slutty looking) girls who are mandated to wear lingerie. Is that what a victim does? 
When he was on Dr. Schnozz, his leg was bouncing up and down pretty hard and he was clasping his hands pretty tight. Nervous? Maybe. 
Seems odd for someone that LOVES THE LIMELIGHT to be that nervous. He's a sociopath, pretending to have the right emotion and the right responses.
HE STINKS. 
IF HE REALLY WAS COREY'S FRIEND....$10,000,000 would never have been mentioned. 
Especially with other voiceless victims out there WAITING FOR HELP, NOW!!!

            Guys, I'm a day one lurker and I don't post a lot but I respect your efforts for 100%. I just wanted to say this guy does not seem legit to me. I had second thoughts in the first minutes but after he started talking about donations I was pretty damn sure. If it's about a greater cause why doesn't he ask for a voluntary skilled video editor or some sound equipment/editing guy. He is asking for fucking money, abusing our empathic minds which are just hoping he will be making an awesome independent movie instead of buying crack. Seriously guys I'm in the tin foil hat movement long enough to signal fakes. As soon as they ask for money instead of services it's bad fucking news, and I believe this is such a case. I am of course willing to change my point of view if there is enough reason to, but my gut is telling me not to trust this dude.

            Yes lets name the people who are known pedos and have already been convicted. This is unsettling, why is he interviewed by the gatekeepers of the media like megyn kelly and dr. oz. I dont think were going to get the truth and what were looking for from Feldman. Darn!

              Even if he is being controlled with hush money, listening to him opens the doors for the ones who aren't. We'll here a lot more from them if we're gentler on the ones trying to come forward now

             I feel for him. He might be a manipulator, I don't know the guy well enough to say. But I do know that if he experienced any of the terrible things we research here then I wouldn't be surprised if he is incredibly traumatized. I can't even relate to what it would be like to be in someones shoes who has gone through abuse like that of Feldman or Paul Bonacci.

             Yes, Feldman is a hot mess.  That doesn't necessarily mean his story of abuse is not true--to the contrary, really.  Nevertheless, as you say, sooner or later the truth will come out.

             I don't think so, he was a child star in pedowood.  He has been outspoken, he may of approached it all wrong but look how its been ignored for decades and the masses kept ignorant of the issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             Him asking for millions to make a feature film really irked me, his refusal to name names allowed Hollywood gropers to gain the spotlight, rapists like Weinstein are on the back burner, and the pedo problem hasn't even been touched yet by the MSM.. just the rapes and assault. However I didn't know he had a memoir a few years ago and used psuedonyms for the people we are asking for him to name.  It's out there and its been missed.  I'm torn between pirating his memoir to get names and figure out the pseudonyms now he has given us an example.  or buying it to support him.  He mentions legal reasons and they do own the legal system in Hollywood.

                Everyone deals with trauma differently. Is he crazy? Yeah, probably. But any more or less so than other child stars of that time? No. And even if he IS a little nuts, that doesn't make the allegations any less factual.

                I own his book. No need to pirate it. I can tell you that after reading it, and in particular how he wrote it, I knew who he was talking about for the most part. Sheen, Geffen, Grissom and Weiss are ALL THERE.

                If he's doing it for money or fame, that shouldn't surprise you. He's an actor, after all. But again, if he survived half of what he claims, and has been mocked and shunned by the community for even suggesting it happens, is it any wonder he's wanting to secure his future?

            Unaware Feldman has a book out where he talked about his abuse and uses pseudonyms of his abusers: Coreyography: A Memoir
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Feldman went on to explain that Grissom is who he was referring to in his memoir, but for legal reasons could not use his name and instead used the pseudonym Ron Crimson. The revelation prompted an on-air call to the LAPD’s Elite Special Assault Section. The actor has since given statements to the department.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Grimson is hiding out in Mexico
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Now, in this brave and moving memoir, Corey is revealing the truth about what his life was like behind the scenes: His is a past that included physical, drug, and sexual abuse, a dysfunctional family from which he was emancipated at age fifteen, three high-profile arrests for drug possession, a nine-month stint in rehab, and a long, slow crawl back to the top of the box office.
            </p>
            <p>
             While Corey has managed to overcome the traps that ensnared so many other entertainers of his generation—he's still acting, is a touring musician, and is a proud father to his son, Zen—many of those closest to him haven't been so lucky. In the span of one year, he mourned the passing of seven friends and family members, including Corey Haim and Michael Jackson. In the wake of those tragedies, he's spoken publicly about the dark side of fame, lobbied for legislation affording greater protections for children in the entertainment industry, and lifted the lid off of what he calls Hollywood's biggest secret.
