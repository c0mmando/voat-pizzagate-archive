            "Milo was told "it's not time yet" yesterday and cancelled his pizzagate speech. Bannon and Trump have a plan; jumping the gun on all this seems to be against that plan. Perhaps they want the enemy to feel as comfortable as possible so they don't tie up all loose ends. For instance, Comet is very likely 100% clean because of our public research. Trump understands that this dynamic is counterproductive to nailing these fucks."

            From 8chan. This is good, Trump has never let us down. He must have a plan.

             I have to agree. What I saw today after I found this researcher, and looked at his evidence, absolutely sent chills up my spine. He sent this stuff to Trump. He provided copies of the certified mail receipts on his blog. I can't stress that enough. He openly gives his contact information and encourages people to contact him if they have  questions. He is a professional investigative journalist researching this stuff, not just a hack like most of us here. Hell, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if he's in this sub lurking, or maybe posting a comment here or there, maybe he's been given a directive by Trump to not get too close in order to let the FBI do their work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gowdy's tweet today about justice for victims made me feel pretty good. I really, really hope we will see some action soon.
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO all these people  here in this sub are spinning their wheels trying to figure things out - and this guy already has.
