<p>He and his family also want to influence/reform children’s education <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/fundraising-early-childhood/bezos-family-foundation-grants-for-early-childhood-education.html">https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/fundraising-early-childhood/bezos-family-foundation-grants-for-early-childhood-education.html</a> He has a stepfather Miguel Bezos who was a Pedro Pan (Peter Pan) import from Cuba in 1962. That was a State Dept./Catholic Charities program to harbor unaccompanied Cuban children in the US during the Castro regime. 14 thousand children came and half of that number went to live in various states (including Lincoln,Neb.) under the auspices of Catholic Charities. <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/family-voices/individuals/miguel-bezos">http://americanhistory.si.edu/family-voices/individuals/miguel-bezos</a></p>
<p>Although most of the Pedro Pan Cuban children, now adults ,strongly support the program there were accusations of sexual child abuse that didn’t survive court appeals. 
<a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/priestdb/PriestDBbylastName-W.html">http://www.bishop-accountability.org/priestdb/PriestDBbylastName-W.html</a> 
“Rodriguez’ complaint states that he arrived in Miami in December of 1961, when he was eleven years old.  Rodriguez was transported to a CWB camp in Florida City where he stayed until the spring of 1962.  At this camp, Rodriguez was sexually abused.  CWB later assigned Rodriguez to a foster home where he remained for approximately two years.  From there, CWB provisionally returned Rodriguez to a CWB camp in Opa-Locka in 1964.   Rodriguez spent his final years of CWB care in a Texas reformatory for delinquent children.  Rodriguez believes he was sent to the Texas reformatory in an effort to silence his complaints about the abuse.  Rodriguez also alleges that 
 While at the reformatory, he was given a regimen of unknown drugs.  In 1966, at the age of 16, Rodriguez was finally reunited with his parents.”</p>
<p>Although the CIA was taken to court and “proved” it had nothing to do with the program, there are other articles that give witnesses’ names and alternative evidence: <a href="https://theredphoenixapl.org/2012/02/27/the-cia-cuba-and-operation-peter-pan/">https://theredphoenixapl.org/2012/02/27/the-cia-cuba-and-operation-peter-pan/</a> Report gives witnesses’ names and testimony that the CIA in Cuba spread the false rumor that Castro was going to seize the children from the parents and indoctrinate them into Communism.Panicked parents then flocked to send their unescorted children out of the country with the State Dept’s help. Interestingly, the head of that program in the State Dept. died unexpectedly at age 54 of a heart attack in 1964: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/22/frank-auerbach-us-official-dies.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/22/frank-auerbach-us-official-dies.html</a></p>
<p>Bezos Sr. denies anything of that kind of abuse occurred to him. He was sent to Wilmington, Delaware initially then landed up in Univ. of Texas after which he married a local girl with land and landed a job with Exxon. Texas oil companies were barred from Castro’s Cuba; they decided to help fund the Pedro Pan venture and then supported some of the children as adults in the oil employment field. <a href="https://pediaview.com/openpedia/Operation_Peter_Pan">https://pediaview.com/openpedia/Operation_Peter_Pan</a>
“By late 1960, Castro had expropriated several companies that made up the American Chamber of Commerce in Havana, including Esso Standard Oil Company and Freeport Sulfur Company. The leaders of these companies moved to Miami while they analyzed the actions of Cuba’s new government. Under the impression that Castro’s rule would be brief, they agreed to aid the Cuban children by providing funding for Operation Peter Pan. “</p>
<p>The Catholic priest, Bryan O. Walsh, who supervised the program was an Irish immigrant to the US, had previously in the 50’s helped Hungarian youth immigrants in the US and with the Cuban program became their “hero”: “decided to move there myself.  There was a little apartment in the back above the garage. I decided to move there myself to keep an eye on things and that began almost 20 years of living with Cuban teenage boys. Things fell into place.” <a href="http://eguides.barry.edu/c.php?g=287101&amp;p=1913442">http://eguides.barry.edu/c.php?g=287101&amp;p=1913442</a> He also in the 80’s was involved with Haitian refugee programs connected with the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The town of Wilmington, Delaware seems to crop up often in connection with the CIA: <a href="http://rense.com/general69/morecia.htm">http://rense.com/general69/morecia.htm</a>. Many CIA contractors are in the area. Another Cuban: Ted Cruz’s father, Rafael Cruz, who it is alleged to have had something to do with JFK’s assassination plot, married his 2nd wife who was a computer programmer from Wilmington. He also had a career with the oil companies, he also like Bezos sought political asylum when his student visa expired.</p>
<p>So can all these dots can be connected somehow? Cuban children brought to the US in the 1960s during MKUltra CIA programs. Not much data on their eventual dispositions: in Walsh’s words “I\'ve never heard of anybody going there (Cuba) looking for his parents or her parents and not finding them. It\'s been very easy for, sometimes slow, but almost possible for people in Cuba, parents to communicate with us. We have never received anything of the nature and so to talk with thousands or even hundreds is heartily ridiculous. “http://eguides.barry.edu/c.php?g=287101&amp;p=1913442
Some allegations of sexual abuse. Some evidence that the CIA was connected. And now at this time we have the 2nd richest man in the world who was raised by a stepfather with a murky background (both men with possible ties to the CIA) that wants to effect a change (a la Carnegie and Rockefeller) with the education of our young.”</p>
<p>&quot; collaboration with the Aspen Institute that cultivates the next generation of leaders” “Mind in the Making (MITM) is a national initiative to share research on the development of young children, including the importance of life skills that build on and promote executive functions. MITM brings this research to the general public - families and professionals who work with children - through a series of training modules and other resources.”” Students Rebuild is a collaborative program of the Bezos Family Foundation that inspires young people worldwide to connect, learn and take action on critical global issues” <a href="http://www.bezosfamilyfoundation.org/">http://www.bezosfamilyfoundation.org/</a> “But without direct access to the Bezos clan or its small group of staff, this funding source is a difficult one to crack. The foundation does not accept unsolicited proposals or inquiries.” <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/grants-for-k-12-education/bezos-family-foundation-grants-for-k-12-education.html">https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/grants-for-k-12-education/bezos-family-foundation-grants-for-k-12-education.html</a></p>',

              It's sad to see so many males here are still homophobic and ready to deny human
rights to homosexuals.  Despite the evidence that this hatred which has mainly been taught
by our male-supremacist religions has created violence against homosexuals, both gays and lesbians.
Children in their schools get the immediate message that they'd better not be different from the declared "norm."

            .  I am fascinated.  I don't understand a lot about MK Ultra at all.  You guys are going to think I'm an idiot, but what the heck?  It's the weekend and I'm drinking my Coke Zero with Lime and my defenses are down so I don't care if I seem like an idiot.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've googled it.  Wikipedia has a page on the MKUltra Mind Control Program (here:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)
            </a>
            ).  Does anyone know why it was called "MK Ultra" as opposed to, oh, say, "Coke Zero with Lime Mind-Fuckery" or something?   Does anyone think it's still going on?  I would FLIP OUT if I were ever given LSD without my knowledge or consent, and as a kid growing up years ago (after this program started) I remember hearing about all kinds of strange "suicides" of people on LSD.  I'm such a simpleton when it comes to stuff like this.  A well-educated but sheltered simpleton. . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            I also often wonder if I could ever spot a CIA operative in my midst, because this forum has me thinking of all kinds of things about which I never thought before the Podesta emails were leaked.  So my understanding is that there are CIA agents everywhere, in all towns and cities.  And I've heard (well, read online) that these spooks are available at a moment's notice to pull off an operation.  So I'm just wondering if we would know one if we saw him or her, or would they catch us by surprise?
           </p>
           <p>
            Before y'all spank me for being a moron (which I'm not, really, I've just lived a sheltered life as a workaholic) please know that I attempted to do research into some of this CIA stuff before finally posting my stupid questions about it here.  But the CIA doesn't even post the numbers of employees that it has, let alone real information about the programs the agency runs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such scary, scary stuff.  Thank you,

             , Thanks. same here, had my head stuck in the sand while raising kids and working. Now the focus is opening the eyes.

             As to the origin of the name MKUltra, saw this on Wikipedia:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The project's intentionally obscure CIA cryptonym is made up of the digraph MK, meaning that the project was sponsored by the agency's Technical Services Staff, followed by the word Ultra (which had previously been used to designate the most secret classification of World War II intelligence). Other related cryptonyms include Project MKNAOMI and Project MKDELTA."
Looked up the definition of digraph,still didn't make any sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think there are any "stupid" questions, long as you gain some knowledge from asking.

            Bezos also has the lazy eye, which is a sign of MK-Ultra.

           <p>
            It seems that Stanley Kubrick knew all about this stuff. That's why his movies are filled with references to mind control, brainwashing, child abuse/trafficking, and secret societies.

            About three years ago, I posted on facebook that it's odd that Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton, Jeff Bezos, and Obama were also adopted. Something about it just seemed off to me. Now I'm guessing that we all/most CIA kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at how ruthless and successful Bezos is. What happened to him if he didn't do his homework and get straight As?

              There is a difference, but I doubt that the difference is relevant to my point. I think they are both CIA kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              Obama had an entire book written about how he was raised within the CIA (Manufacturing of the President by Wayne Madsen). Clinton has CIA connections through Mena but I have no other evidence to think he was a CIA kid.

             "Lazy eye" is the incorrect term.

             I have seen this BS repeated in GooTube videos, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are referring to
             <strong>
              <strong>
               unilateral ptosis.  It is common in JEWS

             </strong>
             , whether or not they have been MK-Ultra'ed.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Lazy eye" is ambylopia, an entirely different condition.

             I wondered about that eye , asymmetrical face. You're spot on about the adoption similarities. Interesting to see what their DNA looks like, similar clones? Bezos Jr. didn't want anything to do with his real father when the latter wanted a reconciliation before his death. None of the others you mentioned had any ties with their birth father. Maybe beause there wasn't a birth father, just a birth test tube? Convenient that Clinton and Obama's father providentially died off early on.Job's real dad is v.p. of a Nevada casino:

             85 billion is a number attached to a unit whose value is (for all intents and purposes) arbitrarily assigned and variable. The amount of value that 85 billion represents is not something that can be come by morally. Money is a form of power, nobody collects that much power with good in their heart.

             I don't mean to disagree with you, but a lot of these companies take taxpayer subsidies.  I know that Walmart and Tesla do.  Elon Musk was not even born an American.  I believe he got US citizenship, but I do not know when he first received US taxpayer support for his business ventures.
            </p>
            <p>
             Almost all of the military companies would be out of business without taxpayer subsidies.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have not looked into Amazon, but I would be surprised if they are not heavily supported.

               Even if it is the board, they are deciding how much to compensate the CEO with taxpayer money.  Why don't they compensate the CEO with revenue they earned and give the taxpayers their money back?

               There are many more.  I just searched "amazon subsidies".

               These companies are not being run by corporate geniuses.  They are being run by people that cannot earn enough revenue to justify the bonuses they want, so they shake down the taxpayers to make up for it.

               I have these arguments a lot with people who say that Socialism does not work.  It seems that one can argue that these corporations are Socialist, and it works for them.  Socialism is just not available to the rest of us for some reason.

            Wow, HennyPenny, you hit this one outta the park!  Excellent research and dot-connecting.

            Just a suggestion, I think your post would be easier to follow and refer back to if it were broken up into paragraphs.

             Thanks for the praise and the constructive criticism. I'll use the space bar more next time.
