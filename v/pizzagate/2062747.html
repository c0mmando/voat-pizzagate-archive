<p>Moshe did not send a threat to the White House. Rather, he communicated that he intended to go public with information he had regarding the flu vaccine that is being prepared by Baxter Labs, an Austrian company.The information is this: The vaccine is being manufactured in Ukraine. It is not a vaccine at all, but rather an engineered genetically mutated bio-weapon meant to cause sickness and death. Moshe informed the White House he intended to go public with this information. When he became aware that the FBI was about to detain him, he packed some belongings in his car and set out for the Israeli consulate, located in close proximity to the federal building where the standoff took place. </p>

<p>Rather than this being another fake news conspiracy, Manafort and Yanukovych learn the truth. Swine Flu was just a front for a type of weapon that could travel beyond borders, and make money for a massive influx of pharmaceutical equipment and NGOs. </p>

<p>Through art smuggling, the Ukrainian kids end up in the hands the global elite, most notably the Geffen entertainment network in Hollywood, where Chris Cornell, Chester et al. Bryan Singer make appearances. Steven Spielberg and Harvey Weinstein travel to Ukraine to film a movie with Victor Pinchuk, who coincidentally runs the shipments of contemporary art to Venice, where he meets frequently with major globalists and who is on the MOCA board. </p>

            I do have what is probably a dumb question.  I understand that fetal tissue is used in developing vaccines and that harvested human tissue would be invaluable for bioweapons.  But why the interest in bone marrow?  It seems like any other type of tissue can be infected and spread just as easily.  Why not use tissue that is worth less money if its whole purpose is to contain the virus?   Are they using stem cells from the bone marrow to genetically engineer the bioweapons?

            Wow, there is so much information in your post. You have opened a Pandora's Box.

            The Life Ball logo definitely leans towards the Satanist side.  Roisin Murphy, who performed at the Viennese ball, is also suspect.  Disturbing is a photo of the 'performance' with a woman hanging from the ceiling tied up.  That seems to be a favourite theme of theirs, as this is depicted in artwork and was featured in the Gotthard tunnel ritual. Murphy's music videos allude to the occult.  Ten Miles High, Exploitation, Evil Eyes and Overpowered are the names of some of her songs.  And it's horrible, crappy music.

            Fantastic post, Swordfish69!  This is some horrendous stuff.  I had no idea about the incident with Moshe or the claims of bioweapons.  It certainly makes a lot of sense though.

            and his claim that the Moshe bioweapon aspect of this story is false. I researched this story extensively when it was unfolding.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of those "neighbors" making statements to the media about Moshe being "off his meds" are the reason why I stopped looking into it. Most refused to give their name. So I looked up the 3 names that were given... all men in their late 30s. No persons with those names have ever existed according to multiple DBs. Maybe people can watch some of the footage of his apprehension requiring hundreds of LE personnel and a tank and decide for themselves.

            XLNT Post! damn, they used a bio-weapon. This has to breakthrough into the media world. Hopefully at least in Europe, Africa and Latin America where they can begin comparing notes.

            Unbelievable. Yeah it's really looking like the art world is the root of the child trafficking. Rockefeller has the patent to the latest man made virus and it's been said AIDS was always another man made virus which they used to try to wipe out the gay population. I'm starting to really believe this now as the depravity is mind blowing. Peter Thiel using child blood to stay youthful as long as possible, as well as other "elites", tells me they believe they are going to hell for doing despicable acts so they are trying to prolong life as long as possible until their little AI projects are completed whereby they believe they can transfer their souls and live forever. So fucked up. Swordfish, this post is nicely referenced and I recall the flight that went down over Ukraine and I think you are correct on your theory. What happened to the Ukrainian people is so sad, the women and children are huge for human trafficking (since the late 90s) as most are beautiful blonde hair blue eyed peoples. There was a photographer who did a book of photos of the youth of Ukraine I recall seeing this a while back and the photos were alarming, very sexualized youth in poor surroundings. Along the lines of Sally Mann's pedo images she made of her own daughters and family. It's hard to fathom how many people out there enjoy making money off of other people's misery as referenced above on the swine flu and the pharmaceutical industry. I noticed that Denis Solvay of the Solvay pharmaceutical family giants had his castle, Mothers of Darkness, and name removed completely from social media and it was all over before if u try to look for it.

             AIDS was developed for population control of blacks who are 13 times more likely to catch it. The reason it was stuck in the Hepatitis B vaccine one year latter in 1978 was because the Gay movement was becoming to millitant. So they assassinated Harvey Milk and released HIV at the same time - totally destroying what had been the Gay movement.

            This fits right in with Jane Burgermeister. Anyone remember her? She was exiled from Austria when she went public with her information about Merck, the WHO and the swine flu. I'm not sure if she's still alive or what.

            Wow..this freaks me out. Saw on FB a couple weeks back (someone who knows someone) a prayer chain. Some guy from AZ got bit by something that he said looked like a crossbreed of a spider and scorpion but they kept calling it a bug or insect.

            The guys arm was filled with welts and bruises. It looks AWFUL and the docs were mystified. If I can find the post, I will link the pics

             It was a Military HAARP attack (geoengineered) as was some other major earthquakes.

             Geeze, I was investigating 1000 degrees franchise because it seems like some kind of obvious, fast growing, front. The franchise owners are mostly Indian/other. That is some interesting stuff, and good work.

             This is in response to complaints about their condom advertising being dropped in letter boxes: Apparently some parents believe that they alone have the right to educate their child about sexual matters and that no-one should force the timing on them. The statistics suggest that many are not doing this soon enough. There are also many other groups involved in educating young people about all sorts of issues. Thankfully parents don’t have a mortgage on the minds of children.  WTH?  Do they think they own our children's brains and emotions and their puberty and when they think it is time?  I guess so.

              This problem is so big, and so far widespread, were at a most critical point mankind has ever witnessed before. But we can't drive out this evil with evil, calling for people to be lynched mob won't work, only light can do that.

               Yes.  My daughter has allergy shiners, but the pics of circle eyed children associated with these "elites" is too many to be denied.

                That is just as horrible.  It is the unthinkable that they are doing.  We would only know by having the children examined, but yes, that could be possible.  Whatever, they just look like all has been stripped from them. Horrid.

             I am so tired of hearing about Jews.....I can not believe it but I really wish the world did not have to bear their putrid presence....and hopefully in my life I will witness a true shoah.

            The whole Ukraine coup stank from start to finish, and pretty much red pilled me on just how fake even some news outlets I'd previously had some regard for were.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire MSM went into rabid Putin hate, completely ignored the atrocities being clearly commited by "our" side (at that point YouTube hadn't really tightened it's grip so a lot of citizen video went up showing what was going on....the Odessa Massacre was super fucked up) and anyone questioning that narrative was getting dismissed as Putinbots by what certainly appeared to be a brigade of paid shills.  One thing I'd noticed was for a couple of years earlier Putin had been getting grief for his treatment of LBGT folk, which kind of set up the SJW's for mass REEEEEEEEEing
           </p>
           <p>
            Although there were some obvious motives (Gas, bear poking, and tightening the military cordon around Russia) ever since pizzagate broke, I've suspected that was a part of the deal too (Biden seemed to take a big interest in Ukraine, which is red flag!)

               Let's just name who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Ukraine started and what boards they sit on now. 
Everyone got rich while Neo-Natals for forced premature births and organ harvesting became a booming business.

              <p>
               There are dead bodies emptied of their organs in pikes in Ukraine...these include tiny babies.

               You want to disprove it. They have the videotape and photographic records and electronic &amp; banking records seized and stored already.

            Several reports of plague infested fleas coming out of AZ! When we pulled out of the Paris Accord...Chelsea Clinton tweeted "Rising temperatures due to climate change are exposing bacteria and disease threats we thought were gone forever"
I replied "So what your saying is that your family will be releasing the plague and will blame on Trump"

             Yeah, I'm sure the existence of the plague has to do with with pulling out of the Paris Accord in 2017.   Gee I wonder if there were some facts to check that theory against.

             My guess would be they found the fleas today because they have been looking for them.

              Please forgive Are_we_sure. He or she is possibly the most naive human being on planet Earth. It's a long story. We're working through it. It has something to do with a lack of a science curriculum and a strong case of White Privilege.

               You also enjoy calling me naive, when your gullibility has you going 0-100mph on this new conspiracy you just this second learned about.  Naive also means lacking informed judgement.   And given that, look at this, this is not naive at all!

                Not really. I've researched Soros's underhanded tactics quite a bit. In fact just yesterday we had a discussion about "Blood and Soil" which was a term Soros funded Nazis used during their successful effort to remove a Democratically elected government in Ukraine.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've also seen the documentary "Clinton Cash" which outlines some of the extremely under handed tactics Killary &amp; Co are more than willing to use to get their way. I have two questions for you AreWeSure:
               </p>
               <p>
                1) Have you seen "Clinton Cash" yet and if not why not?
               </p>
               <p>
                2) Why is Columbia Economics Professor Jeffrey Sachs

             The guy arrested in LA was unemployed and taking medication for his mental health issues.  This reporting from the DAY of his standoff with police, by a Rendodo Beach newspaper
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Westchester neighbors say standoff suspect needs meds for mental issues
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              A Westchester man suspected of making a threat against the White House poses no danger, but sometimes becomes loud and profane when he fails to take his medication for mental illness, his neighbors said today.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The guy is harmless, but once he gets off his meds he is screaming profanity," said one neighbor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Neighbors and his mother identified the man as Joe Moshe, 56. Moshe fled from U.S. Secret Service agents and Los Angeles police officers Thursday, leading a chase in a 2002 Volkswagen Beetle up the San Diego (405) Freeway.
             </p>
             <p>
              He stopped near the Federal Building in Westwood and is engaged in a standoff with law enforcement officers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Asked why her son might threaten the President Barack Obama, 90-year-old Julia Moshe said,
              <strong>
               "I don't know. He is a sick man. Depressed."
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The standoff began shortly after 10 a.m., when police tried to stop Moshe near his home in the 8300 block of Creighton Avenue. Police have not publicly identified him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Neighbors who did not want to be identified said Moshe "sounds like he could be dangerous," but he has never caused any significant trouble for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              "He's got issues. He doesn't take his medication, he doesn't do that well," a neighbor said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moshe, who does not work, inherited the house when his father died. His mother lives in Beverly Hills.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             What was he depressed about?   His mother had recently gotten a restraining order against him and his violated it and didn't show up to court and an arrest warrant was issued for him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the story from the next day
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Standoff suspect had been charged with elder abuse aganst mother
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The Westchester man suspected of threatening to blow up the White House and engaging in an eight-hour standoff with police was already being prosecuted for allegedly terrorizing and abusing his mother.
             </p>
             <p>
              Joseph Moshe, 56, was wanted in two misdemeanor cases charging him with trespassing, violating a restraining order and elder abuse, Los Angeles Deputy City Attorney Mitch Fox said.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was arrested Thursday after withstanding four blasts of tear gas into his car, where he sat for hours, refusing to come out. Special weapons team officers blasted Moshe with a Taser at the end of the ordeal and took him to jail.
             </p>
             <p>
              His mother, Julia Moshe, told the Daily Breeze during the siege Thursday that her son was a sick man. She obtained a restraining order in recent months to keep him away from her, Fox said.
             </p>
             <p>
              "She lives in fear of him," the prosecutor said.
             </p>
             <p>
              In January, Moshe went to his mother's residence and refused to leave. She called police after three days, Fox said.
             </p>
             <p>
              From March to June, Moshe made repeated calls to his mother, threatening her and making demands, Fox said. Many of the calls were recorded.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moshe yells, screams and threatens his mother, the prosecutor said.
             </p>
             <p>
              The charges do not involve assaults against her, but the elderly woman indicated that her son has been physical in the past, Fox said.
             </p>
             <p>
              A judge issued a warrant for Moshe's arrest on July 29 when he failed to appear for proceedings at the Airport Courthouse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police said Moshe called 911 on Wednesday and threatened to blow up the White House.

             <p>
              Really? The modus operandi of the Clinton Foundation is very well established:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine">
               Disaster Capitalism
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact their M.O. was explained in a very well made documentary called
              <a href="https://youtu.be/7LYRUOd_QoM">
               "Clinton Cash".
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Find a disaster.
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Make money stealing 98% of the USAid relief money.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a sure thing. A well timed flu epidemic keeping people away from the polls would dove tail quite nicely with Killary &amp; Co's M.O..
             </p>

              AreWeSure why haven't you watched Clinton Cash yet?

             Yes.  It's an incredible amount of work to write something incredibly stupid.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a lot of glitter thrown up in the air to distract you from the fact that they aren't even trying to support sentences like this.   Just claiming it as a fact.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Through art smuggling, the Ukrainian kids end up in the hands the global elite, most notably the Geffen entertainment network in Hollywood, where Chris Cornell, Chester et al. Bryan Singer make appearances.

             There's absolutely NO Manafort bombshell incoming regarding bioweapons.   There is about moneyl-laundering and becoming business partners with high level ex-Soviet organized crime figures like Dmitry Firtash and Oleg Deripaska who  "upper-echelon associates of Russian organized crime" as US prosecutors referred to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, this is the actual Manafort news this week

              Paul Manafort partnered on an $850 million New York real-estate deal with an ally of Vladimir Putin and a Ukrainian moneyman whom the Justice Department recently described as an “organized-crime member.”

             <p>
              That’s according a 2008 memo written by Rick Gates, Manafort’s business partner and fellow alumnus of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. In it, Gates enthused about finalizing with the financing necessary to acquire New York’s louche Drake Hotel.
Two former federal prosecutors told The Daily Beast that the hotel deal was likely to be an item of focus for special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some White House officials, who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity, are also wary. They feel Manafort may have made President Trump more legally vulnerable through his decades of business deals with foreign governments and shady Eastern European power brokers. Those deals, these White House aides suspect, led federal investigators down a money trail that threatens to plunge the Trump White House further into legal jeopardy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Asked whether any Manafort deals seemed particularly troubling in retrospect, a senior administration official replied, “You mean like this one?” and appended a link to a 2016 story on Manafort’s alleged attempts to launder a Ukrainian oil and gas billionaire’s ill-gotten fortune through New York real estate—including the Drake.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Justice Department is now seeking the extradition of that billionaire, Dmitry Firtash, so he can stand trial for a 2013 racketeering indictment in a Chicago federal court. Two weeks ago, in response to a legal filing from Firtash seeking dismissal of the case, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago termed Firtash and a deputy as “two organized-crime members” and people “identified by United States law enforcement as two upper-echelon associates of Russian organized crime.” Years before the indictment, Firtash was a major moneyman for the Party of Regions in Ukraine, the pro-Kremlin political faction for which Manafort consulted.
             </p>
             <p>
              Firtash’s alliance with Manafort to acquire the Drake has been reported before. But far less attention has gone to the involvement of another party: Oleg Deripaska, one of the wealthiest men in Russia—and a longtime Putin associate. In 2006, according to the Associated Press, Deripaska signed a $10 million annual contract with Manafort for what Manafort pitched as political and economic efforts inside the U.S. to “greatly benefit the Putin Government.”
But Manafort was more than Deripaska’s political operative. They were business partners, as well.
“When Paul met with Mr. D last month he told Paul to lock in the other financing elements and then come back to him for the final piece of investment,” Gates wrote to two longtime business associates of Deripaska, Anton Vishnevsky and Andrey Zagorskiy, on July 1, 2008.
According to ex-prosecutors, a business relationship between a Kremlin-tied oligarch, an accused gangster and the manager of Donald Trump’s campaign is the sort of arrangement currently occupying Mueller’s time.

             I heard on the local news that they found some fleas infected with some plague that murdered many and I believe it has jumped to a couple of small animals.  They said to keep your dogs and cats away from small animals and rodents. This was found in Az. So people that live there should be up in arms.  Actually we all should be.

              The Plague isn't what worries me. It's treatable with drugs and its spread is easily blocked with flee medicine and keeping clean.
             </p>
             <p>
              The real problem is if some George Soros funded NGO developed some Influenza hybrid that keep people away from voting in an election. That's scary as fuck and maybe what they want to do in 2018. These people are psychotic.

               In general I like your comments, so don't take this the wrong way, but you're a retard if you brush off any weaponized bio agents. I spoke with a now deceased bioengineer from the 50's- 60's. You'd run off and hide in Antartica if you knew what they had 60 years ago. Still not publicly released. His expertise was botulism, but he also assisted with anthrax. There were entire depts he was isolated from which focused on STD's.
              </p>
              <p>
               He insinuated that the only reason "his creation" was not used was because it's use could not be limited. In other words "end times" and he was't very religious. That  was cold war, korean  and vietnam era.
              </p>
              <p>
               How fucking naive are you to think genetic engineering and targeting hasn't usurped super strains when we publicly know bacteria was modified in the 70's?

                When did I do that? The cases of plague out in Arizona have happened pretty consistently since white people started keeping records. I'm not saying Soros &amp; Co aren't above using the Plague. I'm just saying the examples out in Arizona aren't anything to worry about.

               I think it's scary because the drugs they use to treat it could be some toxic population control drug. These people are nuts! These are the ones that say we need to give our children immunizations. You can't trust anything.

               Good news and I am glad to hear your answer.  The second part is scary for sure.  We should spread this news around starting next Jan. they should not be allowed to get away with this.  They should be headed off at the pass.
