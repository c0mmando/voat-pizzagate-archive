<h2>It explores what a synopsis calls the “manipulation and abuse” of two unnamed men by Michael Jackson, from the ages of seven and 10 onwards</h2>
<p>Michael Jackson’s estate has condemned a new documentary film, <em>Leaving Neverland</em>, which features allegations that the singer sexually abused children.</p>
<p>Speaking to TMZ, representatives from the estate said the film was “another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson … just another rehash of dated and discredited allegations. It’s baffling why any credible film-maker would involve himself with this project.”</p>
<p><strong>The film, directed by Dan Reed, who has won Baftas for documentaries including The Paedophile Hunter and Terror in Mumbai, is described as “a portrait of sustained exploitation and deception, documenting the power of celebrity that allowed a revered figure to infiltrate the lives of starstruck children and their parents”.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numerous accusations of sexual abuse of children have previously been made against Jackson. In 1993, Jackson was accused of sexually molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler – he denied the claims, and later settled out of court for $23m. </p>
<p>In 2005, a jury found Jackson not guilty of molesting Gavin Arvizo and related charges. Arvizo was aged 13 at the time of the alleged offence. </p>
<p>In 2013 and 2014, after Jackson’s death in 2009, two further lawsuits were filed by Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who each alleged that Jackson had abused them in the early 1990s when they were children. Both cases were dismissed for being filed too long after the alleged incidents.</p>

            it’s likely that Jackson did get involved in paedophilia but I see this film and narrative of being part of a ((((media)))) deflection from all the paedophilia going on TODAY within people of high powers. Jackson, like Jimmy Savile, Cyril Smith, ((((lord))) Janner, ((((clement Freud)))) and many more are only hung out to dry  once they’re dead and can’t talk so can’t glip and call out the whole cabal.

            As much as I hate niggers, and for good reason, since they are a worthless, violent, subhuman race, the reality is that Michael Jackson was one magical, fucked up nigger.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wouldn't surprise me if he was a kid fucker but I doubt it. I think he was totally confused and saddened by his empty life and wanted to help kids, and thus himself, be reliving his childhood. I hope he didn't molest any kids and my gut says he probably didn't. I think he was just exhausted with everything in this world and just wanted to use his money to live happily ever after - thus the name "Neverland Ranch".
           </p>
           <p>
            I absolutely detest niggers, and Jackson clearly wished he was white, so I'm going to stick with my gut and say that MJ was a true anomaly and just wanted to help kids. Thus, that's why he was a scapegoat and demonized while real pedos get away with murder, literally.

            Some urban explorers broke into the Neverland Ranch and filmed everything. There was a magazine called Satan with music exec Tommy Motolla on the cover. Many bedrooms adjoined and really odd and creepy vibe all around. Remember when Jackson claimed he was straight and married Lisa Marie Presley lol! Another odd celeb offspring. His poor kids are beyond messed Paris, Blanket, Michael Jr.

            Just look at the covers of Off the Wall and Thriller. It's two different men. A Jewish cult of human sacrificers does this and replaces stars with doppelgangers who they then go on to compromise through paedophilia, and murder of children. This cult has the full backing of US, UK, NATO and Russian militaries and Intelligence agencies through Freemasonry. Their goal is rebuild the 3rd temple in Jerusalem.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing's going to come of this disingenuous investigation into the doppelganger, because it's just a distraction from the greater agenda. MJ's replacement is dead and the child sacrificers are still in power.

             What an incredible read, thank you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Always wondered if Trumpie was gayzie. He was such a pretty kid when younger and Fred Trump has pedo face if ever I saw one. Jamaica, Queens (NYC) home; upscale mafia locale. Fred Trump never moved from there, SO weird, considering his fortune. Didn’t one of Fred Trump son die from alcoholism at 40? Wonder what made him so.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would love to know more Trump Snr. Family secrets, if anyone can share?

             Have you seen this (see comments at bottom of page in your link):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              We should add to the list of gay hypocrite Republicans Illinois Governor James Thompson (who served in the 1980's).
             </p>
             <p>
              A friend of mine's father was a police officer back then, and was one of his bodyguards. Every once in a while, the Governor would send one of his bodyguards out to bring back a black teenaged male prostitute.
             </p>
             <p>
              My friend's dad would come home occasionally from work and literally scream "I can't take this anymore"!! But no one ever told on him.

            I have no idea whether MJ was a pedo or not.....I do know that Q has inferred that history will be rewritten and what we have been told is just the opposite.  My eyes are wide open to the sham the deep state has projected.  Knowing how corrupt the CIA and FBI were, I put nothing past them......

             Well, I guess you would someone call a pedo who has child porn in his closet, like Jackson.

              Maybe he did or that is what we were told.  Q says this is bigger that we know and that we need to thsee no for ourselves.  Could it have been a set up?  Maybe.  Could Michael have been protecting children?  Maybe.  We will probably never know the truth.  I just know that the deep state/cabal is evil and anyone who is a threat to them will be taken out.  I am questioning ‘everything’ that we have been told - was is truth or fiction.........

               'Pedo' doesn't necessarily mean that someone is only interested in children, it might also refer to someone who has sexual contacts with adults, but sometimes abuses children, imo.
