<p>Art museums and art sales, elite private clubs and hunting clubs, secret societies - everything here relates to how pizzagate style parties are enjoyed by the ruling elite - in this case literally two future US Presidents - and opens them up to possible compromising situations in which they can and will be blackmailed and controlled.  In addition, founded by Chicago newspapermen, The Whitechapel / Suicide Club demonstrates the pizzagate theme of the press flouting their role as the watchdogs of our leaders and instead shows them in bed together.  And that bed might just be a coffin.   
</p>
<p>Understanding these historical roots is vital to show friends, family and the public that pizzagate is actually not a completely new phenomenon and has many verified historical antecedents.   Now, let\'s start the show...and the story of Omene.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago\'s Whitechapel Club - Degenerate Dark Side of Victorian Era - Honors Jack The Ripper as it\'s (absentee) President!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jefferson R. Burdick Collection of Printed Ephemera in the Department of Drawings and Prints (in the New York Metropolitan Museum collection) contains 13 portraits of a woman named Omene. Now entirely forgotten in the history of dance and entertainment,...</p>
<p>Omene\'s most notorious scandal had to do with a press club in Chicago called the Whitechapel Club. As much a secret society as press club, the Whitechapel Club—also known as the Suicide Club—was founded by a group of Chicago newspapermen in 1889. The club was named after the area of London where Jack the Ripper prowled for victims, and the legendary serial killer was named (absentee) president.</p>
<p><strong>The club\'s quarters were a testament to the grotesque. The walls were decorated with pistols and knives that had been used for murder, human skeletons were hung above the central table, and skulls were fitted as shades for the gas-lighting fixtures. The bloody slipper of a Chinese merchant killed by a streetcar was nailed to a wall, donated by the San Francisco police force.</strong> <strong>Goblets were made from skulls of local prostitutes.</strong></p>
<p>Although the Suicide Club engaged in traditions and decorations both morbid and grotesque, a wide variety of celebrities sought entrance as honored guests.<strong>Future presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William McKinley both spent time at the club.</strong> Women were strictly forbidden—in fact, Omene was the only female to enter in the club\'s history. Already a favorite subject of reporters, Omene was asked to dine with the members and perform a dance. Although sworn to secrecy, the savvy self-promoter readily brought her story to the San Francisco Morning Call (June 10, 1893) and eagerly revealed the secrets she discovered in the inner sanctum.</p>
<p><strong>Omene described the furniture built from coffins as well as the instruments of murder mounted on the walls. She was asked to perform on top of a stage created from a coffin and, in keeping with the theme and audience enthusiasm, danced with a skull and bones in her hands.</strong> Omene was already famous by the time she visited the Whitechapel Club, but her &quot;Coffin Dance&quot;—discussed in newspapers across the country—made her infamous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The exclusive nature of this club is also in keeping with The Pugs Club discussed on these boards recently - women like Demi Moore or Naomi Campbell are included as sort of mascots, pets, or entertainment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As far as occult themes, the Goddess Kali is a death goddess who dances on her dead mate with a costume of skulls and bones, including a long human bone in one of her multiple hands.  It should be noted that while Westerners find Kali a scary &quot;occult&quot; figure, religious devotees in India consider Kali to be a goddess who represents an important cosmic element, and she is not an occult figure but an important part of a pantheon.   Nevertheless, with the tastes of these Whitechapel Club Jack the Ripper admirers, I have no doubt these finer points were lost on them and they just got off on being able to hire an important entertainer to embody their dark and reportedly murderous and warped fantasy life.  If Omene hadn\'t been so famous in her day, I wonder if she would have made it out alive.  
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently The Whitechapel Club / Suicide Club only admitted to being open for 5 years - they recieved an uproar of publicity when Omene discussed her performance and the interior design themes with the press.  These men no doubt took their tastes out of the spotlight to even more private venues, and it is unlikely that heading underground changed any of their practices and power brokering at all for the better.  Quite the opposite I would guess as Chicago is famous for it\'s well greased political machine from which many national political figures have emerged, including of course Obama and the Podesta Brothers.

            “It is common knowledge in the Chicago gay community that Obama actively visited the gay bars and bathhouses in Chicago while he was an Illinois state senator,” Madsen told WND.
           </p>
           <p>
            WND also spoke with a member of the East Bank Club in Chicago, who confirmed Obama was a member there and was known to be a homosexual. The upscale fitness club, which has some 10,000 members, is not a “gay” facility.  But it’s one of a number of places identified by the Chicago homosexual community as a “gay gym,”  where homosexuals meet and engage in sexual activity.

            Nothing seems to surprise me anymore.  Chicago, especially will have many skeletons bursting out of it's closet.  I fear that there will be much more heinous reports than this one.  Hang on folks, there were some nasty goings on there. They had even less respect for poor people then, although it seems that their crimes and disgusting sexual habits seem to have been heightened.  Getting bored, eh?

             lol carmencita you gave me a gallows humor laugh - I pictured skeletons in panic mode trying to get out of that damm closet but there's just so many of them....they are crushed! and the door blasts open spewing skeletons to the wind all over the city.

             Not were, are. Chicago is said to be another pedo center and hub of organ trafficking.

            <p>
             Never forget that Chicago is considered by many to be the "pizza capitol" of the US.

                I think we will find many things like this going on in these pizza parlors.  It sounds like a Sweeney Todd operation.  The thought of it is disgusting.  Also notice the logo has a lasso style rope in a circle.  the hand is that of a child with a heart in the middle.  Also if you look at the picture of each owner (featured as children) when they were toddlers, their legs are spread open and a little underwear is peaking out.  This place has bothered me for a while now.  They also own a rather swanky place too.  Ugh.  I am so sick of these perverted pedophiles.
