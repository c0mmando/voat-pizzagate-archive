<p>Well, Smith Corona was not the only typewriter manufacturer to  produce guns for the military.  And Tom Hanks, a collector of typewriters, has also mentioned in a number of articles that he also favours the Olivetti brand <a href="https://typewriters.com/blogs/blog/typewriters-more-than-just-a-hobby-for-tom-hanks">https://typewriters.com/blogs/blog/typewriters-more-than-just-a-hobby-for-tom-hanks</a></p>
<p>So, I looked up that company: <strong>Underwood Typewriter Company</strong> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Underwood Typewriter Company was a manufacturer of typewriters headquartered in New York City, New York.</p>
<p><strong>During World War II, Underwood produced M1 carbines.</strong> Approximately 540,000 M1 carbines were produced from late 1942 to May of 1944. Underwood also produced M1 carbine barrels for the US Government. Under the Free Issue Barrel Program, barrels were sent to other prime manufacturers who did not possess the machines to make barrels. It is thought that they made about 1 million barrels from late 1942 to late 1944. During the post-war period they were one of two civilian companies who were awarded a contract to refurbish M1 carbines. They were first to produce stamped and brazed parts by producing trigger housings and front sights reducing time and machines for complex work during milling operations.</p>
<p>In 1945 Wagoner was elected chairman of the board of Underwood, and Leon C. Stowell was elected president. Wagoner remained chief executive.[9] <strong>Olivetti bought a controlling interest in Underwood in 1959, and completed the merger in October 1963, becoming known in the US as Olivetti-Underwood with headquarters in New York City</strong>, and entering the electromechanical calculator business. The Underwood name last appeared on Olivetti portable typewriters produced in Spain in the 80s.</p>
<p>The original Underwood typewriter was invented by German-American <strong>Franz Xaver Wagner</strong>, who showed it to entrepreneur <strong>John Thomas Underwood.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The German name Franz in the Anglosaxon world is Francis or Frank.  Combine that with our entrepreneur and we have Francis Underwood aka Kevin Spacey: <a href="https://www.wnpr.org/post/hartford-was-typewriter-capital-country">https://www.wnpr.org/post/hartford-was-typewriter-capital-country</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second season of the Netflix series, House of Cards, the protagonist Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, pulls out an old family typewriter, an Underwood of course, to write a pseudo-heartfelt letter to the President.</p>
<p>Frank\'s father gave him the typewriter saying this Underwood built an empire. Now you go build another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Headquartered in Ivrea, in the Metropolitan City of Turin, the company has been part of the Telecom Italia Group since 2003...The company was founded as a typewriter manufacturer by Camillo Olivetti in 1908 in Ivrea, Italy. The firm was mainly developed by his son <strong>Adriano Olivetti.</strong></p>

            This is damn interesting, MB2. While it's not surprising that typewriter manufacturers were recruited for WWII arms manufacturing -- they require precision machining, just like guns do -- the Frank Underwood/Spacey thing really can't be ignored. I don't know how anyone could think that guy wasn't signalling with is weird videos.

             I have a theory about these plastic surgery facelifted morons. You know how many of the super rich have gotten facial surgery that makes them look like alien cat-lizard people? I mean how weird and twisted is it? How can that possibly be a desirable or attractive look? I suspect they are emulating their demon-gods. I mean how many of these filthy rich idiots look completely alien? I think they are doing it to honor and resemble their evil demon overlords. No sarcasm intended. I think they are trying to look like their demons.

              I’m certainly not a specialist but you might be right with some.  Or some are just dirt cheap. They get bad job and look like a gargoyle. The advice I read many years ago is to only get one face lift and make it a good one. Around age 50 to 55. Then age gracefully. Not many have heeded this advice for sure. Sadly some might be sick enough to want a devil image. Sadly Serious Intervention  may be needed at that point.

            Someone had a post where Hanks tweeted the typewriter in 2011. Also in Madonna tweet  she capitalized the whole word of GOD. Why is my question. Have not thought this out yet. Video was very strange as usual. Of course we have the always Illuminati One Eye Symbol by wearing an eye patch. At about 4 min.  there are figures carrying tube like shapes that to me looked like they could be large ammo. Especially while they are using the gas masks. Later there is a band in the background appearing with other singer and they appear to be wearing green army helmets or berets. Throughout the whole number there are hooded people that to me are like monks. She is always mocking religion. Usually Catholic Religion. She’s a Catholic my arse.

            Special Operations Executive

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a British World War II organisation. It was officially formed on 22 July 1940 under Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton, from the amalgamation of three existing secret organisations. Its purpose was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe (and later, also in occupied Southeast Asia) against the Axis powers, and to aid local resistance movements.
            </p>
            <p>
             Few people were aware of SOE's existence. Those who were part of it or liaised with it were sometimes referred to as the "Baker Street Irregulars", after the location of its London headquarters. It was also known as "Churchill's Secret Army" or the "Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare". Its various branches, and sometimes the organisation as a whole, were concealed for security purposes behind names such as the "Joint Technical Board" or the "Inter-Service Research Bureau", or fictitious branches of the Air Ministry, Admiralty or War Office.
            </p>
            <p>
             SOE operated in all territories occupied or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal Allies (the United States and the Soviet Union). It also made use of neutral territory on occasion, or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis. The organisation directly employed or controlled more than 13,000 people, about 3,200 of whom were women.

            <p>
             A variety of people from all classes and pre-war occupations served SOE in the field. The backgrounds of agents in F Section, for example, ranged from aristocrats such as Polish-born Countess Krystyna Skarbek, and Noor Inayat Khan, the daughter of an Indian Sufi leader, to working class people such as Violette Szabo, with some even reputedly from the criminal underworld.

             UK Whistle Blower - Pedo Ring goes "Right To The Top"
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             (This was not the first time a child-abuse case had been rejected. Years prior, a pedophile that had failed to register was discovered to be living on a boat on the UK rivers with another pedo. This was at the same time a children's TV programme heavily featured canal boats-
             <strong>
              Rosie and Jim
             </strong>
             . When he looked into the two on the boat, it lead to a network of 90. A high ranked officer told him the investigation was shut down due to not being able to afford the funding. This then lead to how a fellow Scotland Yard Officer warned him how investigating child abuse cases did not earn praise, and how he had dealt with a cabinet minister who had been investigated multiple times, and on multiple occasions they were shut down.)

             In this instance "Rosie" means "Rosie Lee" which is cockney rhyming slang for tea.

              There was a lot of stuff on the old David Icke forums about "Rosie" and pedophiles. I haven't visited for many a long time. Just went there to bring back some of that info only to find that the forum has been locked up and a new one is in its place.  Therefore all the invaluable information of years of research into pedophilia by British researchers is lost.  Whatever happens over at the MI5/MI6/Tavistock controlled Icke forum tends to happen here a couple of years later.  I expect that Voat will eventually be 'locked down'.

               Hampstead cover up is linked massively to Rotherham grooming scandal. A lot of the same players are connected in both cases.
