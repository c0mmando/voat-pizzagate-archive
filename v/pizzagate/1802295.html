            Yeah, OMG. After doing some cursory research on this subject, also considering the very apparent role Gore Vidal played not only in the entertainment but politics arena as well, I happen to watch the 1970 trailer with Raquel Welch, which Vidal said was trash btw, and I am utterly shocked at how absolutely every aspect of the film, book, Vidal, and now Clinton elements to it make COMPLETELY INSANE. How in the world could anyone not look at how the enitre ERA looks JACKED UP ON REALLY GOOD COKE AND THEY COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE. Even Mae West, in the film, looked like she had been an MK-Ultra prostitute to the entirety of Hollywood. You could tell Raquel Welch couldn't act behind that look of looking at every actor she acted with in those scenes as some kind of dirty snake... you can see it in her eyes. Or, she WAS acting and got in very well with all of them, either way, you can see they were ALL living a fast a furious lifestyle in the 70's HOLY FUCK... I vaguely remember growing up then and hated most of the style and the vibes of that era, although admired others then and to this day, however, it REALLY SEEMS LIKE THE LOT OF THOSE FOLKS WERE REALLY, REALLY FUCKED UP PEOPLE. And if you think about it, THOSE ARE THE VERY SAME PEOPLE THAT RAISED THE GEN X AND BELOW GENERATIONS WHO ARE IN THEIR 'GOLDEN AGES' NOW, THOSE THAT ARE MORE APT TO HAVE ALL THE MONEY, DO ALL THE ADMINISTRATING AND GOVERNING. People like Hillary and Bill Clinton. If THIS is Hillary's favorite book, and she gets off on the duplicitous nature of Mays character in her mechanizations in politics and business, along with her socialist Saul Alinsky style politics, her closeted lesbian lifestyle, and the unbelievably horrible accusations of sexual abuse and ritual/cult involvement, THIS WORLD HAS NO IDEA WHAT LURKS IN THE SOUL OF THAT WOMAN.

            I believe a more proper angle for the title of this thread would be to focus on the proclivities of Hillary Clinton versus her involvement in Pizzagate and the leftist policy and lifestyle she tries so hard to stuff down for the bible belt believing christian vote. The transsexual issue is not the strongest aspect of this particular piece, it's the fact that, once again, Mrs. Clinton has some dubious taste in literature and entertainment which only corroborates what us researchers know about her versus her sanitized political charade.

            If you look a little further into that Vidal story and find the inspirations for this publication, you will find that it came from some of the more prominent writing influences of the EARLY 20th century who were SOCIALISTS, inspired by the "megalomania" of Anaïs Nin's diaries who was considered one of the first women known to explore the realm of erotic writing.

             At least some one else gets exactly what I was trying to say. Vidal strongly believed in depopulation and mixing genders/non gender. Globalists use these people in arts, entertainment and yes politics to push agendas. Right now, the push IS Paedophilia acceptance through LBGT- everyone has the right to love who they want to love. And kids can "choose" to love adults ( and they don't mean love as in the heart, but obviously sex). WTF? How do sane, normal adults fall for this?

            Marxists/communists have always sought to destroy the family. 
Now we have the neo-marxists who believe that identity is the root of oppression. 
Welcome to the LGBT Mafia.

            AMEN. Just read some poor kid had genitial mutilation surgery in MICHIGAN. Now if some freak parent decides their kid is the wrong sex and some quack doctor thanks to the psycho push of gender confusion agrees, this could go bad real fast.

            Homosexual Behavior &amp; Pedophilia- an academic paper of 31 pages by Frank V. York and Robert H. Knight, published by the Family Research Council in the US in 2000. They write observantly, “Although most homosexual activists publicly deny that they want access to boys, many homosexual groups around the world are working aggressively to lower the age of sexual consent. Their cause is being aided by the professional psychiatric and psychological associations, which have moved in recent years toward normalizing pedophilia, much as they did with homosexuality in the early 1970s.” They present a wide range of very strong evidence for their case.

             There is the theory that the pushing of the transsexual movement by the "Illuminati" may have something with the worship of the Baphomet.  Baphomet is the demonic goat-looking deity that has both male and female (breasts) features.

             It's is the push of normalizing Pedo, gender reassignment, non gender in entertainment. As well as, people saying Myra Breckinridge being a fav movie of HRC which includes blackmail. Politicians being taped screwing kids used as blackmail has already been proven.

              It's a little bit of a false correlation.  People obviously have differing opinions on transsexuals, but they don't have anything to do with pedophiles.  They're two different things.  These transsexuals/transgenders are adults who have made a choice to live like this and if they are in the entertainment business, other consenting adults make the choice to go to these shows.  It's not hurting anyone.  If a person disagrees with these adults choosing this lifestyle,simply ignore it.

              Pedos are adults who abuse/exploit underage and/or underdeveloped minors.  It's a serious issue and it totally dissimilar to the LGBTQ movement.  So....the post about transsexuals is quite a bit of a stretch, and again really does not correlate with pedophiles.

               Have you seen Myra Breckinridge? If so, please explain the blackmail part, why it would be a fav of HRC's and how politican are blackmailed by being video taped screwing kids? And Peaches with the baby heads on her prosthetic tits is a bit disturbing as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               And since the Pedo pushers ARE tagging onto LBGTQ...P...for pedosexual, sorry, that opens the doors to look deeper. No "group" is immune to investigating. If you don't personally see any correlation or want to look further, your prerogative. Don't look and move along. I'm still going to research it out. If it comes up empty, so be it.

                You seem to be getting defensive.  The LGBTQ community didn't come together to welcome the pedos.  The pedos are the ones trying to normalize themselves by attaching themselves to the widely known LGBTQ community label by adding in their 'P' to the string of letters as if doing so legitimizes their horrid love of children/minors.  And again, I think it's a bit of a stretch to assume because Myra Breckinridge is a fave movie of HRC that it somehow correlates with politicians being video taped screwing kids.  I'm sure politicians have been blackmailed for this reason....but I don't think it correlates with that movie.  Its too vague and broad of a connection.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also think that assuming transsexuals are related to pedos because one transsexual entertainer put doll heads on her tits for shock/awe purposes is far too vague/broad of a conclusion.  That's like me saying that Miley Cyrus is a pedo because she dressed like a baby in one of her music videos or that she's a pedo because she danced around like a sexualized teddy bear.  Is it in bad taste?....Well personally yeah...it's trashy in my opinion..but again...I think it's just these entertainers these days trying to be edgy.
               </p>

                No need to get upset.  I'm merely debating your so called findings and connections/conclusions you're trying to draw.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion and those that have differing ones or believe differently are also entitled to debate within a forum setting.

                 If LBGTQ (XYZ..they don't want to be labeled yet use labels) isn't accepting the P on to their label, I do not see them condemning the Pedos doing this..at all. I do not hear an outcry as to how it's wrong to screw kids and to not use the label of P and lumping themselves onto this bandwagon. All I see is "Love is Love" and everyone should love who they want, including screwing kids.  it's all over FB and Twitter so they become targets of research like everyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You can have your opinion, as I already stated. And as far as "edgy" movies, music, entertainment in general, it is brainwashing. Slowly and methodically normalizing shit on the public. Tavistock Institue is behind this. The degradation of the moral compass. Some guy sticking his fist up his ass is an adult and can do disgusting things to himself and those who want to watch and call that art &amp; entertainment can watch. Why? Who the hell knows bcuz it's gross as hell. I don't call that art just like Tony Podesta's art work of bound up kids hanging from a ceiling. It's moral perversion &amp; its sick AF.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you don't get the blackmail connection to HRC (or Globalist Elites) w/that movie, I can't help you.

                  The LGBTQ community is made up of many many people.  The pedosexual movement is still relatively underground.  Yes they're making Google+ pages and what have you, but there hasn't been a big enough of a movement to bring it to the front of the stage because they know how the rest of the world condemns it.  So, because it is relatively under the radar, the LGBTQ community either does not know about it or simply knows that it's such a ridiculous notion that it should just speak for itself that 'screwing kids' is wrong.  There are a lot of people that do not know about pizzagate/pedogate...that does not mean they're condoning pedophilia or they are morally bankrupt because they haven't gone looking for the issues or spoken about it.  Again, yeah it's your opinion that these 'shows' are disgusting...hell I agree with you and would never go to one..but again...they're adults and other adults are making the choice to see them.  They're not hurting you or children....so just continue living your life and avoid these shows like I'm going to do.  Pedos on the other hand are looking to normalize child abuse and the other issue of child trafficking is a very serious and terrible issue actually going on where people's lives are in danger...THIS is something worth investigating and doing something about.  Not whether or not a man wants to become a woman and make a show about it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "If LBGTQ (XYZ..they don't want to be labeled yet use labels)" &lt;--- this comment....while I technically agree with you...there's nothing we can do about it...and they're not hurting anyone except stressing themselves out by creating drama...so it really doesn't add to the argument and again doesn't add to PG...so not really sure why you even bothered bringing it up...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And I get the connection you made regarding the movie..but still...it's still a stretch.  It's like me saying "I saw movie about a homosexual man who also worshiped Satan...thus all homosexuals worship Satan."  It's a false correlation.  You're drawing these conclusions based on your own biases about the LGBTQ community.

                   You are dangerously naive and an example of why women should not be allowed to vote.  Miley Cyrus is in fact a satanic pedophile and her career was manufactured to influence a generation of young girls.  They had her cry after Hillary lost so all her dumb girl fans know that it's super important to vote for Democrats. And y'all are stupid enough to be influenced by it and say "just because they are bizarre sexual deviants doesn't mean they're pedophiles" OK WHY DONT YOU SIT THE NEXT FEW PLAYS OUT CHAMP

                     Remember when Buckley called him a queer and said he was gonna knock him out? He was cia and skull n bones but the good side I guess. In the 80s he said hiv+ men should have their buttocks tattooed by force

                       No they were awesome. I don't know how old you are but before jays sabotaged our demographics and culture with PC stuff designed to stigmatize logical thinkers America was pretty sweet.  I'm young and I wouldn't even consider living in America as it is now.

                        Comparatively yeah, it was better (I was in middle school during the summer of love) ... and although I like to wax nostalgic about it, it was the beginning of the end.
But at least a man was a man etc. And people talked to one another. And if you broke down on the side of the road it was an adventure. Etc. 
Yeah, America is shot to hell now, sad.

                   I do understand what you are saying....trust me I do. And although this angle may seem to be a "stretch", I believe it's worth checking out. I'm sure the first time anyone heard of Laura Silsby, it was a stretch to think she was connected to HRC and that she is now working for Alert Sense after getting arrest for trying to take 33 kids out of Haiti, it's absurd so why bother. But without looking further, connecting dots, we'd never know it was actually true.
