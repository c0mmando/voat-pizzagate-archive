            Im norwegian. The article doesnt say the case will be shut down, but that its organizational operandi will be outfaced. The case is still ongoing, and the team that initially broke the case may merge with another police unit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dont think its suspicious.

              Sure. I haven't found any names studying the case. Normal procedure in norway. 
I dont think you'll find connections there - these people are probably not up there. I may be wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the most valuable leads to look into right now are the CF and MoPe.

             <p>
              I will update you should I find other intel on the Dark Room case.

            another .no article --  She is doing the dirty work ---  She is a HERO!!!
            <a href="http://www.tv2.no/a/8756224/">
             http://www.tv2.no/a/8756224/

            Hilde Reikrås (38), who started and led the investigation decided already in secondary school to be prosecuted for helping others.
           </p>
           <p>
            A gut feeling she got during work on the case of a 14-year-old, led to a ten-month immersion in atrocities against children.
           </p>
           <p>
            She took the job home with them when 14-year-old review of a 22-year-old to abuse:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I got a gut feeling. One thing was the material found in the seizure was of very serious nature, and it was very much. So it was very extensive contacts with others, a huge contact list. And then I thought when there are so extensive a place, what about all the other places here? says Reikrås.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            After Sunday's disclosure has her 25 counterparts received even more tips.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              It's tough. It is coarse images and movies. We are also parents and it goes on us but we have a job to do! We have stopped abuses. Then you know what you are doing it is so incredibly important, and that it works. So I am very touched by it. Yesterday we received flowers from 25 previously abused where they wrote "Never give up!" She says.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The last few days I've had feelings a little on the outside - the joy of everything that happens, so I have cried a splash, says the investigator.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Hilde Reikrås has its particular way to draw strength to do the job - see the report from Saturday magazine top

            At least four of the 51 men should have perpetrated own abuse. The four provisionally charged with this, one of South Trøndelag and three from Oslo, is aged 20 to 50 years.
Several of the men caught in other people's affairs, and many have had contact with each other. One man reportedly had contact with up to 200 others.
