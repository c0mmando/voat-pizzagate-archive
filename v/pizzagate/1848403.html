The number twenty two has occultic significance, and the card is designed to mimic the look a possible new card of  the major arcana cards of the Tarot Deck:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1847712">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1847712</a></p>
<p>In addition, the 22nd card in traditional Tarot decks is the one called &quot;The World&quot;. This is how it usually looks: <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xK93QOT50aY/UE3bCGTAJbI/AAAAAAAACZU/ABzrJQUdfLk/s1600/scan0001.jpg">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xK93QOT50aY/UE3bCGTAJbI/AAAAAAAACZU/ABzrJQUdfLk/s1600/scan0001.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>Notice it is number XXI. It becomes XXII, with the placement of the zero card &quot;the Fool&quot; at the beginning of the deck</strong> as you see here:
<a href="http://www.masteringtarot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/major-arcana-all.jpg">http://www.masteringtarot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/major-arcana-all.jpg</a></p>
<p>The card of The World at the very least means: <strong>the fulfillment of all ambitions</strong>. so the elites have achieved all their ambitions with &quot;pizza&quot;? Let\'s have a closer look.</p>
<p>The Tarot  Deck, which is composed of 22 major arcana (major mysteries, deep occult) and 56 minor arcana (four suits numbering one(ace) through ten with four court cards: king, queen, knight and page). The four suits are: wands/staves (clubs), cups (hearts), swords (spades), pentacles/coins (diamonds). It is easy to see that our modern playing cards are based on the minor arcana.</p>
<p>Like the Illuminati Card Game, the Tarot was ostensibly created for playing games, but the major arcana of the Tarot are used for fortune telling or prediction and have <strong>multiple layers of meaning</strong>. Many have already observed that the Illuminati card game seems to have predicted events decades before they occurred. </p>
<p>Without going into a lengthy history and meaning of Tarot, suffice it say that both the numbers and pictures of the major arcana have multiple layers of meaning and when they are arranged in a certain order, they serve to communicate events and ideas--rather like a sort of code. There\'s a common everyday meaning, then there is a different one for those &quot;in the know&quot; . Now this is what makes it interesting. </p>
<p>The January 2017 edition of The Economist magazine--a Rothschild publication--- features a Tarot spread on the cover--rather than the customary rendering of world movers and shakers. On that cover, there was a card called The Star, which did not have any of the usual features, but instead, it has fourteen, eight-pointed stars with a black and white **photo of a child **in each. These photos are reminiscent of the <strong>missing children photos</strong> which were once featured on milk cartons. Who are these children? Why are they on the cover of The Economist? Most surprisingly, why is there a COMET in the middle of these stars? Are the elite trying to say something to each other?</p>
<p>This cover also contains The World card (fulfillment of all ambitions).</p>
<p>Original post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/176913">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/176913</a></p>
<p>There is also an Illuminati Card with a slice of pizza on it (#444), referring to a &quot;secret meeting&quot;.</p>
<p>According to what it says on this card, &quot;Pick one Secret group to lose it\'s Secret status for the rest of the current turn.&quot; So, learning the true meaning of &quot;pizza&quot; and the Secret Group&quot; exposes them and they are not secret anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Summary</strong>: </p>
<p>Tarot cards communicate hidden meanings.</p>
<p>Traditional Tarot image of The World is replaced by a slice of pizza. </p>
<p>Tarot on the Rothschild magazine includes non-traditional depictions of The World, and The Star shows &quot;missing&quot; children\'s faces surrounding a comet in the center.</p>
<p>The Illuminati Card #444 shows a slice of pizza and it\'s use in play exposes a &quot;secret group&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Pulling it all together: The global elites, (any list would include Rothschilds) achieved and/or maintained their goals or ambitions through the exploitation of children (pizza) using blackmail and secrecy. Pizzagate exposes it all.</strong></p>',
