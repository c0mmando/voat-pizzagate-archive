The number twenty two has occultic significance, and the card is designed to mimic the look a possible new card of  the major arcana cards of the Tarot Deck:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1847712">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1847712</a></p>
<p>In addition, the 22nd card in traditional Tarot decks is the one called &quot;The World&quot;. This is how it usually looks: <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xK93QOT50aY/UE3bCGTAJbI/AAAAAAAACZU/ABzrJQUdfLk/s1600/scan0001.jpg">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xK93QOT50aY/UE3bCGTAJbI/AAAAAAAACZU/ABzrJQUdfLk/s1600/scan0001.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>Notice it is number XXI. It becomes XXII, with the placement of the zero card &quot;the Fool&quot; at the beginning of the deck</strong> as you see here:
<a href="http://www.masteringtarot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/major-arcana-all.jpg">http://www.masteringtarot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/major-arcana-all.jpg</a></p>
<p>The card of The World at the very least means: <strong>the fulfillment of all ambitions</strong>. so the elites have achieved all their ambitions with &quot;pizza&quot;? Let\'s have a closer look.</p>
<p>The Tarot  Deck, which is composed of 22 major arcana (major mysteries, deep occult) and 56 minor arcana (four suits numbering one(ace) through ten with four court cards: king, queen, knight and page). The four suits are: wands/staves (clubs), cups (hearts), swords (spades), pentacles/coins (diamonds). It is easy to see that our modern playing cards are based on the minor arcana.</p>
<p>Like the Illuminati Card Game, the Tarot was ostensibly created for playing games, but the major arcana of the Tarot are used for fortune telling or prediction and have <strong>multiple layers of meaning</strong>. Many have already observed that the Illuminati card game seems to have predicted events decades before they occurred. </p>
<p>Without going into a lengthy history and meaning of Tarot, suffice it say that both the numbers and pictures of the major arcana have multiple layers of meaning and when they are arranged in a certain order, they serve to communicate events and ideas--rather like a sort of code. There\'s a common everyday meaning, then there is a different one for those &quot;in the know&quot; . Now this is what makes it interesting. </p>
<p>The January 2017 edition of The Economist magazine--a Rothschild publication--- features a Tarot spread on the cover--rather than the customary rendering of world movers and shakers. On that cover, there was a card called The Star, which did not have any of the usual features, but instead, it has fourteen, eight-pointed stars with a black and white **photo of a child **in each. These photos are reminiscent of the <strong>missing children photos</strong> which were once featured on milk cartons. Who are these children? Why are they on the cover of The Economist? Most surprisingly, why is there a COMET in the middle of these stars? Are the elite trying to say something to each other?</p>
<p>This cover also contains The World card (fulfillment of all ambitions).</p>
<p>Original post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/176913">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/176913</a></p>
<p>There is also an Illuminati Card with a slice of pizza on it (#444), referring to a &quot;secret meeting&quot;.</p>
<p>According to what it says on this card, &quot;Pick one Secret group to lose it\'s Secret status for the rest of the current turn.&quot; So, learning the true meaning of &quot;pizza&quot; and the Secret Group&quot; exposes them and they are not secret anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Summary</strong>: </p>
<p>Tarot cards communicate hidden meanings.</p>
<p>Traditional Tarot image of The World is replaced by a slice of pizza. </p>
<p>Tarot on the Rothschild magazine includes non-traditional depictions of The World, and The Star shows &quot;missing&quot; children\'s faces surrounding a comet in the center.</p>
<p>The Illuminati Card #444 shows a slice of pizza and it\'s use in play exposes a &quot;secret group&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Pulling it all together: The global elites, (any list would include Rothschilds) achieved and/or maintained their goals or ambitions through the exploitation of children (pizza) using blackmail and secrecy. Pizzagate exposes it all.</strong></p>',

            The World in 2017 contains The Economist’s annual collection of detailed, numerate and opinionated predictions for the year ahead. The World in 2017 features leading figures from politics, business, finance, science, technology and the arts alongside prominent journalists from The Economist and other leading news publications.

            The World In 2017 looks ahead to a new American presidency, a Chinese Communist Party Congress, elections in France and Germany and the political and economic challenges of Brexit, and marks a number of poignant global anniversaries—500 years since Martin Luther published his 95 theses, 100 years since Lenin launched the Russian revolution and 10 years since Steve jobs unveiled the iPhone.
