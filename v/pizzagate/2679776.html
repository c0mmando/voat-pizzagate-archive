<p>Another pedo-island. Mac skulking statement can be heard at around the 7:30.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his graphic account ushering in the holiday season, Macaulay Culkin describes scenes of national and political elites committing vile acts. The most influential people in the country are sacrificing children in a ritualistic Satanic murder cult. The skin of a slain youth is worn like a hunting trophy.&gt;</p>

<p>He distances himself in this interview but I believe cat is code for young girl. He is not going to Ko phi phi to sleep with Thailand\'s, flea-bitten felines. Beta-programming, or like a kitten, a girl. </p>
<p>You don\'t get VD from cats....so we can only surmise this is code for sex with someone, he feel he can\'t name. A prostitute? A young prostitute?</p>
<p>From his wiki about his band, Pizza Underground.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The group released its first music video in January 2014, parodying various Velvet Underground songs such as &quot;All Pizza Parties&quot; (&quot;All Tomorrow\'s Parties&quot;), &quot;Pizza Gal&quot; (&quot;Femme Fatale&quot;) and &quot;Take a Bite of the Wild Slice&quot; (Lou Reed\'s &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;).[8] The video featured the group performing on a bed of pizza boxes, surrounded by pizza checkered walls, with members of the group wearing slices of pizza as masks.[9] Also in 2014, the cassette of the demo was released by Bitter Melody Records[10] on yellow, white, and red cassettes.[11][12] An 18-show North American tour entitled Fresh to Your Door took place that same year.[9]&gt;</p>

<p>This man knows something. Perhaps a classic case of victim becoming victimizer. Perhaps compromised. But the list of songs, coupled with the interview.,,doesn\'t take much to connect the dots. He knows the elite are wearing their victims ...their pedo-Dior creations?....like trophies. The skin of people. Red shoes anyone.</p>',

But I guess you can still become an aggressive, risk-taking, psychopath. But you'll be a clean psychopath.

              You snapshot only one small scope of Culkin's situation/involvement and skip over all the acionable shit, just so you can try to drag his name through the mud with an erroneous and childish nickname("skullkin") - my, you really cracked the case there.
