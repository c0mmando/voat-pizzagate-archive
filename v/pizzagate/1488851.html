<p>Looking at events she\'s advertised for Comet Ping Pong, we found mention of what is called &quot;bedroom pop music&quot;  Before looking into this, I had no idea such a pop genre has existed. <a href="http://8tracks.com/explore/bedroom_pop/popular">http://8tracks.com/explore/bedroom_pop/popular</a> (Archived: <a href="https://archive.is/eVpMl">https://archive.is/eVpMl)</a>) Some of the group names listed here are &quot;Teen Suicide&quot; &quot;Elvis Depressedly&quot; and &quot;Ricky Eat Acid&quot;. Do these sound like family appropriate venues to you? </p>
<p>I found a name of a retired ABC News guy, Mike Silverstein, who\'s part of the Dupont Circle Advisory Neighborhood Commission. He signed off on the amended liquor license for Comet Ping Pong. <a href="http://www.dupontcircleanc.net/wordpress/about/commissioners/">http://www.dupontcircleanc.net/wordpress/about/commissioners/</a>  (Archived version: <a href="https://archive.is/gxLsE">https://archive.is/gxLsE)</a>)</p>
<p>Liquor license mentioned here:  anc3f.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ANC041916.pdf</p>
<p>One of the amendments of this agreement was noise limitation. Here\'s a link to Sasha Lord\'s tech specs equipment. <a href="http://www.sashalordpresents.com/comet">http://www.sashalordpresents.com/comet</a>  
</p>
<p>This next link is the Facebook page to the song solo artist of what\'s called Japanese Breakfast <a href="https://www.facebook.com/japanesebreakfast">https://www.facebook.com/japanesebreakfast</a> Two of her songs are titled &quot;Psychopomp&quot; and &quot;Dead Oceans.&quot; We couldn\'t find the song lyrics. Maybe you can. Does this seem like something that\'s appropriate for all ages?!?</p>
<p>We haven\'t been able to find any exterior images of the back of the Comet Ping Pong building. How and where do their restaurant supplies get delivered? Is there a loading dock or a freight elevator in the back of the building? Went to the original construction site and couldn\'t find blueprints to see if any of the shopping center places have basements. We couldn\'t find any record of health inspections, and we couldn\'t find any construction permits or zoning records - but we did find out that the shopping center that pizzeria, Besta Pizza, Little Red Fox, and Politics and Prose are located was built in 1932. <a href="http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/11881126/5037-Connecticut-Ave-NW-Washington-DC-20008/">http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/11881126/5037-Connecticut-Ave-NW-Washington-DC-20008/</a> (Archived version: <a href="https://archive.is/q6Rnd">https://archive.is/q6Rnd)</a>)</p>
<p>After the Crisis Actor gunman was arrested, NBC channel 4, ABC channel 7, and CBS channel 9, all local news - showed the community coming out to support them. They claimed to be from the neighborhood, but they didn\'t say who they were. If you can find the file films, run them against a facial recognition program, and see who they really are... What about the kids that were with them?!</p>
<p>I also checked out the news articles related to the #StandWithComet event. We know at least one legit family had went there, but nothing about them going there more than once. My dad (who used to teach a journalism high school class) and I think many of these people had been paid to go to this event. So far I only found one person who doesn\'t have children, that works at a non-profit affordable housing company (Mi Casa Inc) named Elin Zurbrigg. She\'s stated about going to the pizzeria many times. Her Facebook post: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1142895149161513/permalink/1147930008658027/?ref=1&amp;action_history=null">https://www.facebook.com/events/1142895149161513/permalink/1147930008658027/?ref=1&amp;action_history=null</a> (Archived version: <a href="https://archive.is/s3HAY">https://archive.is/s3HAY)</a>)  I think it might be worth a look to find more about this person.</p>',

              Does seem worth exploring that list.  I just was chasing other dogs...  Let us know in a NEW thread if you turn up something. That way it gets archived.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've also noticed google is completely scrubbing stuff.  You might want to try another search engine.

            Wasn't that the liquor license hearing that had the controversy?   The neighborhood guy was ticked off they had Ping Pong outside and attracting the 'wrong element' (was that gays he was upset about?).

             Who was the guy? Do you know his name? As for Sasha Lord, she was part of the Girl Scouts leadership, Girl Scouts Beyond Bars, and she was part of this outdoor leadership organization called Hemlock Overlook. (That info is on her bio page I linked to.)
            </p>
            <p>
             I didn't see any information about Sasha Lord being a tranny. That would be hard to get into the Girl Scouts unnoticed if she was a tranny. If anyone has that information, then I'd like to know.

              Girl Scouts is totally PC.   Remember, to the PC crowd a tranny is identified properly as a "SHE" (for example, Chelsea Manning is now called 'she' by all MSM, despite being a dude).

              Sasha Lord sounds like a fake name.
