<p>So further to my previous SPiN <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3020019">post</a> about its fondness for locations with tunnels, I thought we should look at who else has access to the Park Avenue tunnel system:</p>

<p>Labelled a ‘convenient rest home’ for spies, Hakluyt had always managed to stay in the shadows - until a top intelligence operator lost his life in murky circumstances.  </p>
<p>Hakluyt was founded 17 years ago by Christopher James, a former SAS and MI6 operative, and Christopher Wilkins, a businessman who had served in the Welsh Guards.  The links between the company and MI6 have always been strong. Spies preparing for retirement are approached discreetly in St James’s clubs and asked if they would like some lucrative freelance action to top up their pensions.</p>
<p>Hakluyt regards itself as operating at the top end of one of the capital’s most lucrative service industries. It has the most impressive list of big corporations, with particularly close links to the big oil firms. </p>

<p>So, I can\'t find the Park Avenue address  for Hakluyt but the company gives its NY address as 540 Madison Avenue which is just around the corner and virtually next to the Core Club which is on Park Avenue though it\'s official address is 66 East 55th Street New York, NY 10022 . You can see that <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/304+Park+Avenue,+New+York,+NY,+USA/540+Madison+Ave+%2315A,+New+York,+NY+10022,+USA/@40.7585574,-73.9782008,16z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c258fc5799d1ed:0x28e5bc02aa670e67!2m2!1d-73.974469!2d40.7570912!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c258fb06c07f31:0xa73b365b2aa470b0!2m2!1d-73.973758!2d40.7609466!3e0">here</a></p>

            What about the 666 Park Avenue address? Doesn't Kushner own that property that leases space to Lucient Technologies?

             I just came across this video on 666 Fifth Avenue by happenstance:
             <a href="https://youtu.be/5eLCbNOhgsk">
              https://youtu.be/5eLCbNOhgsk
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             EntertheStars goes heavy on the occult but it's an interesting short video containing old footage of the construction of 666. It also refers to early involvement of Donald Trump, before his son-in-law's company bought the building.
            </p>

              @think-
             </a>
             it also refers to John L. Tishman's involvement, he of Tishman Speyer, a company I have had my eye on since the start of pizzagate because Mirabaud, the  Swiss brokers (who I recently posted about), now operate out of a Tishman Speyer building in London.  I've had my eye on New York from the beginning and I sometimes wonder if that was the one of the originating sites for the Hampstead case (to put it mildly).

             Secret Park Avenue Crypt Unearthed!
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             John D. Rockefeller Jr.’s subterranean escape route out of 740 Park Avenue to the railroad tracks underneath the street (where his private train could pull up) has long been “a wonderful urban myth,” says Michael Gross, author of 740 Park: The Story of the World’s Richest Apartment Building. Gross didn’t mention it in his book after the Rockefeller relatives denied it. But not everybody’s so sure. Stephen Del Savio, a subsurface plumber and vice-president of NYC Water Works, was working with his crew about fifteen feet under Park last summer and discovered a sealed-up vault. Upon entry, just outside 740, they found a series of brick chambers about ten feet tall, six feet wide, all with arched ceilings, branching off from 740’s basement. “I was, like, ‘Holy shit!’ ” he says. “This thing was certainly leading somewhere.” Was it an old wine cellar? Remnants of a building built before 740?
            </p>
            <p>
             Checking pipes under the city’s streets, Del Savio has stumbled upon an abandoned pool (under Brooklyn’s St. George Hotel) and a barber shop (under the Hotel Pennsylvania), but nothing so tied to city royalty. Rockefeller once owned 740 Park, home to Bouviers, Bronfmans, Guggenheims, and J. Watson Webb, a member of the Vanderbilt clan—the family that built the New York Central Railroad. So whodugit? “My money is on the Vanderbilts,” says Columbia historian Kenneth T. Jackson.

              My piece is a bit of history of Park Avenue. Did you know that it was originally (still is actually) the railroad tracks that ran directly north and out of town? Mr. Vanderbilt’s railroad. As much as people loved the “new” steam engine transportation, no one wanted to live by the railroad tracks. Smart thinking people changed all that over time, and when they did what had long been Fourth Avenue on the grid, became Park Avenue. And the rest is history, especially some of the most interesting – houses and families...

            What's with the obsession with tunnels.  Other than at a border crossing, have tunnels been used in a single case of trafficking?
           </p>
           <p>
            You claim these businesses have "access" to the tunnels, but you show no evidence of this.  Do have such evidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            All you have shown is there are influential companies on Park Ave South.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Madison is parallel to Park, not around the corner.

            Oh boy, I just looked at your other thread.  You have several things wrong

            Spin in New York IS NOT across the street from the Waldorf Astoria. It's a mile and a half south.
           </p>
           <p>
            The train tunnels you claim go the length of Park Avenue do not go to Spin.   They stop at Grand Central Terminal on 42 Street. Park Ave continues to 32nd Street.   Spin is on 23rd Street which is near Park Ave South.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means your thesis has fallen apart.

              Now that you have the correct address for SPiN and the understand that Park Ave and Park Ave South are considered different streets you can use your map tool to find out the truth.  Here's a hint, 280 Park Ave and 280 Park Ave South are not the same building.  They are a mile apart.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's walking directions you can map out yourself
To go from from 280 Park Ave, New York, NY 10020 to SPiN's location at 48 E 23rd St, New York, NY 10010 is 1.4 mile and a 28 minute walk.  Notice the different zip code.

His cousin JJAstor lV, to compete, built the Astor Hotel next door. Putting profit over family competition, they combined the two, which became the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Yes, they did have tunnels.

               So, you are correct that SPiN is a bit further down from the Astoria on Park Avenue South.  The articles I looked at give the incorrect information by stating that it is at Park Avenue.  Nevertheless, the Park Avenue South address is still part of the Park Avenue Tunnel system.

                Is the point to tell interesting stories or to find the truth.  Because even if Spin was a mile uptown, you provided no evidence of anything untoward happening and no evidence any of those companies have access to the tunnels.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will say that mistaken news article had me doubting myself.  I was wondering if the club further uptown was just a private club, because I remembered when they opened I was pretty sure SPIN only had one location in NY and they never moved.
               </p>
               <p>
                I actually just called SPIN myself and asked about this.  So here's the deal,  304 Park Avenue South is the name of the entire giant building they are in, but there's a lot of retail spaces within this building on 23rd Street.  I don't know if this link will work, but here's google maps showing the entire building is probably 10 stories and they are in the basement of that

                  As to your other post, you gave me a list of border tunnels. I understand why tunnels would be used a guarded border crossing. But Manhattan is not under Siege like Sarajevo was. These examples only prove my point.

                 The information I posted on the Waldorf Astoria explained how their tunnels were used for Roosevelt's convenience and quite possibly for later presidents. From our research it is common for VIPs to use tunnels to get around.  Hollywood does the same. But if you chose to ignore that, be my guest...

                    No it's not.  Because you still have shown if they have any access to the tunnels or how they avoid the trains that use these tunnels.  Because we are talking about a subway, it's the part of MetroNorth that is submerged.

                    Right because they connect to Spin which is right next door through a secret tunnel system.  Except they don't.   So you just have a random collection of business near Park Ave and Park Ave South, but let's call this a logistics exercise!  Because that will make them seem connected in some way.

              A.  Those were completely different, what he is talking about here are part of the city's infrastructure, they have been running trains on Park Avenue from 1831

              They broke ground on the tunnel in 1837.  It used today for the very busy Metro North commuter line (86 million riders a year).  To claim that if you work in one of these buildings on Park Avenue and you have some special access to these tunnels is a completely unfounded assertion.   The easiest way to get access is as a Metro North customer, but the train doesn't stop underground, the next stop is 125th Street and that is elevated above the street.

              B.  There were no tunnels under the McMartin preschool. First off there was no entrance at all, just a concrete slab, the building rested on.   When they removed this slab, they found nothing that would support a tunnel structure.  They found a bunch of junk in the dirt, but it was really, really old, like cans from before the school was built.

              Smuggling tunnels are secret passages used for the smuggling of goods and people. The term is also used where the tunnels are built in response to a siege.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Sarajevo Tunnel operated during the Siege of Sarajevo as a passage underneath the no-man's land of the city's (closed) airport, providing a vital smuggling link for the beleaguered city residents. Guns were smuggled into the city and people were smuggled out. After the war, the Sarajevo Tunnel Museum was built onto the historic private house whose cellar served as the entrance to Sarajevo Tunnel.

              A 700-meter smuggling tunnel with a narrow gauge railway was revealed in July 2012 between Uzhgorod, Ukraine, and Vyšné Nemecké, Slovakia, at the border of Schengen Area. The tunnel used professional mining and security technologies.

             <p>
              Many villages on the southern coast of England have a local legend of a smugglers' tunnel, although the entrances to most of the actual smugglers' tunnels have been lost or bricked up. Some tunnel stories turn out to be plausible, such as the tunnel at Hayle in Cornwall, which seems to have been built specifically for smuggling.

              The Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels connect Egypt and the Gaza Strip, bypassing the Egypt–Gaza barrier built by Israel along the international border established by the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. The tunnels pass under the Philadelphi corridor, an area specified in the Oslo accords as being under Israeli military control, in order to secure the border with Egypt.

              In early 2005, a group of Canadian drug smugglers took up the idea, and constructed a tunnel between a greenhouse in Langley, British Columbia and the basement of a house in Lynden, Washington, which lay across the ditch marking the Canada–US border (the house on the Langley side was on 0 Avenue ("Zero Avenue"), which runs parallel to the border and is the baseline of Langley's avenue-numbering system). They bought the two properties and began construction work. Authorities were alerted when a neighbor noticed the large-scale construction work being undertaken in the greenhouse. Inspection revealed that tons of construction material were entering, and piles of earth were coming out.

             It became known within a short time, by both American and Canadian border authorities, that a tunnel was being built. Video and audio devices were installed secretly by United States customs officials both at the termini and in the tunnel itself. On July 14, the tunnel having been completed, the first packs of marijuana began going through. Officials raided the home soon afterward and arrested the three men, who then appeared before court in Seattle.[4] The tunnel was sealed and the roads above it were rebuilt, but the US house where the tunnel exited still exists.
