              Ansatz is a physics/math term.  You have misused it.

               It's German for "guess". In English, it basically means "a guess that we know is more or less right". Go fuck yourself.

               I don't think you watched any of the videos that I posted, so I don't think that it
               <strong>
                could
               </strong>
               make sense to you. You don't know about the monolithic intelligent group of people from what you could pretty much call pre-history. Maybe watch the videos? Too hard headed for that?

            It doesn't seem like those stories would red-pill me. The Franklin Coverup and info on Brownstoning seem more likely to do so. Showing Deep State involvement seems important.

            Leave out the breitbart one. He was referring to the ACORN sting, no point having dubious ones undermine the rest.  Get celebs too, like Stephen Kings "IT" ends with a preteen orgy etc

            I'll also leave this here, but might deserve a special thread. 
Belgian MP ties Prime Minister Di Rupo to the Dutroux case. 90% of MP's walk out.
