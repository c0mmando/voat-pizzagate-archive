            This puts episode 1 of star wars into a new light! Im a bit on the older side, and I remember at the time it came out we hated the casting decision for anakin because they picked a 6 year old boy, and we expected a teenager, bc there was supposed to be a romance between anakin &amp; amadala but it made no sense to have romance between a 6 year old and a much older girl....maybe it made sense to some people like george lucas.

            This was in 1979 when they were figuring out the story for Raiders of the Lost Ark and back then Lucas and Spielberg were the two hottest most powerful guys in showbiz. I think they probably went to VIP coke and pedo parties in those days they were invited to participate maybe they did or maybe they just stood around and watched. Either way it's gross and I also wondered in 1981 when I saw Raiders just how old Marion was when Indy took advantage of her. Probably she was 15 or 16 based on how old she was in Raiders around 30 I think and Indy was 35 to 40.

            For YEARS rumors have circulated that George Lucas is a freak who REQUIRES anyone starring in his movies (even the boys/men) to have sex with him.  However, those reports may have been scrubbed from the Net -- at least, I can't put my finger on one ATM.

            I hated Pulp Fiction - it was like bright poisonous candy being shoved down people's gullets, that's how I saw it anyway.  I really dislike Tarantino as well as a person and as a fake artist.

            George Lucas appears to like him some  10-12 year olds who are grow into border line boring 15 year olds.  He says a 25 year old man with a 'slightly young' 12 year old is 'amusing'.  Or maybe he wanted to give a shout out to some of his rich 'special needs' viewers.  Nothing new really, Hillary Clinton is on record defending a poor misunderstood rapist from his 12 year old victim.  So much of Hollywood is a criminal pedo cesspool, which is why they love Hillary so much, stink begets stink.

            I didn't watch it because don't watch gratuitous or graphic violence. It desensitizes a person and is not good for the soul. Nor do I, as you say feel sympathetic towards evil people. None of that interesting or entertainment to me.

            A new look at this article, thank you!  BTW, I'm even embarrassed in ADMITTING I'm a Pizza-Gater.  Personally, I'd rather tell people I wear ladies underwear than say I'm studying Pizza-Gate. (I don't BTW).

             It has to do with two things.  First, they are 'screening' for sociopathy.  So if you will do anything to become 'rich and famous', ANYTHING, they want you to prove it.  If they know you are a sociopath, then its impossible you will have empathy and 2nd thoughts about anything you are TOLD to do, during your career, wear a dress, same sex relationship on screen, support a political candidate like Hillary, promote the cause of the day like Leonardo DiCaprio.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, it is because if they 'make' you, they want you to know they can 'break' you.  And blackmail material is a surefire way to do that.

               No, its an information war.  If we don't win the information war, then when action is taken, it will be spun, and those who have taken action will be labelled 'extremists' and 'terrorists' and 'white supremacists'.  So it will  actually forward the NWO objectives.

               <br/>
               People have to come to understand they have been lied to about everything.  Russia, Israel, the government, Wall St, the media and its ownership, the legal system,  the education system, the 'health' system.  The truth in most of those cases is almost diametrically opposed to what we are told to believe.    The common man in Russia should be the common man in America's greatest ally.  The leaders of Israel (esp. behind the scenes =aka Rothschilds) should be the common man's greatest enemy.

                That type of thinking won't work.  Clannishness only leads to mob  mentality and gang warfare.  The ideals of the Common Man in America are not consistent throughout the group.  They all want different things.  Why, if the ideals of the Common Man are diverse in the U.S., would they be the ideals of the Common Man in Russia?  The correct answer is to fight for Individual Rights and the right to hold those beliefs and pursue those beliefs peacefully in a free land, in a free world.

             Can you elaborate on this comment please. As per my closing remarks hollywood (and separately the music industry) are obviously heavily involved. As these people are 'celebrities' it means there is buckets of information available out there, including things like this that give us hints.
             <strong>
              Every fact starts with a clue
             </strong>
             , and there are definite clues here that GL and SS express at the very lest some sort of tacit approval to making a 'hero' character as a paedo.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you wrote a movie and someone said 'oh lets make the hero a paedo', would you :
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Get physically sick
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Object profusely
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Continue with the conversation / not call it out / provide your tacit approval - just like you did here?
            </p>
            <p>
             These people are sick and related to this whole fucking mess. I cant say that either of them are involved, but
             <strong>
              the fact that this conversation even exists speaks volumes about these lords of cinema
             </strong>
             . Your comments say more about you than this subject my friend. Keep digging!

              This isn't new information; it's been widely publicly known for years.  And it's not a smoking gun like Roman Polanski or something, just one more data point of evidence that Hollywood is fucked up - and a pretty weak one, as these things go; I wouldn't even say it's convincing proof in and of itself that Lucas or Spielberg are pedophiles, as opposed to immersed in a pedophile culture.  I wouldn't say I'm any more convinced now than I was before reading the post - but then again, as I said, the post is not remotely new information, so that may be a large part of my reaction.  I'd say that the general trend of child starlets turning into psychologically-damaged sluts as soon as they outgrow their first image is a near-infinitely more compelling argument for Hollywood's status as Pedo Paradise than a single off-color conversation between writers about their character.

            I've always been bothered by that aspect of this movie, which is probably why the 2nd one is my favorite out of the series-an unpopular opinion.  However, I was twelve when my parent's 30-something goodbuddy Don cornered me in a moving car and groped me, so I guess I'm sensitive
            <em>
             shrugs

            but either way-that storyline makes Indy look really, really gross (and George Lucas, who doesn't need help looking ick).

            Maybe that's why Pope Francis said Jesus was the son of Satan.  A reference to some ancient idea being paraded in Star Wars.  What did James Joyce say?  "Satan, really, is the romantic youth of Jesus re-appearing for a moment."

            3 vile pedophiles brain storming a pedophile fantasy.  The most interesting quote was the Lucas quote you didn't highlight. He's working out the conflict between "interesting" and "safe" ( although he doesn't use the word "safe", it's his purpose ).
           </p>
           <p>
            Making the girl 11 or 12 makes the sex very interesting to Lucas but not safe because there would be blowback.  It's too safe and not interesting at all if she was 16.  15 is the compromise age that possibly can make the sex interesting to Lucas without much blowback from the public.

            It looks like Lucas is part of the problem -- Star Wars itself is a lore that was spun by cornball sado gay pedophiles. I mean beyond this world, the big machines and their fruit. The robes that the Jedi wear are very similar to bath robes that you would see guys wearing at a gay bathhouse and its not an accident.

             What's wrong with gay bathhouses, if they are visited by grown ups? But the Jedi are rather asexual. 
"Star Wars" is not a good example for a perv mind of the director.  ok, maybe Jabba the hutt looks like Cyril Smith.
But I guess Lucas also could make "normal" movies... 
But the "Indiana Jones" -movies are a bit suspicious. I always was confused about them - about the relationship to the women and also about these archaic rituals  or  that nazi-shite he was digging out - or that whip.
Never really enjoyed these movies.

              As someone who was a victim of sexual assault at a party, I am all too familiar with "she wanted it". It was part of what lead me to conclude I shouldn't involve the police; who would believe me? I had a couple drinks, and there were no witnesses. Plus, these days, you'll find wealthy white dudes hardly ever do much time, if at all -- even when they admit guilt.

               It wasn't too long ago a judge decided a 40-year old man who raped a 12-year old girl should receive ZERO time behind bars
              </a>
              . IIRC the child was a relative of his and the judge sympathized after reading a letter from the girl's mother who pleaded for leniency and forgiveness in regards to the rapist's punishment. In my eyes, that is the textbook definition of an unfit mother, but as this subverse has proven, CPS is generally no better. My heart hurts for that child :(

               Very sorry to hear not only that you were assaulted but then had no recourse for justice.  Regarding the case you mentioned, it turns out it was the girl's father who had raped her at least 3 times.
               <a href="http://archive.is/OBtzV">

               </a>
               He agreed to plead guilty to one count. "The state had recommended the 40-year-old father of three serve a 100-year prison sentence with 75 years suspended — in effect, 25 years — and the dismissal of two other incest charges as part of a plea deal.
“A father repeatedly raped his 12-year-old daughter,” the Valley County deputy attorney, Dylan Jensen, said during the sentencing hearing on Oct. 4, 2016.  But in handing down his sentence, Judge John C. McKeon of Valley County District Court noted that lawyers for the defendant could argue for a less-severe punishment if an evaluator recommended treatment in a local community."  So the rapist gets the plea deal, two counts are dismissed, THEN the evaluation is recommended by the Judge.  When the results came in that claimed the father wasn't a risk to re-offend, the Judge gave him 60 days with time served of 17, so 43 days.  How can a minimum 3 time (there's usually more) rapist be considered not a risk of raping either his daughter or someone else's daughter?  And regardless if he didn't do it again, there is no justice, he should have served time in prison, not hang out singing kumbaYa at Mr. Sullivan's community center.
              </p>

               "In handing down the sentence on Oct. 4, Judge McKeon cited a report prepared by Michael D. Sullivan, a specialist who had performed more than 2,000 evaluations over a nearly 30-year career.
Mr. Sullivan, who performed a psychosexual evaluation of the victim’s father, found that he could “be safely treated and supervised” in a local community and that such treatment was available, the judge wrote in his ruling."
So the 'law', i.e. Judge McKeon, was more concerned about the mother and the two sons (who see that their Dad can rape their sister and get away with it),  working out "their" good relationship with dad, while the victim has to watch her back and live with nightmares because her rapist was the sympathetic character in the mother's eyes.  Sick.
