<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Ohio Attorney General’s Office is turning to the public for help</strong> as it continues to investigate a Portsmouth <strong>attorney and former elected official.</strong></p>
<p>The AG’s <strong>Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation</strong> is asking anyone “with information about suspicious activity involving <strong>Michael Mearan”</strong> to call 1-855-BCI-OHIO (855-224-6446) or file a tip anonymously online</p>
<p>Last week, BCI assisted local authorities conduct a search of Mearan’s office near the Scioto County Courthouse, according to a news release.</p>
<p>It’s part of an ongoing investigation with Portsmouth police after reports <strong>he is a key player in a sex trafficking ring,</strong> FOX19 NOW has confirmed.</p>
<p>In late 2018, the Cincinnati Enquirer investigated rumors of Mearan being involved in the trafficking of women for sexual purposes and talked to women who claimed they were <strong>prostituted to officials in return for a number of things including money and reduced sentences in criminal cases.</strong></p>
<p>[A] document, obtained by The Enquirer in early 2018, includes <strong>accounts of Mearan sending women to Florida and other states to have sex for money.</strong></p>
<p>That investigation resulted in eight drug convictions, but <strong>Mearan was never charged.</strong></p>

<p>The prosecution is handled by <strong>Angela Canepa</strong> at the state attorney general’s office of special prosecutions. </p>
<p><strong>Ten women said they worked as prostitutes for Mearan,</strong> and several of them said <strong>they traveled to numerous states to have sex for money at his behest.</strong></p>
<p>The women told the Enquirer that <strong>Mearan’s operation included some of the most powerful men in Scioto County as customers and participants.</strong> One said she slept with <strong>a former police chief</strong> for money.</p>
<p>Three others said they were approached by Mearan or others to <strong>perform sexual favors for now-retired Scioto County Common Pleas Court Judge William Marshall in exchange for lighter sentences in their criminal cases.</strong></p>
<p>That opened an investigation by the Ohio Public Defender’s office into Marshall’s conduct and whether the results in <strong>as many as 3,000 criminal cases he oversaw should be reexamined.</strong></p>
<p>[A previous] investigation resulted in eight drug convictions, but Mearan was not charged. <strong>The DEA said it handed any notes on Mearan over to the FBI, and it is not clear what happened after that.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Former Portsmouth city probation officials accused of sex misconduct and trafficking in underage girls</strong></p>
<p>A one-way bus ticket and the <strong>promise of a modeling contract.</strong></p>
<p>It was the escape Linda Mills had long sought from a life she said was filled with physical and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Instead, Mills said <strong>she was trafficked at age 15, sent to be a prostitute in Chicago by a member of local law enforcement.</strong></p>
<p>Mills is one of four women to accuse<strong>[Phil] Malone</strong> or his brother, <strong>Mark Malone,</strong> of inappropriate sexual conduct or <strong>exchanging sexual favors for light treatment from the Portsmouth City Probation Department,</strong> where they both worked.</p>
<p>Mills said her maternal grandfather abused her from a very young age, raping her repeatedly throughout her childhood.</p>
<p>She began posing nude for Phil Malone, who soon said he had lined up a <strong>modeling contract</strong> for her in Chicago. Another man met her at the bus station, and within hours, she was told she needed to have sex with him “so he could see what he could sell.”</p>
