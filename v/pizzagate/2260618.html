            My friend  made a documentary with a high ranking Thai policemen doing busts of monks in temples, found loads of kiddie porn and stuff and in one case he found and exposed an underage bar. These are taken as serious offences in Thailand with long prison sentences.

            Money corrupts monks too.  I visited a monastery that makes millions a year.  One young Monk peeled out on his scooter and cussed out another motorist. I encountered 10 young monks from the monastery at a karaoke club. The monks had their hands all over two female hostesses that were paid to sing with them.

            I CALL BULLSHIT KACEY! 
EVIDENCE PLEASE... Pointing at Buddhist monks and screaming pedophile without evidence is disingenuous. Buddhists are not known for such things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me make it easy to dispel this nonsense right now. I will name you 50 Jews involved in Pedophilia, Organ Harvesting, and Human Trafficking if you can name me 50 Buddhists guilty of the same. Keep in mind that there are between 450 and 750 million Buddhists in the world and less than 25 million Jews so you have a huge numerical advantage...
           </p>
           <p>
            Hiding the category of "Jew" in between Christian and Muslim is an attempt at white washing the overwhelming crimes committed by Jews in this area as well as Money Laundering, Drug Trafficking, Prostitution, Gambling and other elicit trades.

              No I cannot name 1 Buddhist Pedophile. That is exactly my point. 
There are very few Jews in the world, in America they are a tiny minority group yet they are prominent in all areas of elicit trade. They dominate Pornography, all forms of Gambling, Money Laundering. Jews disproportionately account for these hideous crimes such as Pedophilia and they seek to shield themselves via powerful lobby groups, position in the Justice System, Politics and the Media.

            The "Tibetan Buddhism" pizzagate connection is definitely worth digging. There are Hollywood stars like Richard Gere, Uma Thurman, Steven Seagal (!), Sharon Stone who are into Tibetan Buddhism. Which, when you look at it from a distance, seems to promote peace, love, and happiness, as represented by the Dalai Lama....

            Also, Allen Ginsburg was into Tibetan Buddhism. --

            I remember reading that even infants are / were given over to the monks, who would provide food and shelter.

           <p>
            IMO the tantric left-hand-path Buddhist tradition in Tibet should be looked at closer. I think there are many parallels to the Luciferian left-hand-path tradition HRC and buddies follow.

            Yea for sure evenbuddhist.  the idea of male dominance is a fallacy because women are stronger, the patriarchs psych out their victims though, to make the women think they have no power. I imagine the buddhists have a better understanding of chi prana life force energy because of the oriental mysticism originating there. I read about a man who practiced meditation in a Buddhist monastery after 20 years he was allowed in the inner sanctum, and he was American, in the inner sanctum the leading monk showed him the holy scenes drawn out on the wall in painting and sculpture. Basically it was pornograhy or people in coitus. He quit right then and there realizing that even Buddhist religion is still a religion. A form of control so you don't have to think. They always say be poor but give me your money. Lol lmao

            Not saying this is true or isn’t true, however this tradition exists only in tibet, and has no bearing on Buddhism in other countries, however one thing is puzzling and that is why havent we heard from copious victims? Also my guess is that if this was really happening, the families and friends of the abused would be in the streets protesting and shouting to the hills about this, at least this is my humble opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to be careful, because the main religions are trying to remove the heat from themselves and start pointing in other directions even if falsely...i would be very careful to make these serious allegations without concrete evidence and proof...and im not talking about one or two articles and one you tube video....i mean real victim testimonials, court hearings etc....
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can supply this information it would be most appreciated.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know for sure if monks did this in Thailand, Burma and Sri Lanka the monks would get beaten and tortured and thrown in prison very quickly because the lay people wouldn’t tolerate it at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also - we fail to talk about Buddhism in the US, Australia and the West generally, and there has been very little if anything at all on child abuse by Buddhist monks which goes to show that even if there is a chance of this happening it is isolated and not spread across the entire culture like Christianity, Judaism and Islam....we know for sure about this....

             treeknot, please read the article I linked to by Parenti and you will understand why there is not a huge outcry in Tibet any more than the serfs in Europe sent up much of an outcry during the middle ages.  As for Buddhists in the US many of the monks that came from Tibet were brought here by the CIA as was the Dali Lama.  Many have been making a killing teaching a new version of Buddhism to young americans eager to have a religion different from the one they were raised in.  There are good Buddhists who follow the best teachings of the religions, just like there are in all religions but.....
Here are some child raping monks in Bhutan

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              While rumors about child sexual abuse in monasteries have swirled around this tiny Buddhist nation for a while, this is the first time confirmed cases of underage monks molested by their seniors have come to the fore.  “Every time I tried to scream or struggled, he pinned me with his body, put his hand over my mouth and covered it tightly,” an 11-year-old boy told the magazine “The Raven,” describing how he was sexually abused by a 20-year-old monk in a monastery in Punakha, about 45 miles northeast of the capital city of Thimphu.  The underage monk said he and his 12-year-old friend at the monastery were asked to come in turns to sleep with the senior monk.  Another pedophile monk, a 60-year-old man, molested not only the two boys, but two other monks, aged nine and 11.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Its not unusual for young boys to not want to speak about being raped.  Its not unusual for their parents to believe the "good" priest, preacher, rabbi, monk instead of their child.  In many countries it is also not safe to speak out against the ruling religious leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             For instance, how long did it take for the scandal to be revealed in Canada about how native children were abused and killed?  Canada, not Tibet or Bhutan where control of the populace is much stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Funny when something comes out that people don't want to hear they say "why haven't we heard this before if it was going on?"  Maybe because every time before when someone tried to tell they got the same response "never heard of this so it must not be true".  Well if every time an issue is raised people say "first I heard of it" then each time will be the first anyone has heard of it and so it will be buried.

              Your last comments do not represent what i said...and i repeat, i am not disputing whether it happened or not. The question is whether these monks were following the rules or not and whether the community enforced them. Any sexual abuse by a monk is an action that results in termination, so how they continued to do this is beyond me.

               It is an act that SHOULD result in termination IF the rules are being followed.  But very often the senior monks who should be responsible for enforcing the rules are the ones committing the abuse.  So, no termination.  Refusing to believe it's possible that this could be happening helps perpetuate it.

                Yes i understand that, but the policy in the church as i know it, is to remove the priest and send him to another monastery...as far as I know, if a priest buggers a child there is no rule that the priest should be defrocked....i have never seen this....nor heard of it....

                 Yes the church often sends a priest to another church or monastary.  That doesn't mean that that is what the rule is, just that that is what the practice is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 for instance celibacy is the rule and not being celibate is cause for defrocking....unless you keep quiet in which case they may turn a blind eye.

That is, of course, until he publicly admitted his secret marriage, which immediately led to his removal from ministry.

                 <p>
                  Pope Francis has been slammed by church officials and sex abuse survivors for cutting penalties for paedophile priests.  The Pope is said to be applying his vision of a 'merciful church' to sex offenders by reducing punishments to weaker sentences, such as a lifetime of prayer and penance.  It has been revealed by church officials that Pope Francis overruled advice given to him by the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith about two priests  - allowing them to be punished by a lifetime of prayer.  One of the priests was the Reverend Mauro Inzoli, who was found guilty of abusing young boys by the Vatican in 2012 and was ordered to be defrocked.  However, he appealed, and in 2014 Francis reduced the penalty to a lifetime of prayer, prohibiting him from celebrating Mass in public or being near children, barring him from his diocese and ordering five years of psychotherapy.

                <p>
                 So the punishment was supposed to be defrocking but the Pope lessened it.   But that means it was the policy in the past but the practice in the past was of course otherwise.  Unless you can find me something in the Catholic rules that says pedophile priests are to be sent to other parishes my contention stands.  The policy was defrocking, the practice was moving.

                 Likewise the Buddhists have rules, but the existence of rules does not prove what the practice is.

                  if Children's Affairs Minister Tissa Karaliyadda is to be believed, child abuse in religious establishments by both Buddhist and Christian clergy in Sri Lanka is rampant.  Yet according to figures from Sri Lanka's National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), only three Buddhist monks have been convicted of child abuse in Sri Lanka in recent history.  One of those died from poison he drank after he was sentenced for raping a girl aged 13 in 2005.
Research carried out by the BBC Sinhala service has revealed that over the last decade, nearly 110 Buddhist monks have been charged for sexual and physical assaults on minors in Sri Lanka.  Many of these cases - especially those of a sexual nature - were barely reported by the Sri Lankan media and seldom resulted in convictions.

                  What about the Anglican, Protestant, orthodox etc...is defrocking the way? Not asking you to provide the research, I am too lazy to do it on my own right now. Religion is not supposed to be government and uphold the laws of the land, that is up to policing....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Why should any Priest or monk be above the laws of the land? Buddha stated that all monks should follow the laws of the land, and that the disciplinary rules refer to monastic life. So there is a split here....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Under reporting like you mentioned back there somwhere..is the only way....but if Buddhist Monks are turning a blind eye...it wont be long before the lay people leave them in droves and will mean the end of Buddist monks....however, there are good monks out there and at this point I forever hold my peace until I hear more of this ....but rest assured i have seen your points...and I am not as naive as you think....im just cautious about anything the mainstream media says and will prod. I like Buddhists in general and think they have a better way, so there is a little bias on my part for sure, not denying it...

            <p>
             I don't know about other forms of Buddhism, but this has been definitely a problem in Tibetan buddhism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tibetan buddhism has been heavily influenced by the pre-buddhism shamanic bon / bön religion, absorbing many aspects of its tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  teachings of tantric left-hand-path Tibetan buddhism are plain evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doeing evil (as opposed to doing good in other Buddhist traditions) is, according to their thinking, also fulfilling the will of god, in a way you even
             <em>
              have
             </em>
             to do evil things "to keep the balance" between good and evil. (That's the common demeaneour in all left-hand-path traditions, like the Luciferian tradition HRC and buddies follow, which also has a strong emphasis on "sex magick".)
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Also my guess is that if this was really happening, the families and friends of the abused would be in the streets protesting and shouting to the hills about this
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Were there any catholics out in the streets 'protesting and shouting the hills' about child abuse in the Church 20 years ago? Are there are any today in great numbers?
            </p>
            <p>
             No, there aren't. As in any other religion - no matter which - there is a BIG taboo regarding the raping of minors by clergy / monks / nuns. One reason why many Tibetan children are given to the monks is the poverty of their families, which adds to the difficulty of speaking out for the victims as they appear to be not grateful for what their familiy has done to ensure a good upbringing.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Tibetan buddhism was, before the Chinese took over, a
             <em>
              theocracy
             </em>
             . This is why still today the Dalai Lama is not only the highest representative of Tibetan buddhism, but the exiled head of state for Tibetans.
            </p>
            <p>
             Religious power plus political power = doubled authority, doubled difficulty to oppose TPTB and coming forward as a victim.

              However Jewish and Evanligecal christians do not have the same rules?? Or do they? Not sure..i know for a fact that if any Buddhist monk has sexual relations of any kind its over, no tranferring to other monastries or rehab..its over...you can find alot of evidence of this by visiting many Buddhist sites that have the Buddhist Monastic code available....
             </p>
             <p>
              The are four serious offences that any monk must be removed which are called the ‘Parajika’ offences:
1. If a monk kills a human being
2. If a monk steals anything
3. If a monks makes a false claim that he possesses spiritual powers
4. Sexual intercourse of any kind....
             </p>
             <p>
              Then there are 13 rules which require rehabilitation..which is a complex and rigorous process:
Masturbation is one of these, even as far as touching a person in a lustful manner and also referring or aluding to any sexual act....there are more.....but i will not go into it..because these rules are freely available for anyone to see....
             </p>
             <p>
              However I do agree with the under-reporting, but even so, it is very hard for any monk to get away with it for long...and im certainly not saying it doesn’t happen...however it is not comparable to other religions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Buddhism is general does not tolerate this behaviour from any monk...the monks themselves are very strict about this..and it the first four rules any monk learns before going forth.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you would like to research it..simply search “Buddhist Monastic Code” and see the “Parijika” rules....or “rules entailing defeat”.....
             </p>

              Thank you for your reply.

               treeknot, don't Catholics have rules that priests must be celibate?  Just because there are rules doesn't mean rules are followed.    Aren't protestants opposed to having sex with someone who is not your spouse?  How many protestant ministers have broken that rule?  Counselors and therapists have rules about sex with clients.  I personally know a couple who have broken that rule.  If breaking rules will always get you the appropriate punishment why aren't at least 1/2 the US congress under investigation by the Ethics Committee.  When looking at pedophilia we cannot afford to be naive.

                Sorry, I understand why you might think I am naive. However in Buddhism its a one strike policy. I am sure there have been many who have done it..no doubt although I do not personally know anyone. However the stakes are high, I do not know the rules in Catholicism, in Judaism and Islam it is quiet ok to have sex with an underage person if they are Goyim or infidel. Buddhism has no such rules...it is not ok, never for a monk to have sex with any being at all...this is my point.
               </p>
               <p>
                So if they did do it, I am stunned at how they got away with it....I think it can be only two main reasons
1. Every monk in that particular monastery was doing it, so therefore it is premeditated and even more sinister and deifes all logic of Buddhism.
2. It was one or two monks and the other monks didn’t know it was going on. Once found out, these monks would, should disrobe immediately and then face the legal consequences of their actions if the victims were children.
               </p>
               <p>
                If the monks did this for a long time, it baffles my mind how they got away with it with no one saying anything....I am not questioning the claims, just questioning the rules and regulations of that monastery....maybe they weren’t practicing the rules at all? I dont know...whatever it is, it is frightening and needs to be condemned.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I am getting at , there is no rape culture in Buddhism. if you rape you are out on your own, and the monks will not defend you if it is true. You will be left poor and to deal with the consequences.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is also the case where there are writers who don’t report accurately as well, and this is a problem too...and not to mention those who want to bring Buddhism down, please dont deny this...
               </p>
               <p>
                So the Truth here is, no monk can have sex of any kind, so if they did...in Lord Buddha’s eyes (as is quoted in the rules) that person in no longer a monk and cannot call himself a monk nor represent the Buddha or his teachings in anyway, as the Buddha made it clear that Monks are not to engage in any sex whatsoever, not even masturbation.... Sooooooo if a monk has sex, that monk in the Buddha’s eyes, is no longer affiliated, defeated and can never be a monk again as long as he lives.....

               But take Buddhist monks in Myanmar, they have been killing Muslim Royingas. So it seems that it depends on which Buddhist tradition you look.

                No the monks in myanmar follow the same rules...and most articles on the matter are not accurate and usually by people who want to push a narrative..however our subject is child abuse...so i will stick to that, if you ant to go down the killing rabbit hole i suggest you do some deep research on the myanmar issue before making up your mind...have a nice day.

            Organized patriarchal religion is about male-supremacy ....
           </p>
           <p>
            The Old Testament/Hebrew was written to cement patriarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The New Testament delivered a hero "Jesus" -- a humanist who
stood against the oppression of women and against a violent "god"
and that figure has gradually been washed away/diluted by Elites who
require an under-class in order to profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            These religions underpin Elite Patriarchy which has always been connected
internationally, by interests, marriage, business dealings -- whatever.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are also now coming to awareness that ISLAM was created by the Vatican ...
in order to better control the Arab world.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF you are truly concerned with the welfare of children, don't support
organized patriarchal religions -- such as those listed....
who have long been involved in the oppression of females/women.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the oppression of females by male-supremacists which has always
permitted the sexual abuse of children by males.
           </p>
           <p>
            INCEST is one of our oldest crimes and it is carried out by males.
Fathers, Grandfathers, Brothers, Uncles, male cousins -- male friends of the family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, all of these major religions at one time taught Reincarnation ....
"which became inconvenient for Elites."

             There are also women raping kids, although the numbers are much smaller compared to male perps.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many incest survivours report that their mothers knew about it all along, but didn't do anything about it. In the majority of cases not because the women were 'oppressed' by their husbands, but because they didn't want to change their lives (marriage, having a house, having financial support).
            </p>
            <p>
             Women are involved in covering-up the crimes. Plus, when you look at the child rape epidemic in British cities in the past decades, Muslim women said these girls were "white trash" anyway (and deserved it). See the recent thread about "1400 girls were raped in Rotherham" here in this sub. Even white Western women sometimes will still say about a women who was raped "but then she was wearing a short skirt" "why did she go out so late at night in the first place" etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know, I'm grateful for everything feminism has done to push the sexual violence issues to the agenda and to help victims. But imo you won't get the full picture when you ignore that women are implicated as well.

              Right ... MALES are our sexual abusers of children ....
             </p>
             <p>
              Women do sexual abuse youths/children ... but generally (as reported) when
they are under the influence of a heterosexual male.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes -- as in the Menendez case -- Lyle and Eric ... their mother also abused them...
knew about the father and also abused them -- and while there is no excuse for it ...
her husband was a powerful/wealthy man.  Possibly they didn't want to change their
lives fearing divorce, whatever and loss of financial support.  but we can guess that 
FEAR was some kind of a basis for what she was doing and NOT doing.
             </p>
             <p>
              When it comes to INCEST, these children are generally female 82% and male 12% ....
May be overall higher in Muslim countries ....
Keep in mind that it seems to be true that the Vatican/RCC invented ISLAM/Muslims.
And we see, of course, much manipulation of Muslim nations by US/CIA ...
(Catholics in Action.)
A very long time ago, I came upon the rumor that the Vatican was involved in
covert activities against the Muslims .... but it didn't occur to me at that time that
the CIA was at their service.
             </p>
             <p>
              And why would we expect Muslim women to suddenly be involved with advanced
thinking in regard to their own gender when they've been abused and oppressed
very brutally -- a few years in UK isn't going to change that overnight ... is it?
             </p>
             <p>
              In regard to Weinstein if you read comments on threads you'll find that American 
women and men are making the very same kind of comments!
             </p>
             <p>
              I've never denied that women are implicated in a very limited way in sexual abuse of children...
the Catholic nuns were the most outrageous in their assisting Catholic priests in abusing 
deaf children ... and retarded children .... and in sexually abusing children themselves...
On the other hand -- and again no excuse -- 40% of Catholic nuns were sexually and 
physically abused by Catholic priests.
It has to be said that Catholic nuns were by every means under control/influence of RCC/
and heterosexual priests.
             </p>
             <p>
              You also won't get full picture until you understand the relationship of the oppression
of females by organized patriarchal religions has a great deal to do with their sexual
interest in children -- and that women stand as protectors of their children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Vatican made constant and totally de-powering attacks on females .... even to the death.
The "Hammer of Witches" wasn't some fantasy ... the Vatican actually burned women at
the stake whom they labelled as "witches."
             </p>
             <p>
              You have to remember that most societies were based in female-centered
awareness which had to do with childbirth/creation of life, but also of their
knowledge of plants which are our natural medicines and drugs.  All drugs
are based on these plant models -- and just think of how much of that 
plant life and knowledge of it has been destroyed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Specifically that Nature is Pro-Choice and provided females with many
ways to control procreation -- providing ways of birth control, of the ability
to prevent pregnancies, to interrupt conception, and to control fertility
overall whenever they wished to end it.  These plants were destroyed by
patriarchy and the knowledge of them destroyed in the "Witch Hunts."
             </p>
             <p>
              That is also where women lost any control over their own children, lost the
right to inheritance of family wealth.  Basically, suspicion falls on the fact that
women at that time were a very notable majority (they are always a majority)
but at that time many male lives had been lost in the "Crusades."
             </p>
             <p>
              The women were inheriting the property of their dead husbands and their 
wealthy.  That made them more powerful and the object of jealousy and 
conspiracy to take their worldly goods which actually happened.
             </p>
             <p>
              Women were also displaced from "medicine."
             </p>
             <p>
              Feminism is for EVERYONE ... the definition that I like best is Marilyn French's ...
which is "Feminism is anti-domination of anyone by anyone else."
             </p>
             <p>
              Women protect children when they have the power to do so....
We love and protect our sons equally as we protect our daughters.
We support our husbands not because we have to, but because these
are loving relationships when we can make them so.

               You keep using the Vatican as your example for religious corruption. We already know the Vatican is corrupt. I bet the majority of people here are not even Catholics. I bet if you did a study, Christian men were less likely to rape kids than non Christian men. Less likely than gay men!
              </p>
              <p>
               There will be corruption no matter what religion someone is in. But, Christianity is about peace and love. You just told someone earlier that Jesus hated them. You are the one that always speaks down about everyone. You are the one that thinks a woman has the right to choose herself over her baby. Even late term partial birth abortion. That it's ok to kill a baby that is 8 or 9 months along and could live outside of the womb!
              </p>

                I'm sure everyone here, whether they are Catholic or not (which has nothing to do with it) are aware of
the involvement of the Vatican/RCC in sexual abuse of children by their priests.
                <br/>
                And that's true all over the world where major scandals of sexual abuse of children have occurred.
               </p>
               <p>
                Vatican "Church" is the seat of Christianity .... those who broke away are called by other names...
Protestants of various sorts.  And the Orthodox.  There is no Christianity without the Vatican/RCC
which came first.
               </p>
               <p>
                Odd that you should suggest that "Christian" are less likely to rape kids than non-Christian men....

                Actually, if you take a look at our Congress which has long been 90% or more male, you will find
a total lack of any real spirituality though they may kneel often and hold a lot of prayer meetings.
If you watch what they actually do, you see that they attack the helpless.  What they practice is
more like "Satanism."

                But coincidentally, our NJ newspaper happened to have an Editorial today speaking out against the $17 MILLION that has been paid out by taxpayers to cover "complaints" of sexual harassment by our MALE
Senators and Representatives in Congress since 1995.  And the records are closed. 
American taxpayers aren't permitted to know who the offenders in Congress are.

                And, additionally, studies show that our sexual abusers of children are not only MALE --
they are heterosexual males.  Heterosexual males are 100X MORE likely to sexually abuse a child
than a homosexual child.
Lesbians pretty much never.
In Hawaii before the coming of the "white man" ... homosexuals there were honored and esteemed 
for their care of orphaned children.

                Organized patriarchal religion based in male-supremacy and a one-all-male-god underpins 
Elite patriarchy.  Needless to say Elite patriarchs couldn't officially confirm themselves as 
"superior" -- they needed a male god to do that for them.

               <p>
                Christianity has NEVER been about peace and love.
It's been about "Introducing the Cross with the Sword."
It's been about extremes of violence -- The Crusades and The Inquisition, The Hammer of Witches.
Not so long ago, a right wing coup in the Vatican seems to have gotten rid of three Popes in a row 
who were about to confirm the right of members to use their own conscience to decide for themselves
whether or not to use contraceptives.

                And, again, evidently you don't know that the war on women has continued throughout
history -- though the abuse of women should be clear if you're at all familiar with other 
societies or if you read the scandals in our own newspapers.  From "Bride Burnings" to
women being gang raped, or having acid thrown in their faces ... it is easy to be aware
as the reports are so frequent.  Long history of "Foot Binding" and "Genital Mutilation" as 
well -- everything between the labia totally cut out.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, evidently you have no awareness at all of the testimony of women who had 
late term abortions and the need for them.  These are wanted pregnancies where 
something goes wrong.  Often the babies are already dead, but there has been a 
long tradition in this country before abortion was approved here that those women
had to go on carrying these dead babies until they went into labor.
In other cases, the baby will not survive.  Often they have enlarged heads which
prevent vaginal delivery without destroying the body of the pregnant female and 
her ability to have another child.
But -- if you can't find in yourself empathy for a pregnant female suffering these 
problems, what would you do if your own wife had these problems?
                <br/>
                Or your daughter?  Presumably you'd make the great sacrifice to let her die?&gt;
               </p>
               <p>
                The majority of abortions take place very early in pregnancies which couldn't be clearer.
The number of "late term abortions" done to save the life and health of a pregnant female is
a tiny percentage --- about 1 problem pregnancy in every county in the US every year.
               </p>
               <p>
                Meanwhile, men continue to murder women at ever rising and alarming rates.
Today American women have 11X the risk of being murdered by a man with a gun than
women in other high income nations.
During the Vietnam War ... where 57,000+ soldiers were murdered -- at home in the US,
the same number of women -- 57,000+ -- were murdered in America by the ex-boyfriends, 
husbands, ex-husbands.

               Midwives and women practising medicine were statistically not more prone to be killed as a witch than other women. Sorry, but that's something that has been debunked in the last two decades. Even most Feminist History scholars don't hold this view anymore.

               What is true is that in the Early Modern period authorities set in place regulations for midwives, and often selling herbs on markets wasn't allowed anymore due to pharmacies that were owned by nobility.

Why should any women have been burned at the stake ... 
and why wouldn't you question that?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why should any male-supremacist organized religion exist at all -- but even more questionably ...
WHY wouldn't any such male world organization plotting the death of women they labelled "witches"
be considered genocide?  And why wouldn't this violent church and its psychopathic and paranoid 
male-supremacists be seen for the criminal murders they were?
               </p>
               <p>
                Somehow you seem to be saying that since perhaps more females who studied plants as medicines, or perhaps more midwives weren't "statistically" burned at the stake in any higher numbers than any other women .... that's it's somehow not objectionable that ANY women whatsoever were burned at the stake.  Leave alone any women with special knowledge of women's bodies, childbirth and plants/medicines?
               </p>
               <p>
                What is true is that since that time males took over control of medicine ....even permitted to examine women and touch women as their "doctors" -- and  delivering babies as "gynecologists."  But, somehow, that doesn't seem odd to you.
               </p>
               <p>
                You don't seem able to "see" very much ... 
however, once begun, the "Hammer of Witches" and burning of women at the stake went on for long periods and beyond the control of the Papacy.
               </p>
               <p>
                While the Hammer of Witches was written in 1486 ....
               </p>
               <p>
                You can see the beginning of it with Joan of Arc -- in her burning at the stake in 1431.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Joan of Arc was one of the most famous individual victims of the Inquisition...
Charles VII convinced that her powers/visions did come from Heaven put Joan in charge of his army.
Joan achieved her greatest military victory in 1429 in leading 4,000 men to relieve the besieged town of Orleans.
Joan liberated Orleans, defeated the English in other French battles, and liberated several other French towns.

                  In 1430, during an attack to liberate Paris, Joan was captured by the Burgundians, and sold to the British.
Joan was tried by the French Inquisition for sorcery and heresy, and burned at the stake in 1431.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Pope Innocent VIII issued a papal bull recognizing the existence of witches. This hateful book became the most-used tool in the mass torture and murder of countless women based on supposed witchcraft or diabolism.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Estimates are extremely unreliable, but over the centuries tens or hundreds of thousands (some sources even say millions) were burned, drowned, hung or otherwise executed in Europe and North America. Some say 1 percent of victims was male, some say 10 percent, but the persecution of witches is very obviously the persecution of women.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Malleus Maleficarum concentrated almost exclusively on women, and the men who were murdered were often accused of being accomplices rather than witches. In fact, the feminine possessive in the Latin title already says it clearly: if the book were about male witches or both sexes, it would be called Malleus Maleficorum. Women were declared to be weaker in their faith and more ‘carnal’ than men–because women make men feel ‘carnal’, of course. That’s why we’re so evil, you see, because men have historically always been incapable of taking sexual responsibility for themselves. Note how the narrative has shifted over the centuries: men are now seen as the more carnal, less sexually disciplined ones, but women’s bodies are still blamed for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So witch hunts, connected as they are to the perception of all that is female and/or sexual as threatening, are a means of quelling female power. The witch or sorceress is a concept that has been closely associated with the woman healer, the midwife, the mystic, the shaman. Not only female sexuality but also female knowledge has been associated with evil. Anything that makes women something other than helpless is perceived as threatening (cf. the systematic killing of medicine women so that the field of medicine could become entirely male-dominated to school girls being hunted down and shot in the head by fanatical soldiers of the patriarchy in Pakistan, for instance). Among those burned in Europe in centuries past were many women who went against the status quo or dared to claim a place for themselves (I’d touch on ‘heathen’ religions at this point, but it goes beyond the already large scope). They were eliminated, driven by a deeply misogynist church-empire and economic pressure and religious-social upheaval in the population (which does sound frighteningly similar to a few regions on the planet right now).

                Of course women of the time were threatened by and fearful of organized patriarchal religion -- 
male-dominated religion.  Who would think otherwise?
               </p>
               <p>
                And of course the Inquisition and the Holocaust of Women resulted in their loss of control over their children ... and to inheritance rights ...
This led to times when women could be committed -- and were committed -- to insane asylums simply based on statements by a husband suggesting confusion or strange ideas.
This forced women into marriage in order to survive.
This pattern is repeated at any time and everywhere that women are deprived of income
and forced to resort to the streets.  We saw children forced to the streets as child prostitutes in the UK during the Victorian Age.
And we saw children here forced to the streets and sexually abused during the "Robber Baron" days in America and child labor.
These patterns are constantly repeated.

                <strong>
                 women were removed from
medicine and their knowledge of plants was destroyed

               <p>
                And so were the plants.
               </p>
               <p>
                Women in the South Sea Islands evidently still use Papaya .. .which
when taken for a week will cause a fertilized egg to be UNABLE to
                <br/>
                adhere to the lining of the womb.  It's also the basis for RU486...
so yes some of the knowledge still exists and some of the plants.

                **
The Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer), first published in 1486, is arguably one of the most infamous books ever written, due primarily to its position and regard during the Middle Ages.**

                 "Whether the Belief that there are such Beings as Witches is so Essential a Part of the Catholic Faith that Obstinacy to maintain the Opposite Opinion manifestly savors of Heresy."

               <p>
                And don't know what fake professioal anti-feminists you may be mistaking for feminists...
but until the 1970's **... repeating 1970's **.... women here still didn't have the right to 
securing credit under their own name.  They still required a male as co-signer.
               </p>
               <p>
                Imagine that for hundreds of years now we've had males delivering children ---
NOT that husbands weren't welcome to assist ... it was a great education for them,
in fact -- an awakening when it did happening.
               </p>
               <p>
                But the displacement of midwives and the idea that males know anything about 
the female body is ludicrous.  But now, women are proctologists ... which I guess
is a little evening up of the situation ... !!

              <strong>
               Protestant missionaries
              </strong>
              ; secondly, so appalled had much of the Catholic clergy become over the worsening conditions of the poor in Latin America that many of them were beginning to embrace a new and revolutionary theology known as Liberation Theology, a theology which, in essence, stood against everything U.S. corporate interests were up to in Latin America. All this goes a long way in shedding some light on why the governing elites of Latin America opened up the doors of their countries to the Protestant missionaries. One would have thought - given the Catholicism of most in Latin America's ruling elite - that they would have done the opposite - prevented the penetration of their countries by the Protestants. But their financial interests took precedence over their religious interests - hence the aid they offered, in coordination with the CIA, to the Protestant missionairy.

Vatican creation of Islam?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's basis #1.
             </p>
             <p>
              There were periods of more liberal leadership of the RCC at times...
-- certainly true during Pope John XXIII's reign/Vatican II -- but quickly reversed.
             </p>
             <p>
              True that Liberation Theology did exist for a too brief time -- overturned by the Polish/CIA Pope.
Who also, btw, returned Opus Dei to power in the Church.  Had been forced out by John XXIII/Vatican II.
             </p>
             <p>
              Elite Catholics aren't believers in religion -- only consider it useful -- money/power is highest interest.
Protestantism was at that time also primarily male-dominated religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Goes something like this ...
"Commonfolk think religion is true.  Wiser folk know it is false.
Elites think it is useful."
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the Evangelicals ... Benedict was talking about moving the church in direction of Evangelicalism.
Happily he's gone.  But who knows who is really running the Church -- Benedict or Frances ... or ...???
             </p>
             <p>
              The other night I punched the wrong numbers into my remote and Jimmy Swaggart popped -
still preachin' to an audience -- which suggests to me that not only is the whole thing about $$$, 
it's supported by members who are either fools or perverts, as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nor have I ever really believed the "boogey man" of right wing Fundi religion.
It's a cover for racism, sexism, homophobia and seeks to control our societies just
as RCC does.
             </p>
             <p>
              What's your impression of Evangelicals/Fundi's?
             </p>
             <p>
              From what internet friends in the South have told me over the years,
their societies are usually very controlled right wing ... but also has a 
LOT to do with MIC in those areas.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, Protestants obviously didn't protect those Latin American countries from
exploitation by Elites, either.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once you're talking Vatican and/or CIA you're also talking propaganda ...
             </p>
             <p>
              You can also see here the reality of fascism in Spain had a great deal to do
with Spain becoming a democracy and the "unhappiness" of the RCC re

              The Vatican Propaganda Machine: The Spanish “Civil War” Lesson**
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               From George Seldes, the “dean and granddaddy of investigative reporters,” when it comes to issues important to the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, “… there is no free press in America.” Seldes’s extensive study of the Spanish Civil War and the related control of the American press by the Catholic hierarchy is exceedingly instructive for all who are concerned about this freedom.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 1931, Spain became the Republic of Spain, a liberal democracy that separated church and state, ended State monetary support for the church and adopted the principles of Freedom of Conscience, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom of the Press. The Vatican feared for the Church’s very survival in Spain. There had been four insurrections since 1835, and it was the Spanish people, the poor workers and poor peasants, who burned the churches because they blamed the hierarchy for having persistently backed the upper class. The latest uprising against the Catholic Church took place throughout the country in July, 1936. One historian described it as “the work of masses of common people, a spontaneous uprising.” The Vatican feared that the liberal democracy with its freedoms would spell the end of the Church in Spain.

               Before the fall of the Papal States in 1870, the Vatican HATED the United States and its Constitution. The U.S. was a haven for many of the refugees who fled Europe after the Revolution of 1848. Garibaldi and Gazazzi were welcomed as HEROES by the Protestant U.S. Many in the U.S. supported the liberation of Italy and contributed to its success with soldiers and money.

              <p>

you have to understand these related CIA operations which were being

              There never was a right wing religious majority without the Vatican.

             <p>
              Meanwhile, the CIA has always been interested in the Vatican and vice versa.
Elites used the Vatican "rat holes" at the least to bring out the gold and the former Nazis to 
ensure the rise of the Fourth Reich here.
Presumably Elites also got help in moving funds to Hitler/Nazis originally.
             </p>
             <p>
              But CIA interests were also high because of the intelligence network of the Vatican -
immense communication.

              Well, at one point Benedict was moving the RCC towards Evangelism  ...
But understand that the large myth balloon that flew over GOP administrations of
an all-potent Evangelical base has just about released all it's air.

              Got the wrong numbers punched into my remote recently and noticed that Jimmy
Swaggart/Pervert is still preaching ... so what can be said of these money-collectors 
other than their followers are either insane or also perverts.

              As for your link ... what was Allen Dulles' nephew doing in Rome as a ... forget what higher
level he reached before he died there.  Think his name was Aubrey Dulles?  Thought he 
might make Pope one day.

              CIA has always been interested in the RCC and vice versa -- huge network for intelligence
gathering that has existed over 2,000 years, plus the taking over of other nation's histories
all of which presumably landed in their libraries/files.
Add to that the info they collected from the Crusades and Inquisition as a result of torture and
mind manipulation and you know the CIA was very interested.
Like Vatican shared this knowledge with Hitler/Nazis for their Mind Control experiments ... and
ultimately landed in CIA as "MKULTRA."
Pope Pius XII catapulted Hitler to power for benefit of Elites.

              and this is true ...

               Catholic clergy become over the worsening conditions of the poor in Latin America that many of them were beginning to embrace a new and revolutionary theology known as Liberation Theology,&lt;

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              EXCEPT that "Liberation Theology" lasted only a brief time in the RCC ... as the
church exists to underpin Elite Patriarchy ... and it was the Polish/CIA Pope who ended 
Liberation Theology.

              (See also uprisings in Spain in regard to RCC supporting Elites there and RCC opposition to 
Spain becoming a democracy and their Separation of Church &amp; State -- which resulted in FRANCO
and fascism there based in Catholicism.  In fact, that Catholic influence here prevented FDR from
intervening in Spain -- concerned about the Catholic vote in US based on the propaganda they were
fed about what was happening in Spain.

             Stop blaming those terrible "white heterosexual Christians" for things they did not do. In our last conversation you lamented the plight of the poor black slaves and the torment they suffered from us terrible white heterosexual Christians. When I pointed out that the black slave trade was run out of Newport and Charleston and was a Jewish operation you called me racist and anti-semitic. Please say that you condemn the Jewish slave traders for black slavery in America. And please admit that holding white people in bondage as "indentured servants" up unto death is the same as slavery.

              The date of the above letter was November 27,1773. We have not yet concluded, because of lack of space, the excerpts and grateful compilations made available by the “Carnegie Institute.”
             </p>
             <p>
              On November 29,1767, the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez—who had been cheated by one of his kind— from Charleston, where he had journeyed to better control his Black cargo, wrote Aaron Lopez at Newport:
             </p>
             <p>
              “These Negroes, which Captain Abraham All delivered to me, were in such poor condition due to the poor transportation, that I was forced to sell 8 boys and girls for a mere 27 (pounds), 2 other for 45 (pounds) and two women each for 35 (pounds).” (No doubt, English money)
             </p>
             <p>
              Abraham Pereia Mendez was very angry and accused Aaron Lopez of “cheating” him. This letter delineates to us that this generous and fine citizen of Newport was insatiable in his greed for money. This is what caused the Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein to present this nobleman, Aaron Lopez, to pursue his objectionable methods. Negroes presented to him but a commodity.
             </p>
             <p>
              In all of the letters which the “Carnegie Institute” published, it stresses the lack of human sympathy for the poor Negro slaves. This lack of feeling and compassion for the
              <strong>
               abused and pitiful Blacks at the hands of their Jewish dealers
              </strong>
              , can be read out of the diary of a captain who manned a ship owned by Aaron Lopez. The entrees concern a trip from the African Coast to Charleston. Moreover, they are authentic documents, published by the “Carnegie Institute” in Washington, D.C., calling attention to an organization which had heretofore known little or nothing about; neither had they encountered further publicity in books or newspapers.

             <p>
              Anyway, the slave stuff you shared is shocking. I bookmarked it to read more later. I never thought deep about that subject. How horrible! It's just shocking how evil humans can be.

              It's hard for me to comprehend how someone could accept money and live with themselves by being cruel. I would rather be poor. Thank you for sharing. Even if it doesn't sink into her head, at least others are reading this and can learn from it. I like that you always reference things too. Keep it up!

              ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT!! Jesus was OBVIOUSLY one of the first feminists. Organized religion is all bullshit. it's a control system and the SAME control system exists on "the other side." it's all controlled by the same entities. it's all a false construct to trick you into agreeing to reincarnate into this fucked up stupid world for your so-called "karma." why come back here to learn what you already know?? hmmm?? these controller entities FEED on our negative energy, that's why they set the system up this way. &amp; besides you don't need organized religion to follow Jesus' examples. he himself taught that your connection to God is WITHIN. it's not outside us! do you think that the controller pharisees liked hearing THAT little tidbit of eye opening knowledge? NO. of course not. religion has NOT been corrupted, it was corrupt from the start. it was always about money, power, control &amp; yes - PEDOPHILIA!

               Agreed. But we need an effort to start this party and at the moment its get rid of pedophilia which will knock the underpinning out from under them.

                "I will let you ponder reincarnation and I will go with documented history. Jesus invented freedom by fighting bankers."
 -- evidence for reincarnation is well documented and overwhelming. &amp; YES Jesus fought the banking cartel of the day for usury and other crimes. i'm in agreement with that. the "idea" of Jesus as well as the reality of him as a real man (i know him personally) &amp; reincarnation are not mutually exclusive ideas.
               </p>
               <p>
                getting rid of pedophilia is paramount. anyways, i'm on an extremely wild spiritual journey right now &amp; i don't know exactly where it will all lead me, so i don't expect people to understand really. the idea that the same controller energies/entities that control everything over here do the same thing in "heaven," is a fascinating one to me and i'm still in the beginnings of researching this. the idea is that there is a TRUE God, a non-judgemental God, a loving God &amp; also a REAL heaven! but the one we go to through that infamous tunnel, may not really be it. there's info on utube as well as books, &amp; i am going to read as much as i can about it before i make a final decision, but i am leaning towards revoking my earthly contracts so that i can be as close to the real God as i can.

              In the much edited and changed myths we call the Bible, one of the most obviously
disguised realities is that Mary Magdalene was Jesus' "Disciple to the Disciples."
And that Mary and Jesus were likely married and had children.

               Jesus invented Freedom and Zionist invented Slavery. You hate Jesus. Now, admit that Jewish Zionists owned the black slave trade and stop making yourself look bad, or continue to demonstrate that if a Zionists lips are moving they are lying.

                 I never thought of that. I saw you say her profile name is a play on words. Voatscam makes so much sense! Why else would someone pick this name?

                  Of course it isn't men who are obsessed with women ... right?

                  There isn't worldwide organized patriarchal religion which just happened to have
run a program of "burning women at the stake"  -- right?

                 <p>
                  There isn't Christianity which advocated the beating of women ... right?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Nor is there a RCC and Mormon Church which funded a movement against 
the Equal Rights Amendment for women -- right?

together you are trading your ignorance from one to the other.

                 I have seen you say the media is a terrible organization. Well meet the media and call a spade a spade. Not full of "white people" huh?

                 You are the disgusting one of the bunch. I wanted to see just how evil you were and you proved it by calling me anti-semitic for pointing out that the Jewish Zionist were 100% responsible for slavery. You brought that subject of slavery up, not me. In typical destroy the family Luciferian fashion you blamed slavery on your invented boogie man of Patriarchy. The truth is that the vast majority of men are good people so fuck your sidestepping ass.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then you had the gaul to say white people were not the slaves of Jews when the Jews made indentured servants out of them. So fuck you again you evil asshole.
