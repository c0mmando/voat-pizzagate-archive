            You are trying to restore your emotional equilibrium by searching for an escape route. "Fake Media" is not doing for you, so your looking elsewhere for something more concrete. Better just to accept Sh*t happens and start looking at the evidence and how you can help...

             You're may be right about me being in a state of denial. But if I am then I'm probably no different in that respect from the majority of the population. The general public at large probably won't be moved, no matter how many bloggers are raving on. And the mainstream media is ignoring it. But there can be no justification for the fact-checkers to ignore what usually falls right in their bailiwick. The theory needs scrutiny from a reputable professional journalist. I just hope there's one left.

              Pizzagate is real because there really are pedophiles.
