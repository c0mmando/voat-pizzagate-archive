<p>Transcribed from Eric Hufschmid’s 1998 video interview.</p>
<p>KG: Kay Griggs
EH: Eric Hufschmid</p>
<p>EH: So, everything here is real laidback. You\'ve got a lot of information and we want to, we want to get this done into a story line because I think what we\'ve got here is something that is extremely important for people to know.</p>
<p>EH: Alright. Uh, let’s talk a little about you and, uh, let’s see now. You, where did you start out your life? Born and raised in the country?
KG: Yeah, I raised on and on a farm in fact I live in the same neighbourhood in which I grew up. It was my Grandfather\'s, um, farm. Part… part of it was divided into thirds but in nineteen thirty nine my grandfather, [who] was an obstetrician in Norfolk, he was also in the naval reserves, he was in charge of military intelligence, er, in, in Norfolk, which is the largest military naval complex in the world. So I was born in the naval hospital which is, was the NATO headquarters...</p>
<p>EH: Uh-huh.
 KG: ...and brought home to my Grandparents farm. Uh, my Father was in the South China Sea’s on a naval vessel. My Uncle was in the Navy. I come from a long line of military/civilian, er, folks. They, they were not full time military individuals, they, they had jobs and they would go into the war they would be in reserve and as my grandfather was he stayed in and retired a Navy Captain but I live an in house that was in part of my Grandfather\'s field.
EH: That’s great.
 KG: But I’m, I’m being strangled, financially, by, erm, the, this army intelligence group, JAG group, that my husband, erm…</p>
<p>EH: Now this JAG, is that J.A.G?
 KG: JAG, judge, advocate, general. Erm, I think American citizens do not realize how many JAGs are in our court system and they take orders. They are in the chain of command, they’re active reserve and they’re in our court system everywhere you look...</p>
<p>EH: Judges federal and state?
KG: ...and local, everywhere, yeah and they\'re going to, erm, meetings once a month and if there is a case uh, like many of the military intelligence wise, like myself, and we have information that would come out in a, in a divorce hearing or whatever they totally control it inside. Judge John Moore in my case, um, in Virginia Beach, is a, is an Army Ranger. His, erm, he is active reserve he\'s VMI (Virgina Military Institute) army colonel. He\'s a graduate of VMI in Virginia Beach in the courts. There are at least six judges, and I\'m, I\'m including commissioners in that because in Virginia we have a system where the commissioners do the, erm, do the, a lot of the decisions and all of these in Virginia Beach, who take care of military wives, are military judge.</p>
<p>EH: Now, you mentioned the term VMI, what, what is that?
KG: Well VMI is Virgina Military Institue and it\'s where, erm, General Marshall, the Marshall Plan went to school, it\'s, it\'s a little west point there\'s a lot of tradition there, erm, but these based on, on the Greek sort of spartan military concept and my father went to Washington and Lee [University], which is also in Lexington, and i know that there is of some sort of, I won’t say cult, but there probably is some sort of, erm...</p>
<p>EH: Club?
KG: ...secret society...
EH: Okay.
KG: and, so it\'s very, very tight clique. Erm, but what I trying to say is that the judges are military men and they\'re not independent. They eight take orders...
EH: Orders.
 KG: They’re on, there\'s a chain of command and in my particular case and the other eleven military wives that, who, whom I had met so far there many, many more, but, they\'ve all been handled the same way.
EH: Uh-huh.
KG: Not, it\'s not a normal divorce, er, at all.</p>
<p>EH: I\'ve, I\'ve heard of these kinda situations before but never, it’s never been put so a concisely and so reasonably that there would be connection why some people just, no matter what attorney you have, it doesn\'t matter.
KG: Oh, no.
EH: The divorces in the settlements of assets never go the right way.
KG: No. And there\'s the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) court which I know is involved in, in my case.</p>
<p>EH: What kind of court?
KG: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. It’s a justice department secret court that American citizens are not aware of. There have been a couple of articles on it. It\'s a small group of men and I think there\'s a woman on it. I believe there\'s seven justices and in reality the in the article that I read, which was given to me by Mike Fuller, and I know he would not mind using his name, he\'s at the government assassin, he was a, er, like my husband, a government assassin, who, er, did…
EH: When you say assassin are you talking character assassination or kill people?
KG: No, killing people.
EH: Uh-huh, Okay.
KG: He’s a, he’s a mercenary government mercenary.
EH: Okay.
KG: He was in Afghanistan and Rhodesia, South Africa, and I met him and his wife through Sarah McClendon. He’s a real wonderful patriot who is speaking out about what the NATO community and the Army and Marine Corps are doing.</p>
<p>EH: And Sarah McClendon she’s a, she’s an old horses, isn’t she?
 KG: Sarah saved my life, literally.
EH: Really?
KG: Yeah. I had been having break-ins starting on, starting the night of March the fourth after I was calling everywhere to see if I could find my husband. He would, you know, disappear at times, and I found my husband\'s diary, which I have here, which they had been not anxious to have erm, get out.</p>
<p>EH: Uh-huh. Now ‘they’ meaning?
KG: The, well they, General Sheehan [John J. &quot;Jack&quot; Sheehan], General Krulak [Victor H. Krulak], Marine Corps Colonels, excuse me, Generals, er, Al Gray [Alfred M. Gray, Jr.], er, Cook [Donald G. Cook ] and especially General Joy.</p>',

            Yes ... but the higher project was supporting the Contras to overthrow the democratic Sandinista 
government.  They were selling arms to Iran to give the money to Contras*
And they were doing that because Congress had BANNED that activity and would no longer fund it.
           </p>
           <p>
            At that point, Iran &amp; Iraq were at war which seemed also to have to do with something the US brought about.**
           </p>
           <p>
            PLUS
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond that was the Hostage Affairs -- #1 the "October Surprise" which was arranged to have 
Iranians hold the hostages until Reagan was sworn in.
            <br/>
            And #2 it had to do with remaining hostages (7, I think) which Reagan was obsessed with.***
           </p>
           <p>
            ***  Iran/Contra **
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The contras (or Contras) were the various U.S.-backed and funded right-wing rebel groups that were active from 1979 to the early 1990s in opposition to the left-wing, democratic socialist Sandinista Junta of National Reconstruction government in Nicaragua. Among the separate contra groups, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN) emerged as the largest by far. In 1987, virtually all contra organizations were united, at least nominally, into the Nicaraguan Resistance.
            </p>
            <p>
             From an early stage, the rebels received financial and military support from the United States government, and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in the Iran–Contra affair.
            </p>
            <p>
             The term "contra" comes from the Spanish contra, which means against but in this case is short for la contrarrevolución, in English "the counter-revolution". Some rebels disliked being called contras, feeling that it defined their cause only in negative terms, or implied a desire to restore the old order. Rebel fighters usually referred to themselves as comandos ("commandos"); peasant sympathizers also called the rebels los primos ("the cousins"). From the mid-1980s, as the Reagan administration and the rebels sought to portray the movement as the "democratic resistance," members started describing themselves as la resistencia.
            </p>
            <p>
             During their war against the Nicaraguan government, the Contras committed a large number of human rights violations and used terrorist tactics,[1][2][3][4][5] carrying out more than 1300 terrorist attacks.[6] These actions were frequently carried out systematically as a part of the strategy of the Contras. Supporters of the Contras tried to downplay these violations, particularly the Reagan administration in the US, which engaged in a campaign of white propaganda to alter public opinion in favor of the contras.[7]

           </p>
           <p>
            **
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1985, while Iran and Iraq were at war, Iran made a secret request to buy weapons from the United States. McFarlane sought Reagan's approval, in spite of the embargo against selling arms to Iran. McFarlane explained that the sale of arms would not only improve U.S. relations with Iran, but might in turn lead to improved relations with Lebanon, increasing U.S. influence in the troubled Middle East. Reagan was driven by a different obsession. He had become frustrated at his inability to secure the release of the seven American hostages being held by Iranian terrorists in Lebanon. As president, Reagan felt that "he had the duty to bring those Americans home," and he convinced himself that he was not negotiating with terrorists. While shipping arms to Iran violated the embargo, dealing with terrorists violated Reagan's campaign promise never to do so. Reagan had always been admired for his honesty. 
The arms-for-hostages proposal divided the administration. Longtime policy adversaries Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State George Shultz opposed the deal, but Reagan, McFarlane and CIA director William Casey supported it. With the backing of the president, the plan progressed. By the time the sales were discovered, more than 1,500 missiles had been shipped to Iran. Three hostages had been released, only to be replaced with three more, in what Secretary of State George Shultz called "a hostage bazaar." 
When the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Shiraa" printed an exposé on the clandestine activities in November 1986, Reagan went on television and vehemently denied that any such operation had occurred. He retracted the statement a week later, insisting that the sale of weapons had not been an arms-for-hostages deal. Despite the fact that Reagan defended the actions by virtue of their good intentions, his honesty was doubted. Polls showed that only 14 percent of Americans believed the president when he said he had not traded arms for hostages. 
While probing the question of the arms-for-hostages deal, Attorney General Edwin Meese discovered that only $12 million of the $30 million the Iranians reportedly paid had reached government coffers. Then-unknown Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council explained the discrepancy: he had been diverting funds from the arms sales to the Contras, with the full knowledge of National Security Adviser Admiral John Poindexter and with the unspoken blessing, he assumed, of President Reagan. 
Poindexter resigned, and North was fired, but Iran-Contra was far from over. The press hounded the president: Did he know about these illegal activities, and if not, how could something of this magnitude occur without his knowledge? In an investigation by the Reagan-appointed Tower Commission, it was determined that, as president, Reagan's disengagement from the management of his White House had created conditions which made possible the diversion of funds to the Contras. But there was no evidence linking Reagan to the diversion. 
Speculation about the involvement of Reagan, Vice President George Bush and the administration at large ran rampant. Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh investigated the affair for the next eight years. Fourteen people were charged with either operational or "cover-up" crimes. In the end, North's conviction was overturned on a technicality, and President Bush issued six pardons, including one to McFarlane, who had already been convicted, and one to Weinberger before he stood trial. 
Although laws had been broken, and Reagan's image suffered as a result of Iran-Contra, his popularity rebounded. In 1989 he left office with the highest approval rating of any president since Franklin Roosevelt.

             Iran Contra really is a long story. Reagan's campaign team negotiated (illegally) with Iran to hold our hostages until after Reagan was sworn in. In return, Reagan unfroze their assets here and sold them weapons. Actually Reagan sponsored the Ba'ath Party in Iraq (the party of Saddam Hussein) to attack Iran, and then sold Iran weapons to protect themselves against iraq.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was illegal because a deal like this is supposed to be approved by Congress. But Reagan didn't even TELL Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
             His people took the money from that deal and used to support a war in Central America, also illegally.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he was caught, Reagan claimed to have no knowledge of what his people were doing. He also said that we sold the weapons only to 'moderate' Iranians.

            Well, yes, I think we do tend to think that it all goes to corrupt individuals ....
but recall Iran/Contra where the money didn't simply go to enrich the players.
And boodles of money are missing from Pentagon/MIC and Iraq pallets -- 
trillions and trillions.
Also, the military is involved in human trafficking according to Det. Rothstein (see Fetzer interview
on YouTube) and not being reported, but certainly they don't circulate that money back to the troops
or even to the top Generals.  Doubt that Reagan saw the $$ that came in for Iran/Contra.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has to be going to secret projects on higher level that we don't know about.
That doesn't mean that people running this stuff aren't doing well ...
but many of them could also be programmed MKULTRA victims/robots.

            I know in the late 1960's someone who would have paid $40,000 or more for a kidney
for his grandchild, so may be a lot more now?

-- or what they might be reporting of a black market in organs?
           </p>
           <p>
            But, can they report on organ trafficking without also hitting drug and human trafficking
which seem all to be run by same people?
           </p>
           <p>
            And we might also give some thought as to where the bulk of this money goes eventually?
What other hidden projects?

            Lively and Abrams show that most of Hitler's high ranking cabinet members and generals were not only Jewish sabbatean occultists, but gay pederasts as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            This approach shows how the roman model of homosexual submission and dominant indoctrination makes for a 'better' infantry and militia because of the 'bonds' created. Hitler and his men used to fill halls full of German boys and made them have sex with each other as well as for encouraging heterosexual young couples to procreate for the fatherland. Pictures of these events are some of the most sought after Nazi memorabilia out there for the elite in the know.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Nazi machine used homosexuality much like every other despot has used it through history, as a tool for blackmail as well. Ernst Röhm had been much too blatant about his activities and had to be peeled back before he showed the german people exactly what the Hitler war machine was.

            This submissive top down approach to command is what has been adopted by the us military just as their Templar descendants did 1000 years ago.

            the DNC lawyer, Elizabeth Beck, was making connections to Mayo Clinic. which has been medical provider to heads of state around the world for years. I found some websites that track organ transfers in the US, a government site, and an organization that handles collection and distribution, but I bet Mayo clinic has a secret supply chain.

            As I recall, Kay Griggs also described that signs were left behind so that others would know who had actually done the assassination -- think she gave Ron Brown as an example.

            I think reading the first part is essential but it does take some time to get to all four parts and I'd suggest
that you can kinda scan your way through after the first part.  Part four was important as I recall she is reading lists of "Council of Foreign Relations" members.
           </p>

            Actually, if I had time I'd look at it again.

            I wonder if the suicide of this two star general in the Army is related to what Kay Griggs described?  I mean, I wonder if he was asked to participate in some sort of Illuminati initiation ceremony, but declined.

            It seems strange that someone that healthy would commit suicide after receiving a very nice promotion.  Besides, why would they promote him if he was suicidal?  You would think they would be able to detect it.

            YES, Yes, yes. The Kay Griggs tapes are essential for understanding how pizzagate has come to dominate the political and power structure. Its about 8 hours but definitely take the time to watch her. She is very compelling and she has a lot to say. She married a US Marine Colonel who was alcoholic and became abusive, she spills all of his secrets and then some.
