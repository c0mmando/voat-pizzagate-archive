<p>Pizza and Cubs and Bears, Oh My!</p>
<p>Amy,
Summer is finally here, and one city that really comes alive when the parkas are put away is Chicago. After being cooped up all winter, locals can\'t wait to get outside and see the Cubbies lose, catch a show on Theater Row, party along the lakeshore or play 16&quot; softball. So, with hibernating over, catch DA BEARS (fans) in their habitat with a Storescape. Here\'s a small sampling of our inventory:</p>
<p>1 North Dearborn
This GARGANTUAN Storescape wraps three sides of a downtown skyscraper in the heart of Chicago\'s Loop. Formerly the Chicago flagship store for Sears, this location is only two blocks from Millenium Park and even has its own subway entrance. In immediate vicinity of retailers including T.J. Maxx, Burlington Coat Factory, Target, Office Depot, and AT&amp;T, and those are only the one\'s on the same block. This is the best advertising in Chicago.</p>
<p>900 South Wabash is in the heart of the loop, the central business District of Chicago. Known for sausages and deep dish pizzas, Chicago is America\'s third most populous city and this corner location is in the heart of it all. Within walking distance of the Art Institute of Chicago, Soldier Field, and Willis Tower, place your advertisement where the Windy City will see it!

            Amy --
Let me ask you two important questions:
   -- Do you like pizza?
   -- Do you want to hang out with The Hillary Bus?
Chip in $3 or more right now and you'll automatically be entered for a chance to win a pizza party with The Hillary Bus!
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm so excited that a group of Ready for Hillary supporters will get to experience all the enthusiasm of our grassroots tour right in their own backyard.
Here's how it works:
The Hillary Bus will travel to visit one lucky winner AND host an exclusive pizza party for you and ten of your friends.
Sounds awesome right? All you need to do is chip in $3 or more right now.
Good luck!
Adam Parkhomenko,
Executive Director, Ready for Hillary

             I just commented on that on another post about Matthews favorite Ping Pong place.  Over 200 emails about pizza and over 200 about chicken.  And yes that Hillary Bus Pizza Party contest?  This is a world famous electronics company.  These are guys talking about pizza and chicken over 200 times?  Just a little strange.

            Last night a thread about hot dog stand runs for the office at Stra tf or on the Global Intelligence Files on WikiLeaks published in 2013 but back in 2009.  There were holding pens at a pizza place in Austin.  I wonder how they delivered the kids or kid.  ? A van or how. This stuff is sickening and makes me cry again.

            As others have mentioned, not all instances of pizza, or even pizza parties, is going to be pedo code. The example you cited was probably a boring food instance. The pattern we've seen with other elites is regular discussion about food, and hiding instances discussing kids amidst the regular food traffic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look for instances that pretty clearly can't be explained away as just food talk, and go from there.

            It's the use of pizza in strange context whereby it is obviously code talk, for example "you think I could play dominoes better on cheese pizza.."
Nobody plays dominoes on cheese pizza...  "I left a handkerchief at your house it's pizza related."  wtf?  Private party with a bunch of supper wealthy catered with $60,000 worth of hotdogs?  That's 147,692 Ball-Park brand all beef hotdogs at current Walmart price.  That would take 2140 people to tie the world record for hotdog eating of 69 hotdogs to make use off all of them.  Lets just say they meant fully dressed and ready hotdogs for 6 dollars a hotdog however you want it that's still 10,000 hotdogs  Let's say everyone at 10 well that's 1000 wealthy connected types in the white house sickening their selves with junk food.  What are the odds of that?  bring out the Lobster bisque that Podesta likes as he tweeted to Julian Assange.  Let's say it was a reasonable bunch who wanted to make sure no one went home hungry and provided 3 hotdogs each.  That's 3,333 guest who can eat all the hotdogs they want, and with normal variegation of some eating none many eating 1 a large amount eating 2 and still a few who didn't eat breakfast eating 3 you could still have a contest with a few world record tiers!  Can you honestly get that many snobs together in private to eat hotdogs in the White House?? That's what you look for when the "words" are used.  Crazy shit under any circumstance. Not what your doing.  Your drag-netting every grocery freezer section into this.

            Room of the Day: Game On in Sacramento
           </p>
           <p>
            Like a royal flush beats a pair, this high-design spot for private card games trumps the typical basement
           </p>
           <p>
            The owners of this Sacramento, California, home wanted to create the ultimate space for hosting their weekly card games, but with no room on the main living floor, they played the hand they were dealt and looked below the house. In the basement they found a little under 600 feet in the home theater to, well, play with.

            Pizza doesn't automatically mean pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can someone with Microsoft Excel search "Matthew Freud", click the .xls files and check who was on those flights with him?
           </p>
           <p>
            His dad (now deceased) Clement Freud was recently revealed to be a pedophile on the same scale as Jimmy Savile and the prime suspect in the abduction of Madeleine McCann. Matthew Freud runs a PR firm (Freud Communications) whose PR consultant Clarence Mitchell was the publicist for Kate &amp; Gerry McCann. Sara Latham, who now works for Podesta, worked at Freud Communications at the same time of the Madeleine McCann disappearance. Clarence Mitchell is also best friends with Christopher Meyer, former UK ambassador to the US whose wife Catherine Meyer is founder of PACT (Parents &amp; Abducted Children Together) where Hillary Clinton was made honorary chair. So that's two connections between Clinton and the McCann disappearence, one directly linking Podesta.
