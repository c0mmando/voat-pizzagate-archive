<p><strong>Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg favors decriminalizing pedophilia and child sex trafficking:</strong>  <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2017/02/08/supreme-court-justice-ginsburg-favors-decriminalizing-pedophilia-and-child-sex-trafficking/">https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2017/02/08/supreme-court-justice-ginsburg-favors-decriminalizing-pedophilia-and-child-sex-trafficking/</a></p>
<p>“In 1977 when Ginsburg was General Counsel of the ACLU, she co-authored (with Brenda Feigen-Fasteau) Sex Bias in the U.S. Code: A Report of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which was published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in April 1977, for which Ginsburg and Feigen-Fasteau were paid with federal funds under Contract No. CR3AK010.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“On p. 102 of Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, under the sub-heading “Recommendations,” Ginsburg and Feigen-Fasteau recommend a revision of 18 U.S.C. §2032 from “carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years” to “A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and . . . the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old“. Below is the pertinent paragraph:</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. §2032 — Eliminate the phrase “carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years” and substitute a Federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense patterned after S. 1400 §1633: A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and (1) compels the other person to participate: (A) by force or (B) by threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will imminently be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (2) has substantially impaired the other person’s power to appraise or control the conduct by administering or employing a drug or intoxicant without the knowledge or against the will of such other person, or by other means; or (3) the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.</p>
<p>Ginsburg (and her co-author) also recommends that the Mann Act be repealed. The Mann Act is a federal law passed in 1910 which makes it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose”.</p>
<p><strong>In other words, if Ruth Bader Ginsburg has her way, sexual abuse of children 12-years or older would not be a crime, nor would child sex trafficking.</strong>”</p>

             Thank you for this.  Here's the full NY Times interview your linked article refers to:

            This all utter bullshit.   This was brought during her confirmation hearings and explained.   She wrote an article about using gender neutral language when writing laws.   She did not take a position one way or the other on the age of consent.  She was not writing at all about the age of consent.   When asked directly during her confirmation she said she had no problems with the existing age of consent laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            What she did argue is that by not making the language of some laws gender neutral, you could read the law to say men or even boys could never be raped.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL/DR   She was absolutely correct and enemies of her confirmation tried to distort what she wrote.
