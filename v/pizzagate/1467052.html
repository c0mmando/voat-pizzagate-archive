<p>Today, I found myself private messaging another pizzagate digger on voat. That digger pointed me to a Youtube author:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgziCnF8Fx_7UOGcBXxMMrQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgziCnF8Fx_7UOGcBXxMMrQ</a></p>
<p>This Youtube author PREDICTED the Comet Ping Pong false flag attack 9 days in advance!!! He said that a gun/arson event would happen before December 14. He made that prediction 9 days before the gunman walked into Comet Ping Pong. This guy is legit! (He says that pizzagate is probably a CIA hoax, but I believe that he is probably wrong about that!)</p>
<p>He also told me that mass shootings like Sandy Hook are fake, false flag events. At first I didn\'t believe him. I thought it was ridiculous. But then I watched some of the videos from this youtube guy, and I became basically 95% convinced.</p>
<p>Remember that FBIanon said that a mass shooting (I think Orlando?) was CIA. He said that 9/11 was Mossad too. These are rabbit holes that I never wanted to go down, but I find myself going down them because of the evidence.</p>
<p>If you watch these videos about Sandy Hook, you will realize that (A) an actor is the same person who played both a &quot;SWAT&quot; guy who was on the front pages of many newspapers and (B) a grieving father who lobbied for gun control laws. He looks literally identical. He is known to be an actor, and his wife is also a known actor. And, in numerous pictures and videos, he holds a rifle completely inappropriately (upside down by the clip). He does many other things that indicate he is an actor (no FBI badge, wearing Army surplus clothes, rifle and pistol on oppose sides, silver pistol clips when is carrying a rifle, dodging the camera repeatedly, etc.)</p>
<p>I have sent the video to a Marine friend of mine who confirms that a seasoned FBI/SWAT agent would NEVER hold a gun that way. There are numerous other pieces of evidence to think that Sandy Hook was a hoax, and an entire book about it was removed from Amazon, and an article about it was removed from Infowars.</p>
<p>In view of the above, we need to ask whether the Sandy Hook Hoax, and similar hoaxes, are part of the pizzagate conspiracy. FBIanon said (I believe) that Orlando was CIA. The people who think Sandy Hook was a hoax say that most other shootings are hoaxes, and are done by the government to try to get gun control laws passed. Remember, RedTeamPlanner explained how right now, if there was a civil war, the conservatives/rebels would win within 24 hours. So, if the government is filled with psychopaths, the first thing that they would attack is the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment might be the only thing keeping us from 1984.</p>
<p>As even more evidence, as I watched videos from Barry Soetoro (the Youtube guy) and others about Sandy Hook, I noticed:</p>
<ol>
<li>he alleges that the people behind the Sandy Hook hoax are involved with the Council on Foreign Relations, which is one of the key points of corruption in the Clinton Foundation (according to FBIanon and books like Partners in Crime)</li>
<li>his videos cite businesses/agencies that have the double-heart pedo symbol as their logo.</li>
</ol>

            BTW - the video OP posted is about 22 minutes too long. There are other more informative vids about sandyhook. Here are just some search queues:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Homes within the vicinity of the school of 5-6 families involved were purchased Dec 25 (holiday) - most of victim families were new to the neighborhood within previous couple of yrs
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              two people seen fleeing the school at the time of the "shooting" and running into a forest edge
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              A mason's lodge is on the other side of the forest edge
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              helicopter footage shows nothing you'd expect to see in the moment of crisis: no commotion, no urgency, no kids escorted from building (same repetitive footage of a dozen kids walking in tandem in the wrong direction)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Victim families' donation web pages set up an hour after the "massacre", according to domain records
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Audio recordings of 9-11 calls - no shots can be heard, strange communication/statements
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Crisis actors - horrible footage and strange events/interviews (female classmate of Lanza, parents - Robbie Parker, Nick/Laura Phelps + others, neighbor Gene) Some of the footage is unwatchable---it was THIS that I remember so distinctly after the event occurred - that the interviews with victims and families on site and more formal interviews later grated my nerves - I knew something was off about them so I just stopped watching the news. And the numerous crisis actors was also quite telling - some were seen at the Boston bombing.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              County Coronor claims he saw no bodies
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              An amateur sleuther climbed over the fence of the school grounds after the incident and filmed it - no visible signs of shooting/broken windows, damage
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              School razed and $50M was donated(?) for new school (I do public work, it is astonishing how fast this new school was designed and built)
             </p>

            <li>
             <p>
              Adam Lanza - found child porn, weird issues with his brother, it's inconceivable to anyone who knows an Asberger's person that they could be capable of this type of rage, it's also inconceivable that someone Adam's size could carry the kind of ammo and weaponry that was reported was used

             My guess is that when the Tavistock documents finally get leaked or unlocked from wikileaks,  they will reveal that Tavistock is behind sandy hook, and a lot else.

            The problem with "investigating" the hoax shootings is they are contained events. The only information that can confirm they are hoaxes is the lack of information/transparency. 
Think about trying to disprove an experiment done in a fish bowl, but the scientist insists you can have no objects wtihin the bowl to conduct your own research. You simply cannot expect to get any real evidence of the validity or lack thereof under these circumstances.
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence is watching the "events" with an open mind. Anyone that actually watches "Robbie Parker" laugh within hours of his daughter being mutilated, then choke himself up to get up and talk on the podium can physically see that it was a hoax.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is a separate animal. There can be real evidence formed that would make any reasonable mind question the narrative. It is not to be treated the same as the shooting hoaxes.

             I don't understand why you are trying to distance shooting hoaxes from pizzagate. Pizzagate involves high level child trafficking and corruption. Shooting hoaxes are examples of corruption. You seem to agree that shooting hoaxes are real. I've given evidence that the shooting hoaxes are associated with the Council on Foreign Relations and businesses with double heart pedo symbols. We know that, right now, these are involved with high level Democrat politicians - the ones who want more gun control. In the past, Republicans were involved with Boys' Town and other scandals. But right now, there is circumstantial evidence to link Sandy Hook to pizzagate, and there is NO EVIDENCE to disconnect them.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the end, when the truth is revealed, you will see that Tavistock is behind all of this.

              Mainly because shooting hoaxes aren't violating any laws.
             </p>
             <p>
              the fact is the media was given full privilege to create and distribute completely fabricated news. Here is the document:

             </p>
             <p>
              Pay special attention to page 5 &amp; 6. The "Rule of Construction" means "how to interpret this document".

              Mass shootings starting Dec. 14 2011 to present - 24 (The day after this bill went into effect. See date at bottom of bill and know it takes exactly 7 months before a bill can be enacted.)

             I will research him. I saw his earlier videos. I am still wondering why he publicly announced that there was an anti-Hillary counter-coup, and then nothing really happened. I'm guessing they are waiting for inauguration?

            False flag predictions are quite common, so it's not surprising that a youtuber predicted 'something' would happen and when 'something' did happen, he's claiming it's a false flag. I'm not convinced this incident at Comet Ping Pong is a false flag.

            However, I'm with you on Sandy Hook and 9/11. Especially 9/11, but Sandy Hook is very, very suspicious. Alex Jones stated that he was going to start a Sandy Hook investigation. I think he said this last week.

             They are common, but predicting a false flag event 9 days in advance, saying it would happen before Dec. 14 - that is fucking extraordinary. You can't do that unless you are right.

            <p>
             I don't really know anything about 9/11. I am new to the conspiracy theory business. I am confident that CPP was a false flag. The fact that they turned the street camera, alone, is a big sign.

            This is the kind of shit that makes people laugh at pizzagaters. And that FBIanon stuff seems like LARPing bullshit tbh. He didn't really give any info and was wrong about a few things like Brexit. then talking about UFOs and stuff.

             FBIanon is the number 1 reason why I follow anything about pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Four months in advance, he predicted:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              a massive FBI investigation into the CF
             </li>
             <li>
              the involvement of child trafficking
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Later, on Oct. 17, he predicted that Podesta's emails would contain child trafficking code words.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am a smart, successful man. I cannot explain how FBIanon got so many things right unless he was telling the truth. It is the NUMBER 1 reason why I believe in pizzagate.

              I have no doubt you're a smart man... but anyone seeing all the ridiculous posts on /pol/ and voat declaring they're gearing up for an ambush on comet, or pleading others to do so... all the bullshit phone calls, etc. could have predicted there was going to be some REAL or staged event involving an "alt-right" or "weapons-crazed" vigilante action. You can thank your fellow posters for that noise. If I were CIA and nervous about exposure, that's exactly what I would do.
             </p>
             <p>
              We don't know that there is a massive investigation into the CF but I sure wish more people here were focused on it instead of all the pizza shops, the youtube videos, what google is up to, and half of the distractions posted here.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm assuming the FBI had intel on the emails awhile back so that doesn't prove anything to me about FBIanon... not debunking him/her but given the unknowns about wiki,  I haven't seen anything certain about FBIanon's identity yet.

               The fact that many people predicted it makes it more likely to be a false flag,  not less. But this is the only youtube person I know who got the prediction so correct.

               FBIanon had been right about most everything.  CNN and the wall st. Journal confirmed the CF investigation around October 30.

                I don't think I'd use either of those publications as a source for anything. That doesn't mean there isn't an "investigation" going on but WHO is doing WHAT? I think FBIanon is more apt to know exactly what /pol/ wants to hear, more than they are likely to come onto an internet forum and divulge national security information. Again, that doesn't mean there isn't some sort of important communication going on. My point is, we really don't know facts at this stage - might never. FBI seems to be in an internal battle so we'll have to wait and see how that shakes out. At this stage, it's good to see positive patterns in FBIanon's statements but it's important to always remain suspicious and alert.

                 I agree that we don't know anything for sure right now. FBIanon has been right about a lot of things. I don't know if he is a highly intelligent LARPer. I don't know if he is part of a CIA psy op. I don't know if he is really part of the FBI.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do know that FBIanon was talking about the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking on July 2, four months before pizzagate. How do you get that right? Someone fucking explain that me. How do you fucking get that prediction right, unless you actually know that the CF is involved with child trafficking?

                  The info could still be relevant and not be from FBI - whistleblowers and victims have information (which is why they are targets and would be wise to speak anonymously). I'm just suggesting to not assume it's the FBI.

              Actually FBIanon was right about Brexit, he said it wouldn't go anywhere, and that is exactly the truth, the people may have voted but the elite has not and will not activate arcticle-50
             </p>
             <p>
              Thus my dear I can assert that FBIanon was 100% right
             </p>
             <p>
              That said was he real FBI? I dont' think so, a larper, a very good larper, but let's be honest, anybody that isn't an idiot knows these things.
             </p>
             <p>
              Clinton rotten? yes
DC full of child-fuckers? Yes, for all time
             </p>
             <p>
              Clinton Foundation a crime org? Fuck yes, all the way back to MENA-ARKANSAS
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean anybody that has followed this shit say 40+ years knows what is real, I think some mature larper went on 4chan (july 2016) and fed the nubiles some real info, ... the rest is history

               You could be right. I cannot disprove you.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I am not sure how a non-FBI agent would predict that there was (A) a giant FBI investigation into the CF, (B) the CF was involved in child trafficking, and (C) Podesta's emails are filled with child trafficking code words.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, I could still be wrong. Perhaps pizzagate is a CIA psy op. That could happen. Perhaps it was faked by the CIA to trigger legislation against free speech. That could happen. But, maybe it didn't happen. Maybe the FBIanon was just being an honest, genuine guy. Maybe Podesta's emails include child trafficking code, because he was involved in child trafficking. That's certainly possible. None of us really know, 100%, what to believe right now. We're about to find out. I am certain, however, that this entire thing is not a hallucination. It is either fabricated by the CIA for a psy ops, or it reveals evil and corruption at the highest levels of government. We're about to find out.
              </p>
              <p>
               People knew that the CF was corrupt. Read Partners in Crime (a book I am reading now), and you will see that. But there is no discussion of child trafficking, pedophilia, rape, Satanism, cannibalism, or any of the other stuff. You would have to be INSIDE to predict.
              </p>
              <p>
               So there are I disagree. We should keep an open mind about them being linked until proving otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as I am concerned, I would bet money that the Wikileaks Dead's Man Switch shows Tavistock documents outlining how Sandy Hook was a hoax.
