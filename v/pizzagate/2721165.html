            THE HISTORY OF SYNANON AND CHARLES DEDERICH -

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dederich became an AA favorite speaker and went to an AA meeting every day. During a bout of paranoia where he would not leave his room, he read Emerson’s “Self Reliance” and using it as a bible he quit his job to devout full time to cleaning up other Alcoholics. He existed on a $35 unemployment check and charity from others. He volunteered for a Dr. Keith Ditman LSD experiment and felt he had a cathartic break through and now understood the world and that good and bad were the same.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ditman, one of Cohen's former Brentwood residents, was director of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric
Institute's Alcoholism Research Clinic, where he tested LSD on alcoholics.
A number of prominent figures passed through the clinic. Besides Wilson, Ditman gave LSD to Chuck Dederich, founder of the antidrug commune Synanon, and Alan Watts, the
popularizer of Zen.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1959, as LSD was at its peak of medical acceptance, Cohen's antennae began to pick
up danger signs. One disturbing trend was that researchers were growing lax in controlling
the drug. They began to share LSD in their homes with friends.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cohen was also concerned that LSD research was being mixed with pseudoscience.
Almost from the start, he and Eisner clashed about interpreting their therapy results. "I
think that the material we have been getting makes him uncomfortable," she wrote. "In
fact, he has said as much." By "material" Eisner meant the vivid sense subjects sometimes
had that they were revisiting ancient Egypt, India, or Greece. Huxley, Heard, Hubbard,
Eisner, and other researchers considered these impressions to be actual memories of past
lives-proof of rein~amation.~~
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to reincarnation, pseudoscientists claimed that LSD facilitated extrasensory
perception. Huxley and Heard popularized paranormal psychology and published their
accounts of LSD experiences in journals of psychical research. Eileen Garrett, founder of
the Parapsychology Foundation, experimented with LSD in the 1950s and funded LSD
re~earch.~Werfoundation sponsored conferences on psychedelics and ESP in New York
City in 1958 and in France in 1959. Insofar as ESP, like reincarnation, lacked academic
respectability, Cohen realized that being coupled with ESP would lessen LSD's credibility

             By then, the MK-ULTRA project had supposedly been closed. But this was by no means the end to misguided covert government programs, such as the remote-viewing project at SRI. Another, less-organized military project, inspired the story behind the recent film The Men Who Stare at Goats.

             The U.S. government woke up to the reality of psychotronics when from 1960 to 1965 the American Embassy in Moscow was targeted by a mixture of electromagnetic and microwaves causing a wide range of physical and mental illness among U.S. personel serving there, including the eventual death of the U.S. Ambassador. Dr Stephen Possony, one time Science Advisor to the Department of Defense, now retired, said to me:
'After the death of our ambassador in Moscow, due to contracting leukaemia, and a couple of other employees, it suddenly dawned on us to have a real careful look at what was happening there.'
            </p>
            <p>
             A huge project got underway. Overall it became known as Project PANDORA, and it included a number of parallel projects, such as Projects TUMS, MUTS, and BAZAR, involving the CIA, Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), the State Department, the Navy and the Army.

             I was following the dots from Wasserman to Synanon to LSD research but then your articles (very interesting) to me went on a tangent about ESP/remote viewing staff that owned a lot sold next to CP.  Did I miss something? Do you think that CEDU schools were proving grounds for LSD/marijuana trials on troubled youth?

              The LSD research then led to BG Rapmund Garrisson who owned a property that is connected to Burning Tree LLC.  We were looking at the properties next to CPP a while back.  It's just more information about how that whole block in Connecticut Avenue is Deep State.  Any normie who still thinks Alefantis is 'just' a pizza guy needs their heads examined.  I also know a number of media people are looking at these forums for information so I like linking back to CPP whenever I can to make the MSM task of 'debunking' us ever more difficult.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, this information that these CIA spooks are linked to some of the more esoteric military projects is useful (I think) in terms of their particular interest in children.

               I've always wondered why Michael Aquino and the Presidio Day Care scandal aren't mentioned much here. For those who don't know, Aquino was a Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Army, he wrote a paper on mind control called "MIND WAR," and he also founded a military Satanic order called the "Temple of Set." He had ties to an on-base Daycare center in Presido, CA, and this same Daycare was shut down by the Army after pedo allegations began to surface.

             <p>
              The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (“Petitioner”), acting through Bar Counsel and pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-751(a),1 filed a petition for disciplinary or remedial action against Respondent, Angela Therese Floyd, on August 30, 2006, in which Bar Counsel alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(c) (Misconduct) 2 when, during an employment application process for a legal position, in order to secure a higher salary, she acted intentionally to deceive the Federal Trade Commission (“Commission”) into believing that she and her husband had a “purely” employer-employee relationship.

             Interestingly, Iverson has recently been in the news about his own client Tighe Barry :

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Frederick Iverson, an attorney representing Tighe Barry, argued that the government “didn’t do their job” in proving their case, and that the defendants created a “spectacle” but not a disruption. The government couldn’t prove that the defendants intended to disrupt the proceedings, he said, and their arguments were all about confusing the jury.

The Project, and its precursors and sister projects, went by various code names—GONDOLA WISH, GRILL FLAME, CENTER LANE, SUN STREAK, SCANATE—until 1991 when they were consolidated and rechristened as "Stargate Project".

              I got a pretty crazy connection between The Clintons, John Podesta, Scalia, and David Miscavige. The leader of Church of Scientology. They use the same set of lawyers and worked on the Scalia cover up and replacement. The church of Scientology was supposed to be investigated by FBI for human trafficking but nothing ever happened with the case and seemed to squashed with no explanation ever about it.

              Fort Detrick /ˈdiːtrɪk/ is a United States Army Medical Command installation located in Frederick, Maryland. Historically, Fort Detrick was the center of the U.S. biological weapons program from 1943 to 1969. Since the discontinuation of that program, it has hosted most elements of the United States biological defense program.

              Sept. 11-12, 2001 - Nearly a month before the first reported outbreak, White House officials start taking the powerful antibiotic Cipro to treat anthrax. By the end of the year it will be known that the Ames strain of anthrax used in the attacks against Sens. Leahy and Daschle was produced by CIA programs coordinated through Fort Detrick, the Batelle Memorial Institute and the Dugway Proving Ground.

             Underage sex by the rabbis equals mind control/submission at an early age. Wonder if any of the child brides ever rose up and poisoned their rabbi husbands in retaliation.

             Re: the Rosenthal interview, thanks for the info, interesting reading. White should have kept the tapes to give substantiation to the interview.

              Its funny how when confronted with this stuff the comeback is usually a cherry picking diatribe of then if all else fails the antisemite go to is busted out. I say this knowing full well that Christians have their 2.0 to fall back on which doesnt seem to be the case with the other Abrahamic religions.Every religion has that you are cherry picking speech to go with its unsavory scripture though dont they?

              Its hard to equate abuse of anyone especially children as following GOD though isnt it?

              I agree, and you're welcome. The tapes were probably destroyed so that the comments couldn't be substantiated, and they could easily dismiss the quote. It's blatantly obvious by their practices that they "worship Lucifer" though.
