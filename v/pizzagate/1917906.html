<p>This fits directly into the theory a tectonic re-alignment is happening vis a vis the players currently on stage in this shit show.

<p>This entire dysfunctional relationship going on between Anglo-America, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the <s>Muslim Brotherhood</s> Qatar was tenuous at best. That marriage was never going to work. We all saw from that day they came back from the honeymoon 8 years ago. What\'s that statistic about most marriages fall apart at around 7 years? This is no different.

           <p>
            After this cluster fuck comes down the very words RFID chip and the entire concept will be stricken from human memory. The New World Order is ending. It ain't coming back. Deplorables outnumber the Illuminati 99 to 1. The only RFID chip that has a chance of being used in the future will be to tag Illuminists as they are hunted for sport on giant game reserves.

            Now the other two thumping chests against Qatar are Egypt, UAE and Bahrain. Now, three more countries, interesting because Hillary transferred 1.8 billion to Qatar! The countries complain they support terrorism. It appears we are funding it for them. Why? They have so much money of their own!

           <p>
            No. If Saudi Arabia wanted to start WW 3 then go to the other side of the Persian Gulf and kick sand in Iran's face.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm pretty sure this is exactly what it looks like. The New World Order is dying. It didn't work. Saudi Arabia is just trying to get on the right side of History as soon as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            So is Israel. Meanwhile Trump is dragging a severely stoned Anglo-America out of its Cadillac Escalade where it had succumbed to the effects of a speed ball after shooting up in the parking lot at Stop&amp;Shop where it had just been purchased. The NARCAN® Nasal Spray is on tap and will be hitting the blood stream directly.

             The big-picture frame says you are a deceptive shill. You are a Hecatoncharis (Demon with a 100 faces). I'm not going to explain.

              Oh that's great. You're just going to be vindictive as fuck and just not tell me why you think I'm a "deceptive shill".
             </p>
             <p>
              Art first up you didn't need the "deceptive" on shill, it's assumed already. Second thanks for the info on Hecatoncharis I never knew that and I'll have some fun on Wikipedia later tonight. I love being divorced.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally Art a little suggestion when playing with others if you play judge, jury and executioner you not me is going to seem like a dick and a cunt.

              If you feel like letting me know why I'm a shill then feel free. Otherwise go read through my submissions and tell me which has proven to you that I'm a shill.

             I agree. I think the different factions of the Cabal are breaking apart, some are desperately hanging on and some are giving up. There is a purge of darkness taking place on the world stage, and things will look confusing until the dust settles.

              your second sentence has truth. Your first is tosh. Islamists are middle ages. If they wanted our standard of living they would learn our language and the values that enable them to participate in our 1st world western economies. They are by and large wilfully not integrating, and they would rather see Europe converted to a 3rd world Islamic state than a 1st world western state that they partake of

               You don't know shit.  In the actual middle ages they had the most advanced cities and much higher standard of living that us.  Soon they will outbreed us decisively. I too would rather see Europe as a third world Islamic state than the embarrassing faggotry Europe currently is as a whole.  Their biggest cultural events are Eurovision song contest and fucking soccer.  Of course they won't integrate to that crap!

               They never would have been allowed in if we had a male only electorate. Now even Saudi Arabia lets women vote, hopefully that's to relieve international pressure and those ballots aren't counted.

                Ok. So let me get this straight. You are participating in an anti-paedophilia website, and you are actively endorsing the rise of Islam in Europe. Islam - whose prohet mohammad married a 6 year old and had the 'restraint' to wait until she was 9 to fuck her. And beat her. And if there's any doubt his 'values' haven't been carried forth to the 21st century, watch some youtubes of Rotherham - which is only the most outrageous case amongst dozens of UK towns - where the pakistani community (who take the quran literally in its advice that menstruation age is acceptable for sexual intercourse) PACKRAPED 1400 british girls.  Yes 1400 in one town
               </p>
               <p>
                So dont you EVER EVER limp onto this website again and talk up Islam you fucking paedophile sympathising fuckwit asshole
               </p>
               <p>
                You have one chance to explain or retract or I will make an entire thread dedicated to your support of paedophilia

                  i didnt say anything against arabs or any race. Im married to an arabic woman, i have a half arabic son.  This is why you lefties are such intellectual retards, you dont even know how to distinguish criticism of an ideology from race. Which mean no, i didnt slander 1.6 billion people, I slandered the ideology held by them

                   LOL! You slandered every man in history before 1920 or so, that's what I'm trying to make you understand. Get some fucking perspective YOU MORON. You're the self righteous lefty if anyone is.  Do you CONDEMN and DISAVOW their awful behavior that you've heard from Jew media??  Like how they throw gays off buildings, cuz that happened one time in ISIS occupied Iraq, supported by israel.

                    dickhead, homosexuality remains punishable by death in 11 islamic countries. 99% islamic Chechnya just opened CONCENTRATION CAMPS for gays this year. Indonesia just publically flogged gays for the first time  - Islam is becoming LESS HUMANIST every year - burquas were almost unheard of in afghanistan in the 1950's

                     Adultery is still a punishable crime in the west, but like homosexuality in the ME, RARELY ACTUALLY  PROSECUTED CUZ ITS SECRET YOU RETARD.  AND YOU SAY I SWALLOW MEDIA MYTHS?

                        Ah, so because "slut culture" is being pushed on their children, it's their fault that they turn out that way? And its okay for them to fall victim to Muzzie pervs? Gotcha.

                         Are you capable of a higher level of thought that considers CONSEQUENCES AS PARAMOUNT.  If i get lost in a bad neighborhood and get robbed, is that my fault? Of course it is.  You probably let your daughters hitchike.  But then this is darwinism, so some percentage of us are total dipshits like you whose children wont continue their genes.

                           OMG what muslims and i realize is that's USELESS MORALIZING AND ITS FUCKIN GAY. Tangible consequences and common sense is what matters. Everything else is IDEOLOGY which is BULLSHIT.

                           No animal puts itself at risk needlessly like we do.  Some dude the other day got a crucifix tattoo, went swimming and got a flesh eating bacteria and died.  Guess what, Islam prohibits tattoos also, because theyre fucking frivolous and an affront to gods creation

                            "Useless moralizing" as in realizing that people are in control of their own actions? No one MAKES a Muslim cleric teach hate speech. No one MAKES a person become a Jihadi. They make these choices on their own. Muslims CHOOSE to view RAPE as being OKAY, just like YOU.

             Besides the fact I'm a Heterosexual Christian I know it took a lot for you to keep it respectful and for that I thank you.
