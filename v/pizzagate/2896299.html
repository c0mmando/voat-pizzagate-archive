<p>Police raided two Detroit cemeteries Wednesday, removing dozens of infant and fetal remains that allegedly were improperly handled by Perry Funeral Home.</p>
<p>Detroit Police and Michigan State Police officers raided Gethsemane Cemetery in Detroit and Knollwood Cemetery in Canton Township. Inspectors with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulation also were present.</p>
<p>&quot;This was prompted by a tip, which said between 100 + fetuses had been mishandled and were stored in crypts,&quot; Detroit police Chief James Craig said. &quot;The remains we removed were all handled by Perry. This is part of the funeral home criminal investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Craig said officers studied sets of remains from Gethsemane, and  from Knollwood, adding there was improper or missing paperwork filed for 27 sets of infant and fetal remains from Knollwood, and 17 from Gethsemane.</p>
<p>&quot;The remains that were removed were found to be in violation, based on documentation that had discrepancies,&quot; Craig said. Those remains were taken to a facility in Flint. Craig said he couldn\'t elaborate because the investigation is ongoing. </p>
<p>Some of the remains in the crypts had been cremated, Craig said during a press briefing Thursday at police headquarters. 
Craig said LARA told his investigators about the tip, which alleged that more than 100 fetuses were improperly stored at Gethsemane, where he said police executed a search warrant. He characterized the Knollwood action as &quot;an inspection,&quot; adding officers did not execute a search warrant there.</p>
<p>Craig said the managers of both cemeteries were cooperative. &quot;At this point, there\'s no allegation that the cemeteries did anything wrong, but we\'re still active in our investigation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>LARA spokesman Jason Moon said Thursday in a written statement: &quot;Based on information gathered during the course of LARA’s investigation into Perry Funeral Home in Detroit, state regulators conducted an onsite inspection of Knollwood Cemetery in Canton last night. We are currently exploring possible regulatory actions against the facility and have an open investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Also as part of the Perry investigation, LARA notified Detroit Police regarding possible issues at Gethsemane Cemetery in Detroit,&quot; Moon said. &quot;Gethsemane is a municipal cemetery owned by the City of Detroit and LARA has no regulatory oversight of the establishment. LARA regulators did assist Detroit Police yesterday in their inspection of the cemetery.&quot;
Wednesday\'s raids were part of a months-long probe into the alleged mishandling of remains by Perry and Cantrell funeral homes, both of Detroit. A lawsuit that prompted police to look into Perry was certified last month as a class action, after plaintiffs\' attorneys claimed as many as 200 infant or fetal remains were improperly handled.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also alleges mishandling of remains by Knollwood, Wayne State University and the Detroit Medical Center\'s Harper-Hutzel Hospital, among others. Spokespersons for the defendants insist they\'ve done nothing wrong.
Detroit police and LARA on Oct. 19 raided Perry\'s facility on Trumbull in Detroit, and removed 63 infant and fetal remains, including 36 that were stored in an unrefrigerated box. LARA also suspended Perry\'s mortuary license and the license of director Gary Deak.
Cantrell Funeral Home on Mack Avenue in Detroit is also under investigation after investigators found the remains of 10 fetuses and an infant hidden in a ceiling tile. The discovery was prompted by a letter alleging improper handling of remains and fraud.</p>
<p>Investigators removed hundreds of other remains from Cantrell. Funeral services were held for the mostly unclaimed remains, including an All Saint\'s Day service for 300 remains; and military honors given to 17 veterans whose remains were removed from Cantrell.</p>

            So let me make sure I understand this; someone working at the cemetery left the bodies of 100 babies in a crawlspace and hidden in the ceiling expecting to return for them? What was the person's purpose? I don't get it. Makes much more sense to me that after the desired organs were harvested someone didn't care what happened to the remains. Shame. There is no way 100 bodies of any size could be left out of refrigeration without decaying and smelling very foul

            The lawyer for the owner of the funeral home has issued a statement saying that the hospital gave the foetuses to the funeral home. The funeral home contacted the parents of the foetuses but got not response so they claim they had no authority to bury the foetuses.  They're saying that a lot of the foetuses were to be sent for 'medical experiments' but then why was the funeral home holding on to them?

               The Spanish Cobras is a primarily, but not exclusively, Latino gang started in Humboldt Park in Chicago during the early 1960s.[clarification needed] The Cobras are considered the second-largest Latino gang on the north and northwest side, with the Maniac Latin Disciples being the first.[citation needed] The Cobras are part of the Folk Nation;[1] symbols include the cobra, raised diamond, and the initials "SC";[2] and colors are black and green.
              </p>
              <p>
               Within Chicago, the neighborhoods with the strongest Cobra presence are Humboldt Park, Hermosa, Logan Square and Kelvyn Park. They are also found in Cicero, and have a small presence in the McKinley Park area on the south side.[citation needed] They are also known to operate in other parts of Illinois, as well as Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha in Wisconsin, and Detroit and are quite large in Flint, Michigan.[3]

               An absolutely disturbing report coming out of Michigan that a head of a child modeling agency in Michigan has been indicted for multiple charges including being involved in a conspiracy responsible for child sex trafficking and child pornography, that’s also tied to a powerful street gang.
              </p>
              <p>
               Federal Agents began investigating the modeling agency, based out of Livonia, where authorities believed that the agency was directly tied to the sex trafficking of minors out of Shiawassee County.
              </p>
              <p>
               Instinct Entertainment, LLC., and their Chief Executive Director Ryan Ulman was brought before a United States District Court in Detroit, Michigan on January 5th on a single count of receiving child pornography following an investigation launched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               The case was kept close to the chests of Federal Prosecutors, where its believed Ulman is set to enter into a plea deal to help take down the other members of the child sex trafficking operation.
              </p>
              <p>
               This case involved a gang in Michigan known as the Spanish Cobras, who are based out of Flint, in which the FBI says are directly tied into the sexual trafficking of the minor children.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                sexual trafficking of the minor children
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite my best efforts to research the Spanish Cobras gang, the most information I could find through Wikipedia was that the group originated as a gang in Chicago in the 1960s, based out of Humboldt Park.
              </p>
              <p>
               It appears however as if the gang has branched outward in recent decades, and now has involved itself into the heart of Michigan.

                Found this on Spanish Cobras even though it says the same as Wiki. If you wonder about names of gangs you will find it on here. Really blows the mind knowing how many gangs there really are.

                   I was surprised to find out it was about a third or more Mexican(legal, illegal?) I did get to meet some good people, just like any town, but there is an evil that is visible and present to those who come from purer places. I would describe it as a criminal element attitude that people are just used to, and would guess that it is just an expansion of the Chicago culture. It's kind of like when I was in NYC, and was going to park the car. My Cousin said you can't just park there. Why not? They will steal the car in seconds. Broad daylight, with thousands of people watching in what looked like an affluent shopping area.Looks can be real deceiving in a place like Racine. I was there for two years, and saw some pretty strange stuff.

                    So what did you see that was strange while you lived there?  I understand what you are saying about the criminal element. The people that live in those type of cities are just conditioned to it. It's just a normal day to them.

                   They ignore it as it grows by leaps and bounds.  Thousands of MS 13 and a multitude of others.  People go about their daily lives and they ignore it.  We are in deep trouble.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Cobras were called the "Hobras" by other gangs because of their link to prostitution. In the 90's girls as young as 12 were bring prostituted by gangs on S Sagiinaw as well as Atherton and Dort area.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All I'm going to say for the moment is, over the last few years, one by one the leadership of the Spanish cobras who were imprisoned in 2003 on the Rico case, they've been getting released. They don't just sell heroin and crack, they KIDNAP WOMEN AMD LITTLE GIRLS AND PASS THEM AROUND THE GANG AND SELL THEIR BODIES AS SEX SLAVES. Some of their little minion bitches in the gang have already been arrested on kidnapping, rape, child porn, not just here but in Detroit too, and if you think that activity isn't on the rise with their "leaders" out of fuckin prison, you might want to do some fact checking. Watch your back. If you see green/black diamonds, cobra love, te amore mi vida loca, tagged on buildings etc, get the vulgar language away from there and watch your goddamn back on the way out. If you live in one of these areas, man, ARM YOURSELF.

                 Yes, it's not pretty. ARM YOURSELF says it all. They have modeled themselves after the MS 13 who are rumored to have killed that bus of college kids in Mexico a few years ago.  Even their teeth turned to powder they were so burned.  MS 13 I believe was responsible that did the hit on Seth Rich.  They worked in the SEIU in DC.  These scumbags don't fool around.  They are really evil, what in the world possess them to do this?  There is no hope for Our Children anymore.  This is how they achieve greatness.

                (Jacob Yrles, Steven Washburn, Terry Taylor, and Anthony Bunn) btw these guys don't look Hispanic, they are all mulatto or white.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 they were part of the Insane Spanish Cobra gang and admitted to raping a 13-year-old girl in 2014 as part of her initiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to testimony from the girl, the sexual assault and tattooing took place over two days in the summer of 2014 in a home on Franklin Street.
                </p>
                <p>
                 the victim testified she turned down the group's offer to join the Insane Spanish Cobras, which involved "rolling the dice" -- a gang initiation method that requires the recruit to have sex with the number of gang members rolled on a die.
[Omitting actual assault because it is horrible and triggering]
                </p>
                <p>
                 The next day, the four took the girl to Yrles' bedroom, where they began to tattoo her hips -- on the left, a gang name she said they assigned to her, and on the right, the beginning of a three-point diamond Cobra insignia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On her back, she said they drew two more large gang-related tattoos.

                 DETROIT - The gates are closed, but the story isn't over after a Detroit-owned cemetery was damaged by flooding.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A concerned loved one snapped photos of the cemetery that family members find heartbreaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Denai Croff's loved ones are buried in Gethsemane Cemetery, and she said she was able to get inside Monday morning when the gates were left unlocked.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The cemetery is owned by the city of Detroit and was mapped out more than a century ago in a known floodplain.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Due to the current flooding, the city obtained emergency purchasing approval to allow ST Enterprises to begin working on the cemetery immediately.

                 It isn't the first time it has happened...maybe this bad, but it isn't the first time.  In 1986 we couldn't go to the plot when my Grandmother was buried because it was underwater.  There were caskets in the chapel because they couldn't bury them.  That was 30 years ago this week.  Let's hope they get it together because this is upsetting for the families involved.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                </p>
                <p>
                 a known flood plan?  Now after 30 years its happening again.  This isn't a Cemetery it's a Mud Hole.

             That's exactly what came to mind for me. Possibly there is not only a religious reason for naming it Gethsemane.  How morbid that they named it so and then there are connections to fetuses.  There are no coincidences.

              "Black" YouTube is pretty woke about this.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've found some scientific studies indicating the superior "longevity" of organs with higher melanin content
             </p>
             <p>
              (Melanin isn't just skin deep, there are many different types with different biological properties that bio research needs a steady supply of organs, blood, tissues to study and extract)

                  I've seen all of these, but I'm looking for medical/scientific literature showing these have been medically/scientifically tested.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've found studies from 1920s/30s where they describe an extraction process of melanin from a black dude and a polynesian dude, and they note different molecular makeups. (No mention is given to the source of the flesh)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Other studies discuss different electrochemical natures of things like neuromelanin vs epidermal melanin.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've also seen reports discussing the future of bio computing will rely on melanin tattoos as it is a semiconductor
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Do you have anything like that? Not denying the legitimacy of it, I just want the kind of citations that aren't blog posts or wikipedia

               Wonder if there are any black people tweeting about this, they did with the death of Kenneka Jenkins who went missing and plenty of them tweeted about missing organs.  I would think they would be really upset about this as well.  Especially in Detroit, same as Chicago.  I am not on twitter but I can check.
