            Its hard to tell when a Narcissist is lying because they are always lying to themselves - pathological liars.

            Next time he puts himself in this type of situation, someone needs to ask a single question. Asking ABOUT Pizzagate gives him room to use the "debunk" comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             All he needs to be asked:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             John, what is a pizza related map?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That's all. Don't ask anything else. Just let him explain what that means and we will take it from there. Maybe John can actually debunk this whole thing himself.

            It is abundantly clear due to his voice inflection and body language that he is highly agitated by the question. His energy certainly says hes lying but itnis hard to tell without being able to see his eyes. You'd think he would be able to lie more effectively being a career politician. Perhaps all the fear of the chase finally catching up to him is throwing him off his game.

             Not to be "that" person, but what if his agitation is caused by the fact that from his vantage-point, PG actually is fake?
What IF it is?
            </p>
            <p>
             Taken logically, if anyone here was being falsely accused of something, that just wouldn't go away and it was destroying our lives, might that look like agitation and lying as well if people keep tormeting you about it?
            </p>
            <p>
             What if all that is abundantly clear is that he is obviously distressed by accusations that are untrue and ridiculous to him?
            </p>
            <p>
             What if it isn't lying, but exasperation and frustration?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not implying anything one way or the other, but I know that with JP, there are so-called facts that are not facts at all.

              You just need to shut the fuck up and running your mouth on this forum is what you need to do.  We've spent way too long in this process for your diarrhea mouth about fuckwads 'innocence'.  Who do you think you are coming in here like this?  Have you not read ANY of our material?  Why do you think your subtle passive comments will have ANY impact at all  on an independent investigation that's been going on for over a year now? 
To me it looks and sounds like a giant sirly slap in the face,  get the fuck out of here.

               Can you answer the question though:
              </p>
              <p>
               The question was:
              </p>
              <p>
               What part of the 14 and the fish on his hands wasn't simply a reference to this:
               <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">
                http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Which was what he was posting about on Twitter for quite some while before someone took that picture and blew it up as a meme.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't be lazy.
              </p>
              <p>
               Read his old tweets.
              </p>
              <p>
               When you get to the part that he was tweeting frequently about environmental matters and see that he painted the fish and the 14 as a reference to this:
               <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">
                http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/
               </a>
               -- then maybe you will slow down.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is your actual
               <em>
                evidence
               </em>
               against JP?
              </p>
              <p>
               Evidence of PG in general is not evidence specifically against JP.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lay it out.
              </p>
              <p>
               What proves to you that JP is as many assume he is.
              </p>
              <p>
               I raise this because when I raised just one fact that wasn't actually a fact, rather than my friends here addressing it, they did as you did and attacked me.
              </p>
              <p>
               Are we here for thr truth or for a circle-jerk?

                NOT my website and that photo is one of the most spurious and circumstantial photographs out of this entire investigation and one that I have never had the wherewithal, evidence or desire to comment or even speculate on. Something tells me you GCHQ fuckers like to focus on these little details repeatedly to set up your cute counter-memes in the MSM. Flog off you flagellate bundle of sticks.

                Actual evidence?  Everything can be entered as evidence if it is substantiated as a valid source.  Based on what has been diagrammed out over the last year plus, there is well beyond substantial evidence for any reasonable judge to issue warrants for a further dig.  The pizza code by itself, combined with associations at CPP and with JA draw a clear line.  A savvy detective/prosecutor team could make a compelling enough case based on historical reference that Podesta may even be a serial killer.  But we don't live in that world.

                Taking one person out of the equation still leaves all of the other mess to explain. Pedogate is real. You can make it all about one guy but the number of players is enormous and the problems are completely systemic. I applaud you for asking others to think critically, but this seems like a coordinated effort to steer people away from Podesta.

                 It is not a coordinated effort to do anything other than question that one fact.
If by questioning that one fact, it casts the entirety of PG into doubt for you, then perhaps it should!
                </p>
                <p>
                 But, that was
                 <em>
                  not
                 </em>
                 the intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The intent was to make it plain that assertions do not make facts.
Wild speculations do not makes facts.
Truth is not just someone's Youtube channel fairy-tale.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The truth has to have more behind it than what someone simply claims.

                 --
                </p>
                <p>
                 What led to my post?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I watched the interview with JP that was just posted. The comments were all pretty lined up with "Look, he's lying. See how nervous he is. See you can tell he is guilty."
                </p>
                <p>
                 And I got to thinking:
                </p>
                <p>
                 What would an INNOCENT person look like under the situation?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Well, the guy's life has been pretty destroyed over PG, Just go to his Twitter and verify that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 True of NOT true, he has sufferered enormously with these "allegations".
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, would an innocent person be angry, nervous, agitated and defensive potentially?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sure would.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Does that make him innocent?
No.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But ASSUMING he is guilty because he is UPSET about this, doesn't make him guilty!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Who WOULDN"T be upset? The guy has been tarred and feathered.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What got ME upset, is that I pretty much concluded that the 14 and fish photo narrative was total B.S. and when I tried to alert people of that, I was tarred and feathered myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, it did not invalidate may of the questions and concerns I have surrounding the totality of PG, it did make me wonder if I'd been a witness to something that was unsavory and perhaps I'd been trolled into beleiving some things that may not be as clear as they were represented to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can find no excuse for the Insta accounts and the bands and creepy as fuck shit out there. Something is at the very best vile here, but there are also "so-called" facts that have been used to create wild fairy tales and the conflation of both facts and fairy tales needs attentions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We must be able to separate facts and fairy-tales.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Though I admit that is HARD to do, it simply must be attempted, else we get a predetermined result and end up with a witch-hunt in an internet kangaroo court. That is not a place I want my soul to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also do not want my soul to overlook truth's that require my attention for love's purposes to be served.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I am not here to
                 <strong>
                  <em>

                </p>
                <p>
                 I am here to try and help

                 guilt or innocence and that is a very different posture than defending facts that are often much too easily explained and too thin to be used as a weapon.

                 Talk about a diversion.
Apparently, questioning one fact is tantamount to denying all of PG?

                 That's pretty sad.

                <p>
                 I made a specific post.
You should note all of the strategies used to attack what I had to say.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are all pretty manipulative, such as yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If the strength of your belief can be rattled so easily by my posing a question about one fact, then it ought concern you.
Stick with this:
                 <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">
                  http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Was the 14 and the Fish something more nefarious or was it merely a reference to the U.N's 14th climate sustainability goal AS it was directly purported to be, on JP's orignal tweet, whererin the pic appeared?
                </p>
                <p>
                 My concern -- is that it may simply have been what it was purported to be.
A Tweet to promote the agenda of protecting the ocean's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Amazing the hornet's nest I stirred up over a fairly benign question.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I addressed this one fact, because it has been used SO frequently to harangue the guy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you look at all of the other facts in the thread you posted. exactly how many of them have to do with JP?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Can we be real for a minute?
                </p>
                <p>
                 How good to you think your Cell Phone service would be in your under-ground, subterranean, "Torture Chamber".
                </p>
                <p>
                 Oh wait, hold on just a moment. I just cut off your left left, but hold on, I have a call to make.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "Oh yes, I'm still in the torture chamber."
                </p>
                <p>
                 That is patently ridiculous.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is JUST A PHRASE to mean "Yeah, still under some stress here, or things still shitty, or still in the grind or blah, blah, blah."
                </p>
                <p>
                 To take that LITERALLY is easy to do, but what are the odds that someone IN a torture chamber is going to be sending that message out from within the torture chamber.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is stuff like that that makes some of this just nutty to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 OTHER stuff does NOT appear so nutty. Artwork, bands, insta's, etc, but some of this IS beyond ludicrous.
