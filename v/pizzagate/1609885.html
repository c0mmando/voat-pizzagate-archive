As some of you may know this ritual child abuse and cultish behavior has been going on for a long time, but the &quot;in your face&quot; behavior started in the early 90\'s after a case called &quot;The Finders&quot; was swept under the rug ([<a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml">http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml)</a>).  Apparently this case blew the lid off programs run by the CIA..Monarch and MKUltra which are mind control programs that many abuse victims speak off (<a href="http://conspiracy.wikia.com/wiki/Monarch_Mind_Control">http://conspiracy.wikia.com/wiki/Monarch_Mind_Control)</a>), further, it indicated that children, in particular orphans were being abducted and somehow used by the CIA (heavy speculation that orphans were sacrificed...).</p>
<p>This leads us to numerous situations where the Clintons, either directly or thru their Foundation, have been all to eager to rush into war torn or disaster ravaged areas...it sounds to heinous to believe...but to harvest orphans.  Certainly the Silsby case in Haiti is just one example (<a href="http://truthfeed.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-tied-to-convicted-child-trafficker-laura-silsby-media-silent/34146/">http://truthfeed.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-tied-to-convicted-child-trafficker-laura-silsby-media-silent/34146/)</a>).  And how did they do this?  Move these children around?  By using a government contractor of course!  Check out this Wiki article on DynaCorp..BUT..go all the way to the end and check &quot;controversies&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DynCorp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DynCorp)</a>).</p>
<p>And to what end?  What is the motive of these people?  Well..to control us for darn sure..but gets weird here.  Who was Hillary\'s main financial backer, who also backed Obama, Bush, McCain, Graham, and many other globalist?  None other than George Soros.  You might watch George\'s interview with 60 minutes where he freely admits to being a nazi (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSyczwuTQfo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSyczwuTQfo)</a>).  George\'s best buddy, who he made billions with in the 90\'s is a gent named Joe Lewis.  Joe Lewis just bought Hitlers (alleged) estate in Bariloche, AR (hmm..was easy to site several months ago..now all references gone except spanish versions did find this version <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5860250/hitlers-secret-argentine-sanctuary-is-for-sale">http://gizmodo.com/5860250/hitlers-secret-argentine-sanctuary-is-for-sale)</a>).  Now..what up with Bariloche AR??  Obama (<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/gallery/2016/03/obama-spring-break-bariloche-000625?slide=0">http://www.politico.com/magazine/gallery/2016/03/obama-spring-break-bariloche-000625?slide=0)</a>) further it is a stopping point for big wigs Antarctic adventures which there have been a slew of in 2016.  So..back to pizza gate..where is the Soros tie in?  Turns out George\'s son is potentially good buddies with none other than Comet ping pong\'s own Alfantes (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1593452/7771582">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1593452/7771582)</a>).</p>
<p>It just gets weirder and weirder but these folks are all 1) tied together in their hideous crimes 2) because what they have done is so bad, none can out the others so there is high trust 3) they all take orders from above government..we have found illuminati references which lead to families like the Rothchilds and the Rockerfeller\'s and have also found CIA/MI6/Business management 4) they are all tied either directly or indirectly with old nazi ideas 5) they are all tied either directly or indirectly to IGFarben companies including Monsanto, Bayer, BASF, and subs 6) we have been living in a deeply controlled environment and these folks have tried to influence our spiritual development and have basically abused us 7) they use and abuse others for their own personal gain..this includes children, taking slaves, destroying people, certainly killing people 8) the end game appears to be to create a new world order or one world government where they were in charge..and it appears this WILL NOT happen now...</p>
<p>The TRUTH will be brutal..and if fully exposed will impact somewhere between 10% and 25% of our government..probably at the local, state, and federal levels...but this TRUTH needs to be told..and I, for one, am certainly capable of handling it!</p>',

            "the end game appears to be to create a new world order or one world government where they were in charge..and it appears this WILL NOT happen now..." is a YUUGE sigh of relief, but we can never stop watching &amp; fighting them back, they're not going to give up EVER. This is a spiritual war &amp; it's been going on for the better part of history. Satan &amp; his minions work tirelessly, so we will always have our work cut out for us. We can never take freedom &amp; democracy for granted, or leave it in the hands of government.

            I will break it down. Absolute Power Corupts Absolutely!
Soros is the biggest puppet master alive right now yes that seems true. He has many puppets dancing for him right now. Many people do not understand what is in his veins, what is in all their veins. They have committed atrocities as we are discovering. They thought as Hitler did they could create or maintain a separate elite bloodline. Maybe grow parts, live forever, have multiple organ transplants, find the fountain of youth. The have made sacrifice to have this and then sacrifice to this power but it is not a game. The biggest puppet master is playing all of them. They will not outlive Judgement.

               Also amazing, how so many remain clueless. I'm trying so hard, to carefully redpill my Christian friends without freaking them out. Starting with the ones who cheerlead for unchecked refugee immigration and open borders, in the name of "love" and "compassion."

               It's a collective organization/oligarchy with oligarchs and everyone has a role to play.  He's definitely at the top and sits at the table.  The theory rolling out now is that Kissinger has been sitting at the head of that table since '74.

               I think we are going to find out some interesting facts about The Who "Jew" blame game. The Khazar region is where many of the illuminati bloodline originate. Soros, Rothschild &amp;others. The were found through DNA testing to be Ashkenazi Jews. These are not the ethnic Jews I believe they are 13th tribe.

            Great work OP, but I think Soros is also a front man.  If you look at recent LIBOR, Gold manipulations etc where low level traders had access, can you imagine access those fronting Soros had to rig all kinds of markets, and hide behind Soros.   No spotlight, no scrutiny and lots of money and power.   I think he was choosen because he is a thug with no morals, sort of Kissenger clone except in finance.
