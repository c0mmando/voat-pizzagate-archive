TripAdvisor submission:  Title: Caution ... RECENT NEWS COVERAGE - Kaliko Beach Club
Review:  Source: Jamaican Observer (Feb 6, 2017) &quot;Haiti police rescue dozens, arrest 12 in human trafficking ring -  Officials said the arrests took place Sunday at a tourist resort outside the capital Port-au-Prince after a three month investigation. &quot;We found 33 girls, 20 of them minors, piled together in one room,&quot; Danton Leger, government commissioner for Port-au-Prince, told local radio. &quot;In another room there were 12 people — four women and eight men — with what appeared to be marijuana and cocaine,&quot; Leger said. The raid took place at the Kaliko Beach Club, some 60 kilometres (37 miles) outside the capital.&quot; <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Haiti-police-arrest-dozens--arrest-12-in-human-trafficking-ring">http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Haiti-police-arrest-dozens--arrest-12-in-human-trafficking-ring</a>
Source Haita Sentinel (Feb 8, 2017) &quot;Haitian authorities say the proprietor of the Kaliko Beach Club hotel is being uncooperative, defiant and boastful even. And although 18 arrests were made on Sunday during the police operation, as of Monday evening only, nine, all Haitian nationals, involved in the child-trafficking ring were still in police custody.  The capital city’s chief prosecutor, Government Commissioner Jean Danton Leger, said the hotel owner is being defiant, “la p ouvri ko l“, in essence raising his voice with a certain “frekansite” or sass.&quot; <a href="http://sentinel.ht/2017/02/08/defiant-kaliko-beach-uncooperative-child-trafficking-investigation/">http://sentinel.ht/2017/02/08/defiant-kaliko-beach-uncooperative-child-trafficking-investigation/</a></p>
<p><strong>#2 Roosevelt Inn, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>
TripAdvisor submission:  Title: Definitely Don\'t Stay on this Motel
Per CBSNews - March 12, 2017 - &quot;Lawyers in Pennsylvania say their client was sexually exploited at a motel for years, alleging the teen girl was a victim of human trafficking who was forced to have sex with more than 1,000 men. “This child was forced into sex slavery, paid to do things with men double, triple, quadruple her age,” attorney Nadeem Bezar told reporters. The teen’s lawyers are using Pennsylvania’s human trafficking law to sue the motel where they say their client was sexually exploited, marking the first civil suit under the law since it was enacted in 2014, CBS Philadelphia reports. Kline and two lawyers from the Kline &amp; Specter law firm, Nadeem A. Bezar and Emily B. Marks, announced the filing of the lawsuit on behalf of a 17-year-old girl, identified as “M.B.,” who in 2013, at age 14, was &quot;sold into sexual slavery at the Roosevelt Motel.” The Inquirer reports the motel is well-known to Philadelphia prosecutors as “the epicenter of human trafficking” in the city. An assistant district attorney, Erin O’Brien, told the Inquirer that Patel had cooperated with police in previous investigations, but said “almost every trafficking investigation we have, we see the victim is at Roosevelt Inn.” “You have to be blind, deaf and dumb not to know that 100 men are showing up over a period of a couple days,” says Tom Kline, an attorney representing the girl.&quot; Source: <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philadelphia-teen-says-she-was-forced-to-have-sex-with-1000-men-over-2-years/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philadelphia-teen-says-she-was-forced-to-have-sex-with-1000-men-over-2-years/</a> </p>

            Of course they would delete it. It impacts their business negatively. Plus it's not a review. (It IS a review section, no?) I know you mean well but they have every right to delete it. You could try tweeting it at them I suppose. Maybe someone will see it before Twitter ghosts your account.
