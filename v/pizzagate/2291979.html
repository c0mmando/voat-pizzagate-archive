            I'm hoping this organ harvesting in Haiti finally leads to Laura Silsby's door. Our gov knows ALLLL about Alert Sense and all this mess with NCMEC and ICMEC too. Up at that level in D.C. there are no secrets about any of this. Question is will they bust any real pedo rings because if they open that Pandora's box it will sweep half of our government into the prison toilet and I still don't know if they are willing to crack that 6000 year old egg open.

             Here's an important video interview between Amanpour and Angelina Jolie right after the Haiti earthquake in 2010.
Jolie is on location and discusses danger of child trafficking there and mentions the Laura Silsby incident. She is pushing Clinton Foundation funded SOS Children's Villages. Sounds like Amanpour is being used to diffuse the Silsby incident. Both she and her husband have close ties to the Clintons.

            <p>
             "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, February 9 (UNHCR)  UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie arrived on Tuesday in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, where she visited earthquake survivors and met aid workers from local and international organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jolie, who said she was in Haiti to "listen and to learn," visited medical centres, the UN mission and met with vulnerable children. On her arrival in the Haitian capital, Jolie was briefed by the United Nations Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General Edmond Mulet on the scale of the humanitarian operation to date and the challenges that remain.
            </p>
            <p>
             She also visited a cash-for-work programme run by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in the Carrefour district of Port-au-Prince, which is enabling Haitians to earn an income as they help their country to recover. "To give people the ability to work towards their own future is so important at this time. It helps to restore their hope and respects their dignity," said Jolie."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In the Santo area of Port-au-Prince, Jolie visited SOS Children's Villages, a worldwide programme to raise children inside their own countries. Since the earthquake, the organization has begun providing additional care for children who have been newly orphaned or who have lost contact with their parents as a result of the catastrophe. SOS is working to reunite children with their family members and will continue to care for those without any caregivers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jolie applauded their work, while stressing that "new adoptions should definitely not be encouraged as an immediate response to the emergency. Haiti had many trafficking problems before the earthquake and now must keep a very close watch on the children. I would encourage as much support as possible to groups like SOS and UNICEF providing care for children in country.""

              Nah, they just hire child trafickers because they are lazy with the background checks. They aren't one of those child organizations that are infiltrated or created from scratch to facilitate or provide cover for child traficking. So organ harvesting is out of the question too no? If they WERE involved, maybe they would just sub the organ harvesting out to somebody else. Really messy. .... Idiot.

              Instead of taking everyone's opinion here and being arrogant enough to think that everyone needs to provide you evidence, why don't you get a life? Why must we convince you? Are you the voat police?

              Go form your own opinions. I could care less if you agree with me. You seem like a shill since you focus on picking others opinions apart. You've been here 9 months. Your contribution points says a lot about you.

                Isn't there a website were people like yourself and Donkey can go agree with each other?  Do you have experience agreeing with others in your life at some point?  It's refreshing to acknowledge another person's opinion as being meaningful.  Negative leads to negative.

                We are a peoples court of public opinion.  It's very informal and yet deeply interested in uncovering hidden evils.  Wherever a crowd is gathered, some will speak just to gather the attention  Being contentious is the best method of keeping the groups attention on themselves.  It's reactive and doesn't require advance thinking or thought.  Promoting the general discussion is a risk the cherry pickers want to skip.
               </p>
               <p>
                Local politics is full of it where I live.  A few have ideas and a few enjoy shooting them down.  Never do the shooters advance ideas.  Their pleasure is only in the kill.  I'll buy the first round, you and Donkey might enjoy each other.  We'd all benefit from that.

                Because we're not a court. When someone makes a comment giving their opinions, that is not evidence or charges. So we don't need opinions picked apart like you are some defense attorney. Now, if we made a post and we are stating something as a fact, then I could see your point. But you need to chill out on simple opinions.

              I am claiming that Laura Silsby had ties to the Clinton state department as is evident in the Wikileaks emails. That draws a red arrow to Alert Sense because Laura Silsby, Layra Gayler (sp?) and the rest of her aliases work there. I am also claiming that the Clinton's are involved in organ harvesting in several ways.

               Angelina Jolie Visits SOS Children's Village in Haiti
Longtime Supporter Back in Haiti to Assess Progress Since Earthquake
              </p>
              <p>
               "Washington, D.C. (June 21, 2010) – SOS Children’s Villages, a global organization that focuses on family-based, long-term care of children, this weekend welcomed UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie to its Village in Santo, Haiti outside of Port-au-Prince. Ms. Jolie spent the night at an SOS house in the Santo Village. She visited with and brought toys for the children. On her trip she met with President Preval, current and former Government of Haiti Ministers, Haitian Judges and lawyers, U.S. State Department officials, and other NGOs regarding child protection in Haiti.
Preceding the overnight stay, Ms. Jolie held a dinner and round-table discussion that included UNHCR, SOS Children’s Villages, UNICEF, Partners in Health and PRODEV. The purpose of these meetings was to study the Haitian legal system surrounding child protection issues and explore mechanisms for strengthening the Government’s capacity to address these needs.
This is Ms. Jolie’s second visit to the SOS Haiti Village. When last there in February she met with the 33 children who were brought to the village after the Haitian government intervened to prevent their removal from Haiti. This weekend, Ms. Jolie learned that all of the children have been reunited with their families and continue to receive assistance from SOS."

               But you do understand it's another big leap to organ trafficking.    Like even if she had nefarious intent, it easily could have been for something other than organ trafficking.    One example, I can think of is to set up an orphanage and skim some of the donations.

               Neither Silsby nor her organization were known to anyone at the State Department before she was arrested.
Here's the email thread where she first gets on the State Department radar.

               Eshade, KnightsOfHubris is lame. He likes to scan everyone's comments and then pick them apart and debate. He seems to think anyone who has an opinion needs to debate him. He doesn't understand that some people don't give a shit what he thinks and could care less if he disagrees. He's one of those narcissistic types that have a need to be right.

                 He thought my opinion on the doctors "suicide" was important enough that he picked it apart and wanted to debate as if I need to convince him.

              Lorich did not say anything positive or negative about the Clinton Foundation.  That was invented after his death.
