            "In the first incident, the victim tells police Washington got him alone on a flight of stairs inside the church in 1982, and told him it was a ritual for all potential altar boys to have outlines of their penises drawn on pieces of paper.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to police affidavits, after the victim submitted to this request, Washington then began fondling the victim's scrotum. The boy was 10 years old at the time, according to police.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second victim described a similar incident inside St. Patrick's between 1983 and 1984. The second victim was also studying to be an altar boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police say the second victim claims Washington waited until they were alone on a flight of stairs, then told him it was customary for prospective altar boys to have their penises measured.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police say once Washington had convinced the boy to do this, Washington grabbed the child’s penis, fondled it, and then performed oral sex on him. Police say the boy was between 11 and 14 years old at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Washington would have been between 18 and 21 at the time of the alleged incidents, according to the affidavits."

            A judge did not set bond on the two criminal sexual conduct charges. Bond has been set at $100,000 on the lewd acts charge.  That seems like a rather low charge.  That means he will only have to come up with $10K on a get out of jail card.  They are already working on his getting off on this or a slap on the wrist sentence.

             As usual, you know NOT of what you speak.  You do NO research before spewing bullshit.

             Washington was arrested by the sheriff's office so is sitting in the county jail. His initial bond hearing was in that lower court.  That lower court judge DOES NOT have the authority to set bond on the other charges, which will be heard in Circuit Court.  The lower court judge MUST defer everything to the proper jurisdiction.

              As usual, you know NOT of what you speak. You do NO research.....  Lies Lies Lies, I will re read it, if I misread I will be the first one to own up to it.  Almost everyone on here knows that I do tons of research.  That's all I will say, for I don't think I need to defend myself.  Mis reading is not spewing what comes out of your rear end.

               You do NOT KNOW THE LAW, lady.   Yet you don't hesitate to post BS about it.  Dittos for MEDICINE.  I don't know how old you are, but most people LEARN to SHUT UP about subjects they know NOTHING ABOUT by their early 20s.  That lesson seems to have been lost on you, which makes you a FOOL.  This is supposed to be a RESEARCH forum for FACTS, not BULLSHIT.

              </p>
              <p>
               I just called you out.  Your prior post is INCORRECT.  Where's the concession of the point?  Instead you get defensive and accuse me of lying!
              </p>
              <p>
               The information I provided wasn't in the article.  The article is a NEWS STORY, not a law primer.  Despite your ZERO knowledge of the law, you took ONE DETAIL in the article and ran wild with it, posting bullshit.  All you had to do was GOOGLE it, Ms. "Researcher."

               Yeah, okay.  Research how?  You can't post a link.  Research on what?
              </p>
              <p>
               A GOOD researcher doesn't just look stuff up.  It takes some cognitive ability to process the information, which you obviously lack.
