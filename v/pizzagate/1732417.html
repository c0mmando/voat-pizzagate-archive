            A competent shill could figure out quick how to get enough upvotes.  The OP was just a few up's away from being able to downvote.  Rationalize it if you will but looking at OP's contributions (which I just did) and using critical thinking/well, let's just say it's a lost art sometimes.  Going off on a member and name calling just cause you feel like forum cop is in very poor taste.  I'm tired of rude and mean behavior.  I think the ppl here have enough to deal with/the stories/the pictures/the vids.  If you had a problem with the request saying so in a courteous respectful manner/fine.  Being an ass yourself/not fine.

            IT WAS NOT DUMBASS...don't buy into that.  Simply someone asking for a hand up/isn't that what we are all about anyway?
It was a troll that called you dumbass.  They love creating conflict.  Heck I gave you an upvote per your request and one now for this comment even tho I don't think you did anything dumbass/just wanted to give you another upvote

            It is very obvious which stories are fake news because they're the ones that contain no sources, no links to anything that backs up the claims they make. That readconservatives site is full of that crap, do people really believe that stuff?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again just because it's a fake story that someone pulled out of their ass doesn't mean that Weiner
            <em>
             isn't
            </em>
            in protective custody - depending on who runs that site it's possible that he is, but in order to make people think he isn't, they put out a story that can easily be dismissed as fake, leading people to believe that every aspect of it was a lie, thereby obscuring the truth even more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, until you see evidence of something, believe nothing either way!

            nice you see again buddy! since you're such a genius, would you please finally answer my question about your educational/academic background, and what exactly qualifies you as such an expert on "critical thinking" and "logic" (your words from past posts). For the record, I am not simply trying to put you down. There is a very specific reason I'm asking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, whatever you may think about the rest of this community, I have been nothing but civil to you, except when provoked, yet YOU repeatedly respond by saying "there's no point in using logic with you idiots who are incapable of basic critical thinking" or something along those lines. Unless you have more than 1 doctorate in mathematical logic (from a top 5 university no less), you are most certainly not more qualified than me in that field. Hell, I'll even accept a PhD in philosophical logic. However, I highly doubt you have an advanced degree of any sort (that's not an insult, merely an observation based on how you conduct yourself vs the educated folks I've encountered in my life).
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you so unbelievably arrogant that you completely discount the opinions of others who are clearly more educated and knowledgeable not only on the specific issue at hand, but also more educated about logic in general, simply because you happen to disagree? And does that really necessitate the constant name calling and harassment you have perpetrated against this community? Have you never before encountered an opinion on the internet that you disagreed with? I am not asking you these questions rhetorically, I am genuinely curious of your thought process.
