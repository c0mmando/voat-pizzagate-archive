One way you can do that is to archive all of your own stuff, (or any stuff you think is important) at archive.is and archive.org. You really should be doing that every time you make a submission. But in case you haven\'t, now is a great time to do it.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it efficiently:</p>
<h1 id="md-to-archive-a-submission">To archive a submission:</h1>
<p>Paste the url of the submission into archive.is or archive.org and save it. If a copy already exists, you can save it again so there are multiple snapshots of the page made at different times.</p>
<p>Archive.is only captures the first page of a submission, and only the upper layer of the comment tree -- so if there is vital research buried in the comment section, be sure to open the thread as described below, and archive that url separately.</p>
<h1 id="md-to-archive-a-single-comment">To archive a single comment:</h1>
<p>Click &quot;link&quot;, then archive that url (should have the number of the submission at the end of the url / the number of the comment)</p>
<h1 id="md-to-archive-a-small-group-of-comments">To archive a small group of comments:</h1>
<p>Go to the bottom-most comment, click &quot;link&quot;, add &quot;?=3&quot; or &quot;?=20&quot; to the end of the url and archive. (The number at the end determines how many comments above the bottom comment you want to show)</p>
<h1 id="md-to-archive-the-entire-comment-thread-or-a-part-of-a-thread-greater-than-20-comments">To archive the entire comment thread or a part of a thread greater than 20 comments</h1>
<p>Go to the bottom-most comment, click &quot;permalink&quot;, add &quot;/0/&quot; to the end of the url and archive.</p>
<p><strong>The entire process is immensely simplified if you go to archive.is and drag the bookmarklet button available at the top of the page into the toolbar of your internet browser.</strong></p>
<p>According Q, Trump has plans in place for declaring vital sites public utilities so that the lights can be kept on. :-)  I don\'t know how that might apply to Voat. Probably it would help support the infrastructure we rely on, but not apply to us directly. The best protection of our research is having it in multiple places, though, so make sure your own research is also posted elsewhere.</p>
<p>If anyone has the additional time to sort <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> by TOP/all time and start archiving, that would be a worthy endeavor, as well. I\'ve been archiving old posts as I read them, and a lot of folks archived them when they submitted, so many are already backed up.</p>

            An excellent practice is to also
            <em>
             pre-write
            </em>
            your submissions in a text editor and save them locally, before submitting.

               How does encouraging people to make backups of our research in case Voat is attacked "sound like" I'm "clearing the sub out"? It's the exact opposite!
              </p>
              <p>
               There is no way for me to do that, anyway. You do realize that Voat does not allow moderators to do anything more than move posts to the "Removed Submissions" area, which is still searchable, right? I can't permanently remove anything. Only Putt can do that...or the users themselves.

                 A better question: Why are you lurking my comments, raving about lies in ALLCAPS, yet never linking to a single example to support any of your baseless smears?

                 H1B visas don't bring in the best programmers, I guess? Seems like it would be pretty easy to write a script that would copypaste in the link to the comments you claim were deleted, or any of these alleged "death threats", or any of the evidence of this tomfoolery you're pushing at all...if there was any evidence.

             Let me be clear, I don't want you dead. I just want you to stop driving people away from what matters, stop triggering survivors.

               Putting blind faith in anything makes you a fool. Telling us what to believe or not also marks you as a fool. I will not put my trust in anything that I cant verify. This is a hive-mind. We communicate thoughts, ideas, and a lot of hate. Feel free to start your "click" somewhere else if you have beef here. I don't trust anyone of you. I simply observe and communicate ideas that might help the cause. The Op's here have done us a great service to log and expose the huge trove of evil we live with. I can care less about being forgiven by your god. You speak like a true sheep and will gleefully be ignored. THANK YOU to all the OP's and goats that contribute to this channel. I know it's a hard pill to swallow and the stains don't wash away from some of the shit that I see here. Same has to go with all of you. Keep us the good fight.

                 OK. Can you list some verified intel on Racine, Wi? I know who hails from it. I also lived 20 miles away from it for years and never heard a peep about what goes on there. I look for dirt but the proof is still in the pudding. 5G? A bow and arrow or shotgun will win over a box. This will be a costly venture when the normies freak out once the dangers become known. They will have to set up a shitton of equipment due to range issues. Think the bigger issue here should be anything made from wheat will give you cancer. They want us passive, dead, or dying. They make more cash off us if we live a bit.  Or chemtrails, or floride in the water, or lead in the water. Poison is poison and it will slowing be the winner to all. Poison your body or your mind. Does not really matter what way we take it. Government never gave a fuck till they get caught. They are all our enemy.

            I'd like to say that some people think that archive.is might be shut down in the near future (just a rumour?), so you might want to choose archive.fo instead, or use archive.org as suggested by you.

              I don't know the reasons people here are giving but off the top of my head, here's one reason:
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Avoid a single point of failure. If everyone is archiving using the same website they only need to attack/compromise that one website. If everyone is saving copies on their computers they would have to attack each individual computer or break into all our houses. Keeping the information stored in a decentralized way means itll take a lot more work to scrub the info. Don't make their job easy. Maybe print out the most important information (or put it on a flash drive) and bury it in a sealed container, then they have to dig up all our yards.

                 No one cares what you "know", because you aren't willing to make research posts explaining it and supporting it. You are nothing but a programmed reactionary that lurks certain users' comments and responds with a mishmash of copypasta, apocolyptic fearmongering and insults.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A non-bot would have noticed that I confirmed the users' observation AND upvoted him so he could message. You need a better programmer.
