<p>A little back story: I am reading a book and came across a term I\'ve never heard &quot;Hakluyt&quot;. So, when I come across something i don\'t know I search online for the meaning.

I clicked it and I\'m pretty sure that this power group is a shell company for something but i\'m sure it\'s probably nothing.</p>
<p>The reason I\'m sharing with you all is that to me, the whole site seems pretty damn fishy being a single page website with 5 offices all over the world?? In the footer, you will see that this is owned by a parent company, <strong>Holdingham Group Limited</strong>. When I went to their site and looked at their directors and their advisory board I\'ve literally been fascinated at this group and trying to find out what the purpose of it really is.</p>
<p>The list of advisory is to say the least a who\'s who in business and everything about this group just seems odd.

            As a BIG hint what in reality is Nazism? it is of course SUN worship to self be god. To be enlightened as in transhumanism/excistensialism. As in Blawatsky, as in Crowley and so on. Deep occult meanings against the church of any kind.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a sidenote.....you cant be Christian managing a BANK you cant be Christian selling alcohol and so on. So in reality NOTHING in christianity or in fact any religion do favor consumism. It is the opposite against religion!!!!

            I also experienced the scrubbers after searching her name w duckduck images- several popped up from getty website - the first time I clicked the thumb I was taken to their site with search = no results / i clicked
            <em>
             back
            </em>
            and then returned 30 seconds later = dead link entirely...

            Fairly obvious we are dealing with an AI, if its that responsive. Is it possible our citizens investigation is actually assisting the AI by doing what its keyword and algorithmic programming cannot? *unwittingly Enlisting those of us flagged #toowoke by MAXWELLS FBAI, for the more human spectrum analysis, recognition, emotional intelligence and dot connecting necessary to FIND all traces of The evidence; So they can then delete it before its used.

            That doesn't mean stop the wonderful work that the righteous are doing here and elsewhere- it means be smart, and be purposeful with your research. Once a theory is proven worth investigation to you, the other believers, or the forum, think of how to package the information for mass awareness or those who can use it to act on direct solutions. Otherwise we are identifying ourselves, flooding the metadata with seemingly random bits of speculation, and finding incriminating evidence for them.  This isn't a call out, just a fellow researcher recognizing how fleeting our chance may be to do something with our data. We are not as Anonymous as we think- and the Research that changed all of our minds, may not always be there to prove them sound.

            It's always the British.  It's always been the British.  They keep trying to paint Mossad as being Epstein's secret backer, but I'd bet dollars to donuts it's the royal family who is behind him.....  just a gut felling thing.   Lots of Q and other roads have led back to the British management.  (I dearly love the citizenry, our cousins).  Guess I'll have to wait and see but I am usually spot on with my instincts...

             When we look at the Boston marathon false flag, too, it's possible to figure out that the IDF is under MI6 in the intelligence hierarchy. Jardine Matheson owns a lot of high-end real estate in Boston, to this day, including the businesses that control the security cameras etc. Many of the agents were Israelis but I'm fairly sure MI6 was behind it.

              Only picture I've seen of Epstein cracking a smile. Is he missing teeth? Very odd.

              In all other pics, no smile with teeth showing.  Same with Rachel Chandler.  Why??? Harder to ID pic?

              Is her left eye smaller than her right eye? I've noticed this feature on many of our persons' of interest. 
Such an unhappy looking girl.

               Her let eye is definitely smaller.  There is something going on about the eyes with many of these degenerates.  Bezos being one.

                 Donald Marshall talks about the eyes in one of his videos about the cloning centres.  It is unfortunate that Marshall is not very credible because he sounds insane.  He's most likely speaking part truths.

            You bet. Remember that it was alleged that the pics Rachel Chandler posted on her Instagram showed CCTV on Epstein's pedo island.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question - does Epstein have ties to the Russian mafia - many, if not most of the girls who attended his NYC dinner parties were Russian. They might have been trafficked via his New Mexico estate (many Russians girls are flown to Mexico, and then get trafficked to the US.)

             Yes, there was a Russian guy mentioned on a post with Epstein a couple days ago. I checked his page and he’s definitely supplying Russian models to famous and wealthy men. He calls himself a matchmaker. He doesn’t show underage girls on his page but we know he does he’s tied closely to Epstein. Can’t recall his name I’ll have to look for it again.
