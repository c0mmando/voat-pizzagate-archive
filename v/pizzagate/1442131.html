<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<p>A quick whois trace on all previous websites, <a href="https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=esag.org">ICANN.org</a> and <a href="https://www.whois.net/">Whois.net</a> shows the registrant is located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens">Athens, Greece</a>, and <a href="http://www.ip-adress.com/whois/esag.org">IP-adress.com</a>, shows the registrant is located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltham,_Massachusetts">Waltham, Massachusetts</a>.</p>
<p>All three show the domain was registered in October 2015.</p>
<p>Here\'s what it says on their <a href="http://esag.org/about.php">About page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The European Society of Aesthetic Gynecology, E.S.A.G. is a premier professional organization of cosmetic gynecologists located in Europe as well as worldwide, who specialize in aesthetic (cosmetic) surgical gynecology. E.S.A.G. aims to decisively contribute towards the promotion of innovation in aesthetic surgical gynecology in Europe and beyond.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let\'s try and connect some dots.</p>
<p>Madeleine McCann <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann">disappeared on May 3rd, 2007</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tony-Podesta-mole.jpg">Official police sketches</a> of two of the suspects in her disappearance display an uncanny resemblance to brothers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta">John</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Podesta">Tony Podesta</a>.</p>
<p>Because of their alleged relation with the Pizzagate pedophile ring, it\'s now a goal of this investigation to find undeniable evidence that places the Podesta brothers in Portugal (specifically, in the Algarve) around the time of Madeleine McCann\'s disappearance. </p>
<p>In the context of this investigation, having an e-mail with pertaining to &quot;<em>A road leading to success in bed</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Watch your boner gradually come larger and stronger!</em>&quot; in John Podesta\'s inbox just two months after Madeleine\'s disappearance would raise some eyebrows but could be overlooked; especially since it seems to have been nothing more than automated Spam mail.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that the e-mail could have been sent by someone working at the European Society of Aesthetic Gynecology &quot;<em>who specialize in aesthetic (cosmetic) surgical gynecology</em>&quot;, that makes my eyebrows rise a little higher. In fact, I imagine that, having the chance, many adult child abusers of 3 year-old girls would welcome such services to cover their tracks. This, of course, would imply corruption within the European Society of Aesthetic Gynecology or, at the very least, severely question their ethics code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However! I believe that the most significant finding here could be something different, which is:</p>
<p><strong>all the possibilities above point to the e-mail originating from someplace in Europe.</strong></p>
<p>Too farfetched? You tell me. But please consider for a moment that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the address in the email body (<a href="http://dudipary.com">http://dudipary.com)</a>) indicates that the e-mail was the result of automated Spam - and it certainly seems so  -, let me remind you that spam can be automated through many variables, some of which are recent search terms in your browser history and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation">Geolocation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if this is nothing but Spam, bare in mind that it was sent by a non-existing esag.net which could have migrated to esag.ch or esag.org. Regardless of its migration, these are all Europe-based domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One final incongruity is the end of this e-mail. The last few sentences are cut but clearly detail European references, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang">Vlaams Belang</a> (Eng. Flemish Interest), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint-Niklaas">Sint-Niklaas</a>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In light of all of this:</p>

           Because of their alleged relation with the Pizzagate pedophile ring, it's now a goal of this investigation to find undeniable evidence that places the Podesta brothers in Portugal (specifically, in the Algarve) around the time of Madeleine McCann's disappearance.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the context of this investigation, having an e-mail with pertaining to "
           <em>
            A road leading to success in bed
           </em>
           " and "
           <em>
            Watch your boner gradually come larger and stronger!
           </em>
           " in John Podesta's inbox just two months after Madeleine's disappearance would raise some eyebrows but could be overlooked; especially since it seems to have been nothing more than automated Spam mail.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, the fact that the e-mail could have been sent by someone working at the European Society of Aesthetic Gynecology "
           <em>
            who specialize in aesthetic (cosmetic) surgical gynecology
           </em>
           ", that makes my eyebrows rise a little higher. In fact, I imagine that, having the chance, many adult child abusers of 3 year-old girls would welcome such services to cover their tracks. This, of course, would imply corruption within the European Society of Aesthetic Gynecology or, at the very least, severely question their ethics code.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           However! I believe that the most significant finding here could be something different, which is:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            all the possibilities above point to the e-mail originating from someplace in Europe.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Too farfetched? You tell me. But please consider for a moment that:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <p>
             If the address in the email body (
             <a href="http://dudipary.com">
              http://dudipary.com)
             </a>
             ) indicates that the e-mail was the result of automated Spam - and it certainly seems so  -, let me remind you that spam can be automated through many variables, some of which are recent search terms in your browser history and
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation">
              Geolocation
             </a>
             .
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Even if this is nothing but Spam, bare in mind that it was sent by a non-existing esag.net which could have migrated to esag.ch or esag.org. Regardless of its migration, these are all Europe-based domains.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             One final incongruity is the end of this e-mail. The last few sentences are cut but clearly detail European references, such as
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Defence">
              United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence
             </a>
             ,
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang">
              Vlaams Belang
             </a>

          </ol>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
           In light of all of this:

            Not sure either way. Can we afford to think it's just spam? If it can at least provide Geolocation of Podesta at the time, that's a huge plus.
