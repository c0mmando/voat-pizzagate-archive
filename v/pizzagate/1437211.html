There is a ton of info out there on him so I won\'t get into the details here. Anyhow, this is a very wealthy and connected pedo who renounced his US citizenship in 2011 while living abroad in an undisclosed location in the Dominican Republic. Since the renouncement of his citizenship, however, his whereabouts have been untraceable. </p>
<p>What made me think of this? Dennis &quot;Denny&quot; Hastert, former Speaker of the House and admitted serial child molester. More specifically, an email sent by Jake Siewert to John Podesta on May 28th, 2015 suggesting, &quot;Might be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island.&quot;</p>
<p>see email at: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11508">Podesta &quot;Denny&quot; email</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert">From Wikipedia</a>:
&quot;Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program. One of Hastert\'s fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, there is a connection between the power elite in politics and entertainment, and the entertainment industry is rife with pedophilia to the point that it is almost a community culture. So what if this untraceable individual could be traced? Would he be found on an island anywhere near Japan? What else might be found there? Sure, I know I am thinking out loud, but I am trying to turn on a lightbulb in my own head, or maybe yours. </p>
<p>Now, Podesta never replied to this email, or perhaps his reply was not recovered as a part of the Podesta emails that we have seen thus far. If he, in fact, did not reply, then it is something he did not want to touch. Jake Siewert was the White House Press Secretary under Bill Clinton and worked for the Treasury Department under Obama. He is currently Head of Corporate Communications for Goldman Sachs. This is not someone Podesta blows off for no reason, at least I don\'t think.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of the connections in this puzzle, Jake Siewert does have children, 4 of them, with his wife Christine Anderson Siewert, also a political operative. I have not found anything concrete involving Siewert, but this all made me think that he, at least, knows something. Perhaps that is where we should look. Individuals who may not be involved but may be covering for those who are. </p>
<p>Think about it. Having knowledge of such things and not coming forward about it is still highly illegal. It must be easier for someone who is not involved to have a &quot;crisis of conscience&quot; under pressure and come forward with information than to have someone who is involved and would absolutely embarrass ind incriminate themselves actually come forward. </p>

            I've been looking into this. The latest news I've found so far is from June 2014. Buzzfeed claimed to have found him living in an apartment in Antwerp, Belgium.

            I think I also read somewhere that the Bitcoin Foundation, donates to the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Brock Pierce, was "elected" director of the Bitcoin Foundation and is a investor in other crypto currencies. Of which, a few have been proven to be scams.

             The Japanese island is the one referenced in the linked email above in my post. Jake Siewert suggests to John Podesta that in the light of another indictment, admitted serial child molester Dennis Haster should vanish to an "undisclosed Japanese island."
