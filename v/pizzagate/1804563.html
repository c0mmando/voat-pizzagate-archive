<p>Have a look at these lyrics, in the light of pizzagate revelations:</p>
<p>PLAY ME BACKWARDS (Written by Joan Baez, Wally Wilson, Kenny Greenberg &amp; Karen O’Connor)</p>
<p>Source (easier to read) :http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joanbaez/playmebackwards.html</p>
<p>&quot;You don’t have to play me backwards To get the meaning of my verse You don’t have to die and go to hell To feel the devil’s curse</p>
<p>Well I thought my life was a photograph On the family Christmas card Kids all dressed in buttons and bows And lined up in the yard Were the golden days of childhood So lyrical and warm Or did the picture start to fade On the day that I was born</p>
<p>I’ve seen them light the candles I’ve heard them bang the drum And I’ve cried Mama, I’m cold as ice! And I got no place to run</p>
<p>Let the night begin there’s a pop of skin And the sudden rush of scarlet There’s a little boy riding on a goat’s head And a little girl playing the harlot There’s a sacrifice in an empty church Of sweet li’l baby Rose And a man in a mask from Mexico Is peeling off my clothes</p>
<p>I’ve seen them light the candles I’ve heard them bang the drum And I’ve cried Mama, I’m cold as ice! And I got no place to run</p>
<p>So I’m paying for protection Smoking out the truth Chasing recollections Nailing down the proof</p>
<p>You don’t have to play me backwards To get the meaning of my verse You don’t have to die and go to hell To feel the devil’s curse I’ll stand before your altar And tell everything I know I’ve come to claim my childhood At the chapel of baby Rose</p>
<p>I’ve seen them light the candles I’ve heard them bang the drum I’ve seen them light the candles I’ve heard them bang the drum&quot;</p>

<p>She even has a song with a direct reference to Monarch programming, called &quot;Caruso&quot;: 
&quot;Yes, the king of them all was Enrico
Whose singular chest could rival
A hundred fervent Baptists
Giving forth in a tent revival
True he was a vocal miracle
But that\'s only secondary

That I find a little bit scary</strong>&quot;

You will find the educational institutions involved and that there were a lot of phony &quot;scientists&quot; used in their &quot;experiments&quot;</p>
<p>Here is an interview which connects some dots regarding Joan Baez:
 &quot;He [Phil Ochs] was a part of a group I called the “Baez Contras” who surrounded Joan Baez. It’s known that Joan was used in C.I.A. mind control experimentation at a very early age. She was subjected to trauma-based programming, which is still in use today in the creation of multiple personalities. If you look at the latest record by Joan Baez, she thanks her multiple personalities on the back of the record. Then you have her friend Phil Ochs, who was equally adamant in his opposition to the U.S. government and covert operations and he developed a multiple personality by the name of John Train. It wasn’t until ten years later that the name “John Train” surfaced as a C.I.A. operative working on Wall Street. As a matter of fact, Lyndon LaRouche complained about an agent named John Train who supposedly led him to his present jail sentence. During the 1960s and Seventies, John Train of the C.I.A. had the job of disrupting the Left, which was the sole purpose of Operation Chaos. So how was it that Phil Ochs came to have a multiple personality with the name of an actual C.I.A. agent? We know Phil Ochs was found hung in 1976 and it was his alternate personality that did the hanging that actually assassinated the host personality.
The F.B.I. and C.I.A. came together in Operation Chaos; it was an inter-agency program that drew upon the entire intelligence apparatus of the U.S. government. As I say, it was the largest covert project in American history. She’s admitted in private letters to two organizations for mind control victims that she had been submitted to trauma-based programming as a child. Her father was the head of Research Operations at Cornell University...&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, many have understood that the whole hippy/drug culture thing was engineered by the intelligence agencies in &quot;Operation Chaos&quot; and that the music industry then (as now) is a product of that control.</p>
<p>Dave McGowan\'s excellent website has been scrubbed, but his great book is still available: &quot;Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops &amp; the Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream&quot;. Many musicians are exposed.</p>
<p>We see the nexus of MKULtra, SRA, not only in politics, but in the music industry today and it looks like it\'s been around a long time.</p>
<p>At age 76, after a &quot;ten year funk&quot; (MK breakdown?), she joined the anti-Trump bandwagon, by posting her first song in 25 years on her Facebook page April 4, 2017: <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/240904/joan-baez-just-wrote-her-first-song-in-25-years.html">http://www.newser.com/story/240904/joan-baez-just-wrote-her-first-song-in-25-years.html</a></p>',

           Dave McGowan's excellent website has been scrubbed, but his great book is still available: "Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops &amp; the Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream". Many musicians are exposed.

           We see the nexus of MKULtra, SRA, not only in politics, but in the music industry today and it looks like it's been around a long time.

            So how did the guy who claims he is McCartney now, change his shoe size, eye color, jaw structure, hair swirl growth direction, and ear cartilage? Not to mention the many different voices that appear on his recordings when analyzed? Or the fact that suddenly he was right handed for a couple of years, when the real Paul was left handed? There are credible forensic studies that have been done on him, for those who do not remember seeing the original Paul.  Those of us who did know this impostor is completely different, even his whole persona and way of speaking.

            You must have worked really hard on this.  Thanks OP.  I read all of it and many of the reports you included on SRA and MK Ultra.  Many on here would not be shocked to read such horrible things done by our govt.  I shudder to think what will happen to the public when they are red pilled about these covert operations that they have been doing for decades.  The story about Sirhan Sirhan is especially enlightening.  I am sad to say that almost nothing surprises me anymore. Serious Upvoats Are In Order.

               I am one of them....only went on this ride right after the election with the beginnings of Pizzagate.  I got obsessed and three weeks later I had a totally different opinion of the world and the history of that world.  A dark and very bumpy ride to hell.

                I was not far ahead of you. I came here after Reddit dumped Pizzagate. I guess because of the horrible primary for Bernie I was prepared and ready to believe almost anything.  I am so glad I am one of the believers and not one that buries their head in the sand.  You should be too.

                 I came here when everyone was yelling about Reddit dumping it.  It was linked to a couple of times by FreeRepublic but quickly removed from there with weird cryptic Zionist stuff at the time.  I got banned from FreeRepublic for calling out the Jew.  But if your not getting banned your not doing enough I figure.

            True.
Like Zuckerberg and the rest, they are actors in the matrix that the intelligence services have created that the masses think is reality. That's why there is so much resistance to the truth. Pizzagate is a lever that opens Pandora's box of evil.

            Look at Joan Baez pretending to be a peace activist, but she's fine with Obama bombing 8 countries, or any wars going on in the past 40 years. She is a creation of intel, as was the whole hippy "movement". Some people are so threatened by her obvious hypocrisy that they postulate she has been "replaced" with a double, which is nonsense. I saw her then and later and she is the same person--a tool of the pedo establishment.

             Thanks. 
I mourn his loss. I am glad I read all his stuff before it "disappeared". He had a lot on pedos and child abuse. but I think it was his historical stuff they killed him over, not just the CIA/Laurel Canyon/drug stuff but the truth about the Lincoln assassination.
Real information is disappearing from the web in general, even faster than from VOAT. 
People are being murdered. Let's not forget: Max Spiers, Aaron Swartz, Monica Petersen, Seth Rich, Michael Collins Piper, Victor Thorne, Michael Hastings, etc.

              it sucks he's gone.  brave dude.  his death was pretty suspect with a cryptic yt comment warning him of aggressive cancer which he got like a couple of months later.  i tend to think it was the Laurel Canyon and Boston marathon bombing research IMO (the message was sent on one of his bostom marathon talks).  But, i never read his Lincoln thoughts.  He was however making the connections to those pulling the strings on a whole lot of evil stuff, including the pedo (his paper on it is still available on the internet).  You can also find on the net a posting of a lengthy email exchange with Col Aquino where he pretty much shreds him

               Since the 60s, they have been able to induce fast acting rare aggressive forms of cancer. That's how they killed Jack Ruby (real name Jacob Rubinstein, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald). They did not walk him talking in prison, or standing trial.

              You gave me a shock so I checked and Miles Mathis website is definitely up.  I love that guy's theories.  Really makes me see the world differently.

            That's true. But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say George H.W. Bush has done stuff a billion times worse than anything Trump could have done.

             HW Bush had way more time in power in the CIA, vice president then as president to do heinous things. Trump just got into politics. People who voted for him believed Trump would get out of those wars but instead he bombed one country based upon a false flag and just dropped the biggest bomb ever made on the poorest country in the world because the pentagon wanted to try it out and suddenly he's the man. The Bushies and the Clintonista's ALL love him now.  Please convince me he's not part of it because he's walking back on his promises pretty efficiently.

              The biggest piece of evidence I have is those 59 Tomahawk missiles. Half didn't work and the other half only did minor damage to the airfield. I think Trump told the Russians an hour before the attack. The airfield was back in operation within hours.
             </p>
             <p>
              So right there it's a hoax. I could be wrong as always but I'm starting to see what looks like the beginning of a takedown. Trump has to avoid looking like he's fighting the Deep State on behalf of the Russians. So what do they do? The do a phony missile attack and make it look like it's about to be WWIII. That bought Trump maybe a 1 or 2 month window of time where he can attack the Deep State without people thinking he's a Russian puppet.
             </p>
             <p>
              I strongly suspect Trump was either told or he told everyone that the Deep State takedown had to happen within 6 months or else. The "or else" is the beginnings of a Civil War. This is serious shit that's happening. People don't realize there is a very high probability some of the high level perps will be hung by the neck until dead. We have no American Government and no Constitution anymore. Those are things worth dying for and if Trump doesn't do something people will do it themselves. That's what the 2nd Ammendment is for. You could even see the Military decapitate traitors within their ranks. They took an oath to protect the Constitution. If they have evidence of high treason they have the right to walk into some generals office and shoot a traitor in the heart and not even be tried for murder. They'll even get a metal for it possibly.

             Thanks, that is why I posted this, and for the bigger picture. The first time I submitted this, it was immediately removed by one of the mods. It was a lot of work to put it together again.

               And wouldn't you know it--Millennial Falcon is right at the top of your link, putting out BS, desperately and obviously trying to do damage control. He's the one who has deleted many of my posts, including the earlier one I did on Joan Baez. People without his bias know the truth about this, but cannot write about it here.

               I think you have nailed the real problem with VOAT. As long as we make it vague like "elites" , "globalists", etc, that's okay, but let's just forget about the playbook for all this stuff: the Talmud, and the institutionalized pedophilia among it's followers. Putting articles about the Catholic Church is fine, but don't touch the story of the rabbi who concealed their child rape assembly line, or mohels sucking blood from babies and eating their foreskins. It seems like facts are "antisemitic" to people who have no real Semitic DNA, doesn't it?

              I dunno.  Both Amy Schumer's stand up routines and her sketch show have given me a few laughs.  Like she's not a BAD comedian.  I listened to her narration of her autobiography and there is an emotional  chapter where she describes meeting the parents of the Sandy Hook "victims" at a special ceremony at the WH.  That made me wonder.

             Baez is the hippie version of Miley Cyrus -- a complete establishment tool. No wonder she comes out of her "funk" to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
             She is as phony as Amnesty International (of which she claims to be a founder!) an organization that has no problem with child trafficking, mass starvation, and genocide. Like most NGOs it is black ops. It's like Angelina Jolie being a "goodwill ambassador" (gag).
