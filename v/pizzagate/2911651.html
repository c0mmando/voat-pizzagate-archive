<p>COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - Newly released documents have revealed that one of the many Jesuit priests who have been credibly accused of sexually abusing children spent time in Columbia.</p>
<p>In all, 42 men have been credibly accused of child sex abuse spanning decades all around the country.</p>
<p>Officials with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston say Father Francis Landwermeyer served as principal of Cardinal Newman high school in the 1988 and 1989 as well as the 1989 and 1990 school years.</p>
<p>In a statement to WIS the Diocese of Charleston said: </p>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, there is no record of any allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor made against Father Landwermeyer while he was assigned at St. Thomas the Apostle or at Cardinal Newman School.”</p>
<p>Officials are asking for potential victims to come forward.</p>
<p>Father Landwemeyer passed away earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Charleston said they will release their own list of priests credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors, dating back to the 1950′s. </p>
<p>We expect to receive the list by February.</p>

<p>There were 428 arrests over the weekend at Nocturnal Wonderland, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff\'s Department.</p>
<p>The legions of ravers booked at the event included those taken into custody for alleged offenses including being under 18, possessing drugs, selling drugs, assault, battery and indecent exposure.</p>
<p>More than 18,000 electronic music fans packed a local amphitheater on Friday for the first night of the festival. Crowds swelled to more than 22,000 for Saturday and Sunday performances by acts such as Bassnectar and Chromeo.</p>
<p>If you look at the pictures you will understand why he had an interest in the Nocturnal Wonderland and Ray Moreno who performed there. </p>
<p>Looks like Fr. Francis Landwermeyer led a very interesting life for a priest.

<p>Pizzagate Related since we have again another priest charged with Child sexual abuse.</p>',
