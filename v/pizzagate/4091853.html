<p>Hollywood producer David Guillod was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at his Sherman Oaks home Wednesday, just four months after he was charged with multiple counts of rape and kidnapping in Santa Barbara, sources said.</p>
<p>On Oct.  2020, a woman reported being sexually assaulted by Guillod during an evening meeting, the LAPD said in a news release .  After a search of his home, detectives took Guillod into custody without incident and booked him at the Los Angeles Police Metropolitan Detention Center, where he remains held on $5-million bail.</p>
<p>Guillod, 53, surrendered to authorities in Santa Barbara in June and was charged with rape, kidnap to commit rape and rape of a drugged victim in connection with four alleged attacks that occurred between 2012 and 2015.</p>
<p>Guillod’s defense attorney, Phillip Cohen, confirmed his client had been arrested but could not offer further details.</p>
<p>Guillod is now charged with 15 sex crimes in Santa Barbara County Superior Court with accusations from 2012 to 2018. Earlier this month he was charged with three counts of rape and sodomy related to an alleged October 2018 attack, according to court records.</p>
<p>He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.</p>
<p>The producer of the movies “Atomic Blonde” and Netflix’s “Extraction,” Guillod ran the talent agency Primary Wave Entertainment until 2017, when actress Jessica Barth accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her five years earlier.</p>
<p>Barth first reported the alleged assault to the LAPD and is now one of the four victims whose cases are being pursued by Santa Barbara County prosecutors. Guillod is also accused of drugging and sexually assaulting an employee during a wine country retreat in December 2014, and committing similar attacks in early 2015, officials have said.</p>
<p>While the alleged attacks took place in Santa Barbara and L.A. County, prosecutors in Santa Barbara are trying the prior cases against Guillod because the charges were consolidated around the 2014 assault case in their jurisdiction.</p>

            Can a person beat a lie detector test constantly? That depends on the definition of a person.
           </p>
           <p>
            A normal person without the aid of drugs "usually" can not fake a test if the tester is competent.
           </p>
           <p>
            With right drugs anyone can. Some MK Ultra and sadistic abuse survivors can pass polygraph test, it they were trained before long before puberty and conditioned well past puberty. These are the folks who are manipulative and control freaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I find interesting is the chemical enslavement aspect. There are drugs that can strip free will from intelligent beings to the point that they are enslaved body and mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Devil's Breath (Burundanga). AKA borrachera, "drunken binge". Extract from a Colombian tree that also contains Scopolamine from datura-based drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Burundanga can be added to food, drinks or cigarettes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The datura plants were used by the Chibcha people to sedate the wives and slaves buried alive with deceased chiefs. It is still used in remote areas by curanderos (healers) to induce a "waking trance" state, sometimes preceded by sudden outbursts of violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            In recent decades, its sinister use on the streets has grown from its role as a weapon in Colombia's gang wars. In Bogotá, hospital doctors say it accounts for half of all poisoning admissions, 500 per month.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Brazil these chemical enslavement crimes are charmingly called Boa noite, Cinderella - Goodnight, Cinderella - after a popular Seventies television show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Crimes involving datura are also being reported in Ecuador, where it is used as a "recreational" drug, peddled by local guides to thrill-seeking tourists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even a moderate dose of Scopolamine blocks acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential to memory. After "unsafe dosing" scans also reveal the drug affects the amygdala, a brain area controlling aggression and anxiety. This would explain scopolamine's pacifying effect. Evidence also suggests victims tend to be confused and passive which is used to enslave free will.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subliminal messaging is exploited on a victim through emotional triggers, fear being the fastest and lust being the most common. Basic knowledge of Psychoanalysis as used for mind control to strip free will. The only thing worse than human slavery is the enslavement of of the human mind.
