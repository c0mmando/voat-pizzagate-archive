            I don't know about this one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sarah Silverman loves to say shocking things, and she hasn't even bothered to delete her tweet, so it's easy to verify it's real.
           </p>
           <p>
            Courtney Cox however is not known for these kinds of tweets. I really think if the actress from Friends would have made this kind of tweet, I could find a mention of it from a gossip blog or something back in 2014 as it goes completely against the image she tries to portray and definitely would have raised eyebrows at the time. I'm not finding anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is easy to create a fake tweet and there are a lot of trolls that do it. I would be cautious about spreading this one until we can find some better evidence. Can anyone find more info that is not just a screenshot?  We don't want to look like gullible people, it doesn't help our cause.

              It took me less than 5 minutes to make this, I probably could have made it more convincing, if I would have spend more time on it

              Not saying that is proof this tweet is fake though. I'm just being cautious and letting people know tweets can be faked.

            I wonder if Al Pacino was referring to this drug addled vermin in the film
            <em>
             Heat
            </em>
            when he said, "Hi honey, guess what?  I walked into this house today where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave because it was crying too loud...".  I seem to remember this scenario occurring in the 1st series of
            <em>
             True Detective
            </em>
            as well.

             The role of Oliver was played by numerous child actors during the run of four years, including Gregory Bradley, James Daley, Ben Reynolds, Andrew James Michel, Jon Lee, David Watkins, Simon Schofield, Steven Webb, Justin Girdler, Steven Geller, Lee Honey-Jones, Brian O'Sullivan, Nathaniel Kelly, Adam Coleman, James Bourne, James Rowntree and Tom Fletcher, while the Artful Dodger was played by Adam Searles, Matt Johnson, Paul Bailey, Marcel McCalla, William Ullstein, Dax O'Callaghan, Sid Mitchell, Emory Ruegg, Adam Mead and Bronson Webb. The role of Bet was played by Danielle McCormack, Rosalind James, Francesca Jackson and Lindsey Fawcett.[9] The musical closed on 21 February 1998.[10] The role of Fagin was later played by many notable British actors and comedians including George Layton, Russ Abbot, Jim Dale and Robert Lindsay (who won an Olivier Award for his performance in 1997). Bill Sikes was later portrayed by Steven Hartley and Joe McGann, and Nancy by Sonia Swaby, Claire Moore and Ruthie Henshall.

             The show was a lavish affair and moved from its original intimate melodramatic feel to a more cinematic and symphonic feel that would accommodate an audience familiar with the 1968 motion picture. This production featured brand new music and lyrics written by Lionel Bart, and also additional dialogue not featured in the original script, added by Bart and Sam Mendes. Other updated elements include the addition of a prologue, in which the audience is witness to Oliver's harrowing birth. The dialogue was homage to both the 1948 and 1968 film versions of the story which were in turn based on the original novel. New music arrangements and dance sequences were added to various songs, most notably "Consider Yourself" and "Who Will Buy?". Tempos for some of the musical numbers were altered (notably "It's a Fine Life", "I'd Do Anything" and "You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two"), while other incidental numbers were drastically rewritten, including the London Bridge chase sequence. A new intermediate scene was added just after "You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two", in which Bill Sikes enters the Thieves' Kitchen and "negotiates" with Fagin.

             The Australian tour was a successful trip through Sydney, Melbourne, and Singapore from 2002 to 2004. The show, which mirrored Sam Mendes' production, was recreated by Graham Gill. John Waters played Fagin, Tamsin Carroll was Nancy, and the production also featured Stuart Wagstaff, Steve Bastoni and Madison Orr and Keegan Joyce in the title role, which was rotated between the two. The role of the Artful Dodger was shared between Mathew Waters and Tim Matthews, with Waters performing on the opening night. Waters declined the tour after the Sydney production to appear in the Hollywood movie Peter Pan.

             Afterwards, we go back to Allen's childhood in Tenterfield, Australia, where a young boy named Peter Woolnough is performing in local bars for money ("When I Get My Name in Lights"). Peter grows up and joins with Chris Bell to become the Allen Brothers, and they perform in Australian Bandstand ("Love Crazy"). After great success in Australia, the Allen Brothers perform in a Hong Kong Hilton hotel to Chinese businessmen. One evening, another person is watching them from the bar: the legendary Judy Garland. Peter convinces Judy to perform with them ("All I Wanted Was the Dream"), and Judy takes Peter to be the opening act in her concert in New York ("Only an Older Woman").

               Read Courteney Cox's twitter. Aside from this tweet very obviously not existing, she also amazingly uses correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar in every single one of them, while this one has numerous errors.

                Maybe it is a LARP. No need to be critical of my investigative techniques. I have no control over what leads me to something that is Pizzagate related. It's obviously pissed you off though. Why is that? Why so angry?

                 What did I ever say that indicated I was angry? It's simply amusing how wrapped up in all of this some of you are that you'll ignore the fact that something is blatantly false just to have an excuse to dig around and make some new connection.

                  Listen, I have no problem if this is false. I'm just wondering why you're calling my results a "wall of text" and not even considering the info within. Why are you here anyway if you don't like the way PG researchers think and research? Go back to Reddit.

                     The critical thinking issue is not on my end. You literally posted the synopsis and cast history of a musical that was an adaptation of a book about child laborers in industrial Britain, and found that one of the actors was also an actor in another show. If that screams pizzagate to you then that just further proves what I said earlier about just trying to find connections that don't exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Also funny how you're talking about critical thinking when any reasonable person's first thought would be that this tweet was probably fake.

                      You obviously didn't read it in its entirety. Do you even understand Wizard of Oz programming? Are you even able to grasp how Oliver Twist applies to what we're seeing today? Are you able to read between the lines of the song titles in
                      <em>
                       Oliver!
                      </em>
                      ? Do you understand the significance of the
                      <em>
                       Oliver!
                      </em>
                      being performed in Israel? You don't find it significant of an actor portraying characters in
                      <em>
                       Oliver!
                      </em>
                      and a play about a gay man as well as the Hollywood movie "Peter Pan"?

                       Again with the connections that don't exist. Oliver! has been performed in over 40 countries. No, I don't think there is any particular significance to Israel being one of them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And what about the song titles? I'd do anything? It's a fine life? Pick a pocket or two? It's pretty obvious that you haven't actually heard any of these songs, either.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And again, no, I don't find any particular significance in an actor/singer being in two different musicals. Especially since the only reason Oliver is of any significance to you is because you thought Courteney Cox referenced it while talking about microwaving babies. It's just all about making connections that simply aren't there.

                        I took a misspelling and researched. If you don't find it significant, fine. You've said your piece. Now, calm down and go back to Reddit.

                          You don't like the way I research, I get it. No need to mock it, unless it frightens you because I've had a lot of successful finds and this is how my brain works. I'm going to start looking into the people who have been in plays with children and see what I can dig up. I'll be sure to ping you when I post the thread.

                           It's not so much how you research as it is that you're so intent on finding conclusions that you will whether there's actually a conclusion to find or not. Have fun digging into children's plays, maybe you'll find something legitimate and maybe you won't. But you'll always know that the reason you became so convinced that there would even be something to find is because you thought Courteney Cox couldn't spell masturbate.

                            No, I took a bit of information and it led me down a trail that you don't agree with. On the surface, my research looks shaky, but you can look up my other threads and easily see that I take stuff that you and others don't see as significant and reveal that it is. Eyes to see and ears to hear. Sounds like you need some practice.

                              Here are three most recent threads of mine. Regardless of whether or not you agree with my conclusions, connections were made nonetheless that lead to the belief that something else is going on.

              A.) English-speaking sexually active educated adults know how to spell masturbate and use correct capitalization within their sentences. You can view all of her tweets and see no random capitalization of words in the middle of sentences in any of them.
             </p>
             <p>
              B.) This tweet doesn't and never did exist on her twitter. It's a screenshot created by a teenager using a tweet generator. Never trust screenshots of tweets, it's way too easy to make fake ones.

               Sorry for the lack of clarity. I meant that this is not the first time an Imgur album has been deleted. I don't know about the authenticity of the tweet.

                 I'm sorry this happened to you. The last time I remember it happening was when the young man who said he was raped by Alefantis uploaded the emails he'd received from Alefantis to Imgur, and then posted them here. They all disappeared very quickly. It seems like the powers that be are really hard at work to scrub information from the web now, much like they were in the early days of Pizzagate.
