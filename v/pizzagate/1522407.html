<p>More from this very mysterious world of Patti Paule-Carres and her many businesses. I homed in on PCS Enterprises, L.L.C. It was listed at 124 Amherst, the location of the one stop adoption services. Pattie and her husband giving what I’m assuming are mandatory counseling services. Here’s cursory foundation. Businesses listed at 124 Amherst: 
<a href="http://archive.is/sRDte">http://archive.is/sRDte</a> </p>
<p>Here’s Patti Paule-Carres’ registration of PCS Enterprises: 
<a href="https://sli.mg/a6wuKA">https://sli.mg/a6wuKA</a> </p>
<p>And where the business was taken over:
<a href="https://sli.mg/rryyCG">https://sli.mg/rryyCG</a></p>
<p>So Paule-Carres registered it on 04/28/05 and it was then taken over with the help of agent Paul Sherman who re-registered in on 09/21/15. Paule-Carres gave the address of 124 Amherst and Sherman gave: 2639 Kenmore Road, Richmond, VA, (<a href="http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2639-Kenmore-Rd-Richmond-VA-23225/12507149_zpid/">http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2639-Kenmore-Rd-Richmond-VA-23225/12507149_zpid/</a> ) (the property appears to have NOTHING to do with Sherman or Paul Smith I might add), but on the link giving the business history, we can see that PCS was doing business at 124 Amherst so it is Patti Paul-Carre’s original business. Note also that the description lists it under “business services”.  Now if you click on the business name, two employees come up: Paul Smith, Owner (SINCE 2011 – IMPORTANT) and Zach Godfrey, President. 
<a href="https://archive.is/D9ZYf">https://archive.is/D9ZYf</a> </p>
<p>If we click on Zach Godfrey’s name, his bio comes up. <a href="http://archive.is/IF3yL">http://archive.is/IF3yL</a> We can see that he indeed did work for Paule-Carre from 2000-2004. He was President of both PCS and his own company called myARCWorld. If we click on myARCWorld, we find that term that PCS was described as. It’s “Inclassifiable Establishments”. So that’s where it came from! </p>

<p>I decided to go hunting and try to track down what myARCWorld did and came upon this article:

<p>The business sounds pretty innocuous and tame. Other than the PC software and computers, it sounded like a Kinko’ on steroids, but what about PCS Enterprises? What business was that? Remember that Mr. Godfrey was the President for it before Paul Smith took it over. To find out about Smith and PCS, I went here: (You have to log in to see everything)

<p>Remember he worked for Hoch and Associates, and that he’s been involved with PCS Enterprises since 2011!!! Told you it would be important. So this info lines up with it being the right guy. Here’s what it says: 
[quote]PCS Enterprises, LLC
November 2011 – Present (5 years 2 months)Everett, Washington USA
PCS Enterprises provides consulting services and training in project management.</p>
<p>Developed detailed project plan for multimillion dollar facilities and equipment upgrade and production rate expansion for Boeing Tianjin Composites Company in Tianjin, China. Trained leaders and future project managers to complete the project.” [unquote]</p>
<p>WHOA!!! WTH did China come in? And note the address given … this time it’s Everett, Washington! Where is this business again? But the next problem is “Gusifer.” Why you ask? Well, I’m glad you did. Patti also registered a business in that name (as we pizzagaters know), and it just so happens … there’s this guy that posts on TripAdvisor and all these game sites that uses that name. Here he is on TripAdvisor giving reviews for restaurants in NICARAGUA: 
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/members-badgecollection/Gusifer">https://www.tripadvisor.com/members-badgecollection/Gusifer</a></p>
<p>He also claims he’s a journalist(?) (will try to find that page again), AND he likes to play games -- some involving flight simulation. So you tell me, what the chances that a guy named Gusifer just happens to post a question about FLIGHT SIMULATION on a site where a PAUL SMITH, and aviation specialist, is a moderator and answers him? Yes, they\'ve talked many times! </p>

<p>A Gusifer and the man who has taken over Patti\'s business are both real and both know each other and converse. So you guys tell me what’s going on? All a gigantic coincidence? Or was this business a front for something bigger? Planes, China, software, and computers … and to think Patti Paule-Carre, a family counseling specialist was involved in all that.</p>',

            I am not even going to pretend that I would know how to begin figuring out what I am trying to figure out, so what I'm stating here is just a random thought.  I may be way off.  I have tried to find proof, but I have no clue what to even look for.
  So, anyways, here's the only thing that I DO KNOW;When I was researching Bright Horizons last November, I was led to the prompt " people also searched for" and under that it said " Bright Horizons, Norwegian Cruise, 12 year old boy".  How totaly bizarre, right?  Well, being that Bright Horizons was started by a Clinton bundler, Linda Mason, who worked with children from Cambodia with US Aid/ Mercy Corp and a Republican Senator, Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, whose former Chief of Staff was suicided after he was about to make a plea deal on a distribution of child porn case, perhaps, I thought googling " Bright Horizons, Norwegian Cruise, 12 yr old boy" was not so strange .  Perhaps I was about to solve a crime.  And so I googled that.  It showed a Chinese website to Wanda hotels 198, 194, or 192.  I can't remember the number because I have since researched so many that I do not recall which one that connected me to.  Regardless, in the description, the text said some perverted stuff and mentioned a 12 yr old boy, so I said, " This must be it".
I was honestly only looking for any dirt on Sen Alexander because, as a dedicated anti nuclear activist, he is a mortal enemy that needs to retire before he kills the planet.  Well, I did not find that.  The website had nothing to do with him, Bright Horizons, Norwegian Cruises, but. There were people chatting in what looked like a Norwegian language, whatever that is ( lots of kk, JJ, when, ugen, ???) , and then if you scrolled down, the rest was in English and I only read two or three posts and that was the most disgusting talk I have ever seen.  They openly discussed their desires with children and I got the feeling it was more than just chat and pedo speak.  The site was encrypted, sort of, with prescription drug talk.  They were discussing clinical trial info and then in the middle of the paragraph, placing orders either for custom made child pornography OR children themselves. That's how it appeared.  The exact wording I can't recall. It was absolutely sickening.  One talked about very young children and it was too descriptive in a sick way, let's just say. I tried to get screenshots, but my memory was full, so I copied the link and posted it as a comment in a group called " Speak the Truth" on Fb because they were in the midst of a pizzagate discussion.  I was posting linkz about Ryan Loscarn( Sent. Alexander's suicided x chief of staff) and related links just to present another angle that needed research and That's where I posted the pedo link.  There were a couple people I believed to be law enforcement I n that discussion.  I said, " look into this."
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that was about Nov 11-14  or so because that's when my phone gets turned off each month, which is what happened afterwards.  So, when I paid my bill, I learned of this pedo bust in Norway of all places because it came up in my FB newsfed and notifications.  . I went back to look up that chatroom that I had semi- reported to the law enforcement that were monitoring that group where I put the link. and it was different. Now, there was nothing under the 12 yr old boy link, but one Chinese site of Wanda hotels had a description," 13 yr old cheer leader with an infectious smile". I went to it and screenshot everything that time, even though it was not the same at all, just lots of prescription drug talk and references to news involving Scalia, Trayvon Martin, some guy named SirCliff Richards that bad his  home searched in the UK, some dog show dog poisoning case in England,, a story about a snake that ate two little boys, LOTS OF WEIRD NEWS.  I'M guessing the FBI may have taken over the site, but who knows??   But the Norway bust happened already.  It happened maybe five days after I posted the link.  Five at the most.  Coincidence?  I don't think it's a coincidence because what they described was exactly what I found and I am guessing they had already been working on that.  Maybe they needed my tip to get those warrants?  Who knows?
           </p>
           <p>
            So, that said, what I can't stop wondering is;
 What if all those missing kids in Virginia were being custom ordered over that pedo chatroom by some sickos over in Norway? What if they got there by being flown or smuggled via " Bright Horizons Insights Scientific Cruises?  They have those, apparently.  I have no clue why a daycare company and cruise company would think to become partners.  That's the only connection I found between them.  And their stock rose the same 30% on the same day.
            <br/>
            Who was that Chinese businessman who brought all that cash to Clinton?  I forgot his name???  Maybe he was the middle man or maybe he bought organs from the leftover kids?  China is big time in the organ harvesting racket.  The black kids that go missing from Virginia would be big money for procruers of melanin.  I have been reading  a lot on that.  There are so many kids missing in Richmond, Alexandria, etc.  Waaaay too many!  I am desperately trying to find some connection between these, but I am stuck.  There's a Helping Hands inc. Which partners with Bright Horizons.  They're in Norway and it's some foundation connected to counseling " at risk youth". Is that where they stalk their prey?  I would be interested in knowing anything these missing children have in common. Any detail, but they do not even post their photos! Why not?  Every other state has photos!  They even make faces of skeletal remains in CA, but in Virginia, the agency that reports certain ones never includes a photo!  What is that reporting agency?  How can I find out?  I am not a professional internet researcher like quanto kitty, but I still want to help any way possible. H"ow can I go forward researching this hypothesis?  I am not having much luck.  Do you know of any details  that link the pedo bust in Norway to the Clinton Foundation?  The news is saying it's connected.  Is this possibly the connection?  Do pervs in Norway custom order kids that are then snatched up in Virginia by Pedosta?  He is a suspect to kidnapping Madeline McCann in Portugal, so you just never know.  If I did know, I'd say it.  I don't.  I am just trying to figure this whole thing out.  Thanks in advance for any help.

             Look, if you have a hypothesis, post it. Say you've found this and that and say you need help. You need to save the links, etc. Just archive them. I'm not an expert and don't quite know where people are getting that idea. I'm just a pizzagater that does searches ... the same as you. But the pizzagate community is great and you don't need all the answers. So just be very clear in what you've found, post it, and say you're looking for a link between A and B or A and D ... whatever it is ... and hope someone ... or a lot of someones ... pick up on it. Good luck.

            is merely a real estate holding company setup for the Paule-Carres in 2005 to allow a shared ownership over the equity of the office building. This is probably when the Paule-Carres allowed a more senior role for their business partner Joseph Daniel Petruso in their various partnerships operating out of this building.

            The name of the company is strange, but it only seems strange because 8 years later a hacker using a different spelling Guccifer caused mayhem in the US government, but without this, would any of us find this name particularly weird? Probably not. Just like

             No, no, no! That's not what that means. I posted this before. What that means is that she reported various addresses for the business, including a home address. Please stop with the disinformation. And is it possible that a guy in Nicaragua uses the name Gusifer and talks to a guy named Paul Smith who happens to be an aviation expert on flying a full plane loads from Newark to Zurich, I'd say it's impossible, but then I'm not paid to debunk and act like an idiot.

             For everyone truly interested in Pizzagate: The MO of these shills are to first contact you and pretend to be some sort of friend. Then they post garbage and try to obfuscate what you're saying. I guess the logic is that this "friendship" (that's developed over the whole thirty seconds it took you to write a DM back to them) is going to prevent you from calling them out.

              Yes, that's exactly what it means, because searching the same database for

              registered at 124 Amherst, does not show up in this database, because this database only shows companies that have real estate Titles registered against their assets. Searching this database for any of the other ~8 corps at 124 Amherst does not return a property value assessment, as does Gusifer LLC.

              That is entirely possible, yes. What I am asking for you to do, is provide a link between the Paule-Carres, and/or their Gusifer LLC, and the Paul Smith affiliated with the Nicaraguan Gusifer blogger, OTHER than the single BIZSTANDING scrambled record which is incorrect when checked against proper State based corporation databases. All I am asking is that you find more solid links before assuming that a Gusifer Nicaragua link with a Paul Smith who commented ONCE on a fight simulation blog, is at all connected with a Virginia based firm related to a real estate holding company simply using the same 7 letters as an identifier (Gusifer; on a planet with 7 billion people).
             </p>
             <p>
              As for assuming that I am not truly interested in Pizzagate or am a shill ... how dare you. I have spent much time here trying to get to the truth, and based on your M.O., you have called anyone who remotely--and even politely--attempts to clarify or correct any of your assumptions, a shill. People who resort to ad hominem attacks in their own defense when even confronted with slight criticisms, are WORSE than shills ... you are a damn disgrace towards the concept of TRUTH. Grow up.

             If you could find the web links it would help me greatly. I seem to have discovered a very strong link to a person strongly involved in Fridays Child formation and management, who has links to a cancer and HIV/AIDS research program/s running between Seattle and Kenya, who operates out of Winchester, Virginia. The reason I find this interesting, is that Paul Gary Smith is currently living and operating a PCS Enterprises, L.L.C, out of Seattle.

              It's perfect evidence because it's a report: Intercountry Adoption Programs and Waiting Child Photolistings. The woman writing is not connected to any of the agencies and is an objective party who questioned the advisability of photolisting children and also listing "EXTREMELY" personal information on the web. Like the child was a product of an incestuous relationship? I mean, why would you put that on a website with the child's pic? Anyway, good luck with this. Let me know when you post.

               I had already seen this particular PDF, and referenced it. What I was looking for was specific information on which 5 countries SFI were operating in. I thought you stated in previous comments that you had seen country specific affiliations, and I thought perhaps you could reference specifics?
              </p>
              <p>
               I have exhausted all channels of research available to me on SFI, and it is almost as if their overseas operations are/were either non-existent, or they were not very successful with their programs, but, as you say, this could be because privacy when it comes to legitimate adoption, or perverse trafficking posing as benevolent adoption services, is the norm. Too bad for the children concerned whose stories are lost to the concerned public or researchers.
              </p>
              <p>
               SFI Adoption and SFI Family Institute were purged and terminated around the year 2014, so they must have gotten shut down for some legal reason, totally un-referenced on web accessible news articles or bloggers etc...
              </p>
              <p>
               This thread is also buried now due to the dozens of marginal and sensationalist threads being posted, so the likelihood that anyone will add anything constructive here to further this line of inquiry, is very small. I wish people would focus on data accuracy and thoroughness, but I guess this is too much to ask from a forum frenzy of crowd sourced concernizens. Oh well ...

                The only thing marginal is you. This here is a stupid shill folks. This idiot first bonded with me and asked to send me a link for proof that SFI services was indeed servicing five different countries in terms of adoptions. I sent them this one:

               </p>
               <p>
                The reason this idiot did that is to see if the evidence could be refuted and debunked and twisted into the left wing pedophile narrative, but it couldn't. So instead, this idiot tries a different tack and goes on and on with nonsense that they already had this and yada yada yada. This is the last time I'm responding to you. Enjoy the few pennies you earned for being an idiot.

                 when they turn out to be false leads, is tantamount to being a shill; actually maybe worse, because at least a shill (by definition) would be getting paid to propagate faulty information.

                 The BIZSTANDING record for PCS Enterprises LLC, is bunk, it has merged interstate records with totally different business identification numbers (as bolus already patiently tried to bring to your attention, when you also called him a shill), and seems to be the whole basis of your assumptions. These assumptions melt when correct business databases at State level are consulted (such as the SCC Virginia database).

                 Fridays Child and SFI Adoptions may in fact glean useful leads, but the whole Gusifer and Paul Smith lead, doesn't seem to be much of a lead at all. I'm sorry if that screws with your agenda. Find some other connection between these entities and people other than the BIZSTANDING junk record, and I will reappraise the value of such a 'lead'. In professional research, this BIZSTANDING record is what is simply known as
                 <strong>
                  <em>
                   BAD INFORMATION,

                 </strong>
                 and any researcher worth their salt has to be prepared to lay away bad information, otherwise they will sabotage their own investigation. It isn't hard to understand. The record can be proven to be scrambled using multiple different resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In 2005 when Gusifer LLC was formed, Guccifer (different spelling) the Romanian lone wolf hacker, wasn't a known entity, so why is this name Gusifer somehow magically different to any other real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes ... like CONNEB II LLC? It has the Title records of 124 Amherst St attached to its assets, so it is obviously a real estate investment trust with probable shared ownership ... it is a medical/psychological practice for goodness sake, so it also would fit the profile for a shared business entity.

            Basically, you go in to sort out a substance problem, get registered, and then they come for your children to make a fee from cashed up adoptive parents. CPS also get bonuses for herding people who have been investigated into their clutches, and they work on quotas. Private clinics can tip off CPS and feed the victim families towards their competitors, unbeknownst to the victim that their children have been targeted outside of medical privacy conventions. It's a racket nationwide ... too many complaints in this industry to ignore that it is a racket.

            Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer and her husband were 'murder suicided' precisely because Nancy wouldn't give up her fight to reform this industry to take financial incentives out of it. Some people make a

            from this adoption industry - not to mention whatever else goes on like disappearing children for rituals or organ trafficking, though I believe the majority of the organ trafficking involved undocumented foreigners.

            So, he works with homosexuals, some with AIDS, and drug addicted people, which is Glenn Paule-Carres and Slavin's specialty, other than adoption. Take note of the Shenandoah Counseling Associates as a prior, because the Paule-Carres have Shenandoah Family Institute Inc, and SFI Adoption Services LC as registered businesses at 124 Amherst.

            It would seem to me that John Penn Turner and the Paule-Carres have a tag team perhaps between their respective substance abuse and psychological practices, and their adoption services? ... Feeding each others businesses between Winchester and Charlottesville in Virginia, in order to avoid a conflict of interests? I've seen this elsewhere when looking at adoption services.

            Interestingly, if you follow the highways between Winchester and Charlottesville, you go through Culpeper, Virginia, where the Finders cult had its HQ, owned by Marion Pettie (a CIA affiliated spook), on over 600 acres just off of State Route

            . I wonder if these people have a Finders history? The Finders were always looking for ways to infiltrate organizations where they could appropriate children to induct into the cult, shuttling them too and from Washington DC.

             I thing sexual preference is pretty important when we are talking about adoption services. Canada did a study and found that 25%+ of homosexual couples in Canada who adopted children had

              1 year prison for slamming a 3yr old's head into a wall ... no wonder other countries are removing support for US adoption programs lately. So SFI wasn't involved with Dmitry, but since this was in Virginia, Friday's Child may have been the domestic placement agent. The case was tried in Fairfax, Va., which is within the Friday's Child domain. In this case, the domestic, rather than the inter-country, would have been responsible for identifying a negligent tendency on behalf of adopted parents. There was no indication that the act was deliberate though, and seems to be simply gross negligence, though the father was acquitted of manslaughter, which greatly pissed off the Russian's, who would have jailed a person for such an act against a child--from what I've read they are severe on crimes against minors.

              Thanks for the reply. Fantastic work. Yeah, I'd have to check my notes and original post, but II believe Russian adoptions were mentioned for the international adoptions. The whole thing seems suspicious, especially the formation of businesses. Deserves more digging.

            One other thing I noticed looking back at Gusifer joining flight sim group. He joined April 2011 and Smith has been a member since 1969 unless that is typo.  So did they connect from flight group prior to Smith buying biz from Gusifer in Nov 2011? Coincidence? Seems everything in PizzaGate is just a coincidence!

             were you able to find any more conversations between smith and gusifer on that site than just the one qk linked?  i can only find the one, and the gusifer the account is linked to doesn't appear to be related to the paule-carres family at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             if you saw more conversations, please share them - gusifer claimed that he's a pilot, and this could be a valuable connection.

            I'll be cynical. Why is a guy who's trained up to the hilt in pharmaceutical chemistry, suddenly traveling to Spain to learn Spanish and getting ingratiated into Spanish speaking soccer networks, though wanting to open a youth soccer training enterprise in Detroit? Admittedly he seems like a big soccer fan, but if one were going to court the families of youths in Spanish speaking South and Central America (where the majority of black market organs are obtained), where children's births aren't so well documented, in order to 'bring them to the U.S.' , for an established youth soccer program, it would perhaps make it easier to procure 'the goods'? Is this just another cover operation like the 'Dominican orphanage' of Laura Silsby? Also, adopting these children to rich western families that don't have children is another potential source of big $'s.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know one thing. If you want to get close to children in Mexico or Guatemala, it helps if you are a cashed up gringo who plays soccer, and who offers a soccer program for disadvantaged children in Detroit ... it would also help you get close to disadvantaged black children in the Detroit ghetto's.

            for clients that had gotten illegal organ transplants? You have to take special transplant meds for the rest of your life, so this would also be an ongoing stream of income, for every black-market organ sale, to any enterprise that can organize an operation. It would seem to me that perhaps these Paule-Carres have trained their son to take over an established franchise from his father and mother at some point?

             Thanks! I totally agree re: Michael Paule-Carres. It makes no sense. Why would he do that? I don't buy for one minute that he cares about disadvantaged youth. If he did, he'd get mom, pop and his relatives to open up their purse strings and finance job training, etc. Reverse the situation. Prince Harry announces he cares about NYC disadvantaged youth and is going to Brooklyn to teach them how to play basketball. Yup, that'll help them and their families out! Put that guy on the list!

             If you have a transplant, and you undergo radiation / chemo treatment that completely destroys your immune system, then the organ is implanted, your rebooted immune system accepts it without rejection. By the same token if a organ donor undergoes this treatment, then the organ should take up the immune system of the recipient. Without need of immune suppressant drugs.?

              No idea on that one, I only know that for most people the DRUG$ cost them lots of money for the rest of their lives, and if you got an illegal undocumented transplant overseas, you can't just walk into your MD's and ask for a script when your medical records don't indicate you got a transplant. Such things are investigated by the FBI.

               But if the kids are kidnapped here and organs sold elsewhere, then how would the FBI know about, let's say, someone in Isral, Saudi Arabia, or China , or India getting an organ from a missing kid from Detroit or Virginia?    I don't think the organs are coming. From the foreign kids.  They are more valuable alive as accessories to celebrities like Madonna.  You know?   What do the missing kids in Detroit have in common?  I am curious if they went to any soccer camps?  Hmmmmm?  Soccer camp is a good cover story for a lot of illegal things, if that's what's going on here.

             Bingo! Upvoat for you. They're even talking about Hawaii ... ostensibly about this flight "simulation", but what better place than to communicate something's going wrong. For instance they're talking about two pilots disappearing. The reviews might also be signals. It's so much easier than trying to hide something. As we've seen, emails can be hacked, but posting openly? Nobody pays any attention because they're talking about the game!

            Pedophilia may just be one of the many ways to monetize unwanted humans for this gaggle of alleged criminals. Organ trafficking to match orders would be the most profitable I would think.

            , may I ask you to to add a tl;dr summary of your findings at the top of your post? Technically your submission doesn't violate rules, but it's difficult to make out the connection to Pizzagate.

             It is? I thought "Gusifer" was a large part of it? And Patti Paule-Carres is Podesta's cousin. Yeah, I guess I can summarize it. I thought the link to the previous post would do that, but what do I know? Sure.

              We're only talking about a few sentences here, and it's much appreciated if you add those. It helps people process the complex information you're offering. Assuming that people understand why and how your findings are relevant is never a good thing, rule 1 is largely about this. We needed that so that readers don't need to spend a lot of time getting up to speed with a given topic or thread of investigation. Without this requirement, it's easy to exhaust users who are being bombarded with all kinds of complex information, including disinformation, as part of their efforts to understand and further the investigation. Thanks for understanding.

            "Software" might be important for being able to falsify computerized government birth, health, education and vaccination records, etc - giving a child the "appearance" of legitimacy, even as they might show up "missing" elsewhere in another system.

            Planes (aerospace industry) - DOH!  China - DOH! Computers - DOH!
           </p>
           <p>
            So quite possibly they were hacking into Chinese government records, falsifying, and then leaving with/transporting kids, all with "legit" paper, which could then SERVICE the "adoption" agency who was trafficking in stolen/bought/unwanted kids... and the aerospace industry is basically CIA, so sort of a new variation on the old "One Child Policy", with a twist.

            have to be very careful when connecting businesses by registered agent - that's a good catch that paul smith is listed in there, and it was listed as a single owner...that seems important.
           </p>
           <p>
            here's what i see, though - tell me what you think.  one of the other businesses listed at the 124 amherst address is "Prisma Counseling Services, PLC" associated with Wendy Jean Werner.  I strongly suspect that Prisma = PCS.
           </p>
           <p>
            the virginia listing of PCS  Enterprises L.L.C. is for patti, but PCS Enterprises LLC is for paul.  I think it's an unfortunate coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            (unless you can show me where you see the 'business history'.  i see that the L.L.C. has been canceled, and the LLC version has an entirely new articles of organization in 2015.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Prisma has an articles of organization in 2016.

             I didn't connect the businesses through the registered agent. I merely stated the registered agent's name was Paul Sherman. As for the Prisma Counselng, no, the PCS Enterprises name and business was taken by Paul Smith. Look on the links I gave. And naturally the business was not renewed since Paul Smith took over the. As far as I know, Wendy Jean Werner didn't create a business named Gusifer, Paule-Carres did. The fact that Paul Smith and Gusifer regularly converse is so very odd. I have no idea where you're going with throwing in all this other stuff. PCS Enterprises is the name of the company. It was listed at 124 Amherst. Paul Smith is listed at that address. This is complicated enough without throwing red herrings in there.

              Well, prisma counseling services is registered at the 124 amherst address also, and its initials are pcs.  It follows that the two entities are both tied together somehow...perhaps to intentionally hide the pcs enterprise connection.   I agree that the smith/gusifer conversations are a good lead...and i thought i said that...that name doesn't just randomly pop up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look through the va registry for just pcs...lots of entities, unfortunately.

             further - here's a link to another PCS enterprises from 2001 in texas, showing mr. zachary godfrey as president.

            </p>
            <p>
             either - PCS Enterprises is a coordinated shell game which has existed for longer than the 124 amherst location, OR Patti chose the name independently of the other PCS Enterprises, and that business listing site is just confused.
            </p>
            <p>
             50:50 odds, i guess - your best bet is to try to tie paul smith/zachary godfrey back to 124 amherst through a second source (not referring to PCS enterprises) or directly back to Paule-Carres some other way.

              Seriously, you are an idiot. Did you even READ my damn post?!!!! I include Zach Godfrey in there. It's is not ANOTHER PCS, he's listed as President and working at 124 Amherst (or being an employee), from 2000-2004. Here's the link that I posted in the original post that you did not even read and yet you're trying to debunk?!!!!

              <p>
               Zach is registered as the president of another pcs enterprises in Texas in 2001. (Follow my archived link above )
              </p>
              <p>
               That he's associated with the Virginia pcs indicates that its a broad coordinated effort, and I'm suggesting that we should find another connection between all three of them.   I'm sure it's there.

                I see your point about PCS Enterprises being a common LLC name, and also its existence in multiple states being seemingly unconnected with the one begun by Patti Paule-Carres in 2005. It seems that Zach Godfrey gave up on his Texas LLC which operated from 2001-2004, then founded All Resources Consulting Group LLC in 2004, then launched myARCworld in 2005; See pg 43-46 of this pdf for myARCworld company overview

                </a>
                (which is the only linking evidence) is just scrambled info--a case of low quality info, quite common in research--because Smith's PCS Ent., LLC, is a Texas corp, as you say, and predates the Amherst St Virginia corp, thus he couldn't have worked for Paule-Carres ... also, the Sherman LLC is a totally different SCC number, and is simply a similar core name registration after the Paule-Carres entity had lapsed from being active.
               </p>
               <p>
                There also isn't any evidence that the Paul Smith from Texas of myARCworld is the same Paul Gary Smith in Everett (Seattle) ... it would seem that PCS Enterprises is just a common name to register a business under.
               </p>
               <p>
                We would need further connections between specific Smith's and the Paule-Carres to make any solid conclusions ... though the GUSIFER LLC is rather curious, considering it was setup in March 2005, only 1 month before the PCS Enterprises LLC ... both being Patti Paule-Carres entities, and both being the only corps attached to this family which are unexplainable in regards to the products/services they dealt in. All very strange ... but I have a feeling the clarifications will come from further research regarding the various child adoption agencies they were operating.

              Look, I have no idea what you're doing. You're obfuscating facts and I'm wondering why because you aren't that smart. The business PCS Enterprises was registered in 2011. That's when the business was filed in VA with a FAKE address. Paul Smith was not at that home according to records. Another person lived there. So to go with your disinformation/shill theory: Paul Smith wanted to name a business PCS Enterprises, L.L.C. Patti Carres-Smith just happened to have not renewed hers so Paul Smith decided to register the business using a fake address and then become a moderator on a flight simulation board that just happens to have a gamer from Nicaragua named Gusifer another of Patti's businesses. And, no, Gusifer is not Patti's husband. You know, if you're a shill, I hope they're not paying you because you suck at it.

              that's a lot.  and oc is usually good about associating branches, so it
              <em>
               appears

              that these are all meant to be seen as individual organizations.

             <p>
              Wouldn't surprise me at all if they were all affiliated somehow - like i said, a coordinated shell game - but that just means we need to find the common tie before we head down any one of their rabbit-hole-leads.  the Gusifer user-name on trip advisor has me almost more intrigued.  you don't just pull that name out of a hat.  if we can find another link to nicaragua (and i think it'd be glenn - the reviews are written from a husband's perspective) that might be interesting to follow.
