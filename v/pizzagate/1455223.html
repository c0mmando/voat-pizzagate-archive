            This is highly concerning and should be a warning sign to all of us! We have to be vigilant and should consider risks carefully. This now is the next stage of our battle. The opposition is forced to act they can't ignore this any longer. They are going to be be smart, well organised and sly about it. Remember it's a game they have been playing for a long time and there defence is going to be close to impeccable. They are going to cherry Pick a bunch of silly "nutjobs" to humiliate them on television (and it's going to be hilarious), thinking we could achieve anything using their medium is delusional. They have a lot of dirt on this guy, they'll make an example of him to discredit all of us.
           </p>

            this is the link to the Video:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM47hhSkDBk">

            </a>
            I watched a number of his videos which are on the most part well researched and factual. But on the other hand although i wouldn't call him an extremist he made some troublesome remarks regarding violence and homosexuality, this guy has several channels with hundreds of videos. This should give the Media plenty enough to make him look like a Terrorist-Hitler-Gayhating-Fascist-Antichrist they need so desperately to give the people someone to hate and distrust other than the media. What we have to take away from this is that we have to stay factual, calm and reposed, don't give them free leverage (the guy posted Images of himself on Facebook with guns in both hands)!
           </p>
           <p>
            The opposition can frame you, produce fake evidence etc. they are able to tap unlimited resources. But we have the Advantage of numbers, legitimacy, critical thinking, actual Journalism and an overwhelming amount of Evidence that keeps piling up. If we stick to our guns (internet, journalism, anonymity, free speech(or what is left of it)) and keep the ball of information rolling, it eventually will become an avalanche of such a growth it can't be stopped.
