<p>Due to the fact that so many states have lenient surrogacy laws that will allow for someone to act as a surrogate for their own child and simply take a fee to adopt out their own baby, this website would be a great place to look for more information on which states have the most lenient laws.

<p>I once knew a woman on Facebook who quite literally went through a surrogacy pregnancy &amp; sold her own child (not the intended parents\'  / couple\'s genetic child) a few days after she was born to a couple in Florida that she didn\'t know simply because she felt compassion for them wanting to have a baby and they &quot;couldn\'t.&quot; </p>
<p>I\'m not sure what the typical surrogacy case looks like and I hope most of the adoptive parents aren\'t like that, but I know from my research that many countries ban surrogacy as it is considered selling children there. It\'s possible that there are women being coerced into &quot;surrogacies&quot; or who are being forced into baby farms as breeders, or who are being promised large fees to go through a pregnancy and then perhaps not paid? Seems like a potentially legal way to obtain children you care nothing about and use them for your own sick purposes.</p>',

            Surrogacy is rich people exploiting and taking advantage of vulnerable women. Don't want to carry your own child and rich?  Easily fixed. Just get a poor woman who needs the money to carry a child for you; rent out her womb; subject her to all the risks of pregnancy; buy her body for your own selfish needs.  I have no doubt that surrogacy laws are exploited for pedophiles.   Thank goodness that the law, up until now, has said that rent-a-womb parents (many same sex couples) can have only parental responsibilities, but that the 'parents' are always the women giving birth.   A gay couple recently went to court wanting parental rights taken from the mother and given to them.  The judge ruled that the gay couple could have only 'parental responsibilities'.
