            Okay. Let's look at "The 'Pizzagate' Four (PG4)"
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The Podesta brothers: Italian/Greek descent, Catholic, both married women
            </li>
            <li>
             Hilary Clinton: Methodist, married Bill
            </li>
            <li>
             James Alefantis: Gay, unknown religious views so he might be a Jew!
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Since 3/4 are married the opposite sex and their publicly known religious beliefs are Christian based. Maybe we should be filling Youtube with anti-Christian, anti-Mediterranean and anti-straight marriage speech instead?
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem, Hagen1, is that when 95% of Youtube comments related to pizzagate within the past month or so are about Jews. I'd say that over half of the people that I've talked to about pizzagate recently that have done some "research of their own" said they dismissed it because it looked like just another crazy blood libel thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            And honestly? If I had been introduced to pizzagate with a lot of the crap I've seen lately, I would have thought the same damn thing and dismissed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to make it clear that pizzagate is about the mountain of evidence pointing to child sex trafficking, ritual abuse, and cyber crime in global political powers around the world and the massive organized coverup by the MSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to explain the Jewish connection, make your argument about it here, backed with evidence. If it's good enough, it can be archived and have a section in a sticky.

            Yeah I've noticed a lot of schizo posers on YouTube posting flat-earth and illuminati stuff in the comments and making intentionally shitty videos to make us look stupid.
