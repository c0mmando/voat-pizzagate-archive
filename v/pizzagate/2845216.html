<p>Conclusion: Based on these, we can summize why Islamic culture treats women like shit and believes in punishing the victim of rape. It is projection at its finest. Projection of their own inability to control their sexual urges, as seen whenever the muslim migrants reek havoc in non muslim countries.</p>
<p>Now, on to the main event, exposing our Sharia Shill as a pedo and a scum bag, thus unfit for a sub dedicated to opposing rape and pedophilia. <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> <a href="https://voat.co/u/think-">@think-</a> <a href="https://voat.co/u/srayzie">@srayzie</a> <a href="https://voat.co/u/Shizy">@Shizy</a> feel free to bring up any similar incidents regarding our resident Sharia Shill.</p>

<p>Why does he constantly push for Islamic culture to replace European culture? It is likely that it is because Sharia is his only hope of ever getting any. He needs Sharia and its idea of forced marriage for no sensible woman would ever want to be with a pig. Bestiality is no longer in vogue, so he’s shit out of luck.</p>

           This is systemic. Wherever Islam seems to go, rape statistics sharply rise. This is what happens when men who regard women as subhuman are allowed into a country. Where such vile treatment IS the law.

           Three recent threads regarding Islamic rape/pedo rings.
          </p>
          <p>
           Conclusion: Based on these, we can summize why Islamic culture treats women like shit and believes in punishing the victim of rape. It is projection at its finest. Projection of their own inability to control their sexual urges, as seen whenever the muslim migrants reek havoc in non muslim countries.

           Now, on to the main event, exposing our Sharia Shill as a pedo and a scum bag, thus unfit for a sub dedicated to opposing rape and pedophilia.

           Why does he constantly push for Islamic culture to replace European culture? It is likely that it is because Sharia is his only hope of ever getting any. He needs Sharia and its idea of forced marriage for no sensible woman would ever want to be with a pig. Bestiality is no longer in vogue, so he’s shit out of luck.

           Donkey claims to be white yet wants white culture replaced by muslim culture. The word I’m looking for is “race traitor” right? That is IF he is actually white at all. Given Taqiyya, its possible he’s lying about being white.

           Donkey saying that violent rape is the right thing to do, praising muslims for doing it. Also says “if it bleeds it breeds”. Refer back to Appendix 3 proving this is complete horse shit.

            Religion is one of the most common themes among pedophiles. There are a lot of sanctimonious religious fanatics on here who pretend that people of their religion aren't fucking kids, and that it's just "Satanists." Religion is just as big a problem as that of kid-fuckers. Both are destroying the world from the inside out, and both are stifling evolution. "

            What you are too dim to understand is that every worthless street-rat tramp, as almost all "grooming victims" (i.e. prostitutes) are, was sadly never going to benefit our race anyway and their every additional one in the papers brings us closer to the Race War that I prefer happen SOONER rather than LATER when the average age of a white man is 55 years old while the Muslims are 20.

             Conclusion: Based on these, we can summize why Islamic culture treats women like shit and believes in punishing the victim of rape. It is projection at its finest. Projection of their own inability to control their sexual urges, as seen whenever the muslim migrants reek havoc in non muslim countries.

           <p>
            Punishing a rape victim is supremely logical.  It's called a deterrent: girls shouldn't be drunk around strange men or invite them into their homes, period.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is precisely the Islamic culture I want in Europe: the one like our forefathers had.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             An engagement may be arranged between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (wali), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or performed under coercion is illegal according to the majority of scholars.

           <p>
            So apparently it's not acceptable under Sharia and you totally made that up, with the same low effort you simply threw this out there: Use of physical violence against women as part of a forced marriage seems to be a standard tactic.  LOL!

            I did not know this. This is alarming and outrageous behavior for this subverse, because we here stand for the truth that child-sex is intrinsically evil and that children must be protected above all other members of society. The Muslim cult truly is an evil institution, "Ye shall know them by their fruits."

             You must not have been around for very long then. I was here since the first Reddit migration and he's been an a piece of human excrement this entire time. At first I brushed him off as a pubescent troll, the kind that hangs around on 4-chan, watches my little pony friendship is magic to be "ironic", and dreams that one day he might have sex. But you'd think a kid that age would have gotten bored at this point, or had his trolling interrupted by mommy insisting that THIS will be the year he gets a job, at least bagging groceries or SOMETHING, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CONTRIBUTE. But no. I think the truth is probably a lot more sinister. Thanks for the post, OP. Good work.

              I haven't been around that long, I've been following Pizzagate for about 8 months or so now. My first exposure to Pizzagate was that it was most likely fake, and so I researched into it and discovered the opposite. Also, I don't really think MLP is a bad thing, just most of the fans of the show who've been brainwashed by "inclusivity" and LGBT propaganda, which is where the show is now slightly heading (which is very sad and disgusting). Like any show, the fans are by far the most disturbing part and I wish they didn't exist, or at least wouldn't turn the best parts of these pieces of art into sexual themes or worse. It's quite evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't think it's right to attack young males who's mothers can  let go of them and babied them their whole life (like my mother), it's usually the fault of the mother that these males are down in those basements to begin with. The boys never were made to work. It's quite debilitating let me tell you.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the people who are pro-child-sex have either evil intentions or have undergone extensive leftist brainwashing. I think this guy could also be on the (CIA) payroll to "troll" these forums, it's easy enough to do and wastes time.

             Not Classy! Handled by men, and mature, competent women.I am still the same un-popular person .Donkey claims to be white yet wants white culture replaced by muslim culture. No one can beat the racial challenge with Yog, because they would have to be transported off the Rez. I am from The USA, and you are not. Let that ring in your bell you stupid ***'s.

            He has told me several times that women should be thrown in a dungeon and raped, as young as 12 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            He hates white American women the most. He told me he would marry a Muslim woman, they are much more decent. He doesn’t think that it’s pedophilia to have sex with a girl once she starts puberty.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said that it’s better for a kid to be in foster care, even if molested, than to be raised by a single mother.
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s just some of the awful things that he has said. The only group of people he defends are Muslims. He hates Jews and whites. The list goes on...
