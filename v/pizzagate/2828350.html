            We should be checking the backgrounds of all of the AGs that spearhead these investigations.  Some can prosecute and some can't.  Why are they heading them if they can't prosecute?  So far I have found 3 that are questionable and am working on a 4th.  Kamala Harris, Karl Racine, Lisa Murray Madigan (she was adopted at the age of 20) yes I just typed that, and the 4th is Josh Hawley of St. Louis who also can't prosecute.I believe these lists will come up short.  We now have seen the former nun Whistle Blower of Buffalo saying she found a huge list of priests in the closet of Bishop Malone.  Hmm.  Nothing to see here folks.  Thank you for posting this list.  It is a good start.

              She was adopted by Michael Madigan.  He rules Illinois.  She is the daughter of a now dead mafioso.  You can't make this stuff up.  While looking her up I saw that she will not running for this election so I wonder who will take over.  Evidently whoever wins.  Another runaround.

               It really is amazing how much the internet has allowed us to find out.  Before the net they could get away with this stuff pretty easily bc the media was on the take. They got lazy and now they are about to pay for it bc knowledge is power and the people have access to knowledge now.  It is a good time hopefully we can use it to make legit change before they are able to shut it down.

                This is my fear.  They shutdown.   Many are awake now but the ones that are not are so ingrained with misinformation and the politically correct jargon that it scares me to death.  They seem to be frozen in time and totally out of it.

                 Honestly I was hella asleep, it was my son who woke me with the Franklin Coverup.  Johnny Gosch went missing when I was a kid and it really affected me as a child so that hit me on a soul level I guess you would say.  Once his name was brought up I couldn't stop researching and the more I found out the more upset it made me.  I have so much respect for his poor mother.  That woman is a legend.

                  Horrible story and there were many.  We all have something that scared us so much it changed our lives.  Some say Johnny Gosch is still alive.  Who knows.  I hope his Mother finds some peace.  Good that you are awake and good that your son clued you in.  It's usually the other way around.

                   As much as people like to talk about milliules ( nowhere near spelling that right) they really area  generation that is very aware of what is going on in large part.  I mean growing up with the internet has made them different and now they are adults we are seeing the results of children having instant access to information.  Things are gettting very interesting I think.  Don't count this generation out at all.

                    I know a few who's brains are so drenched with the democrat jargon and refuse to accept what I say and say I am heading to the wrong sites.  Little do they know that I research both sides.  I know that they don't do that.  They just read right wing statements and count them out and immediately check it out on their sites.  Ugh.  I am not beholding to any side and know they are all on the same page Dems and Rep.  We are  all a big joke to them.

             Similar subject, different thought. The Southern Baptist Convention maintains a central administrative organization in Nashville, Tennessee. Might try finding connections between the mentioned priest in the article and members within the SBC. Likely to have connections to fashion and/or art as well. The "bible belt" has a lot to hide, below the waist.........

              All of this sounds as if it connects to what Georgia Tann started in Tn.  A Notorious Trafficker I just stumbled on because of the name of a book someone gave me.  Before You Were Mine.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tann">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tann
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Georgia Tann (born Beulah George Tann; July 18, 1891 – September 15, 1950) was an American child trafficker who operated the Tennessee Children's Home Society, an adoption agency in Memphis, Tennessee. Tann used the unlicensed home as a front for her black market baby adoption scheme from the 1920s until a state investigation into numerous instances of adoption fraud being perpetrated by her closed the institution in 1950. Tann died of cancer before the investigation made its findings public.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tann used pressure tactics, threats of legal action and other methods to take children from their birth parents, mostly poor single mothers, so she might sell them to her wealthy patrons. Tann also arranged for the taking of children born to inmates at Tennessee mental institutions and those born to wards of the state through her connections.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tann also arranged kidnappings. In some cases, single parents would drop their children off at nursery schools, only to be told that welfare agents had taken the children. In others, children would be temporarily placed with the society because a family was experiencing illness or unemployment, only to find out later that the Society had adopted them out or had no record of the children ever being placed. Tann was also documented as taking children born to unwed mothers at birth, claiming that the newborns required medical care. When the mothers asked about the children, Tann told them that the babies had died, but they were actually placed in foster homes or adopted.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sound familiar?  She may have just started the whole CPS stealing of Children.  I bet the Clinton's stole her plan.  Wouldn't be surprised if they knew about it.  Remember Lamar Alexander?  We at one time had a thread about him and Bob Keeshan (Captain Kangaroo), they owned a string of daycares.  I think they all took from Tann's playbook including the Churches.

               Was Georgia Tann a member of the Order of the Eastern Star? Any relationship to the Price or Morris family names in TN?
              </p>
              <p>
               CPS is crooked in TN, as in many other states.
              </p>
              <p>
               Order of the Eastern Star(I must note most members are likely great people and in no way knowingly participating.) members and their affiliated Rainbow Girls organization are woven into the CPS systems in TN. Also, their members are CASA workers, kinship program families/foster families. The money involved is what tempts most people. OES or otherwise, to foster a child. OES members run many PR campaigns and are part of many anti-trafficking organizations, globally. OES people were exposed in Australia for Satanic ritual abuse of some high profile cases(I'm sure you know of the one.).
              </p>
              <p>
               OES is a huge masonic order with tons of people in all sectors of society, all across the globe. No one seems to like it when I point out this aspect of the CPS/trafficking children crap.

                I have heard of Eastern Star but don't know if she was a member.  She was connected to a Judge (a woman) that did much of her dirty work for her in the courts and I believed they may have been lovers.  There could be people related to this judge (name escapes me now)  that have continued with this lucrative illegal business.  I have not done further research on this.  Was even thinking of doing a post on her, but am now researching the AGs that are going to investigate the diocese of the states.  I don't think they may be going to look the other way or helping to cover up names. I will have to look into this OES  and the Rainbow Girls (what a name).

                 That judge was likely OES. All judges are masonic.(doesn't mean they are all crooked though.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Rainbow Girls are a christian based group. Mostly really good for empowering young women, but through my personal run in with OES members. I discovered an OES member, her niece was head Rainbow Girl and the CPS investigator messing with my life was Rainbow Girl as well. Which is why she ignored all CPS laws(24 hour background check for a kinship application.)and took a family member of mine, left that member in the care of an OES member(who wasn't a foster parent, nor approved kinship program member.)

                  Any kind of experience with CPS would frighten me.  What happened to the family member?  I hope they are safe now.  These cases are so painful for families and horrendous.  The site Medical Kidnap is full of those stories.  I hope to God your situation had a good ending finally.  Rainbow.  The now have hijacked that name.  LGBTQ has claimed the Rainbow that was attributed to Jesus.

                   The judge over my nieces truancy case, recused himself from the case when she accused me of molestation. IDK if it had to do with masonic crap, personal reasons, whatever. He had dealt with my niece and all four of her brothers for many years.

                    Wow.  I wonder if he was masonic and since the woman was OES he had to recuse.  That's really some story.  I hope that family finds the right path.  But your niece is proof that time and love will make a world of difference.  I want to thank you for sharing your story and hope that your medical issues have improved.

                  <p>
                   I had a teen niece dropped at my doorstep when her step father got sick of her and her mother was in prison(my sister).
The girl was a handful to say the very least. Truancy issues took me to juvenile court many times over the two years I kept her.
I had a level three case worker involved. The girl had over twenty cps cases involving her alone(I didn't know that when she was abandoned in my life. I was never around her or her four brothers much.). That level three worker turned me onto many great programs and stuff for trying to help the girl.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The girl liked to lie to me and go to places with heavy gang activity. I caught her many times in many lies. I tried my best to keep her away from certain areas. Later I found out, one of her friends mother was a mason with OES. She had known my niece since my niece was 8. I tried my best to keep my niece away from the area where that OES woman lived. VERY heavy gang activity, drugs, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   My niece pulled a stunt to purposely injure herself. She had stitches in her foot. She pulled them out, knowing I couldn't get her back to the hospital(money was very tight.) The girl told me her friends mom was a nurse. So I reluctantly gave into allowing the woman around. She seemed decent. My nieces attitude changed within a week of me allowing her around that woman and her friend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The first day of school, my niece decided to not answer phone calls. She was by law a runaway after 24 hours. I left messages on the OES womans, daughters phone. That I would be reporting my niece to the police, if she didn't return home. That first day of school, I called the police. I reported her. Told them what I knew of where my niece was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That OES woman took my niece to cps and tried to get power of attorney, behind my back. I had temporary custody, due to the truancy issues. CPS called me when my niece and that OES woman were there. I told CPS I reported my niece as a runaway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That evening, a cps investigator called me around 8pm asking if I would allow my niece to stay in that OES womans care. I said no. My niece is a runaway. Lock her up or bring her home. After that, around 9pm or so, the investigator called me back and all the bull began. My niece accused me of molestation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I spoke with a child detective in metro. He said he had never heard of any kinship allowed in less than 24 hours. That OES woman was given kinship over my niece in three hours.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I dealt with around four months of bull, jumping through hoops, sitting in family court listening to lies. Having a cps lawyer try to manipulate any word I spoke.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   On the day of my "hearing". I told the judge I wouldn't participate. I wouldn't swear on a bible. They were denying me my legal right to an attorney. The judge kept saying I was only the "guardian" not the "parent" so the courts didn't have to provide me one(knowing I was jobless. I helped care for my 75yr old disabled mother and my 37yr old downs sister.) I'm bipolar/manic depressive/ schizophrenic(high functioning) I informed the judge I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY RIGHT TO an attorny is being denied. The judge finally understood what I meant when I told him my mental diagnosis. No charges were brought against me. I've never been arrested. Never spent a day in jail. Nothing happened to me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Here is the point I made to the judge after sitting through the entire embarrassment of listening to all the crap my niece was saying about me, in a room full of people and the judge.
My niece claimed on a sworn affidavit that she had a prescription for loratabs. (I caught the girl stealing some of her grandmothers once.I had looked into that OES womans life. It's how I discovered she is OES. I found the drug connections to her gang member brother. Her old man running them through a car lot. I can go on and on, but this is where my niece was getting loratabs from.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The judge ask my niece about that prescription..........my nieces rehearsed lies and calm voice cracked as she tried to think up lies for the judge, not knowing how much I discovered about that OES womans life. I seen it in the judges eyes. He seen how much a liar my niece is and how fast she tries to manipulate others with lies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   My niece was placed in state care at 16 for about 6 months. Her mother got out of prison. I done everything I could to help my sister get her daughter out of state hands. My niece is now 19. She has a boyfriend and they have a place of their own. I've seen my niece about four times since the crap I went through. I know my niece is sorry for putting me through it all, but she and I have said very little to one another on the few times I was at my sisters(who now cares for my elderly mother)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I forgave my niece the moment it all began. Maybe someday she will look back and finally understand what I tried teaching her. I can love you without liking you. I can forgive you without forgetting what you did. I promised the girl I would protect her until she was 18. Even if it meant from herself. I proved it to her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There is so much more I could write about this girl and the crap she put me through, but this is long enough, I'm sure. Thank you for taking the time to read it.

                    I am so sorry you had to go through all that.  One of our other members on here also went through a similar situation.  You are to be commended for doing your very best to save the life of a child. That woman wanted your nice for something, possibly to sell drugs for her or to prostitute for her.  That sounds disgusting but we know that there are people like that.  Your niece had a very rough start with her dad giving up on her and a mother doing time.  Sounds like your sister is helping out and that is good.  She is showing her daughter responsibility. You did a wonderful job and even though she may never say the words, you will know she is thankful you came to her rescue.  She still has a lot to learn so give her time.  She may say them one day.  You are an Angel.  God Bless You +
