            Brilliant approach op. 
Kid fukkers have been around since someone decided killing them was wrong, ( liberal Democrat I'm sure )
The whole satan angle, esoterica, spirit cooking, in plain sight pedodesta with the ectus and 14 hands pic, normal. Par for the course, you don't get it then it's not for you, that's the that. But what activated my absolution on the matter. Aside from the memetic aspect of this investigation, is the audio file I cleand up. 
There is no mistaking what you hear in that sound file.

            The Madeline McCann e-fit was the first wake up call.....soon after the strange emails about hot dogs and pizza on wiki leaks ,but  the heavy breathing videos nailed it for me and the artwork collection of the podesta. Actually as I type this I realize there is so many indicators trying to narrow it down to one thing is really hard.

            Still not sure it's real.   Maybe false flag set ups to send everyone down the wrong paths while they get out the popcorn and read about us all chasing "leads" they plant here while laughing.  I seriously wouldn't be surprised if they created all this crap--- backdated Instagram and Facebook photos, leaked their own Wikileaks even, all in order to send us on a wild goose chase-----then we are too far in the rabbit hole to follow the money and see the bankers (you know what kind) robbing the world blind.  BUT if it is real, I would say the creepy as fck Instagram and Facebook photos, cringe worthy comments on them, and truly disgusting "art" were the best evidence for me.....also the moloch email is off as is the penance Cankles owes the ROTHSCHILD woman....

            WJC hijacking Lynch on the tarmac and Comey stating that "no reasonable prosecutor" would pursue charges, coupled with the theft of the primary by DNC against Bernie who was the more popular candidate. I was indifferent to H until that Lynch plane stench. Also the video of her face plant into the van. I still think there is something in that video that has not been disclosed. The rest (pedo business) is just confirmation of weird and strange stories I've heard from a wide variety of sources throughout my life.

            I have suspected this in the performing arts industry for a very long time. I know someone I believe to be involved and the first You Tube I watched connected with me too strongly. Too much connecting.  I think everyone knows someone that is either connected or close to it. I say that hitting people at a personal level is important. Like..."have you ever met someone who...they may be into organized...". That kind of thought track.

            Hillary email 14333, the one about sacrificing a "chicken" to Moloch. It makes no sense initially since Moloch was the Canaanite god of child sacrifice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you find out that chicken is sometimes used as slang for an underage boy...
           </p>

            Now crazy shit that I used to laugh off as tinfoil hat talk, like an Illuminati Satanist cult operating like Hydra secretly within the halls of power, seems almost plausible.
