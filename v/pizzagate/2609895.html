<blockquote>
<p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti—In a closed courtroom in one of the few government buildings still standing here, Laura Silsby and nine other American missionaries were charged Thursday with abducting children from this earthquake-ravaged capital.</p>
<p>Their lawyer, Edwin F. Coq Jr., said they had been charged with child abduction and criminal association and not the more-serious charges of kidnapping and child trafficking in connection with trying to take 33 children into the neighboring Dominican Republic. The charges could carry sentences of up to nine years and up to three years, respectively, Mr. Coq said.</p>
<p>For Ms. Silsby it was the latest in a series of wrong turns on a road her parents and others who know her in Idaho say was paved with the best intentions. Yet in her long-stated desire to help orphans, she has left a trail of business and personal debts, as well as unheeded warnings about the intricacies of taking children out of Haiti.</p>
<p>&quot;Laura was the only one who had knowledge of what was going on,&quot; Mr. Coq said. &quot;The rest said only that they love Haiti. That is why they came to Haiti.&quot;</p>
<p>Much about Ms. Silsby, who started and ran an online personal-shopping service, remains a mystery, including the current state of her business and personal finances—her house was foreclosed and she was sued by creditors—and whether she believed she was following Haitian law as she gathered children.</p>
<p>Personal Shopper, whose Web site personalshopper.com, promises to guide shoppers to products that fit their needs, won Ms. Silsby a 2006 award as International Businesswoman of the Year from eWomen Network, a Texas-based international businesswomen\'s group. By last year it also was facing suits.</p>

            Nothing to see here folks.  Having Clinton Connections and her lawyer involved in a human trafficking ring means nothing.  As usual we are trying to make mountain out of a mole hill.  That's what I was told when I was trying to red pill someone last year.  We are still trying to explain this to people.  What will it take.  So frustrating.

             Silsby had no Clinton connections at all.  No one in DC knew who she was before she got arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jorge Puello was not her lawyer.  He was a conman working an angle. He interjected himself into the proceedings by contacting the families in Idaho and presenting himself as a lawyer which he was not.  He was hired by the family members before he ever spoke to the Americans detained in a jail in Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             The family members had originally gone with a Haitian lawyer, Edwin Coq, but then became convinced he was was charging too much, almost extorting them, an idea that Puello encouraged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Puello was not a lawyer whatsoever.

               You've been lied to there are absolutely no emails showing this.   She went to trial in Haiti and was freed by a Hatian Court and there's nothing whatsoever connecting the Clintons to Alert Sense which is a private company.

               They were not.   One of the most important missions of the US State Department is consular services for American's overseas, this includes Americans arrested overseas.

               Consular Affairs was notified by the Embassy duty officer in Santo Domingo of the arrest of 10 Amcits from Idaho by Haitian police. They were attempting to take 33 'orphans' to Santo Domingo for the stated purpose of establishing an orphanage to care for the children. The Americans are in the custody of the Haitian police. We have no information about the whereabouts of the 33 orphans.

             <pre><code> Silsby was arrested at the Haitian border attempting to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti without documentation. Her sentence and charges were reduced after an intervention by Bill Clinton. In the aftermath of Silsby’s arrest, her originally retained lawyer Jorge Puello was arrested in connection with an international smuggling ring accused of trafficking women and minors from Central America and Haiti. The revelation of this news in November was either ignored by the Western media or attacked by Clinton controlled publications.

               That steemit article has many statements that are false and links to fakers news sites like Your newswire. Silsby never asked Puello to be her lawyer.  There's no indication that he knew her before.   He was a con man and got involved for his own reasons.  He tried to get money out of the families.

               The State Department provides all Americans with consular services.  That was the extent of Hillary Clinton's involvement.   Many Baptist leaders asked her to get involved, she said no.

                Reginald Brown -- the Washington lawyer who represents one of the detained Americans -- sent a letter to Clinton on Tuesday asking her to personally intervene with Haitian authorities.

             She kidnaps 33 children, her lawyer is a child trafficker and the Clinton's get her out when they shouldn't even know or care about her. The sheeple think it means nothing. The sheeple need to go. I support the Cabal's agenda 21. They have given consent. Rid us of their stupidity.  I respect the controllers more than the sheeple. One is devious, the other is mind numbingly stupid. Shame we get lumped in with them and will be ground up with them and because of them. No safety in numbers when the masses are pathetic dolts.

             The solution which no.one here understands ..is to reduce debt ..and stop.feeding the banking system..at the same time setting urself up as creditor over the US treasury...
            </p>
            <p>
             Then as an individual or a group...u can instruct the US to follow ur instructiins...while they r obliged to discharge ur bills and debts...from here on

             Google : nexium etymology
Google : what is namium
.and then search for nexium ..and understand that Rome is indebted and obliged to ur instructions from berth ..and that u have a nexium contract over them when u turn them into ur debtor

              Their is no government, it was dissolved March 9th, 1933. Yes 33. You should know this by now. We were collateralized, our metals seized, and government replaced with a corporation, USA INC. owned by the Rothschild banking cartel. You have been corporatized as well, and that is why your birth certificate is all in caps. The politicians are employees if the cartel. The Cartel taxes us, pays the politicians and gives fund the treasury to pay tax refunds. That's it, they keep the rest. Politicians don't spend more than they bring in because they are stupid, that is their job, to keep the country in debt to the cartel.

               I have not been corporatised...the name i hold had been capitalised...we all consent to it ...we can volunteer to get out of the debt game..
The merchants know this simple trick...hence all the fear porn and diversion ...all it takes to make the US our debtor is one dollar..
The war is fictional ...we give consent and credits to its banking system..
Google : what is namium
Its not ur property ...but u r the beneficiary to it ..
They enslave and capitalise on it ...via ur consent to applications ...for licences..benefits...bank accounts etc

               If debt is the problem...and what gives them.power..
..then logic should convey..that reducing debt must be the solution..
...and when one studies basics of commercial law...that is just the case ...
..so we emailed the US treasury ..and they confirmed that ..yes ..anyone on this planet can reduce their debt ...making us their true creditor with surety rights over them..
              </p>
              <p>
               ...the next would be to ask.the debt reduction department of the crown..whether they accept any countrymens currency...
The crown is important since i believe they r the ones holding the lien or legal title.of  our name ..whilst we keep the equity side ...as trustees ...and loan it to the war game ..ie tye templar banking system..
When we reduce debt ...we both become beneficiary of our trust..ie the NAme...created by our parents at birth ...and since we are on the peace side...the crown has no right over the legal.title...They only hold.it on the war side ...using us as surety to their war statututes....
Constitutor means someone who shifts debt into a third partybie the surety...
The politicians take an oath to this insursnce policy document 
..they can only apply these statutues inside the war game ...

              I have read your comments before and it makes some sense.  I don't pretend to understand all of what you say, I am not of the same understanding.  I have heard others speak of reducing the debt and I believe it to be true.  I believe that they have really pulled the wool over our eyes and we have been living a huge ponzi scheme.
