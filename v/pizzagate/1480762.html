            I posted because I have been part of a few of these movements in the past and simply offered up some advice that I learned. That and to let yall know that in a way your already successful, but perhaps in a way that you didn't intend as other silent communities are watching.

            Also the bifurcation bit is a key bit of information for those smart enough to know what to do with it. Can't give you guys the cow and the milk.

            The internet is the last frontier on the freedom of speech road. Only a select few minority has always controlled the flow of information for a long time. Now though, the internet has level the playing=g field for us poor peasants. As long as we got the internet, we stand a fighting chance.
