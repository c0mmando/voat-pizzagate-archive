            Our taxes have paid for atrocities beyond comprehension. When Neo wakes up in the pod seeing that the machines are feeding off everyone in The Matrix, that's them, the government, feeding off of our hard work and trust and trying to destroy us with it.

             Oh yeahhhhh.  That movie really freaked me out.  The blue people one did too - was it Avatar?  And there was another one with all the people in tanks.  I can't remember the name.  It was more recent than avatar and the matrix

            Our tax dollars even go towards arming and training people who routinely rape little boys, so that it all comes full circle as our tax money pays for both child rape and destabilizing the Middle East at the same time.

            Washington DC has been pillaging the American people for so long now. Many of your fellow Americans have been talking and warning about this for decades. You know, all those 'conspiracy theorist crackpots'
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is already a success, when viewed in the light of how many new people have been introduced to this harsh reality of modern day slavery.

             Right.  It's definitely eye opening --not in their twisted illuminati way.
            </p>
            <p>
             We've been enlightened to their evil dark ways
            </p>
            <p>
             I knew of all the right media saying America is in trouble etc.  but pizzagate is new info for me and their silencing the press in such a drastic way over this month is new.  They have owned the major networks for decades- obviously.  But I don't recall a time when they censored so frantically like they are now

              Indeed, this full blown censorship is truly unprecedented. But the info on child rapists in government has been around for decades.
