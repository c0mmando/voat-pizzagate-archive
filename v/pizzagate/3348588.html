<p>In the spring of 2017, then-senior White House counselor Steve Bannon got a text message from a producer for CBS’s “60 Minutes” inquiring about a wild story getting traction on internet websites and chat rooms. It involved Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer who had been shot and killed on the streets of Washington the previous July, and claims that his murder was retribution for a supposed role in leaking internal Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>“In the conversations I\'ve had with Steve, he tended to go towards conspiracies,” recalls Ira Rosen, the “60 Minutes” producer who sent Bannon that text message. “He liked conspiracies, and he believed in them. He talks about the deep state. He talks about black ops.”</p>
<p>In the case of Rich, Bannon didn’t disappoint. When Rosen asked about rumors that a “disgruntled insider … kid’s name was Seth Rich” had sold Democratic emails to WikiLeaks, Bannon responded with no shortage of certainty.</p>

<p><strong>Excerpts involving Ed Butowsky:</strong></p>
<p>It is a story with many twists and turns that ultimately raises a provocative question: What role did the Trump White House play in promoting one of the nastiest conspiracy theories rising out of the 2016 election?</p>
<p>The central player in this drama is Ed Butowsky, a hard-charging Dallas financier and inveterate political schmoozer with connections at Fox News. (He was an occasional commentator on the Fox Business Channel.) He was also on friendly terms with a number of Trump White House officials, including Bannon and then-press secretary Sean Spicer.</p>
<p>During the Obama years, Butowsky had served on a “citizens’ committee” to investigate Benghazi and would often talk about how he got important information about the deadly incident into the media without leaving any fingerprints. “Behind the scenes I do a lot of work (unpaid) helping to uncover certain stories,” he once boasted. “My biggest work was revealing most of what we know today about Benghazi.”</p>
<p>In late 2016, Butowsky claims, he got a hot tip that caused him to plunge headfirst into the Rich story. His supposed tipster was Ellen Ratner, a liberal radio talk show host who due to family ties — her late brother Michael Ratner had been the U.S. lawyer for WikiLeaks — had met with Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London during the closing days of the 2016 campaign.</p>

            This would be great to expose. If everything came to light, yes, this is one story that could red pill people. It would have to be incontrovertible proof, but if it was? KABOOM!!!! Opinions would change.

             Imo and from a lot of research at the time of the leak the person I charge of all of HRCs list of future voters well he engineered the opening of the flood gates. They claimed that someone on the. Ernie team tried to peek at the other sides list of voters. The fact is that the HRC camp are guilty of opening both lists simultaneously thusly turning the tables on the Bernie Camp. What a Brouhaha that was. The truth is ad you say that the DNC is guilty of doing what they are trying to pin on the Russians. The DC as well far led to five low the Justice Roberts Rules at the Dem Convention and took a test vote which is not legal. If anyone is to blame it is the Dems not the Russians. The finger should be pointing at them.

              Absolutely. And I believe this is what our POTUS and others are hinting at. Gradually these connections are coming out ... conditioning people to what will come. I believe the tide has turned. I was getting very down, but ever since that Mueller hearing, I'm really rejuvenized. I believe we have momentum. I actually believe Q when he says nothing can stop this from happening. Now I don't know if I believe who Q is, but I believe the truth in that statement. That's what I'm trying t say. All these loose pieces are fitting together. Bella Thorne is speaking out hard. There's Little St. James on Disney's tour packages. The connection with Weinstein is coming out and there was our wonderful POTUS talking about the Clinton Foundation and how it needs to be investigated ... and there are the connections of it to sex trafficking. As for Seth Rich, Julian Assange is the key ... the paladin ... the piece not yet heard from. There will be the gnashing of teeth when he testifies. There will be the Great Awakening.

               Craig Murray is also a key. He has said that he is the one that Seth Rich met that night when he turned over the evidence that would rock the DNC to the core. I can’t evrn imagine what went on behind closed doors.  The truth must be told about J Podesta and Jennifer Palmieris roles in his death.  The rifles that were stolen from the FBI vehicle that night and not to mention the two that were murdered gangland style in Myrtle Beach after driving all night from DC. They had MS-13 ties and were possibly part of the union clean up crew.  All this must be exposed.

                The release of FISA is only setting the stage and introducing to the deeply indoctrinated that their icons and saints beyond reproach are filthy dirty. Once that toe is in the door, more evidence can through leading up to the previous commander-in-chief being a traitor and complete imposter.

                Wonderland. Wonderland has been in front of our eyes. It's been a movie we've been watching replete with completely Photoshopped images. Mike never looked like that. If you look at unPhotoshopped images you'll see that Mike is actually taller than her "husband". So how come even with heels on she appears shorter? It's impossible unless the photo were altered. All that time spent on creating an illusion. It means the media was complicit on this charade. The propagandists must be replaced by journalists.

                  It takes a bit of time, but you need only to get one of the elite cabal in a position of power. They make sure to hire their own and cause trouble for those not affiliated or willing to play ball with the cabal. It'll take a few years, but all the people with integrity will leave. They may even be tempted to leave a job for a better offer. They bite and discover the job that was touted to be so wonderful and give them journalistic freedom is even a worse prison than the one they left.

                       According to his article it comes down to organ harvesting. Israel has used up a lot of stolen organs.

                        Now that you've answered, something just popped in my head.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Maybe it's because of the direct connection between Israel and PedoWood. You know stars, perv producers and directors get first choice along with politicians ... and supreme court justices.

                        In terms of organ harvesting, I believe it's also the race to incorporate government health care patient information into a viable network. The link I posted calls out Nicole Junkermann as having Google-backed AI set to launch. It would use NHS data to create new vaccines, etc. Ostensibly that's what they would do. But with this influx of info, they could also target a virus to wipe out certain segments of the population.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I believe this was talked about was it last year? FB was setting up something similar, but were caught. Weren't they in bed with ZocDoc? I think that was one connection, but they were using sophisticated algorithms to mine users posts. So if a user said they had a dentist appt that day for say a heart condition ... they could find out the doctor and and begin from there to find out what occurred through the records. They were in the stages of talking to hospitals and doctors to give consent to releasing information WITHOUT the names. But you see, they already knew the names through FB and it would be simple enough to match them up. Yes, it's coming back because the loophole is that it's not illegal for hospitals to release your information as long as there is no name attached to it.

                         Yes the hospital stays clean while FB passes the info on. I have thought from the very beginning that there was a method to their madness. Jews in Israel were against donating organs so they got them elsewhere. Even though things have changed somewhat they still want the top choice. The young ones especially. They  pay top dollar. Imo there is a pipeline from there to the big cities here. Sick.

                          It is so sick that it's hard to accept. Like when I heard about Disney .... how can it be involved with the abuse of children? But a huge part is the media carefully select who are heroes are for us. They push this propaganda -- like with PedoWood producers and directors. Exactly why is Steven Spielberg so wonderful? You never really know, but you find yourself thinking and repeating what they tell you to think.

                          Now with Wray not cooperating and FISA still not released, I'm starting to get antsy again. I am so ready for this to come out and so tired of waiting. There are hints ... like with Barr conducting an investigation ... a criminal investigation ... so it's not as bad as before, but bad. And this Seth Rich story ... I have a feeling the timing of it is after the election. But that means I have to sit and bite my nails through another one hoping that our POTUS and the real patriots will persevere.

                           Same here I am putting my faith in people I don’t know. Will they spill the beans and expose these sick perverts? Idk really. All I can do is hope. I can’t wait for SS to get his. As for Seth Rich that’s going to have to involve some real buggies.

                            Had to be a lot of huge names involved with that hit. They had to communicate some way. Especially after it was learned that the hit wasn't successful. Blackberries had to be blowing up with panicked conference calls of what to do. It would be very satisfying to see them go down, but the Awan brothers really skated for all they'd done. The had to. They probably had a back-up of the server that would take a lot of the elite cabal down.

                             The Awans had their ticket out through DWS. She had an affair with Imran. She can pull a lot of strings She is from Broward where anything goes. There was some funny business about him not being dead at the hospital and some Dr. getting involved. Getting blurry. Also why did they take him to another hospital when the closest one was a trauma center. Also there was some kind of red light camera detectors that can recorded shots and when they went off. Where are those records?  So much hiding by so many. Yes exploding blackberries is a perfect description.

                              And I believe the propagandist press put out the disinfo that Seth was talking to that bar owner, but the owner admitted he wasn't there? Truthfully, what stands out is Seth's brother laughing when his parents are talking about Seth.

                               I think he may just have had a nervous reaction due to the subject matter. We know that some people have laughed at funerals or wakes.

                               The story is that Seth and Aaron passed the evidence to someone in s park. Craig Murray claims to be the on that met them/him.

                                Oh, no! That wasn't nervous laughing This was astonishment at the cover story his parents were giving.

                                No doubt that Seth Rich was working for Sanders ... the old communist. He was MOSSAD, but really working to bring the destruction of the US. Hence his passing the DNC info along to Assange for dissemination.

                                I suggest you view that video yourself. I know you're pretty intuitive from past conversations and your discussions with others ... and posts. You'll see the reaction. It's replete with facial expressions that put it way out of the "nervous laughter" arena.

                         I agree. There is always so much more going on but they are making big money on organ harvesting. It’s bigger than drugs. It’s disgusting and I know you agree.

                           Yes and the rat lines being used today are still the same ones used decades ago by Capone and other gangs. If it works why change it. We both know about Hill’s connections to Capone. Her dad used to play cards with those boys.  She learned well.

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The ramifications here are almost too large to describe.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this information turns out to be true and accurate, the entire narrative around the DNC “hack” will have been proven to be intentionally manufactured.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite the FBI’s prior admissions about never reviewing the DNC servers; and despite their recent admissions about never actually seeing the forensic computer analysis, the U.S. Department of Justice, specifically Robert Mueller, Andrew Weissmann and former DAG Rod Rosenstein, cannot blame a simple investigative ‘mistake‘ for the wrong attribution of who gave the DNC emails to Wikileaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI, the DOJ and the Mueller special counsel have each purposefully claimed specific Russian actors were responsible for hacking the DNC in 2016. If it turns out those claims were based on falsehood, the integrity of the DOJ and Special Counsel collapses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Butowsky is making a very serious allegation in this court filing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, the previously discussed motive to arrest Julian Assange would now be further enhanced. Heck, the reason for Assange’ arrest would be brutally obvious.
           </p>
           <p>
            ?Dana Boente was head of DOJ-NSD from May 11th, 2017 through end of October 2017 when he officially announced his intent to retire. However, the timeline gets cloudy here because Boente said he was staying on until an official replacement was announced. There’s no indication of when Boente actually left the DOJ-NSD or the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) role.
           </p>
           <p>
            On January 23rd, 2018, FBI Director Christopher Wray announced Dana Boente had shifted over to the FBI to be Chief Legal Counsel (replacing James Baker) where Boente remains today. As Mueller was using 19 lawyers, and 50 FBI investigators, Boente was/is the legal counsel to FBI Director Christopher Wray while the Mueller probe was ongoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            [Remember, Robert Mueller never interviewed Julian Assange. Additionally, it is worth noting for the U.S. side of the legal framework, the charges against Assange are not related to Russian efforts in a hack of the DNC; nor is Assange charged with anything related to the 2016 U.S. election interference activities, the Podesta email release or anything therein as previously described by the DOJ.]
           </p>
           <p>
            The April 11th, 2019, Julian Assange indictment stemmed from the Eastern District of Virginia. From a review of the indictment we discover it was under seal since March 6th, 2018: (The DOJ sat on the indictment for 13 months, until Mueller finished)
           </p>
           <p>
            (Link to pdf)
           </p>
           <p>
            However, on Tuesday April 15th, 2019, more investigative material was released. Again, note the dates: Grand Jury,
            <em>
             December of 2017
            </em>
            This means FBI investigation prior to December ’17..
           </p>
           <p>
            The investigation of Assange took place prior to December 2017, it is coming from the EDVA where Dana Boente was still, presumably, U.S. Attorney. The grand jury indictment was sealed from March of 2018 until April of 2019.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was there a delay?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did the DOJ wait until the Mueller report was complete?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s where it gets interesting….
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI submission to the Grand Jury in December of 2017 was four months after congressman Dana Rohrabacher talked to Assange in August of 2017: “Assange told a U.S. congressman … he can prove the leaked Democratic Party documents … did not come from Russia.”
           </p>
           <p>
            (August 2017, The Hill Via John Solomon) Julian Assange told a U.S. congressman on Tuesday he can prove the leaked Democratic Party documents he published during last year’s election did not come from Russia and promised additional helpful information about the leaks in the near future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is friendly to Russia and chairs an important House subcommittee on Eurasia policy, became the first American congressman to meet with Assange during a three-hour private gathering at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has been holed up for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rohrabacher recounted his conversation with Assange to The Hill.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Our three-hour meeting covered a wide array of issues, including the WikiLeaks exposure of the DNC [Democratic National Committee] emails during last year’s presidential election,” Rohrabacher said, “Julian emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved in the hacking or disclosure of those emails.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Pressed for more detail on the source of the documents, Rohrabacher said he had information to share privately with President Trump.
