<p>Pizzagate is real and now this is going to be really difficult for skeptics to explain away. CIA claws are reaching far and wide throughout the world. The governments are full of pedophiles, which are in control of military state.</p>
<p>There are a lot of paid Lithuanian shills trying to disprove this story. Don\'t fall for them. Their view of the story makes no sense. They are trying to falsify the facts. There was no reason for Drasius Kedys to kill people other than to protect his daughter from government pedos and take revenge into his own hands. The police men are in the same bed with pedos. Why would Drasius sister fight the state and everyone if she had a well paying job and risk her life if her brother was in the wrong, even after his death? Why would the screaming daughter, wanting to be with her grandmother fake her emotions? Don\'t fall for pedophile shills. They will probably come to this thread. They are already in full force on reddit. If all dots are connected this will lead to USA pedophile ring in high office.</p>

<p>Lithuania is a satellite state of the USA, just like Israel. Our governments all worship the same devil. This is of maximum importance. Please sign the petition. This woman cannot return to Lithuania. She will be killed 100%.</p>

<p>Drasius Kedys was just drowned. Mainstream media said he had left the country. <a href="https://kek.gg/i/5kdrxr.jpeg">https://kek.gg/i/5kdrxr.jpeg</a></p>
<p>His kid was being molested and the kid came forward with it. He tried to get justice through legal means. Instead the whole governmental force came against him. He was going against big guys. Tried to take his kid away. Huge custody battles against the government.</p>
<p>Then he went full Dorner and killed two pedos.</p>
<p>Wiki tells following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 5 October 2009 Furmanavičius and Naruševičienė were shot dead in Kaunas. Kedys became the prime suspect.[6] On the same day, a national search of Kedys was announced,[7] which was soon followed by an announcement of international search, as he was thought to have left the country shortly after the murders.[8] Kedys\' friends Raimundas Ivanauskas and Eglė Barauskaitė were charged with accessory to murder. As of December 2013, that court case is ongoing.[9]</p>
<p>The story caused an uproar in Lithuania, much of the public siding with Kedys: in the public mind, the case was seen as largely a father\'s futile attempts in pursuing justice and trying to protect his daughter, and by being driven to desperate measures by anger at the injustice. Others questioned whether the killings were in fact commissioned by Kedys himself.</p>
<p>Death of Kedys</p>
<p>After six months of police search, Drąsius Kedys\' body was found near Kaunas Reservoir on 20 April 2010. According to the official report, the cause of death was &quot;choking on the vomit&quot; whilst being heavily intoxicated. However, his relatives were convinced that Kedys was murdered, pointing out to some wounds on his body.[10] Kedys\' relatives demanded a second opinion from independent experts. In April 2011, a report was received from the Swedish National Forensic Service (Rättsmedicinalverket) which confirmed that Kedys had indeed died from alcohol and drug poisoning, and that he choked on the contents of his own stomach.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Note: Swedish National Forensic Service</p>
<p>When your own national forensic services are so fucking corrupt you actually have to get fucking Sweden forensic services (the sames who somehow fail to connect the shitload of murder and rape with the current immigrant crisis even if they find their DNA all over the fucking victims) to appear credible. Honestly, you don\'t go to such lengths unless you\'re really want to hide something.</p>',

             The parentheses thing has been credited to the alt-right controversialist Mike Enoch. It probably should be '''MIke Enoch''' though, since, like most alt-right figures, he is an agent of the Deep State. The main point of Deep State agents encouraging (and feigning) anti-semitism - as happens a lot on here - is to drive normal people away from the debate, since the first impression a normal person will have is of a bunch of foul-mouthed racists.

              the term "deep state" originates from 1970s Turkey mainly to describe countries like Egypt where the government has substantial direct stakes in major industries and remain corrupt.  its application in the US is an extremely recent phenomenon and in fact serves only one purpose: to add another layer of obfuscation for truth-seekers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Organized Jewish groups ARE the "deep state" and have been exposed as staging anti-Semitic incidents on a constant basis.  that's why its a meme: search "whatcha doin rabbi"

            Reddit, as you know, goes the extra mile to protect pedos:

            Major internet media is going full damage control.

            I for example hadn't heard of this in any news. Basically the mom whose child was pedodiddled and later taken away by force by the police made a political party and was able to get many seats in their parliament. There were a huge protest made and this has been ongoing scandal in Lithuania, and yet it's been blackholed. No news coverage has leaked outside since 2008. 
This is like that Marc Dutroux case where whole entire towns go to strike to protest the system. While cops and judges try to cover pedophilia and let the man escape. That case was also totally shut down outside Holland. No news coverage got outside.

            I can't believe that they came back for this little girl ready to take her from the arms of her loved one/ family to be put right back into the monster's den. A crowd of 5000 people standing around the house didn't even phase them in an act that one wouldn't even consider to be done by a human. What does the state know about the whole situation that justifies their taking a little girl from her family?
I saw the video of the little girl explaining what was done to her and it's pretty disgusting. Does the state have evidence that what the girl is saying if false, evidence that would backup their claim? If 5000 people cant stop the machine what does that tell a person? I guess it's up to the courts.

             This is how the "legal" system works in their favour, they don't need to prove what she is saying is "false", someone needs to prove what she is saying is "true". And just like the Hampstead case, they claim these kids can somehow make this stuff up, or claim someone coached them. It's a cesspool for corruption.

             Jesus just the thought of a full media blackout... If shit starts to go down here in the United States I'm sure it will be just the same. Whole cities and towns under media blackout when hard evidence starts getting released and people start protesting and rioting in mass.
