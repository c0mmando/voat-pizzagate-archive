            No. I don't care if I offend anyone. I thought her post said its only about migrants, she says "just this case." well, I say, write better. Note that her post was edited.

           <p>
            She's an idiot if she thinks scrolling through my profile and seeing a comedy podcast implies something it doesn't, or that I havn't "done enough" on the history of this account. With detective skills like that, she's more likely to flounder

            Thanks, I was trying to make sense out of this puzzling article. The only 2 parts that really scared me though and that says much about the author in that case, were these:
           </p>
           <p>
            "... nuked those deals
            <strong>
             like I might nuke leftover pizza, which is delicious in both its cold and re-heated states of existence.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            and
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <strong>
             One of the kids I babysit doesn’t like pizza
            </strong>
            ; my sister doesn’t like pizza that much. Yes, these two individuals also
            <em>
             hate freedom
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             rig elections in their free time
            </em>
            , but
            <strong>
             I’d rather eat more pizza than argue
            </strong>
            with them about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is he into killing, raping, abusing, torturing, eating, refugees, migrants or internationally trafficked children himself? Why doesn't his sister like pizza? Is she a racist? Could be, since he says she hates freedom and likes to rig elections. This is a very, very scary thought and I really hope I'm wrong.

            I read it. Pizza isn't a code word in this case. It just means pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's why I think so: The problem with interpreting it as a code word is that you have to define an audience for whom the encoded message would be useful and meaningful. If John Podesta read this article, what would it tell him? That Putin is suspicious of Western elites? That he accuses them of pedophilia and other kinds of decadence? I think Podesta knows that already.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizza is a useful code word between people who are pedophiles. It is less useful but still occasionally relevant when referring to a third party who is not a pedophile. When it comes to public figures like Putin, it really doesn't add anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's my take on it, anyway.

            Pizza in this case, I believe refers to the Globalist agenda of ethnic cleansing and means
            <strong>
             MIGRANTS
            </strong>
            . PIZZA is a mixture of ethnicities, immigrants or migrants. The mixing up of the ethnicities would easily pave the way for a one world government, because the main obstacle to the NWO agenda is patriotism and pure races. Roots to the land. Land owners are an obstacle. Anyway, you get the idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             I guess it was the Georgian conflict that gave it up for me. And these hints:

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             EU membership practically would have guaranteed that Ukrainians got some
             <strong>
              proper pizza from Italy
             </strong>
             ,1 and a close relationship with NATO virtually certified that Ukraine would get to attend the annual
             <strong>
              NATO Pizza Party
             </strong>
             . All that is over now.
             <strong>
              No pizza for Ukraine.

           <p>
            <strong>
             Italy has a migrant problem
            </strong>
            and they were probably looking forward to sending some to Ukraine.

              first proper slice in 2008

             before Russia invaded. The
             <strong>
              United States
             </strong>
             was actually in the process of

             2K8 when Russia said “nyet.” Once Putin realized that the West wasn’t really that committed to
             <strong>
              bringing pizza to Georgia
             </strong>
             , it was a natural logical step to deny Ukrainians their chance at
             <strong>
              unlimited pizza.

            <strong>
             destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages
            </strong>
            in South Ossetia and were responsible for an
            <strong>
             ethnic cleansing of Georgians
            </strong>
            . Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August; in response, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. In the aftermath, Russia's international relations were largely unharmed. The
            <strong>
             war displaced 192,000 people
            </strong>
            and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people,

            It's looking more and more obvious to me that this is the big plan and Russia's Putin doesn't like it one bit. He hates it. And I can't blame him. He's standing up to the NWO globalists and I admire that very much.

                I never said that. I said that in THIS CASE, pizza is codeword for human trafficking/migrants/refugees. The author is taking it one step further by implicating himself and his relatives. I suspect he likes sex slaves and is an abuser of people of a different race than his own. That is totally related to PG and is not coming in contradiction with my theory. Nice try, attempting to discredit it though. Better luck next time.

            I want to like Putin, but I still have a hard time with the  picture of him kissing the little boys belly. That was freaking weird. Like mind controlled weird. Who would do that in front of the media on purpose?!?

            <p>
             Vladimir Putin hates pizza.
            </p>
            <p>
             How do I know this? Well, for one thing, the President of Russia has demonstrated repeatedly through diplomatic efforts and hard-power flexing that he prefers a multi-polar international community, in which Russia is one of those alternate poles. Since one of the cornerstones of the free world is pizza, Putin’s separate little world—in which human rights are suggestions and democracy has as much tangible meaning and practical application as the term “synergy” —has no place for pizza. Also, I searched the internet for pictures of Putin eating pizza for a full minute and got no results. Also also, I lived in Russia for a while and the pizza there is typically so far removed from real pizza that, if Putin ever tried Russian pizza, I imagine the experience solidified his distaste for the West and for its freedom pizza. Russian pizza is pretty bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since Putin doesn’t think very highly of the West and its freedom pizza, it only makes sense that he wishes to deny Ukrainians access to pizza. They were pretty close for a while there, nearly joining NATO and working on EU membership before now-ousted but totally-still-legitimate Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych nuked those deals like I might nuke leftover pizza, which is delicious in both its cold and re-heated states of existence. EU membership practically would have guaranteed that Ukrainians got some proper pizza from Italy,1 and a close relationship with NATO virtually certified that Ukraine would get to attend the annual NATO Pizza Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             All that is over now. No pizza for Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
             This isn’t the first time that Putin denied a former Soviet Republic its chance at pizza. Georgia was really close to trying its first proper slice in 2008 before Russia invaded. The United States was actually in the process of teaching Georgians how to make palatable pizza to bring to NATO Pizza Party 2K8 when Russia said “nyet.” Once Putin realized that the West wasn’t really that committed to bringing pizza to Georgia, it was a natural logical step to deny Ukrainians their chance at unlimited pizza.
            </p>
            <p>
             We Westerners love pizza, and we think everyone should try it sometime, but like, we’re not going to fight you about it. One of the kids I babysit doesn’t like pizza; my sister doesn’t like pizza that much. Yes, these two individuals also hate freedom and rig elections in their free time, but I’d rather eat more pizza than argue with them about it. The international community is taking the same stance with Russia, promising that they won’t bring pizza to the G8 summit in Sochi (since, as stated, Russia doesn’t have any good pizza of its own).
            </p>
            <p>
             Should NATO force feed Russia some pizza? Should the UN provide pizza-based aid to threatened areas of Ukraine? Should Crimeans sack up and try pizza before they foresake it forever by forming a sovereign, pro-Russian, anti-pizza state? Such steps would be drastic, and could be met with serious retaliation by Russia. But Putin is a notoriously picky eater who has refused to try pizza time and time again, so force-feeding or otherwise mainlining pizza into his system may be the only way to save Ukraine from life in a pizza-less Hell.
            </p>
            <p>
             No but seriously, do you have a better explanation for why Putin is doing this?

             Does anyone know what national ave normally reports on?  Is it a D.C. based publication?  Do they normally report on international politics?  If this is indeed code, then it's very blatant, and they'd be assuming their audience knows what they're talking about, but also, someplace like the NYT
             <em>
              wouldn't
             </em>
             write like this because it would be so weird as to raise normy eyebrows.
