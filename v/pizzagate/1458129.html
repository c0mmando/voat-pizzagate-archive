Some information is missing or incomplete and the gaps need to be filled. I have been looking at 5039 in particular as this one \'number\' has many lots.
Going by google maps (2014) and then searching on [<a href="http://www.opencorporates.com">http://www.opencorporates.com</a>] for the owners; the lots are as follows (starting from the far end, lot number 1):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Law Offices Maloney &amp; Mohsen, PLLC. Owner = BURNING TREE LLC. Search results in ARYA MOHSEN, resident lawyer. No suspicions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patrick M Grogan, DDS. Owner = PATRICK M GROGAN. Resident dentist, no suspicions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Law Offices Schulze &amp; Pederson. Owner = 5039 CONNECTICUT AVENUE LLC. Search results in an inactive listing with the name PAUL J. O’REILLY and address of 3715 ALBEMARLE STREET, NW, Washington, District of Columbia, 20016. This appears to be a private dwelling. Search results for PAUL J. O’REILLY tell us he is a senior partner at O’Reilly &amp; Mark, PC. Attorneys-at-law. Linked to The Arc Montgomery County <a href="http://thearcmontgomerycounty.org/">http://thearcmontgomerycounty.org/</a> further info needed around this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>McCullough Residential. Owner = EDWIN S ROCKEFELLER APT 1024. Search results link to antitrust and an address of 2801 New Mexico Ave NW Apt 1024 Washington, DC 20007-3939 (The Colonnade condos). Address also linked to ONCONON, L.L.C with the name of EDWIN ROCK <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333091643/ESR2">https://www.scribd.com/document/333091643/ESR2</a> Search of ONCONON, L.L.C returns this <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333091857/ESR3">https://www.scribd.com/document/333091857/ESR3</a> This is unsettling and needs further investigation, as well as the alias of EDWIN P.

</li>
<li>
<p>Politics &amp; Prose Offices. Owner = BARBARA M MEADE. Barbara Meade was one of the former owners of Politics &amp; Prose; does she still own this building even though the store has new owners? Needs full confirmation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chevy Chase Gallery. Owner = CHEVY CHASE FINE ART LLC. Search results in an inactive listing with the address 10420 Grey Fox RD, Potomac, 20854 and the names KIUMARS KAVOUSI and TATYANA DEFIDDLER. Mr Kavousi is the gallery owner according to their website <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333093966/5039ART1">https://www.scribd.com/document/333093966/5039ART1</a> and the owner of the address listed according to this <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333094357/5039ART2">https://www.scribd.com/document/333094357/5039ART2</a> Tatyana Defiddler seems to be misspelled. The real name appears to be TATIANA DE FIDLER although it is again misspelled as TATIANA DEFIDLER in some instances. Her address is the other one listed, 5425 Connecticut Ave Nw APT 309 Washington, 20015-2722
<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333095008/5039ART3">https://www.scribd.com/document/333095008/5039ART3</a> she appears to be an artist <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333095386/5039ART4">https://www.scribd.com/document/333095386/5039ART4</a>

</li>
<li>
<p>McCullough Construction. Owner = CONNEB I LLC. Search results in JOHN W. GILL, SR and T. NICHOLAS GILL address    <br />
1722 WISCONSIN AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, 20007, District of Columbia. Address checks out as being H.A GILL &amp; SON, REALTORS. Following T. NICHOLAS GILL leads to 
2829 28TH STREET L.L.C. Following JOHN W. GILL you get A. C. ELECTRIC CO. INC with an added name of HENRY J. KLEIN and the address 15829 Redland Rd, Rockville, 20855, Maryland. HENRY J. KLEIN has many connections so some help digging here would be good. From JOHN W. GILL you also get 1549 35TH STREET L.L.C which is a branch and leads to 1549 35TH STREET, L.L.C. with the name KEVIN M MCCARTHY and the address 8508 REHOBOTH CT, VIENNA VA 22182. Digging is needed here also. Again following JOHN W. GILL you get DUPONT-MORGAN III LLC. (more digging needed for this one). You also get BEALL Inc. with the name LINDA L. BEALL and an address of 14844 CRANOKE STREET, CENTREVILLE, 20120, Virginia. Yet again more digging needed here. Then the last active entry for JOHN W. GILL is CONNEB II LLC which is a branch of CONNEB II, LLC and following that we get KEVIN MCCARTHY again with the same address as mentioned previously. This clearly needs some digging. Finally, I noticed that there was an inactive entry for JOHN W. GILL for BYRNLEY FARM LLC. Following this gives the name of ROBERT DUVALL and an address of 10866 WILSHIRE BLVD, SUITE 300, LOS ANGELES, 90024, California. (Initial reaction; is it the Robert Duvall?) The answer appears to be, yes. By following the name BYRNLEY FARM I found <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333099786/5039RD">https://www.scribd.com/document/333099786/5039RD</a> and 
<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333100113/5039RD2">https://www.scribd.com/document/333100113/5039RD2</a> 
So, following addresses and names from there should produce lots more results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also 17 other lots/units listed and these appear to be parking spaces or garages (note the use code in this one chosen at random) <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/333101111/5039G">https://www.scribd.com/document/333101111/5039G</a> 
and they all have the same price of $20,000.00. These belong to the following:</p>
<p>1	PATRICK M GROGAN</p>
<p>2	BARBARA M MEADE</p>
<p>3	BARBARA M MEADE</p>
<p>4	BARBARA M MEADE</p>
<p>5	CHEVY CHASE FINE ART LLC</p>
<p>6	CHEVY CHASE FINE ART LLC</p>
<p>7	CHEVY CHASE FINE ART LLC</p>
<p>8	CONNEB I LLC</p>
<p>9	CONNEB I LLC</p>
<p>10	CONNEB I LLC</p>
<p>11	EDWIN S ROCKEFELLER UNIT 1024</p>
<p>12	BURNING TREE LLC</p>
<p>13	5039 CONNECTICUT AVENUE LLC</p>
<p>14	BURNING TREE LLC</p>
<p>15	5039 CONNECTICUT AVENUE LLC</p>
<p>16	PATRICK M GROGAN</p>
<p>17	EDWIN S ROCKEFELLER UNIT 1024</p>
<p>Finding some plans outlining exactly where these units/spaces are would help in showing if they are of importance or not. Obviously if they are garages and not spaces they could be used for storage.
(P.S: Sorry about using scribd, I had no idea the image quality was so bad until I had finished).
(P.P.S: I am not accusing any of these people of crimes and all information was publicly available).</p>',

           Finding some plans outlining exactly where these units/spaces are would help in showing if they are of importance or not. Obviously if they are garages and not spaces they could be used for storage.

            Looking through some old posts and looking for connections lead me to your post.
I feel this should have gotten more attention, would you have any new things to link that you have found in the past month to maybe repost this with additional sources? I feel we should look into some things in here more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I wanted to ask you since you might be interested, someone posted something on voat that almost got no attention, and IDK why but I can't seem to stop wondering about it?
           </p>
           <p>
            It might be absolutely nothing at all, but I just have some weird feeling about it that I can't shake? Maybe it's someone trying to distract, but I mean it might be worth the time to check or not?

             Hiya.
I haven't been digging in this area specifically for a while, but it's obviously still there in my mind, peices of the puzzle so to speak. The Douglas connection is, I'm sure, a valid one as they work with McCullough construction - they did the Hecht warehouse together and the pattern of Douglas' work is one that means properties are often left 'empty' as they wait for the market to change and then actually work on, or develop, the property in question. I made a comment before about the fact that there are lots of empty properties and how this would be convenient for illicit activities. I think it would be a good area to look into in depth if you would like to run with it? I'm looking into something else at the minute otherwise I would as well. (staying on one 'area' is so hard to do in this whole damn thing because the links and connections seem almost endless). I haven't wound the clock back, is there anything there of note?

            involved in these Lot management corporate entities (the popular Gill family business that you've referenced), but the names attached to these Realtors and their connections can create many false leads, because these estate Agents simply offer broad services to many clients in D.C., not necessarily linking their clients at all.

              The Rockefeller connection to McCollough//CONNEB I LLC, (the construction and residential companies with subsidiary offices still on this Nebraska Ave NW side of the block), however, is very interesting, and should definitely be looked into; especially since this 5039 Conn.Ave.NW is the Chevy Chase Art Gallery &amp; Custon Framing, because I have started a sub (

McCollough businesses were started by Tom McCullough, who used to work for Bechtel, which has to be one of the biggest and spookiest construction companies on the face of the earth ... they do all of the US Govt. DUMBS bunkers (Deep Underground Military Bases) and covert and super massive Government infrastructure projects, and it is owned by a guy who is a kingpin at Bohemian Grove (the Bechtel Company ... still privately owned I believe, which is amazing based on its size).

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Two real-estate holding companies were created on January 15th 2003:
            <strong>
             <em>
              CONNEB I LLC,
             </em>

            and
            <strong>
             <em>
              CONNEB II LLC,
             </em>
            </strong>
            <strong>
             <em>
              (#1 and #2)
             </em>
            </strong>
            in order to consolidate but partition the properties owned by the previous lot owners, no doubt for ease of Tax filing, P&amp;L assessment, and LLC protection (most people who own multiple lots in one place will eventually consolidate their holdings into a single corporate body ... and they will need the help of professional Realtors such as the Gill business, and/or taxation/corporate lawyers, which seems to be the role of Kevin McCarthy).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, working out the
            <strong>
             <em>
              ACTUAL OWNERS
             </em>
            </strong>
            is not as straight forward as some might think, because they don't need to reveal themselves as these are not publicly traded entities ... thus we only have the Realtors indicated, which isn't much help.
            <strong>
             <em>
              HOWEVER, the dead giveaway was the $0 purchase price, which proves that the original Lot Title owners were the ones who incorporated the CONNEB II LLC, because they DIDN'T have to sell Lot's they already owned to themselves ... obviously.
             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            It would seem that many of the posters on Voat that talk about the property purchases don't have the faintest idea of how real estate entities and corporate shells are created and managed ... which is highly frustrating (I'm not referring to the above author
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Yuke">
             @Yuke
            </a>
            of this particular Subverse).
           </p>
           <p>
            The original owners are actually the
            <strong>
             <em>
              Jewish Cohen family (Carla and David)
             </em>
            </strong>
            who were long-time founder owner operators of the
            <strong>
             <em>
              Politics &amp; Prose
             </em>
            </strong>
            bookstore, which has always been a Democrat stronghold, and it seems that the ex-Washington Post journalist/editor couple of
            <strong>
             <em>
              Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine
             </em>
            </strong>
            must have purchased or at least become majority owners of CONNEB II LLC, because they are now referred to since 2013 as the
            <em>
             'owners'
            </em>
            of Politics &amp; Prose, though the property records indicate that it is still owned by CONNEB II LLC. This means that the WashPo duo since 2013 actually probably own the Title of Besta Pizza and Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping through CONNEB, and that Hammad and Alefantis are only owners of a Lease (CPP however is owned Freehold by Alefantis through BIG CHEESE LLC, bought for $1.8 million in 2005 ... and Alefantis must have bought the lease for Bucks later on in 2005, but NOT the Title).
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              NOTE:
             </em>
            </strong>
            The dead giveaway that the heirs of the Cohen estate were/are the owners/now part-owners of CONNEB II LLC, is that the Title of Little Red Fox was sold July 13th 2007 (before Carla and David Cohen died; 2010 &amp; 2015 respectively), to one Barry R. Cohen, for $0 --
            <strong>
             <em>
              THIS IS KEY,
             </em>
            </strong>
            because Barry R. Cohen is the only purchaser on record who received a property TITLE from Carla &amp; David Cohen (CONNEB II LLC) for $0, whereas everyone else like Alefantis paid for their Freehold. Obviously Barry R. Cohen (who isn't the owner of the Lease, only the property Title, because he is not the corporate owner of the restaurant operation) of Little Red Fox, is obviously a side relation of the P&amp;P Cohen's, because they only have one son Aaron and daughter Eve ... though I suppose he could be a grandson through Aaron Cohen.

            was opened in 2013, but before that, there was a bakery known as

             </em>
            </strong>
            (a Democrat political operative before he became a baker after 50yrs of age).
            <strong>
             <em>
              Mark Furstenberg is the younger brother of the late Carla Furstenberg Cohen (interesting bio

            </strong>
            , the wife of the late David Cohen. So ... Barry R. Cohen is most definitely related to the Cohen-Furstenberg's and his $0 purchase in 2007 of the Little Red Fox property Title is the key to understanding who owns CONNEB II LLC (at least up until 2007). He wouldn't have paid $0 to someone he did not have a close personal relationship to, and the Cohen family name fills in the blanks.

             just backtracking through the "important leads" post on the sidebar and found this.
            </p>
            <p>
             your post finds much of the same information that i've found - i've submitted a few posts regarding exactly the CONNEB llcs and the art connection.
            </p>
            <p>
             i think that the master-list of leads needs to be re-verified/re-examined.  the shill post with "CON-N.E.B" and saudi connections is being listed as viable.
            </p>
            <p>
             for you, i give you this link:
             <a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/documents/">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             it's still available, but it contains all of the .pdf files associated with all of the transformer events over the last decade or so.  you want to connect dots, there's lots of dots in there.
            </p>
            <p>
             i connected them to sotheby's - the house with the handkerchief, the realtor, the clinton cards - all sotheby's:

              Sorry for the late reply, but thanks for the link to the transformerdc documents ... that will be very handy in analyzing the personalities within the DC art crowd that Alefantis is patronizing.
             </p>
             <p>
              The erroneous "CON-N.E.B" saudi connection stuff really jerks me off, because it is so completely based on a simple Google boolean search and wasn't even linked at all in the sub. The fact that this is Cohen-Furstenberg Jewish instead of Saudi should be of more interest based especially on the ADA affiliation, which was Socialist Party of America and not Democrat Party ... which actually fits the Alinsky and Podesta political and ideological evolution even better than the Clinton's. Most people don't get how further left along the political spectrum the Podesta affiliated Democrat Party personalities are compared with the group that was traditionally crowded around the Clinton's ... though Podesta is responsible for the Clinton's movement further towards the left wing, that is for sure.

            I've linked another post which links to this one, into the sidebar post. Hopefully this increases traffic, if not I can add it directly to the sidebar.

               Haha, too true. I don't mind, the info is there and I'm sure it will come in useful soon enough (and I really need to get back to digging on this one myself too).

             Hey, even the Bavarian Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt held their Minerval Colleges as 'book groups' ... the symbol of the order was a medallion featuring an open book and an owl sitting on top. As I have posted above, McCullough worked for Bechtel, which is one of the spookiest corporations known in the conspiracist-sphere. Is McCullough simply a business agent or aligned business for Bechtel servicing the residential market for high net worth elitists? Their website talks a lot about their large condo building activities.
