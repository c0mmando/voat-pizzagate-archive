            At the risk of getting flamed here for bringing up the name George Webb, he has been on the case of the Iwans for months now, including interviewing some of the tenants of properties owned by Imran Iwan. Say what you want about whether or not you think the man himself is Mossad disinfo, there is a Trello Board maintained by a number of contributors on behalf of his investigation that has pretty much every source that has been found related to the investigation.  I will leave it up to you to determine the quality of the information.

              "terabits" is a curious way to express quantity of data.  If the files were going to Dropbox, that was probably the fastest speed it could go.  I rarely use Dropbox, and only for small files, but it wouldn't be surprising if they throttle the speeds of anyone who tries to transfer massive amounts of data.  But why not say "megabytes" instead of "terabits", unless the goal was to ultimately load terabytes and it got interrupted.

               Have no idea. I'm assuming it's important since it's mentioned. I'm also assuming all this will be explained.

               I'm still working on why someone would leave DWS' computer in a phone booth with a note.

            I seriously do not believe Imran or any other Awan left that laptop to be found. My guess is it was his wife. She probably found out Imran was goathumping Debbie WasAMan Shultz, and had enough! She stood to gain by having the pecker and his goat in jail. She could have sold all his properties, cars ect... and lived very wealthy in goat country, Pakistan!

             Absolutely not. No way it was his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to who left it, not sure. The cloak and dagger way it was done is curious. Hopefully, all this will come out in the trial. What I really would love to emerge is who put the hit on Seth Rich. There has to be an email in there .... a discussion ... something about what was about to be done.

             This is HUGE! And the story just keeps expanding. Definitely treason. But remember the narrative about the Russians hacking into the server? Then remember the narrative about how the Russians plant kiddie porn. Now we see the need for the defense these molesters are going to advance.

            Wait a minute! I'm just connecting things. Were the secret wiretaps that Susan Rice used to unmask people on the DNC servers? I remember when this first came out, one of Obama's flunkies said something about collecting intel for the election. Does that mean that all that stuff was also sent to the DNC?

             Certain "streams" of information were skimmed off as "competitive intelligence".  The real problem was the Deep State had the CIA set up surveillance on about 50MM Americans under a yet-to-be-named program.  And that was top down full collection on all of these individuals.

                Once the trial starts and had evidence comes out, most will. There will be a huge shift where the dems lose popularity and are reviled. But there'll always be that commie/pedo base that doesn't believe anything. I'm gonna guess and say that wil be 20-30%.

            "The secret server was connected to the House Democratic Caucus, an organization chaired by then-Rep. Xavier Becerra. Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it. Authorities considered the false image they received to be interference in a criminal investigation, the senior official said."
           </p>
           <p>
            Xavier Becerra is now the California Attorney General. Some here may recall that just over a month ago, California's Deputy State Attorney General, Raymond Joseph Liddy, was arrested for possession of CP.
            <a href="http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/07/27/deputy-state-attorney-general-arrested-for-child-porn/">
             http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/07/27/deputy-state-attorney-general-arrested-for-child-porn/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "California Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office said in a statement Wednesday that it was aware of the charges against Liddy and that he has been placed on administrative leave.
           </p>
           <p>
            The San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children task force began investigating the case after receiving reports from internet service providers that a user had uploaded 11 images that appeared to be child pornography. Investigators traced the uploads to Liddy’s home in Coronado, the Union-Tribune reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Liddy was interviewed by FBI, he admitted downloading sexual images and using online services to share sexual fantasies, but he said most of the images were of adults, the newspaper reported, citing a federal criminal complaint. When investigators searched his home, they found numerous photographs of children  engaging in sexual activity on a computer and a thumbdrive, the complaint said."
           </p>
           <p>
            I know there has been much speculation about what was really contained on the DNC server, and why they never allowed the FBI to examine it, even as they were claiming to be hacked by the Russian.  Is there more to the Liddy story than is known, and is there a connection to Liddy's CP and the contents of the secret server, and that's why a fake copy was given to investigators?  I know I probably sound like a conspiracy theorist, but at a certain point, there are just too many coincidences to just shrug off without asking questions.

              yep - no one other than the "G Man" himself - G. Gordon Liddy. He had a radio show some years ago that played in my area that I would happen to hear on occasion.  In fact, the name is what alerted me to the story in the first place.  I was a very young child during the Watergate hearings. My mother, who never turned the TV on before prime time, had the hearings on because they were televised live. Kind of an unfortunate intro to the workings of the swamp. It's only gotten worse, it seems.

             I'm willing to bet this is ISI working on behalf of Mossad. Wasserman-Schultz and Weiner are involved, so that would be biggest clue. This goes back to who controls our congress. Saudi and Israel. And one of these has a fetish for children.

            I think he was a spy  or maybe blackmailing them, and trying to do it without getting killed.  Once he figured that was impossible, he left the laptop and notes to authorities, hoping they would keep him from being added to the Clinton kill list.

             He couldn't be a spy. DWS knew about the stolen computers and other irregularities, yet, she kept him on. No, there's more there than a freakin' spy getting into the DNC.

               Doubtful. She was a huge detriment to the campaign so there had to be a reason for her to be left in that position. Killary/Pedostas wanted her in that position which means she was doing what she was supposed to. And to call up the police and demand her laptop back? She has way too much confidence going on. Powerful cabal behind her. She has to be shaking in her mukluks right about now.

               Someone can be a spy and also work for you. Its bad on two fronts because 1. Govt shouldn't be collaborating with foreign intelligence agents and 2. DNC should not be using spys for any functions.

               Its clear they don't have domestic interests at heart. They will weaken the USA in order to empower themselves. This is why they must be executed for treason.
