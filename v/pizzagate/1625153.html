<p>Furthermore, starting Monday or Tuesday of next week, you will begin to start seeing arrests of individuals. Over 30 politicians (many are household names), and over 40 other individuals throughout DC, VA and also a handful in NYC. Some may off their selves before they are apprehended, so keep a eye out for that over the weekend, and you will know they are involved in some manner.&quot;</p>

            That is great!  ask your acupuncturist if they know of a LOW IMPACT chiropractor.   That practice has changed a lot and now the good ones don't crunch your bones but do very precise tuning - may be worth looking into for your spine.  : )

            Hi - just saw this so answering 2nd.  Don't worry about my questions, the last thing I want is any stress your way, especially on account of that.   So sorry about your pain, I wonder if you have ever considered acupuncture?  It can be really good for chronic conditions and is covered by most insurance.  I've seen it do amazing things.  at the very least, it can increase circulation around troubled and impacted areas, helping the blood to cleanse and heal, but it can do much more, "rewiring" your neural paths and unblocking them.  But it takes several treatments usually over a few weeks.  Just put whoever isn't afraid of needles in charge and go for it!
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the high level arrests, I am afraid for me it sounds way too good to be true.  I don't think you haul in big fish like that the day after a new AG is sworn in, god I hope I am wrong.  These high level types have layers and layers between them and the criminal enterprises they enable, and many of them are lawyers themselves like both the Clintons.  They may have gotten sloppy but they are far from stupid.  I honestly believe it would take an actual documented photo of them in the middle of ritual and or sex with their faces clearly showing to get them actually arrested and even then it would be considered "politically motivated" by a loud segment.   I don't think that's what is going to happen and if it were, I don't think it would be this leaky all over the place.  God I hope I'm wrong.  There are good signs with new busts every day, and maybe they can work their way up some chains.   I say have some skepticism and then if it happens it can be a great surprise.

            It may very well have been him! his name seems to ring a bell for me, but I didn't actually pay attention to the moments when he was introduced.  It was a show from about 4 or 5 days ago.   Next time you go in, ask if he did a Coast 2 Coast interview with George Noory.  So glad to hear about your aspirations, you'd be GREAT.  Your traumas would be the mechanism to help heal others.  Keep me posted.  Warm warm wishes.

            sometimes the coast to coast programs get swept off you tube as they are considered "bootlegged" though new shows are regularly put up there probably as marketing.   sorry that one is gone.

            Basically it was a Christian minister who was a serial ritual abuse specialist. He talked about how people can be split through family bloodlines to create personalities who will murder and do other acts uknown to the core personality, but he also talked about how a "demonic" entitiy through the ritual side of abuse can inhabit the person to give them unusual strength and powers as well.  So he seemed to be comfortable with both the secular and the religious take on this phenomenon.  He talked about globalism and how the globalist think this activity gives them power to dominate the earth, whether we believe in it or not.  He said he had been threatened with harm to his own daughter early on when doing this work.

            The flight attendant news story is weird to me because last week in CA they arrested 474 people in relation to human trafficking, yet  ZERO coverage of it anywhere. So why is this story that happened A WHOLE YEAR ago getting so much coverage now? Very strange. Maybe it's a special message to all the human traffickers out there that things have been compromised and that no one is safe?  Just a theory...

            I agree-  I also would suggest people look to their own state/local news to see what is going on. Also there is the story of a flight attendant that rescued a girl on a plane. The actual story is from 2011 .Is odd to me it was released yesterday

            Nice summary post, OP. One hint: a really great way to include citations to your sources is to turn the mention of it in your text directly into an embedded hyperlink. It's really easy. You just highlight whatever key words of the text you want to turn into a blue link, go to the little tool bar that is right above the editing window, and click the third button, which looks like a piece of chain. That will create a little box, into which you can paste the url of your source. That way, you won't have to include a bunch of footnotes. :-)

            Coast to Coast AM has not mentioned pizzagate or done a show on it for months now since it broke, (maybe a quick news item mention of the pizzagate shooter guy but that's it since it broke), but they just did a show now on "Ritual Satanic Abuse" and the guy ties it into the government and the military.   Maybe they feel safer to talke about it now that there is a buzz that there will be some movement by law enforcement

             This does not seem to be #pizzagate related, and in fact seems to be pro-Trump-impeachment, so I am inclined not to include it?
