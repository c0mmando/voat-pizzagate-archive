<p>I was unaware of this document until recently. It was written by a guy named Michael Swift and published in &quot;Gay Community News&quot; on Feb. 15-21, 1987. Some people regard it as a satire. In its own words, it\'s a &quot;cruel fantasy, an eruption of inner rage, on how the oppressed desperately dream of being the oppressor.&quot; You be the judge:</p>
<p>The first paragraph is a very disturbing &quot;cruel fantasy&quot; about pedophilia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall sodomize your sons, emblems of your feeble masculinity, of your shallow dreams and vulgar lies. We shall seduce them in your schools, in your dormitories, in your gymnasiums, in your locker rooms, in your sports arenas, in your seminaries, in your youth groups, in your movie theater bathrooms, in your army bunkhouses, in your truck stops, in your all-male clubs, in your houses of Congress, wherever men are with men together. Your sons shall become our minions and do our bidding. They will be recast in our image. They will come to crave and adore us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this &quot;fantasy,&quot; it seems that the author considers pedophilia to be a way for homosexual men to procreate, hence the reference &quot;your sons&quot; becoming their &quot;minions&quot; and being &quot;recast in our image,&quot; biblical language referencing procreation (e.g. Gen. 5:3). That struck me as I considered the many high-profile homosexual individuals visible in the media recently who were abused as children or teenagers such as Milo, George Takei, Bill Maher, etc. Obviously homosexual copulation doesn\'t lead to natural procreation.</p>
<p>There are also several clear connections in this article to government. The author fantasizes about sodomizing boys &quot;in your houses of Congress.&quot; Is this really a &quot;fantasy?&quot; Four years before the Gay Manifesto was published (1983), the congressional page sex scandal erupted.</p>

<p>Then two years after (1989), Tom Brokaw reported on the White House call boy scandal. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTitnDgw3Gc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTitnDgw3Gc</a></p>
<p>There\'s obviously a lot more about that (I haven\'t even mentioned Barney Frank), but I digress...</p>
<p>Swift also writes, &quot;All laws banning homosexual activity will be revoked. Instead, legislation shall be passed which engenders love between men.&quot; I\'ve read several places that the article has been interjected into the Congressional Record. I don\'t know why.</p>
<p>Finally, Swift writes that &quot;All homosexuals must stand together as brothers; we must be united <em>artistically, philosophically, socially, politically and financially</em>.&quot; These words accounts for just about every area we are investigating in pizzagate.</p>
<p>So satire or not, it seems that much of this &quot;fantasy&quot; or &quot;dream&quot; has come true in Pizzagate.</p>
<p>Does anyone know more about who this Michael Swift is? The Gay Manifesto is the only thing that comes up under his name on Google.</p>',

           The first paragraph is a very disturbing "cruel fantasy" about pedophilia:
          </p>
          <blockquote>

          <p>
           There are also several clear connections in this article to government. The author fantasizes about sodomizing boys "in your houses of Congress." Is this really a "fantasy?" Four years before the Gay Manifesto was published (1983), the congressional page sex scandal erupted.

          <p>
           Then two years after (1989), Tom Brokaw reported on the White House call boy scandal.

          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, Swift writes that "All homosexuals must stand together as brothers; we must be united
           <em>
            artistically, philosophically, socially, politically and financially

           ." These words accounts for just about every area we are investigating in pizzagate.

            Jimmy Savile's youngest victim was a 7 year old boy, while most of his victims were females. Its about abuse not about the victims sex. "Do you think  I will do better playing dominos on Pizza or Pasta".

            Gays, straights and in-betweens can all be pedos. Pizzagate isn't about getting the gay pedos exclusively but all the PEDOS and traffickers! Looking at you Epstein, Silsby, Maxwell, Clinton and Podesta

            Something I read in an experiencer story, it might have been
            <em>
             Svali Speaks
            </em>
            , was that victims of mind control and SRA who grow up to become adult operators in the system, chose same sex partners in adulthood.  They may get married and have children to seem normal, but their love life is strictly homosexual.  This goes for men and women both.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying all homosexuals are former abuse victims, but control and mind-control always seem to be in play in pizzagate research.  Very alike to moving a control agenda forward.

            this is kind of a parody (but not really) of Jonathan Swift's 1729 famous satire "A Modest Proposal" that advocates the poor simply eat their own children

            Like it or not, the laws are already on the books.  Discrimination based on "sexual orientation" is illegal.  If pedophilia is not a sexual orientation, please tell me what it is?  It is not enforced currently, but that is next in line.
You will soon not be allowed to infringe on your children's "right to choose"  when, with whom, or at what age to have sex.  Age of consent laws?  That is wiped out with the stroke of a (pedo) Judge's pen.  Don't get your "bigoted" hopes up.  The Supreme Court would never uphold that?  If i told you 20 years ago that the Supreme Court would rule that the Constitution guarantees the right of men to marry men, and women to marry women, you probably wouldn't even have taken the trouble to laugh.  I am a Libertarian, so i have no problem with what any consenting adults do, but it is disturbing to see Judges pull decisions out of a total vacuum.

            NAMBLA  is part of the same political action committees, giving money to the same politicians, and soon they will not allow you or anyone to make your children "second class citizens."   And the public will fall for these childish word games the same as it falls for all the other ones.  They do every time.

            If you want pizzagate to be investigated and taken seriously it needs to be done by both sides.

              Wrong, socialism has nothing to do with government just decides who owns the factory and who is getting paid (owning means of production) nothing to do with government. Anyway thats not what were here for, we want pizzagate to be investigated and telling someone to "gtfo" doesnt not help this be investigated.
