            Field is the real deal. He was a fighter pilot. He turned in his sister Kristine Marcy who was part of Serco and involved directly with HRC &amp; then Michelle O. in setting up pedo/snuff blackmail. He knows the answers to JonBenet.

            I was going to do more research into her. I started watching more Abel Danger videos after I saw so many people asking George Webb to meet up with him. Interesting that the other day in the middle of one of his videos he mentions meeting w Webb, (not by name), then goes on to say that the person he met with said that they were aware of a secret service agent who had a memory stick with video evidence of Trump being brownstoned by a 13 yr old girl back in the day and that that was recently taken to DC. Implying that that is the reason Trump is now compromised and his agenda will not be followed. It actually made me question Webb. Only bc if Trump was compromised in that way during the campaign, why in the hell would they have let that go? Why not just use it then? 
I can't say what I think if Field or his theories yet. Hard to tell who's telling the truth nowadays.

           </p>
           <p>
            That's the Boeing Honeywell Uninteruptable Auto-Pilot you're talking about. It's the real deal. Field had to go to court to prove it but it definitely exists. Any plane with that installed can be taken over at any time and the pilots on board can't do a thing about it. It's goal originally was to make a plane hijack proof. Which right there means 9/11 was an inside job. As soon as the planes were hijacked they should have had the uninteruptable auto-pilot engaged and flown to the nearest airfield. Full Stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            9/11 was a total inside job. The only question now is how is Trump going to spill the beans to the American people.

            "people are speculating that Field McConnell is plant: that is he is involved in all this stuff in order to spread misinformation."
           </p>
           <p>
            I've thought that a few times, especially in the beginning when trying to follow Field McConnell's speaking style. But if you listen to him long enough you realize he's the real deal. He's not acting of that I'm sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other reason I don't think he's a shill is the majority of his work is researching every last aspect of 9/11 and recreating all the players that they believe took part. You could almost say Abel Danger is the most detailed and most credible source on 9/11. Field was an airline pilot and flew all the types of aircraft used on 9/11. He says there's no way in hell a human being could have flown a 767 at 500 knots into either of the towers. As I recall the real tell was that left turn at 500 knots right before impact. A human can't be that precise. He said any airline pilot could recognize 175 was on auto-pilot at impact which means there was no human in the loop.

             It's taken me about 50 hours of Field and David Hawkins's videos and pages of notes to try and understand what they are saying but it was worth it. I'm not totally on board with everything that Field believes outside of 911 but Hawkins has one of the most brilliant minds I've come across.
