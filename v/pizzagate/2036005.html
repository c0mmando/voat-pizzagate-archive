The boy was found to be sexually abused and ended up being human trafficked to Australia where he’s disappeared. I’ve recently discovered that CNN was a major part of turning over that little boy to an alleged pedophile.  
</p>
<p>Sinister CNN is worse than we ever imagined. My new opinion is that it’s downright evil. That opinion was shaped by what I discovered this evening. I was dumpster diving when I ran upon their part in the horrendous human trafficking story of Jonah Rief. The only thing that’s stopping me from saying that CNN is 100% responsible for what happened to Jonah is that I don’t know who tipped off the police to where Tammy Rief was hiding, or what prompted that call. But let me start at the beginning.  
</p>
<p>Tammy Rief was a single mom to her son Jonah when she was targeted by a piece of human scum that went by the name Brian Sullivan. He was not the father of this child and, therefore, not biologically related. Although, he lived in Colorado, and she lived in Alabama, he somehow gained custody by going through the pedocourts of San Diego California . After suspecting her son was being sexually abuse and being forced to turn him over to Brian Sullivan after supervised visits, she did the only thing she could which was to kidnap her own child. </p>
<p>She and Jonah eluded the police for four long months. That was when CNN got involved. It was through HLN. Here is the description from CNN’s website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/videos/hln">http://www.cnn.com/specials/videos/hln</a>
HLN is a national news network that airs news by day and mysteries and investigations by night. HLN\'s dayside programs feature live coverage of national, regional, lifestyle, and entertainment stories in a fast-paced approachable tone with expert-led, personality driven hosts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds innocent enough, but then scum-sucking CNN is good at masking their evil designs. It seems HLN picked up on the Jonah Rief story, and decided to feature him in a program called, ‘FIND OUR CHILDREN”. Nice? No, but wait … THEY CAME OUT ON THE SIDE OF BRIAN SULLIVAN!  Here … see for yourself!</p>

<p>Police in La Jolla, California are looking for Jonah Sullivan. Jonah is four years old and has been missing since April.
Jonah was reportedly taken by his mother, Tammy Rief. There is a warrant for her arrest, and Jonah\'s dad has been awarded custody of him.</p>
<p>Watch this video to see pictures of Jonah and learn more about his story.</p>
<p>Find Our Children is In Session’s partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. If you have any information on Jonah or any other missing children, please call 1-800-THE-LOST. You can also visit www.missingkids.com for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is “FIND OUR CHILDREN IS IN SESSION’S PARTNERSHIP WITH NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN” There you have it! Moloch and Satan walking hand-in-hand! But it gets worse. If you watch the video, you’ll learn that the cloned piece of human papillomavirus hosting the human trafficking segment says that: (1) Tammy Rief had successfully evaded capture for FOUR MONTHS (important); (2) that the record for FIND OUR CHILDREN was 100%, in that, 30 out of the 30 children featured had been REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES, and that (3) they were counting on Americans to find Jonah SULLIVAN!  Yes, the disgusting whore hosting the program to aid human traffickers called Jonah Rief, “JONAH SULLIVAN”! No, bitch! That is NOT his name! But, please, watch that video! </p>
<p>In it you’ll see that they used a photo of Tammy Rief so that they could unleash the American public on her. Tammy Rief looks absolutely in agony! She looks like a tortured soul that has had her heart ripped out, oh, but you know what? NOT ONE PICTURE OF THE ALLEGED FATHER WAS SHOWN! Why do you think that is? My guess is that if his picture were shown, that many, many people would have recognized him as the fucking a$$hole he is! </p>
<p>Lo and behold, less than TWO WEEKS LATER, Tammy and Jonah were captured! Here’s the link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE:  Tammy Rief and her son were found hiding in the closet of a friends home.  Read police report here.    More info, here. 2015 hearing here.
<a href="http://www.missingpersonsofamerica.com/2012/10/25/tammy-rief-and-jonah-rief-missing-from-california/">http://www.missingpersonsofamerica.com/2012/10/25/tammy-rief-and-jonah-rief-missing-from-california/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they were found HIDING IN THEIR FRIEND’S CLOSET!!!! Have you ever heard of anything so pathetic? A mother desperate to save her son and CNN gets involved and uses its vast resources to crush her? </p>
<p>And in case you really want to cry, here’s the police report dated NOVEMBER 5, 2012:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/214078952/Police-Report-in-Tammy-Rief-s-case">https://www.scribd.com/doc/214078952/Police-Report-in-Tammy-Rief-s-case</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, the date on the program is: OCTOBER  16, 2012. The date of capture: NOVEMBER 5, 2012. </p>
<p>Does that mean it’s 31 out of 31 and FIND OUR CHILDREN kept its 100% record intact? </p>
<p>I certainly hope that Mike Cernovich highlights this story in HOAXED. This kid needs to be returned home! The only question left is whether this program was specifically designed to track down kids or families that ran away from abusers, or it was a convenient vehicle. My guess would be it was designed to, or that it was where the direction they wanted it to go. Why else partner with National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. </p>
<p>I think that by going through the other stories featured on this program, it might be a good place to get leads by seeing who was involved in putting these segments together. I\'m also very curious as to whether Brian Sullivan had a contact working at CNN who arranged the feature. Someone like Jake Tapper or Anderson Cooper that could get it on HLN\'s radar. </p>

            They also referred to her as a Julie Sullivan in these fake court papers , as well as referring to Conner and Colin as if they were her children ! It was if they were having fake court tv ! They purposely created such an unbelieveble case to try making her go crazy or something . But she is well aware of what they did and also aware that they have blocked the media as well as activist from helping her. You know it's so terrible people would do such a thing to a child and their mother , Tammy would have been more than willing to share cusitidy if he had been the father but he is not the father and the DNA test showed it was two brothers ! , not that he was any kin at all to Jonah Rief .so that's bs! Then the aritcals that were written , was infected with untruths one said she meet him in sc. a lie , others put the wrong dates , or put Jonah story as alexi story and alexi story as Jonah . They created so much confusion to make it so unbelieveble . But it is true and they are experts . I hope everyone Will realize these people have taken her only child she was in her 40s had no idea she could ever have a child , but a miracle happened , she did, then had some man she met at a celebrity NFL fundraiser in ca . And dated him maybe 3 months in 2006 , he Brian Sullivan left for Australia , New Zealand , and Transylvania with his friend a man named Charles  , Tammy didn't get pregnant until feb,2007 at this time Brian Sullivan was not in the picture. Then after being in terrier for months with threats and break ins while carrying Jonah , Brian try's to take him at the hospital when he was borned as well , Tammy has been thu a hell that most folk would have lost their mind , then having to fight for her child which should have never happened because Jonah is not Brian Sullivan's child! Then having to watch her son go thu mental abuse, physical abuse , and sexual abuse ! Not to mention all the rounds of shots they wer giving him! My God I ask you why would the people whom are suppose to protect us alow such a thing to happen! Then they make sure they drain her and her parents of every penny they have . Throw her in jail under another name , then sale her son! That poor child was handed over to the wolfs! Now Tammy has to remain hidden due to threats they have used her stolen her identity as well. If she try's anything they are right behind her . What has happened to people how could anyone do such to children and their parents. Tammy and her parents have not celebrated a holiday or anything since Jonah Rief has been gone , they are at a complete pause , until one day they can find her miracle son Jonah Rief

             There are a lot of independent journalists now. It's a different world. I sympathize with the story and what she's gone through, but she needs to get someone to champion her story and get Jonah back. I notice there are never any photos of Brian Sullivan shown. Why? Why isn't his picture out there? It would help in finding him. Children change so much, but an adult?
            </p>
            <p>
             Look, all I know is she's driving this train. If she wants her son back, and she does, she needs to regroup and find someone to help.

As of this morning , all my photos were somehow wiped from my phone and want alow me to take any photos as well ! I guess this conversation has got my phone hacked.

             I thought they were just clueless in the beginning, but I believe they are a malevolent organization that spews out propaganda and lies for nefarious purposes. They have an agenda and have carried it out with impunity. It's only now that people are catching on.

             This. It's what we all want to know.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I understand, he basically lied about being the father and never did submit to paternity testing. I believe he also went through a divorce court, lying about non-existent divorce proceedings even though Tammy Rief was never married. To make matters worse, he entered the country on a fake passport, and it seems this could all have been cleared up by the court checking on any one of these things, but the legalities were thrown out the window.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a whole entire backstory to this. By that I mean, Tammy alleges that while in Alabama, there was a group behind Brian Sullivan and this push to get Jonah. I also am suspicious because she worked in the movie industry for quite some time. She might have gotten on someone's radar back then. And she did date this guy Sullivan. Who knew dating someone would cause her to lose custody? It's outrageous and no one is still helping her get her son back.

              Judge pollack was his former attorney with the volunteer association in San Diego on another title IV case with another mother, where pollacks law firm represented Brian Sullivan and stole 2 other children through the system. I believe the lawyer with pollack was named Herbert. Same lawyer crystal harris hired out of ' Higgs &amp; fletcher' to force pollack to get off her case, making it be a conflict of interest.

             i heard CNN was started by Walt Disney as propaganda.  When you look at the logo in the mirror it says WD. Supposedly satanists do this type of stuff as black magic.

             The CIA is entrenched there.  CIA has been entrenched in all major media outlets since the 1950s (Operation Mockingbird).
            </p>
            <p>
             CNN was founded with DoD seed money, ergo their role is to promote WAR.  Remember the scud missile crap during the first Gulf War?  That's when CNN became a viable player on the media scene.

            Another heart breaking horrible disgusting story.  Now we have a news station that should be warning us about criminals and instead they are responsible for playing Amber Alert.  Alerting us that a mother of a child has kidnapped her own child when she was trying to keep him safe from a pervert.  A PERVERT.  CNN is totally irresponsible and is a complete failure and is getting itself in deep hot water.  This story must be told and when it is, the real truth must come out.

             CNN is a blight and insidious in nature. There is no journalistic integrity, and stories like this illustrate the depth they go to keep the Pedophile Elite happy. I sincerely can't believe anyone would want a little boy abused and stolen, but here's an example proving me wrong. And I'm sure it's only the tip of the ice berg.

                The Head Pedo must be involved with NCMEC and they might have cooked up a deal.  This is thoroughly beyond imagination.  I don't think the viewers would believe it. It is something none of us would never think could happen.  Totally Corrupt.

                  I never thought Jerry was a lily white parent.  I had read quite a while ago on here from research by someone on here that he had had CP on his computer which was erased by someone in LE that he had connections to.  That made me think he had a checkered background.  So yes, he could be involved in something as nefarious as the microchipping.  These guys are not smart enough to have n honorable profession.  The only thing their brain is wired to do is doing everyone else in for profit. Disgusting.
