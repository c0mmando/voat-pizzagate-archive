<p>The Illuminati Card Game was invented by Steve Jackson, in 1981, 1982, or 1995 depending on which source you consult or perhaps they are different editions. </p>
<p>&quot;On March 1, 1990, the offices of Steve Jackson Games, in Austin, Texas, were raided by the U.S. Secret Service as part of a nationwide investigation of data piracy.&quot; Source: <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/SS/">http://www.sjgames.com/SS/</a>

<p>Complete information is disappearing, though people continue to discuss various cards that seem to be predictive, such as a card featuring a man who looks like Trump titled &quot;Enough is Enough&quot;: <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/illuminati-planning-trump-assassination-attempt/">http://investmentwatchblog.com/illuminati-planning-trump-assassination-attempt/</a></p>

You can see the Pizza card second from left in the third row from the bottom. </p>
<p>We have come to learn the pedo code of &quot;pizza&quot; &quot;cheese pizza&quot; etc. maybe there\'s another meaning to  FBI anon &quot;follow the cards&quot; besides C.A.R.D.S.?</p>
<p>This video was uploaded in 2012, so the card was not just invented for last November:

<p>The title of card #444 is &quot;Pizza for the Secret Meeting.&quot; The card shows a slice of pizza on a checkerboard background and the text below reads:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Is this the secret meeting? Here you go sir. Double cheese, pepperoni, anchovy, green olives, black olives, mushroom and a microphone. Play this card at any time. Pick one Secret group to lose it\'s Secret status for the rest of the current turn.&quot;</strong></p>

            Just wanted to mention the #444 has meaning in several spiritual contexts. The most profound event in recent history was the Iran hostage crisis. The hostages were held for exactly 444 days. There are additional instances as well.

            Does anyone else just sit here and say WTF is it that these Evil Pedo Fucks want? I mean it is not about just $$, ruling the world and sex!
These fucks do not care that it has been exposed about the trafficking, the kid diddling, all the Clinton Foundation crimes. 
The idea about NWO does not make sense any longer. It's obvious they have that! The rule of law does not apply to them, that in it's self is world power. The RCs, the Vatican and Soros alone own the the world. Sex can be had by these fucks at anytime.
At any time they and their secret army of minions could round people up or killus off.
So, WTF could be so secret and "horrific" that these fucks are afraid to have exposed?
It has to be something that each human on the earth is personally effected by it, unknowingly. That if it stops, the Evil fucks would no longer have any $$, power or sex!

             I agree. That's why it is important to read the playbook, as Bernard the the Dutch banker recommended,  and not be fooled by the dog and pony show.

             </p>
             <p>
              What's the name of that book? I'm trying to google it but forgot the name.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT:
             </p>
             <p>
              I just realized you meant the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. I will read that finally as I've never even cracked the thing. I'm pretty sure Bernard recommended it because parts of it are true. But the Protocols as a whole has been widely discredited. It lifted entire passages from other anti-semitic texts of the day.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Bernard did in fact mean the Protocols were 100% true I'd question whether he's a shill being paid by the very bankers he's says he's outing. Maybe they have dirt on him to and gave him the job of making a credible interview that will be dismissed by any college educated American or European because it recommends reading the Protocols.
             </p>
             <p>
              In other words the Protocols are the third rail of American and European politics. If someone touches it their credibility is dead. I now believe this elite layer at the top exists but I also have to come to find out there are some fucking smart people up there. I wouldn't put this past them for one second. It could even make sense as another line of their defense. Perhaps their first line of defense failed and the Bernard interview is the second line where they admit the practice but then taint the testimony to discredit it.

             Yes, and there is a 1995 edition--all of it predating Trump, Assange, Pizzagate, etc.

             i used to play it for many years with high school friends. It was fantastic. The game dynamics ensured you turned into the most backstabbing cynical callous prick. it was hillarious - and incredibly accurate.

             I remember in pizzagate early days looking into podesta's 14 / fish and the connection to a group called 'goldfish fanciers' - an otherwise completely mysterious and obtuse low power card in the Illuminati game, and i did wonder how Steve Jackson knew about so much of this shit
