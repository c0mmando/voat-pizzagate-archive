<h1>The university won\'t ban <strong>Tekashi 6ix9nine</strong>, real name <strong>Daniel Hernandez</strong>, from performing at their CFE Arena on September 22 <strong>because they say the venue has been hired privately</strong>.</h1>
<h1><em>But outraged students have accused them of ‘condoning’ 22 year-old Hernandez’s crime by letting him on campus, and have collected 5,000 signatures on a petition calling for the concert to be scrapped.</em></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Student Noemi Teutsch, who is leading the campaign told WFTV: ‘People are just as outraged as I am, if not more.</p>
<p><strong>‘[T]hey are endorsing, and they are condoning his behavior because they’re allowing him to come on campus to perform.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Teutsch says that if the petition fails to embarrass UCF leaders into banning Hernandez, she and her fellow signatories will organize a protest.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Hernandez struck a plea deal with the state of New York in 2015 which saw him admit felony use of a child in a sexual performance over the abuse video <em>[please see info below]</em>.</h1>
<p><strong>The clip saw Hernandez thrust his hips behind the victim as she performed a sex act on one of his pals.</strong></p>
<p>But he was back in court earlier this month for violating the terms of that deal by getting re-arrested twice and joining a gang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hernandez will be sentenced for the crime on October 1 – nine days after the planned concert, and was previously banned from performing in Manchester, England, because of his criminal record.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A UCF spokesman told WFTV: ‘Outside performers can rent the space. However, that does not mean that the university endorses them.</p>
<p>‘At all times, the safety of our campus is our top priority.’ <em>Sure...</em> /s</p>

<p><strong>What the actual fuck?!</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<h1><strong>In October 2015, Hernandez pled guilty to one felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance.</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hernandez was charged with three counts of the offense after a February 2015 incident where he had sexual contact with a 13-year-old girl and later distributed videos of the incident online.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Three videos are described in the criminal complaint against Hernandez.</em> </p>
<p>In the first video, &quot;the child engages in oral sexual intercourse with the separately charged defendant Taquan Anderson, while the defendant, Daniel Hernandez, stands behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking her on her buttocks. The child is nude in the video.&quot; </p>
<p>The other videos show the child sitting on the lap of Hernandez while her breasts are groped by Anderson, and later sitting naked across the laps of Anderson and Hernandez.</p>
<p>Prior to his sexual misconduct charges, Hernandez served jail time as a minor for assault and the sale of heroin.
On July 12, 2018, Hernandez was arrested in New York for an outstanding warrant related to an incident where he allegedly choked a 16-year-old in Houston\'s Galleria mall in January 2018.</p>
<p><em>Due to his continuing legal problems in light of his plea bargain, the Manhattan district attorney\'s office announced Hernandez could face up to three years in prison and possible sex offender registration for his 2015 case.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Sentencing is scheduled to take place on October 2, 2018.</strong></p>

<p><em>Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as &quot;Scumlife&quot;, &quot;Yokai&quot;, and &quot;Hellsing Station&quot;, drawing attention due to his aggressive rapping style and the use of anime as music video visuals.</em></p>
<p><em>Hernandez rose to prominence on social media due to a July 2017 Instagram post that went viral on both Reddit and Twitter, where Hernandez\'s eccentric appearance (rainbow-dyed hair, a rainbow grill, and multiple versions of the number 69 tattooed on his body) turned him into an internet meme.</em></p>',

            Said it before so many times in the last two decades, Yankee college. I am not saying that the others have not been infiltrated by absolute scum, but it would not fly in certain other places. It was only a few years back when Manatee Community College was a respectable learning establishment. I could have 5 million$'s and I would still send my uncles' kids to work in a business to learn a trade. Sad time for higher education.

            So much for the campuses Me Too movement involving sexual assaults yet they allow these bags of shit in to perform their degenerate trash music. Hypocrites much? This guy even openly admits he sold his soul to the Illuminati. Those are his words. Imagine what he actually had to do. Sick.

             Jewelry falls off a boat, gets remelted in that infamous NYC street, really got stolen, or never existed. Same scam. It is about taxes.Young musicians could smoke 100,000 in crack, and make twice that much with a good accountant. Money Laundering would be the most likely charge.

            Why has he not, at MINIMUM, been registered as a sex offender?!!?
My God, every day there's more evil filth rising to the top! This punk piece of trash has over eleven million followers on IG. How does one justify supporting &amp;/or being a fan to utterly wicked corruption???!?
Thx for posting main campus number

            Am on phone can’t copy Instagram pics. Look under his eyes.  I saw it in a few pictures. Darkness under the eyes. This is a young kid. Should not have light puffiness nor darkness. A sign of abuse. This kid could be under MK Ultra. He looks like a combo of Beiber an MS 13. Notice him with a few little kids too. No wonder they are refusing to cancel. He could be some new hottie they want to push. This is SO SICK. Someone please check those pics.

              Sadly, I am afraid if someone does not intervene, he may end up like them too.  Something is seriously wrong with this boy.  He is a boy.  This is not someone on the way to maturity and finding his manhood.

               Great idea for Twitter!  This reminds me of another R Kelley.  Kelley skirted the law for quite some time and still has managed to stay out of jail.  Seriously think there are other forces and backers at work here.  Possibly a David G or just like him.

            So woody Allen is axed, R Kelly is axed, why are we cool with some dude who molested a 13 year old again?? Not to mention his music is sub par, if they want to keep it going good for them I guess, I'm not one to want someone's life to be ruined over one horrible action, but this is a pretty big no no and I certainly won't be attending.

             R Kelley has been slightly wounded but is still out of jail.  He has connections to David G and others in Pedowood and has a rich lifestyle without making that much money as of late.  Someone is backing these Filthy Pedos.  There is more going on here than meets the eye.

              He was able to carry on for years, I'm not buying that no one knew about his escapades! It's true, they always seem to be shielded from any real consequence unless the media decides to vilify them like Harvey Weinstein, who although gross, is really just the fall guy for something much more pervasive,
At least in my opinion.

               He seems to me to be on the same course as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry Beiber and some Hard Core Rappers.  As I said like R Kelley.  He comes from a very dangerous area.  The Mexican and PR hoods in NY.  He has a little girl too.  If you look, there she is wearing his necklace.  Somebody gave him his start, backed him up.  The story is he couldn't even afford to buy his daughter diapers.  I am worried about her since he is a pedophile.  Possibly that video was his initiation fee into the big time.  This is all so really sick and sad.  As far as Kelly, the parents can't get their daughters back.  Now that is really bad.

                I mean r kelly carried on for years, but yeah I agree, they talked about his video with the 13 year old for like a day or a week then all of a sudden he is releasing a song with Nikki minaj?? Wtf! Which potentially skyrockets his career. People are getting booted out of Hollywood for taking advantage of the casting couch, which everyone knew about, but we don't care about rainbow pedo dude?? Man that seems like a sick double standard to me. What do you mean the parents can't get their daughter back??

                 Parents Told Police Their Daughter Is Being Held Against Her Will In R. Kelly’s “Cult”
                </p>
                <p>
                 As the R&amp;B legend tours the country this summer, parents have told police that R. Kelly is keeping women against their will in an abusive "cult" that's tearing families apart. Three former members of Kelly’s inner circle told BuzzFeed News similar stories.
