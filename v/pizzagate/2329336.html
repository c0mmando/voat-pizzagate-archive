            Yes, that's part of the rich diverse culture of Islam is- child raping, incest, etc. Now that Sweden is almost under Islamic control, it will become the new norm.

            Sweden has so long tried to show its ability to be a powerhouse in the world that they are ridiculous and totally afraid to say or do anything that may offend thus offending their own citizens in the process. But I am sure that those they protect with these disgusting and I believe criminal acts totally respect them right? HA!

            You can 1) either force them to divorce or 2) deport them. Both options are unpalatable to a typical liberal Swede. This is what happens when values clash in a liberal Western democracy.

            The ignorant fools in this thread are thinking of repeated cousin marriages where recessive genes are much more likely to coincide.

            I'm guessing you don't think it works in reverse though: that a 12yo can be mentally 15.  Google says swedish girls on average lose their virginity at 16.2 years.  Do you understand that average means half of them lose it before then, say, AT AGE 15?  So you don't care if they're voluntarily sexually active, only if they get married first.  Horny penniless irrational teenage boys thank you for your efforts on their behalf

            Women are for making babies and everything else is secondary.  Men are also for making babies and working to provide for as many as possible.  At what age they do this is largely irrelevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering your brithrate is below even replacing itself and your women are probably sluts, this shouldn't be a priority for you.

            That's bs. Most of these marriages are forced marriages anyway, in most cases the girls are not allowed to choose their 'husbands', their family will.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it would be even pointless to ask the girls how they feel about their 'marriage' when entering Sweden - someone in a foreign country, who will certainly be threatened by family and 'husband' before an interrogation simply won't come forward and tell everybody she is being raped and would like a divorce.
           </p>
           <p>
            And these girls are led to believe that they must obey their 'husbands' at all means and submit to their wishes anytime in their home countries.

            The Turkish council for religious affairs just stated that they approve of
            <strong>
             9 year old
            </strong>
            girls getting married - and raped legally - a couple of days ago. Can you imagine?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Turkish President, Erdogan, tried to change the law, introducing a bill that would have lowered the age of marriage to 14 years last year. Luckily, there were so many protests he had to retract the proposal.
           </p>
           <p>
            So please watch closely what's going on in Muslim countries - it could get even worse.

             What's going on in Muslim countries is the women have like 5 babies each compared to our ONE.  Which means you could arrest and execute every single PG offender tomorrow and our countries would still be fucked.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the only way to have more babies is to marry younger.  What a conundrum, NOT! Fuckin skanks.  Abrogating your female responsibility to your race so you can suck dicks and get drunk in college.  SHAME

              I hardly couldn't believe it when I read about religious authorities in Turkey setting the age of marriage at
              <strong>
               9 years
              </strong>
              . There are Muslim countries like Afghanistan where this is happening anyway, but you'd expect a modern country like Turkey, with close ties to Europe, to act differently.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the religiouls council of Turkey trains the Muslim cleric and Muslim teachers that will work in other European countries like the Netherlands, Austria, Germany etc., and these will teach these value sets in mosques and schools....so these notions will be spreading.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's an illusion to pretend that Islam will soon have an 'age of enlightenment' like Europe in the 18th century, this is just part of the brainwashing that's going on at present.
             </p>

              Edit:
              <em>
               I hope the mods won't take down this post; it's an important piece of the puzzle to understand how elite pedophiles try to normalize pedophilia - by instigating Muslim mass integration to Europe or Canada. Many newspapers and magazines in Europe have been publishing 'heartbreaking' stories of underage girls at age 14 or 15 who were desperately 'in love' with their older husbands. It's part of the psy-op to undermine Western values and to normalize pedophilia. Thus, relevant to pizzagate. ;-)

            It's legal, if you are Muslim... Because the progressive- left bow down to Brussels and the satanic, pedophile globalists and take their money and power with a smile on their face. 6 out of 10 Swedish politicians are on Soros payroll. Oh, almost forgot to mention that Sweden is the most brainwashed country in the west... Ideological subversion at it's finest.

             Is it actually enforced?
            </p>
            <p>
             In Japan it is often stated that age of consent is also 13. What many miss out is that's the federal age of consent. In practice, all prefectures enforce their own higher age of consent. So in practice it's not possible for a creepo to fuck a 13 years old girl.
