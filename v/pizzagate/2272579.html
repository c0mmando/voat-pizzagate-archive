            When I looked up this Amber Alert System,
            <a href="https://www.amberalert.gov/active.htm">
             https://www.amberalert.gov/active.htm
            </a>
            . Although this is a .gov site, it is not a part of the US govt. There is a link to
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/Amber.html">
             http://www.missingkids.com/Amber.html
            </a>
            which
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/gethelpnow/amber/wea">
             http://www.missingkids.com/gethelpnow/amber/wea
            </a>
            states that it is a NGO. How sad. It seems odd that there are so few pictures of missing children on the site. Maybe I'm missing something but what happened to the pictures of the hundreds of children states as missing in Washington DC and Virginia and elsewhere in the USA? This group isn't doing a very good job of being the center for missing children.

             I think you have this incorrect.  The NGO is just serving as a clearinghouse for information.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at the FAQ, the national coordinator works in DOJ and Alerts are issued by local law enforcement.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Who is the National Coordinator for AMBER Alert and what is the Coordinator's role?
             </p>
             <p>
              The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, serves as the National AMBER Alert Coordinator. The role of the National Coordinator is to facilitate the development of the AMBER network, support the development of state AMBER plans and efforts, help eliminate geographic gaps in AMBER networks, provide regional AMBER network coordination and provide guidance on criteria for issuing an AMBER Alert.

            For me pizzzagate started when I found out about Hillary getting those two child rapists off the hook.That was like her only real job in her life, and it lasted a couple of days. It was much later that I found out she was fired from Watergate.

             These stories were picked up by Your News Wire a few days later, on the 4th of November

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Revealed: Clinton’s Link To Convicted Child Stealer And Sex Trafficker
             </p>
             <p>
              Internet sleuths, cross-referencing WikiLeaks emails and archived news reports, have linked Hillary Clinton and her foundation with convicted child stealer Laura Silsby and a convicted sex trafficker.
             </p>
             <p>
              The news was made more explosive considering rumors and whisperings have emerged from the FBI’s reopened investigation into Hillary’s emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop that serious additional crimes are under investigation, unrelated to the email server case, involving among other things, child trafficking.

             She got two child rapists off the hook?  Really?  Because they was only one defendant in her trial.

             The other guy was 15 years old and charged as juvenile defender and had a separate trial.

            <p>
             The guy didn't get off.  The case ended in a plea bargain just like what happens in 90% of cases.  The guy took a plea deal and got a 5 year sentence.  1 in prison and 4 on probation.

             The sentence was light because

             </a>
             They lost the only forensic evidence that would have indicated he raped her and were left with a he said/she said case and she was not going to be a good witness and her mother probably wasn't going to let her testify.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              For a variety of reasons, a plea agreement to a reduced charge was reached. Investigators mishandled evidence of Taylor’s bloody underwear, cutting out the stain that contained semen for testing and then losing it. Newsday also quoted a retired detective on the case as saying that Shelton’s “ ‘infatuation’ with the teenage boy, which she refused to admit,” led to “serious inconsistencies in her statements about the incident.” The detective also said Shelton’s mother “was so eager to end the ordeal she coached her daughter’s statements and interrupted interviews with police.”

              That was like her only real job in her life,

             This is really dumb.   Right after this case she went on to found a rape crisis center.  She has worked as a legal advocate, a Congressional Researcher, a director of field operations for the Carter campaign, a legal scholar, the lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, a law professor, director of a legal aid clinic, became the first woman partner at her law firm.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was twice named one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America and served on the board of WalMart and other companies.

The fact that you are pushing his work as deliberate disinfo and do not acknowledge that it is Wikileaks, not Craddick, that originated that date undermines your supposed "correction" here, AWS. You also ignore the fact that Wikileaks retweeted Craddick's Reddit post, saying it was a "Significant, if partisan, find."

             Even if the thesis that Silsby had a preexisting relationship with the Clintons is wrong, you have not proven that the Clinton intervention was normal diplomatic work standard for the SOS. The state dept memo discussing possible options is suspiciously

              In various places, I've already addressed nearly every point you made.

              <p>
               The press release Craddick found among the email archives at Wikileaks is shown there as an email, with a date of 2001-01-01.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Yes. You are correct on the date.  (The document is not a press release, it's more a mission statement/recruiting document for the organization.)
This is a complete error on Wikileaks part
             </p>
             <p>
              However, Craddick is still a liar, because he used this error dishonestly.   Craddick is not an idiot and there is no way to read that document and he did read the document and conclude it's an email from 2001.
             </p>
             <p>
              For one, have you ever seen an email with no sender and no receiver?  How does it get from from a computer in Idaho to Clinton's server without being sent?  That's a big clue.

              Perhaps he missed that, but there is no way a non-idiot could read that document and think it was composed in 2001.  There's simply no honest mistaking that the document was reading after the Haitian Earthquake in January 2010.  The clues are everywhere.

             <p>
              It is absolute proven to be wrong.  Again, I point to the original email thread of how this case worked its way up to Clinton and where that document came from.  It was downloaded from the website of East Side Baptist Church in Twin Falls, Idaho by a low level state department employee.  East Side Baptist was one of two Churches the Baptists who went to Haiti came from.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wikipedia still points to this url, but the church has taken the PDF down.

             <p>
              This is not suspicous at all.  This is standard.   And I have not ignored it.  Someone pointed it out to me the other day and I explained why it was redacted.
If you read that document it explains why it was redacted:  B5.    This refers to one of the exemptions in the Freedom of Information act, it specifically said legal work product is not to be released under FOIA.   The part that is redacted is a legal memo from Harold Koh the Legal Adviser State Deparment.

              I am not clearly wrong.  You're citing the same guy I debunked.   Pleading the Yiff is William Craddick is Disobedient Media.  All the same guy.  He's been lying about Clinton and Silsby for 13 months now.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you think any of the below if false, please point me to it, but you'll need to do more than cite Craddick, he's made claims that are easily proven false.
             </p>
             <p>
              The claim that Clinton knew who Silsby was before the Baptists were arrested is completely false. Craddick claims Wikipedia has an email from 2001 showing this.   It's completely false because the emails wikileaks has are from Clinton's time at the State Department which began in 2009 AND the document he cites was clearly written after the Haitian earthquake of 2010.  There is no way he could be making an honest mistake here.  He is lying.
             </p>
             <p>
              The claim that State Department got involved in this case because of some personal connection to Silsby is completely false.  Helping Americans overseas is one of the highest priorities of the State Department.  This includes Americans who get arrested.   Sometimes this goes up the level of the Secretary, sometimes it does not.  This was an international incident.
             </p>
             <p>
              This email thread shows how the State Department got involved.  They got involved because 10 AMCIT, that is American Citizens were arrested.  They didn't know how the 10 AMCIT were or what their organization was.  The document Craddick talks about is not even an email, it's an attachment to this email.

             <p>
              There is a single news report that Bill Clinton was sent on a diplomatic mission the Times of London.  However, there is a ton of evidence against this news report being true, the key one is that is was never confirmed by anyone including the reporter who made the first claim.   There was no followup whatsoever including by the paper that made the claim.  Craddick also cites a law professor, but doesn't seem to realize the law professor has no original information and just refers to same article in the Times of London.  And the Law professor makes another claim that is false.

               Yes, I believe that Shani M. King is completely wrong here. First of all, he doesn't work at Harvard. His paper makes clear he is an Associate Professor of Law University of Florida's Levin College of Law or the 41st best Law School in the country.

              </p>
              <p>
               And it's clear that King did not do original research on Clinton in Haiti, because that is not the point of his paper. You should follow his footnotes and find the original sources. He relies on a single news story.
              </p>
              <p>
               He also makes a factual claim that is not at all supported by his footnotes. He claimed that Bill Clinton was negotiating with Haiti for a month. He claims this AP news report backs him up, but it doesn't mention Clinton whatsoever.

              <p>
               The original news report is wrong and here's why I believe that.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's based on a single report in the UK press
               <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/clinton-brokers-deal-over-haiti-orphan-abductions-v63ld395r7b">
                https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/clinton-brokers-deal-over-haiti-orphan-abductions-v63ld395r7b
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               No other news reports have this. The UK press didn't claim this is a secret effort on behalf of Bill Clinton. An actual diplomatic intervention would have been reported by multiple sites if it actually happened. Haitian newspapers would have been all over this. The international press would be all over this.
              </p>
              <p>
               The paper that reported it never followed up on it at all. So the original report had no confirmation and zero follow through.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Clinton quotes they used were reported by other outlets 2 days before. Clinton openly spoke to reporters about what the US and Haitian governments should do. He never claimed anything first hand or that he was working on a deal and not a single other source claimed he was intervening in any way. In fact, in CNN's report on it, Bill Clinton doesn't even appear until 22 paragraphs in.
               <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/05/haiti.arrests/index.html">
                http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/02/05/haiti.arrests/index.html
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               There was no press conference about having a reached a deal. Again this was not reported to be a secret deal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bill Clinton left Haiti with all the Baptists were in jail.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Obama adminstration and the State Department were being criticized in the conservative press and by Baptist leaders FOR NOT INTERVENING.
               <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/08/free-the-baptist-10-in-haiti/">
                https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/08/free-the-baptist-10-in-haiti/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Even with this the State Department went out of its way to say it was not intervening and Secretary Clinton would not be getting involved at all.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the time, no other media even did a story following up on the The Times's report. This happens all the time when papers confirm another a paper's reporting. They do not do a followup story when their sources cannot confirm this. And reporters from around the world were on this story for months.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nothing in the 7 plus years since the Haitian earthquake suggests this was true and the Clintons, of course came under intense scrutiny during this time. Haiti's AP reporter who worked this story stayed in Haiti for years writing a book and never had anything on this.
              </p>
              <p>
               In short, there's nothing at all to suggest the Times got their story right. And there's a lot to suggest they got their story wrong, including the fact that they never even followed up on their story. The writer of the Paper relied on them and did not do original research/reporting into this.

               You are clearly wrong because you attempted to refute the issue of assistance with a link for an argument that Clinton didn't  know Silsby for a long time.

                The claim is that that Clinton assisted only because of a personal connection to Silsby AND that the Clintons were the reason she got a six month sentence.
               </p>
               <p>
                These claims are false.  Clinton had not idea who these Baptists from Iowa were when they got arrested.   The State Department got involved, but that involvement did not go beyond what any other American citizen would have been able to get.
               </p>
               <p>
                The false claims rely on people thinking that any State Department involvement is suspect.  It is not.  It is routine.  There was nothing wrong with what the State Deparment did and that level of involvement would be available to any American citizen in the same situation.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's loads of evidence that an extraordinary intervention did not occur.

               <p>
                At the time that a supposed diplomatic mission was underway, the american lawyer for one of the Baptists

                 was pleading for Clinton to intervene on behalf of his client
                </a>
                and the State Department declined this, saying this did not rise to the level of the Secretary.  The Washington Times editorial board
                <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/08/free-the-baptist-10-in-haiti/">
                 excoriated the Obama adminstration for not doing anything
                </a>
                and called them feckless.  The heads of the Baptist Convention were calling on the Administration to intervene.  The reality is the the Obama administration was actually paying a political price not to intervene.  The NY Times ran an article all about how dark and dirty and hot the prison was where these Americans were being kept.

                I'm quite aware of the the quote from this journal.  It's from Shani King who I just discussed.  The King paper relies on the same single news article to make it claim about Bill Clinton.  Check the footnotes.  It's the same thing.  As I just quoted above

               <p>
                The State Department let the Haitian court system deal with the Baptists and they were very clear about this.  My guess for why the kidnapping charges were dropped is when the prosecutor spoke to the parents of the children, he found they had given their children to Silsby.  Everyone involved seemed to agreed the other Baptists were just following Silsby and left her to take care of the details.
               </p>
               <p>
                Please read my full comment again.   The claim that Bill Clinton intervened comes from a single source and I think there's loads of evidence that show this original source is wrong.  A big one being that no other new source followed up on this at the time or in all the years since.

                 Given that assistance from the Clintons resulted in the release of of others in Silsby's group, it's reasonable to think that Silsby herself benefited from this, i.e the claim is most likely true.

                 Here's what
                 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/09/haiti.clinton.arrests/index.html">
                  the State Department was saying
                 </a>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will not get directly involved
                  </strong>
                  in the case of the 10 Americans detained in Haiti on child abduction charges, a State Department spokesman said Tuesday.
"
                  <strong>
                   It would be highly unusual for the secretary of state to intervene in a case involving the judicial process of another country
                  </strong>
                  ," spokesman P.J. Crowley said in an off-camera question-and-answer session.
Reginald Brown -- the Washington lawyer who represents one of the detained Americans --
                  <strong>
                   sent a letter to Clinton on Tuesday asking her to personally intervene
                  </strong>
                  with Haitian authorities.
"This is all the result of a colossal misunderstanding and we are hoping it will resolve itself," Brown said about the arrest and detention of his client, Jim Allen, and the other nine Americans. "We would appreciate it if you could continue to devote significant personal attention to this matter, as we are confident that with your assistance this misunderstanding could be quickly resolved."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He asked Clinton to make "a personal request" to Haitian authorities to allow Allen to speak to his wife and her lawyers and to have fresh supplies.
"As far as I can tell, the one thing our detained American citizens have been able to do is communicate with just about anybody who wants to talk with them," Crowley said at the State Department. "
                  <strong>
                   If family members wish to talk to them, I think that is something that can be easily facilitated through our embassy in Port-au-Prince or through the Haitian government."
The State Department continues carefully to defer to Haitian authorities.
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "We have had regular consular access and meetings with the 10 American citizens," Crowley said. "I believe we have facilitated getting medicine or other needs to our citizens.
                  <strong>
                   We are doing exactly what we would do with detained Americans anywhere in the world.
                  </strong>
                  "
                  <strong>
                   As to intervening directly in the case, we are very respectful of the Haitian government and of Haitian law
                  </strong>
                  ."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The State Department also has ruled out any special role for former President Bill Clinton in a possible release of the Americans.
"
                  <strong>
                   It is unnecessary for former President Bill Clinton to play the role of intermediary
                  </strong>
                  as he did in North Korea in the case of the journalists being held," Crowley told CNN on Monday. "The situation in North Korea and the situation in Haiti are dramatically different. In Haiti there is a functioning government with which we have diplomatic relations and established channels to monitor and deal with bilateral issues. North Korea is an opaque society with which we have no diplomatic relations."

            The info in the article is out of date. AlertSense has been sold and has new management and is out of the Amber Alert business. They make smartphone apps now.

            Laura Silsby (Gayle) isn't with the company any more either.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder is the attention caused by the Pizzagate investigation, especially to the corrupt appointment of Laura Silsby, led to this?

                Some people are not noticing that Pizzagate is morphing into the theatrics of Russiagate. The way we can see this is that Republicans associated with the pedophile network are not suffering the same unfortunate political fates as Democrats.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Republican vs Democrat turfwar is not about taking out a pedophilia blackmail ring, it is about pigs jockeying for better positions at the taxpayer money trough. Pedophilia has yet to enter the equation because its not about taking out the pedophile blackmail ring. Its about Russiagate.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its dragging Pizzagate into the swamp and diluting our message of pedophiles.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pedophiles, Republican and Democrat alike, are rejoicing. Suddenly pedophilia is only a Democrat problem, and no Democrats are going to jail for pedophilia. The subject of pedophilia is slowing sliding off the map.
               </p>
               <p>
                Until the most famous and powerful people in the world, politicians and billionaires, are publicly outed for pedophilia, all else is noise. They are still protecing themselves.
               </p>

                I wish people would notice.
