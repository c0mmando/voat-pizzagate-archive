            Go to Fergies social media and look at her latest post and statement about Andrew, she’s standing by him as if he’s innocent!! Talking about all he has done for “The Monarchy”. Beatrice and Eugenie are both ritual abuse royals look at the date of birth the numbers always matter. They also put on their own little show wearing the hats as protest at Harry’s wedding which was all over the news. They, especially the red headed bug eyed one, have turned into royals in every sense of the word. As children I feel sorry for their abuse and growing up with a pedofile father but now they are fully into the occult, even wearing Kabbalah bracelets at one point. Fergie is a self proclaimed witch which she said on her social media and promoted a book about witches. They all promote children’s charities which is alarming in itself. Don’t let them fool you, the daughters are not innocent either.

            Always with these dates. WTF. I'm even highly suspicious that Princess Beatrice was actually born on the day and time stated...

            What’s with the blurriness under epstein’s chin? Gives a shopped feeling to the image. Also, what’s with the out of place military uniform? This really feels like a pic of someone else with his head attached.

            Public photos. Everyone knows about this. Beatrice and Eugene are actually two of the most decent royals. I feel sorry for them for having a father like Prince Andrew.

            Royals need to hope that the Andrew scandal does not reignite the scandal regarding future king Charles and Jimmy Saville or his pedo vicar. They could end up with major Hewitt's sun Harry on the throne. At least he only dressed as a Nazi.
