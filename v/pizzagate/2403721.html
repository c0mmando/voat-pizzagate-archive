evidence that an MP was involved in the murder of a child in a snuff movie.</p>
<p>A young boy sold for sex is said to have died in a torture session filmed at
Amsterdam’s notorious Blue Boy vice club.</p>
<p>Allegations that the unnamed MP was present can be revealed today. The claims
mean police are now investigating FOUR child murders linked to the alleged
abuse ring.</p>
<p>Informants said the MP was present at the murder after going to Holland for
sex with boys supplied by paedo fixer Warwick Spinks.</p>
<p>Boys were allegedly taken to the guest house in Barnes, South-West London, and
Dolphin Square flats near Westminster, to have sex with VIPs and MPs
including Cyril Smith.</p>
<p>Yesterday it emerged that police who investigated Spinks in the 1990s were
told a boy had died at the club while the MP was present.</p>
<p>A source said: “Officers were told Spinks knew the MP and arranged a tour to
Amsterdam. While there he went to the Blue Boy bar, where Spinks was running
a brothel.</p>
<p>“The MP was said to have been present when a boy died during an orgy which was
being filmed. The information was not confirmed and the MP’s identity never
surfaced.</p>
<p>“However, clear evidence that boys were tortured was discovered.”</p>
<p>Spinks was jailed in 1995 for sex offences, including abducting a boy of 14
and taking him to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Evidence from the Spinks investigation is now being analysed by the Met’s
three-pronged probe into networks of VIP paedophiles.</p>
<p>The team are already probing three other alleged child murders, one by a Tory
MP.</p>
<p>The families of two boys believed to have been murdered by Sidney Cooke’s
paedophile gang are also urging police to investigate possible links to the
VIP ring.</p>
<p>Police were last night accused of covering up claims that a senior MP abused a
boy at a gay brothel.</p>
<p>The victim is said to have named the MP when interviewed by detectives probing
claims of abuse at the Elm Guest House in the 1980s.</p>
<p>But his claim — heard by a social worker — was allegedly left out of his
statement after Special Branch or MI5 intervened to protect the MP.</p>

<p>MI5 got involved to cover this up. The snuff film of the brutal gang rape and torture of an 8 year old boy who died on camera.This was shot at a gay brothel in Amsterdam called the Blue Boys club. The tape is called the Bjorn Tape. I found a forum from 2001 talking about the Blue Boys club here. </p>

<p>The guy who produced it made other snuff films as well. Warwick Spinks is his name. He was caught in 2012 after an international manhunt. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234679/Britains-wanted-paedophile-Warren-Spinks-kidnapped-sold-young-boys-abuse-finally-caught-15-years-run.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234679/Britains-wanted-paedophile-Warren-Spinks-kidnapped-sold-young-boys-abuse-finally-caught-15-years-run.html</a> The MP and other elites are not named or even in this article but in The Suns article. So there were elite torture and snuff pedophile rings being run out of that location and at Elm Guest House in London. Celebrities, Politicians and other elite would use Elm Guest House as a child rape ring.</p>

From 2001 talking about Blue boys brothel</p>
<p>&quot;I never felt that I had to go with a boy immediately. I recall browsing through their photo books for hours while sipping beers at the bar. Truly, another era has gone. I wonder if the Internet was not a primary reason for its closing. But, I hope something comparable will replace it. The whole idea of going to a boys brothel and window shopping was always so much fun&quot;</p>
<p>So many great sex venues are disappearing all over the world!</p>
<p>Another comment makes this remark:</p>
<p>There\'s another place you may like to try: Club 21, and you can find it at the Spuistraat 21 (= same street as the back entrance of the Blueboy). It\'s a 5 minutes walk from where Blueboy used to be. I\'ve been there a few times (showing clients around), and I found that the atmosphere always was nicer than at Blueboy.</p>
<p>Regards, Anton.</p>
<p>Read the Google reviews of Boys Club 21.</p>
<p>&quot;Is an Escort Club for gay people where you can rent a boy for sex they have upstairs rooms,and also a bar with music and striptease shows is the single one left in Amsterdam witch does that legally !!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They were going to Amsterdam, to Spuistraat, to a club called the Blue Boy, where Spinks quite simply was going to sell him.</p>
<p>&quot;In Tuesday’s programme, Edward describes the children he says he saw in all five videos. “There was a boy with sallow skin and brown hair, brown eyes, which is unusual for Amsterdam. I’ve no idea where they got him from. There were two blond-haired boys and a strawberry blond boy, and a boy with a very distinctive haircut. It was shaved over both ears, with a loop and a parting down the middle.” Edward says he couldn’t tell their nationality: “They cried and screamed a lot. They did cry out, but I don’t know what language they were crying out in.&quot;</p>

<p>My best house of boys experience was in Frankfort back 3 or 4 years ago when there were 4 all within walking distance. The best would be Playground. In Berlin there is Club 96, called CC69, see also www.cc96.de. Its near the city centre.</p>

<p>(mentions another hotel website. &quot;Hotel Citadel&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hotel Citadel is a small but functional place near Central Station. There are a lot of small hotels to stay in around this area. Also, near Central Station and of course near the &quot;houses w/boys&quot;, The Black Tulip is a <a href="https://voat.co/s/M">S/M</a> bed &amp; breakfast with lots of equipment in each room. 
Both of these are near Why Not?&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hotelcitadel.nl/">https://www.hotelcitadel.nl/</a></p>
<p>along with </p>
<p>The three main boy brothels in Amsterdam are all very close to each other at the top of Spuistraat, close to the central station.
There are lots of hotels near by.</p>
<p>The Holiday Inn (Holiday Inn runs a pedophile brothel? hmm) Crowne Plaza, the Inntel and the Renaissance Amsterdam are all <em>very</em> close (you can see the &quot;Why Not&quot; bar from the entrance to the Crowne Plaza ...).</p>
<p>Slightly further away (but still only a 3 or 4 minute walk) is the Barbizon Palace, which I think is a much nicer hotel.
You should be able to get weekend rates of about 350 guilders a night for any of these hotels.</p>
<p>There is also a Golden Tulip hotel further down Spuistraat that is a bit cheaper - weekend rates there are probably between 225 and 300 guilders.https://www.message-forum.net/threads/europe-houses-of-boys-saunas-with-boys.59198/</p>',

           The guy who produced it made other snuff films as well. Warwick Spinks is his name. He was caught in 2012 after an international manhunt.

           The MP and other elites are not named or even in this article but in The Suns article. So there were elite torture and snuff pedophile rings being run out of that location and at Elm Guest House in London. Celebrities, Politicians and other elite would use Elm Guest House as a child rape ring.

           From 2001 talking about Blue boys brothel
          </p>
          <p>
           "I never felt that I had to go with a boy immediately. I recall browsing through their photo books for hours while sipping beers at the bar. Truly, another era has gone. I wonder if the Internet was not a primary reason for its closing. But, I hope something comparable will replace it. The whole idea of going to a boys brothel and window shopping was always so much fun"

           There's another place you may like to try: Club 21, and you can find it at the Spuistraat 21 (= same street as the back entrance of the Blueboy). It's a 5 minutes walk from where Blueboy used to be. I've been there a few times (showing clients around), and I found that the atmosphere always was nicer than at Blueboy.

           "They were going to Amsterdam, to Spuistraat, to a club called the Blue Boy, where Spinks quite simply was going to sell him.
          </p>
          <p>
           "In Tuesday’s programme, Edward describes the children he says he saw in all five videos. “There was a boy with sallow skin and brown hair, brown eyes, which is unusual for Amsterdam. I’ve no idea where they got him from. There were two blond-haired boys and a strawberry blond boy, and a boy with a very distinctive haircut. It was shaved over both ears, with a loop and a parting down the middle.” Edward says he couldn’t tell their nationality: “They cried and screamed a lot. They did cry out, but I don’t know what language they were crying out in."

           My best house of boys experience was in Frankfort back 3 or 4 years ago when there were 4 all within walking distance. The best would be Playground. In Berlin there is Club 96, called CC69, see also www.cc96.de. Its near the city centre.

           The three main boy brothels in Amsterdam are all very close to each other at the top of Spuistraat, close to the central station.
There are lots of hotels near by.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Holiday Inn (Holiday Inn runs a pedophile brothel? hmm) Crowne Plaza, the Inntel and the Renaissance Amsterdam are all
           <em>
            very
           </em>
           close (you can see the "Why Not" bar from the entrance to the Crowne Plaza ...).
          </p>
          <p>
           Slightly further away (but still only a 3 or 4 minute walk) is the Barbizon Palace, which I think is a much nicer hotel.
You should be able to get weekend rates of about 350 guilders a night for any of these hotels.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is also a Golden Tulip hotel further down Spuistraat that is a bit cheaper - weekend rates there are probably between 225 and 300 guilders.https://www.message-forum.net/threads/europe-houses-of-boys-saunas-with-boys.59198/
