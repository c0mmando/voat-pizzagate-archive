<p>GOOGLE – GOOGLE MAPS, LOCAL GUIDE  PEDOPHILIA AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING RING</p>
<p>Google Map’s, ‘Local Guide’ platform is being used as the tool for pedophiles and human traffickers enabling them to communicate with each other, mark the spot, and rate experiences amongst others in the ring.  
</p>
<p>This came to light after running a Google Map search of  ‘orphanages in the Washington DC area’ and looking specifically into CAPO Orphanage in McLean, (CIA territory) and discovering an odd website showing a large roasted chicken and a message in the link that read, ‘blo wing up chickens’.  The ‘blo wing’ has been deleted – very quickly in fact after being up on Voat for a matter of minutes before being taken down. Further explained in this submission. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1567029">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1567029</a> </p>
<p>Next I searched \'Claude Moore Colonial Farm’ in Google Maps, next to CIA HQ’s in McLean after having read of its past life as a pedophilia training base.  It is near Grandma Rita’s Children and the former home of James Alefantis   Further explained in this submission <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1566852">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1566852</a>. </p>
<p>A look over the reviews of the Farm on Google Maps and I notice that 
the ‘owner’ of the Farm had chipped in on one of the reviewer’s comments and reports that the Farm has a very small staff, and hundreds of volunteers.</p>

<p>????? Google\'s description of this place is inaccurate in one respect: &quot;Management: U.S. National Park Service.&quot;  It is run by volunteers, funded by donations, privately administered. the NPS does not manage this farm.<br />
Helpful?</p>
<p>Response from the owner 2 years ago
Correct, the Farm is the only privately operated park in the National Park System, and is run by The Friends of Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit with a very small staff and hundreds of volunteers.</p>
<p>So the Farm is the only National Park that is not run by the US National Park Service and ‘hundreds of volunteers’ are permitted to swarm around CIA HQ’s.
It is managed in the Farm’s Administrative Offices situated closer to Turkey Run Park, bordering CIA HQ’s.  
</p>
<p>Several of the ‘Local Guide’ reviewers show a peculiar interest in children, playgrounds, parks, farms, chicken fast food, pizza, Ikea, cinemas and carparks ie parking was a challenge! </p>
<p>There are currently 22 Local Guide reviews of the Farm and 25 Local Guide reviews of nearby Turkey Run Park </p>
<p>This is a map showing the location of the Farm, Turkey Run Park and the CIA HQ’s.

<p>One reviewer, who is not a ‘Local Guide’, posted a 1 out of 5 rating for the Farm and commented that it was a ‘Pedophile Farm’.  (Well, Hello!)
The Farm’s website says it is closed for the winter, till 1 April.  Administrative Offices nearby are open from Jan 4 – December 15.  The reviewer posted his comments in the last week.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the Farm’s, ‘Local Guide’ reviewers.</p>
<p>This is all publicly available, easily accessible web-based information. </p>
<p>NB. This black car often appears in photo’s. Here it is, obvious but most other times just part of the picture.  When a photo appears with a 360 rotation ability – do swing it around.  You’ll often see the photo’s of children/a child.</p>

<p>Nicolas Durand posted 14 photo’s of the Farm in his review as a Local Guide only a month ago. </p>
<p>He’s submitted 118 reviews, 165 photo’s and his photos have been viewed a staggering 483,886 times.</p>
<p>Run the mouse over the locations marked on Durand’s map and you’ll get a good sense of what Durand is all about.

<p>Children are a special ‘cause’ that Durand ‘cares’ about as noted on his Linkedin page. He works for the World Bank and his IT skills are highly advanced.  The Georgetown University Bio reveals his interest and work in neonatal mortality in India. </p>

<p>????? (Five Stars)
I went there for a birthday party in their &quot;deluxe rooms&quot;. Food was good and staff friendly, but the activity was very disappointing and had nothing to do with AG (they just drew on a hat). It took a little while for the food to come and we felt rushed for most of the meal (the mains arrived before anyone was done with their appetizers). They also offered drinks to the girls which were on top of the $47 per child. The total (with tip) was almost $550 for 8 girls and one adult (you must have at least one), which is MUCH too expensive for what it was.</p>
<p>Durand’s favourite spots as marked on his Local Guide Map included the inside of a post office, (code for send?), outside a dance studio, Pump it Up Kids, parks, recreation centers, Ikea etc.  He uses food and menus to disguise his special interest in children and has a food project which is supported by the World Bank, his employer, called Dishly. <a href="https://www.thedailywhois.com/2016-12-23/dishlymenu.com">https://www.thedailywhois.com/2016-12-23/dishlymenu.com</a> </p>
<p>Durand reviewed the Farm a month ago – and took it on himself submitted to post 14 photo’s in all, two of which are standouts - one of a giant close up pig/eye and a small boy standing close to a chicken. </p>

           This came to light after running a Google Map search of  ‘orphanages in the Washington DC area’ and looking specifically into CAPO Orphanage in McLean, (CIA territory) and discovering an odd website showing a large roasted chicken and a message in the link that read, ‘blo wing up chickens’.  The ‘blo wing’ has been deleted – very quickly in fact after being up on Voat for a matter of minutes before being taken down. Further explained in this submission.

           A look over the reviews of the Farm on Google Maps and I notice that 
the ‘owner’ of the Farm had chipped in on one of the reviewer’s comments and reports that the Farm has a very small staff, and hundreds of volunteers.

           ????? Google's description of this place is inaccurate in one respect: "Management: U.S. National Park Service."  It is run by volunteers, funded by donations, privately administered. the NPS does not manage this farm.

           Response from the owner 2 years ago
Correct, the Farm is the only privately operated park in the National Park System, and is run by The Friends of Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit with a very small staff and hundreds of volunteers.
          </p>
          <p>
           So the Farm is the only National Park that is not run by the US National Park Service and ‘hundreds of volunteers’ are permitted to swarm around CIA HQ’s.
It is managed in the Farm’s Administrative Offices situated closer to Turkey Run Park, bordering CIA HQ’s.

           Several of the ‘Local Guide’ reviewers show a peculiar interest in children, playgrounds, parks, farms, chicken fast food, pizza, Ikea, cinemas and carparks ie parking was a challenge!
          </p>

           There are currently 22 Local Guide reviews of the Farm and 25 Local Guide reviews of nearby Turkey Run Park

           One reviewer, who is not a ‘Local Guide’, posted a 1 out of 5 rating for the Farm and commented that it was a ‘Pedophile Farm’.  (Well, Hello!)
The Farm’s website says it is closed for the winter, till 1 April.  Administrative Offices nearby are open from Jan 4 – December 15.  The reviewer posted his comments in the last week.

           NB. This black car often appears in photo’s. Here it is, obvious but most other times just part of the picture.  When a photo appears with a 360 rotation ability – do swing it around.  You’ll often see the photo’s of children/a child.

           Children are a special ‘cause’ that Durand ‘cares’ about as noted on his Linkedin page. He works for the World Bank and his IT skills are highly advanced.  The Georgetown University Bio reveals his interest and work in neonatal mortality in India.

           ????? (Five Stars)
I went there for a birthday party in their "deluxe rooms". Food was good and staff friendly, but the activity was very disappointing and had nothing to do with AG (they just drew on a hat). It took a little while for the food to come and we felt rushed for most of the meal (the mains arrived before anyone was done with their appetizers). They also offered drinks to the girls which were on top of the $47 per child. The total (with tip) was almost $550 for 8 girls and one adult (you must have at least one), which is MUCH too expensive for what it was.
          </p>
          <p>
           Durand’s favourite spots as marked on his Local Guide Map included the inside of a post office, (code for send?), outside a dance studio, Pump it Up Kids, parks, recreation centers, Ikea etc.  He uses food and menus to disguise his special interest in children and has a food project which is supported by the World Bank, his employer, called Dishly.

           Durand reviewed the Farm a month ago – and took it on himself submitted to post 14 photo’s in all, two of which are standouts - one of a giant close up pig/eye and a small boy standing close to a chicken.

            Google does weird distortions to everything.
There are lots of artifacts created when they stich the many photos together. Remember all photos on street view were not taken at exactly the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless you can see distortions in the PHOTO the pedo poofters took and uploaded as reviews. In which case if we can prove stenography, then you would break open the biggest pedophilia case in the world. CIA poofters would only communicate though on alias accounts not their real ones.

            Everyone needs to focus their work at getting into this guys social media and friends ASAP - not following (apart from archiving) everything you already found from Local Reviews. We need something more tangible to tie him to the Podesta's Alefantis. He's interesting but we need that damn smoking gun. Don't get me wrong he's very very interesting Character but lots of people are.

            Remember he teaches Social media and Search at GeorgeTown Uni Postgrad. If he isn't shilling here already I'd be fucken suprised. Nobody say his name again for good luck.

            He's going to lots of events "with kids" giving some interesting reviews about farms etc - not just the farm you found.
Update: He's a homosexual professor majoring now teaching how to control your image on social media and manage google search results for your "business", so I'm surprised if he isn't already on to us.  It means we need more internet investigation before it goes further. I'm recompiling my Firefox due to some segfaults and I'll put a few hours going through him, but for everyone here one more time explain why he first became a POI, and the farm you found him on - how exactly does that go back to James Alephantis. I needed 4 hours sleep before! I recommend others DO the same, because I don't have the knowledge of addresses and contacts in Pizzagate that's needed to do this job properly.

            Help us connect the dots. everything you have get pictures and archive. I had a 3 days awake session years ago for

            that ended up with those cunts being kicked out of Thailand/Nepal.. (but they moved to Cambodia - but I'll get them soon enough) and it's petrifying once you see people who shouldn't be friends with each other, the occult, sex parties on farm and the co-ordinator of said sex party being friends on FB with nearly every person who bought a baby from New Life IVF Thailand (Rachael Goldstien OTO Australia Sexologist) you shit you pants and go into a semi-state of shock. I've been there brother. But as I sent in the PM's we need to see what you are seeing. I'm just seeing google places - without any local review's / pictures of the queers on them like what I was getting last night. Check the links you give out work on a private browsing window - and ARCHIVE EVERYTHING. It only takes a few seconds a page with Mozzila Archive and Faithful safe, that gets it right, or alt-printscreen file safe as in paint or whatever you are using (save png).

            Holy shit.. Could there be steganography at play here? That's probably how the pedophiles would do it, but once the jig is up someone like Google could make it's crawler detect known encoding methods and Catch the lot of them. I still think it's going to be an app like GayDar for pedophiles making use of bluetooth and wifi in existence. Knowing the queers it probably is GayDar itself.

            Thats it! These sick people are using code words to communicate online. The comment made Nov 16 on Elliot Zarot "Free ng bevk de vccs bcgjr" is the exact same type of comment used on facebook by the lady that was a Shanghai diplomat, talking about the park next to Pegasus. Im on mobile but this is a connection. The code was deciphered and was defintely related. This is important!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I cant remember what was deciphered but the thread is on voat somewhere and was using an online algorithm to decode it. I read it last week but fuck i cant remember what it was about. Someone else has to remember this. Im.surprised no one has caught this yet

            Please re-read.  I said I have a problem connecting it and would prefer if it could be laid out so I could figure out who the woman is  in relation to an investigation and other points that don't look connected in any way.   But if you don't want to do that,  then no problem.  I will ignore it and move on.

            I don't think there's nothing there - I think there is something there, and i think you're definitely onto something, especially because - remember that Alefantis had added the Pegasus museum to google maps, and had given it a 5 star review? That seemed odd, and like it was put there for people 'in the know' to find the location. He deleted it after it was found and posted here. And I think the initial part of your post is interesting and is something worth looking into, and that farm had already come up in investigations, so that makes it worthwhile to check out the people who are going there and reviewing it. But I just worry that you list too many reviewers where there isn't really any evidence to show that they are doing something shady, and we have to be careful about possibly exposing innocent ordinary people to being accused or harassed online because their name came up here, and we also want to make 100% sure that there are no ways for the MSM to pick up on something like that and use it as an excuse to discredit the whole thing in the eyes of the general MSM watching public at large.
           </p>
           <p>
            So all I'm saying is it's best practice to ensure what you're posting definitely links a person to PG operations, known people &amp;/or locations. Or if there is something you think could be related but not sure, summarise what you found without giving the person's name or link to their details, and see whether the community agrees it's definitely to be investigated, and then at least it is a group decision and isn't all on you if it turns out said person is completely innocent, and ends up receiving death threats (which may even come from the opposition just to make PG look bad, and putting names out there makes it easier for them to do that if it is an innocent party)! I hope that all makes sense - I wasn't trying to say it was all nothing, I think it's an important thing to look into! I was just worried about that particular issue.

            She/he is pointing out farm owners.    That's not a problem if he/she has something more than a rooster and a child  (which is a health and safety act - but what has it to do with pedo?) 
It discounts any focus on a pig. 
And there's  2 pictures of a woman that  is unrelated to anything else, with no data as to why her pic is there.  Where is this woman on your  ""trail""?
            <br/>
            If this is how people investigate matters, then  you're a discredit to pgate.
            <br/>
            A pic saying, there's that black car again,  but no pic of a black car,  or they showed the same pic that had been provided in   part 1.

           <p>
            I'm not saying something like this isn't happening,   I'm saying that  this presentation  has red herrings and mixed up data or lack of data.

            I know about the farm layout and pigs that  can be used to dispose of bodies, but the problem is that there are so many other obscure pictures thrown in with no link as to where there's a connection.   You are going to have to get information connection of people and actual data,  otherwise there are literally  thousands of farms,  which all have animals.   Just because a person has a farm doesn't mean their doing sacrifices!!  You'd need to do a  well detailed research on data surrounding the farm,  why there is a large pig, what's its purpose, who owns the farm, etc.     Otherwise you could put  hundreds of farms up and it's all a guessing game.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless there's some bigger suspicion,   you just can't go around incriminating  thousands and thousands of farm owners.

            How does the woman with a red scarf in 2 locations have anything to do with anything?
           </p>

            Maybe if this were  laid out  with specific questions and data the whole thing would be easier to follow.

            This time you got it right, this is wild goose chase - black cars? Of course the idiot mod Millenial_Falcon loves it. My post regarding Sargento "Cheese Bites" that you wrongly claimed to be larp is legitimate, read up on it in pizzagatemods (since Millenial_Falcon deleted it). I voted you up on this one.

            I feel really bad for these people, I hope no one takes what you're saying at face value, because honestly most of them look like completely normal nice people who like reviewing stuff, it seems as though you're looking at them assuming they are pedophiles to start off with and then making everything fit that, when if you just happened across most of these randomly not thinking about pedophiles at all, you wouldn't look twice. The one with the discount for the girl - that is clearly a joke as the picture is of a girl, probably his kid or niece or something, in the store's cart, so he's making a joke. That's what it seems to me, and all his others seem innocent.
           </p>
           <p>
            There may be some of them that are dodgy - the basement one with the toy on the balcony could be something, but really it's impossible to tell with this little info, and it just is not the case that every man who is a local guide on google maps or reviews things is a pedo reviewing kids!! Come on, this is the kind of stuff that makes people think PG is some crazy story made up by people with paranoid imaginations, it really does no good for the investigation at all!
           </p>
           <p>
            Stick to the things that are clearly wrong or clearly have evidence that links them to some other person or place that has already been proven/exposed as involved. This started off well and interesting with the farm and the CIA HQ etc, but it seems like you got carried away and started seeing pedophiles everywhere! Don't assume that every who has taken a photo of a kid is a pedophile :-(

            Let's do a little prediction. Next one these guys talked about with the mapping account goes on fake news mentioning their daughter being shown and being shot at and threatend and they say the public must get pizzagate on voat shut down. They are creating and answering these themselves.
Time to organize individually.

            I think the problem is that it's just hard to follow the links and see what he is saying without screenshots.. so then it just sounds like he somehow came to the conclusion that writing reviews for IKEA? And schools is fishy... which fine not sure why IKEA is considered fishy, but I wonder if they just reviewed the schools because it gets their numbers up? I have a feeling these reviewers take the number of reviews you do very seriously like a score in a game or something. Still without screenshots I'm lost. And yes I read all there but only managed to actually find a few things since the links don't seem to work or something.

They need to have a fake business for "services" rendered. Business records on this business may be interesting.

            My other nick is VGB_OPSEC and I Luke McKee researched this with trump's mate TheOtherMcCain.com Robert Stacy McCain to expose the Transhumanist infant rapist now in USA jail being praised by George Soros and Co at Getup.org.au

            you can see the jailed infant rapist on the home page for Australian Marriage Equality that is being hailed as the second coming of Christ himself by the mainstream Australian media.

           <p>
            The media only praise gays when they are suing the government whilst being on the run from the FBI to help their illegal immigrant overstayer PAKI photographer get a visa - covering their arrest isn't important.

            You should see the comments on that OtherMcCain.com thing too when you have time. I noticed lots of the Democrat scum love buying mentally handicapped children when they are low ranked, but as they get promoted get fully functional hot-dogs instead. See the details on the USA Gay Dads Baby Buyer Ambassador to Hanoi Vietnam Ted Osius who I have met in person.

I have seen similar Facebook login apps used to provide a private secret off facebook portal - ran by known pedophile who organized the Sydney My Little Pony Convention Syd Neigh that went bankrupt for young little girls. One click and there is no FB audit trail of what your little boy or girl does on facebook.

            gay baby flesh buyers in Thailand before the royal thai police shut down (but didn't - MSM lied they kept operating - that's another story that involves an on-site infiltration video). Slow down and think rationally. Keep researching ignore the trolls if they are trolls and archive everything like I told you how, and as you save the file - say why it's relevant to your investigation and file name in notepad. Time waits for nobody, but I've only got 4 hours sleeping time. Good luck.

            In Dutch Pizza Gate MK II - the jailed pedophile (elfia com's satanic sister) was in the dutch papers attacking the only person investigating the incident (me). If they know you are onto them there will be consequences. Safety in numbers, so I backed off that case (at least officially). I moved on from that for now, but right now ALL EFFORTS on this topic. The guy's linked in shows we have a genuine GAY ACTIVIST who was identified as a POI before we knew he was gay. And we know all about James "I Love Infants" right....

            You can't "add much more" because what I said is correct, your only "proof" is based on your lack of understanding reviews and how web traffic works, in addition to seeing what you want to see.

            I have got into his linked in profile and it's interesting. IT SAYS HE LOVES CHILDREN and was a GAY AIDS ACTIVIST.
Considering the Intel on the "FARM" in the OP, this Character is definitely a POI. All my gay contacts on linked in I befriended via stealth gave me access to his profile. I got access to it through Sebastian Rice who runs the biggest gay newspaper in Sydney. (my linked in friends are not my friends FYI). I may have burned my linked in Access for sharing this but here goes.
Credit to him for being in the elite! The jury is still technically out if he's in the pedophile elite, but I've seen a lot of filthy crimes done by a lot of gay activist (and they are suing my family - persecuting me) so I'm biased there. Here's his linked in page archived:

            "No one" shares my thoughts? And how do you know? How do you know half these people aren't just assuming you've found something because they are suffering confirmation bias (wouldn't be the first time this has happened)? You've already mistaken two things as being something they aren't.

            I have read it twice. The original chicken wing and The Farm post is suspicious an worthy of instigation. It's the stuff you post afterwards that I fail to see as damning evidence of something going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some people who have made a lot of reviews and provided pictures, and you claim that these reviews are weird and that they have a ton of views, even though 350,000 views for 133 pictures is NOT a lot. Explain how that is proof these reviewers are acting as pedos?
           </p>
           <p>
            You have already mistaken the "Sausage Party" movie for being code word for something else, and you didn't know that the American Girl Deluxe Party was a real thing either, so you can't blame me for having no confidence in the "evidence" you have posted. It looks like what you have found so far is based on you being ignorant and suffering from confirmation bias.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get that PG is scary and these monsters use a lot of "hiding in plain sight" tactics, but we also have to exhaust all possibilities before claiming they are pedos.

             What do you think of gay judges prosecuting people for even suggesting that gay men standing with a little chicken and a boy suggests the gay men are pedophiles (example of a hate crime "successful" prosecution)  - when it was used to describe a video of two gay men who were doing just that you can look up on bop.gov's inmate finder with another 39 years on their sentences (Mark J Newton -  Peter Truong) for Russian infant rape. This may be one of the main pedophilia signs if the government is that defensive

             (as published by Alex Au, first gay man in Singapore to open an Orgy Bar there and gay here - using little rape victims as poster boys for gay pride, furthering his rapist's agenda). Wordpress say's it's hate speech to ask the child rape victim's image be removed as that's homophobic. Wordpress is known as accelerate.lgbt/about Tell the Gay Only CSR mods on their support forum I said Hi and good luck taking it down.

               A GAY JUDGE SAID IN CASE LAW IT IS A CRIME TO SAY A GAY MAN PICTURED WITH A LITTLE CHICKEN IS A PEDOPHILE.
For the 3rd time. Now I'm thinking you a shill too.
Also in the gay judge incident, the guy was a pedophile and got 40 years jail. See pictures for dummies who can't read version again:

               OPSEC - Google is polling voat very quickly. This site was already into their search index with 30 mins. That means the pedophiles who have their own name in google search alerts get notified. Could explain the shills btw.

                No, others here have no idea what you or OP are saying either. I don't know if English is a second language for you, or if you just really suck at constructing a sentence, but you aren't making any sense and are very hard to follow.

                 Look. When I said a gay judge ruled in case law it's hate speech to vilify those found guilty of fucking children because they identified as gay before and after they did it - that is exactly what I meant, and that's exactly what is in case law. I didn't go charging in with

Listen to my 72 year old father say just that on TRUTH NEWS RADIO AUSTRALIA:

                 (hr2) as for the other links I'm not reposting this thread with crap. You tell me if Hereward Fenton host of TNRA and my dad speak clearly enough whilst they discuss the Frankfurt School of Thought on Cultural Marxism, and pedophilia normalization done in Australia by boylovers inc.

                 I've learn't something about the google spider / google alerts &amp; voat that could be causing big problems for us. Any pedophile with a google search notify on their name may know within 30 mins if they have had their name dropped on these forums. I'll be requesting to pizzagate mods to request robots to adjust this sites robots.txt accordingly.
Searching dishly - within 30 mins my comments were on the 1st / 2nd page of google.

            when you break something new it happens. Reminds me of dutch pizzagate MK II thread that broke with the biggest children's party in Europe (elfia dot com) in a Rotchild's castle being done for infant sex porns upload to Facebook last month. But make an effort to answer legit questions instead of calling them shill.

            Windows 7 up to 10 has a decent windows paint that can do cropping easily after doing an alt-print screen - ctrl-v (paste) into paint. It's in accessories.
You don't want to run windows 10 because it's spyware and reports all keystrokes URL etc back to your friends in Langly.
Use tails (ubuntu crap) or switch to Sabyon.org linux for beginners and quit windows why you are ahead seeing you wont need to unlearn anything and you already seem to have as what we in the industry say is "finger trouble"
           </p>

            The screenshot in linux (gnome) lets you select a small area you want to grab, but getting forensically what you downloaded is better for court, hence why I told you to use Mozilla archive and faithful save files. Capturing network traffic with wireshark.org would be nearly unstoppable in court if you uploaded it and weren't capturing your other stuff like gmail auth etc which is a bummer so don't share it publicly - give to someone on a CD or something.

             Good luck getting OP or anyone else who "understands" this to explain what OP found, I've been trying to get them to clarify but all I'm getting is "not my fault you don't understand".

             What I've gathered is OP doesn't understand how reviews or web traffic works.

            Make a video on windows (if you use that crap) using opensoruce screen recording software scrolling over the cunts crap quickly now to prove that claim.
camstudio.org - watch out for the malware on sourceforge download links (hence why they died for github - which I hate with a Passion but that's OT - kinda - It's based in San Francisco and.... you get the idea).

              sorry missed - telling him to use video recording software from google local guide, to show all the comments he commented on or use mozilla maff files to get a viewable web page for researchers later on in case he has stumbled onto something real. I know at least one example of chic's being used as a pedophilia symbol as you've seen here, and you know why I'm asking for more (legal reasons).

            Lesbians proud that they broke laws to jail a husband and wife (Legg Devine case) for religious vilification of a satanic pedophile cult that is behind pizzagate. They always cover their tracks again and again. I been fighting for a decade now starting with investigating twenty10.org.au exposed on kidsrights.org.au And of course they did it too - but I made PDFs then.

             David Sabin – has submitted 133 photos and has had a staggering 350,000 views of his photo’s. His review of the Farm was that he wasn’t happy it closes at 4pm. (Pissed off Pedo).

            Stop saying this shit without any proof! You are going to end up smearing someone innocent. Being pissed that a place closes at 4PM does not make them an "angry pedo" - as a parent, if I'm taking my kids somewhere, it has to be in the afternoon since I work and they go to school. "Family Friendly" places that close at 4PM is something most working parents would be pissed about.
           </p>
           <p>
            350,000 views for 133 photos is not "STAGGERING", that's actually pretty small, especially if he has been doing this for years. Do you know anything about people who make reviews? Do you realize that there are people who do it for a living? Do you know that schools, restaurants, and hiking trials are really popular places to review, because that's what people search for the most, especially people out of town?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying that there is nothing shady going on, but you better damn well make sure the connections and evidence is strong before you start giving out people's information and branding them a goddamn pedo. You could get this sub shut down if you end up smearing someone innocent.

             . You put into words what I was thinking. I'm not convinced there's anything to this. Seems like a big stretch.
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand the primise of the OP though: pedo communication through google maps. But, this seems like such a backward/vague way for them to communicate when they have other options.

              I'm not saying it isn't possible. These sick monsters have already proven they can be sloppy with their methods of communication.
             </p>
             <p>
              But the people OP is citing as "examples" is really weak. OP has already shown he didn't know that Sausage Party was a real movie, or that American Girl Deluxe Parties are real either. These reviewers appear to be regular reviews and OP is jumping to conclusions. OP also has no idea how web traffic works, because having a few hundred thousand views on 133 photos is not a lot. This very thread already has over 1,000 views in a few hours. Thousands of people are searching and viewing these reviewer's photos, so it's not hard to reach that number, especially if these pictures are years old.

            Great work. If you are successful in getting convictions, we in Australia will beat the pedophiles in the NSW Supreme Court. It's been formally ruled "hate speech" to associate any gay man with boys and chickens as a sign of pedophilia ( by a gay judge involved in pedophilia normalization mind you..)

            (updated with more quotes from the judge in case law as he makes his case gay men with little boys taken chicken pictures isn't advertising anything)

            That American Girl review is not suspicious to me. Unless there is something I am missing, American Girl is fucking expensive. Years ago, my daughter was obsessed with them and begged me to get her one. It cost $120 to get the doll alone, never mind all the expensive accessories, clothes, and books. Their birthday party packages are even more expensive, which is why I never took my daughter to one of those official American Girl centers, I was not going to drop hundreds of dollars for something I could do myself for $20-40. If you look at the website you linked, it tells you that it costs $47 per child, just as the reviewer said.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't really get what you're getting at OP. You need to clarify what connections you are making, because right now none of these reviews look suspicious or odd to me.

            Please look at the proximity to 749 Chain Bridge Road...it seems to keep popping up:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1485593">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1485593
            </a>
            . Also, there is a building at 1479 Chain Bridge Road that contains 2 adoptions agencies, multiple mental health practitioners including specifically for "postpartum depression" and an ex-CIA office that seemed suspect. Not on my computer, but will add more later. But there seems to be something about 749 Chain Bridge road. I've been tracking on all of this since the Podesta emails dropped and people realized the pedo code, and that address just keeps popping up. Assistance is needed, obviously, or I would have already been successful in either making a connection or putting it to bed. McLean is a fucked up place...apparently, according to Wikipedia, it's one of the places in America where census information isn't gathered? Can someone tell me why that would be???
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit 1: looks like 749 Chain Bridge is a quick 2 minute drive to Turkey Run Park

            I thought this theory sounded wacko, but once I saw world bank, Georgetown, pigs... you've made a very good case, thanks for your work. Very interesting.

            What is with pig eyes? Alefantis had that IG post of a dead pig eye, didn't one of his friends, too?

             I'm having a hard time following. I think we just need someone to post screenshots or something. Most of these links just lead to the same page for me and I have not been able to actually find anything that I think you guys are trying to point out.

              There are elements that I can't follow or connect either.   I have no idea what the pics of the woman with the scarf or skiing have to do with anything.    Some fill-in is necessary here otherwise it's just someone skiing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Something interesting is the pic of farms with large pig.   Only one pig on each farm?    Because those are huge well fed pigs and if these are petting farms they wouldn't be a great health and safety petting farm choice.   Big pigs like that might be considered  a safety hazard.  What' the farms reason for keeping a pig?  Check discreetly into that and see where that leads.
             </p>
             <p>
              That wasn't a chicken, I think that was a rooster.  Roosters can be very rowdy  and some can even  be aggressively dangerous.  I wouldn't keep it loose with a toddler running around as a health and safety concern.   I don't see what the pic of a rooster has to do with pizzagate leads.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have no clue where you're connecting the Mormon temple pics.   Their Christmas lights.
             </p>
             <p>
              Re: the pic of the  police car parked,  I wasn't able to point out  an exit of any kind,  or any black car.   Black cars are common and I'm not sure how you're connecting this.  Unless you know something specific about the church or people, meetings or activities?

              I think the OP made several LARGE leaps and, as others have said, shouldn't go into it calling everyone pedos. But I think it's an interesting potential lead.
              <br/>
              Having a farm right next to the CIA is
              <em>
               weird
              </em>
              , imo, and I think deserves some scrutiny. I don't buy the pedophile farm story, but do think the location and being privately owned on public park land is odd. This Durand reviewer guy especially has hallmarks of pizzagate actors- Georgetown university, works for world bank, fascinated with pigs and children. Not everything found and posted seems suspicious, but I think it's worth taking a peek. It is a theory that needs lots of vetting, OP hopped in like they made an obvious and important discovery, which is the problem.

               I'm having a hard time interpreting this thread as well. It's interesting though that John Podesta worked at this farm while in college, and the gibberish message in the review seems similar to inexplicable things we have seen before.

            Excellent find and well sourced! Just my 2 cents: You mentioned Whitetail Resort. FYI - It's a nudist resort.
            <a href="http://whitetailresort.org/">

           </p>

            Edit to add: It's been brought to my attention that the Whitetail resort the Op is speaking about is in PA, not the one I linked to above that's in VA.

            SMALL BOY WITH CHICKEN? Now where have I heard this BEFORE! Ah yes! IN CASE LAW and on ABC TV. A gay judge says it's a crime to associate small boys with chickens being a pedophilia sign in CASE LAW. Yes you can look it up yourself!
(don't down-vote if you don't understand the concept of sarcasm!)
That's in an ABC video that's on my youtube channel that's a crime to link to! put "abcplugspedos" into austlii.edu.au or wwww.caselaw.nsw.gov.au and notice the URL shortened and where the link goes to in the case law!
            <a href="https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/558b3c8ee4b0f1d031de9eb8">
             https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/558b3c8ee4b0f1d031de9eb8
            </a>
            In this order, “the material” means:
           </p>
           <p>
            (a) Garry ** ** is after me. Little faggot stalker who contacted me first, harnessed me and claimed connection to corrupt police. He is evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have work to do to help you, protest signs and letters. I am not the case. Your enemy is my enemy and he is evil gay stalker.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will not be raped to death in jail while he watches as he says in his threats to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            (b) Rape little boys, this is same sex marriage.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want this sit back in your armchair and let the homosexual lobby push for same sex marriage.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the end results of same sex marriage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sit back and enjoy yourself whilst this goes on.
           </p>
           <p>
            (c) Older homosexuals call their underage love interests or targets ‘chickens’ or ‘chicks’. The baby chicks featured in this video was likely an advertisement for the pedorists ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            SEE ITS ANTI GAY HATE SPEECH TO ASSOCIATE LITTLE BOY FUCKERS (who rape little boys like Mark Newton and Peter Truong) WITH RAPING BOYS AND LITTLE CHICKS! The dirt I have on this gay judge ALEXANDER JOHN WAKEFIELD IS ENDLESS.
           </p>

             This video also (again) legitimated the boy lover symbol, but the chicken thing is just fucking creepy. They did that anterview and the pedos focused on the chickens, almost like they were openly saying they are pedo... just fucking wow. These guys seem to never hide what they do, just you have to know what to look for.

              Ginger Goreman (interviewer of Mark Newton and Peter Truong published gay marriage activists and russian infant human traffickers with Australian government help) deleted all of her tweets from 2010 when showing interview was arranged but left 2008-2009 there. She was just in the news today for investigating more child sex cases. She's a real sick pedophile lover at the ABC and she's a dutch jew. Boylovers.net that the men were in was started in Holland when she was working there for the Dutch sate broadcaster before coming to the ABC. I could send you my dossiers.
             </p>
             <p>
              At least she says gays can be pedophiles and they ARE FUCKEN EVIL here.

My dad is being sued for the crime disrespecting the same baby rapists in those videos. hear him talk about it on truthnews (hour 2).
(my non-undercover work OPSEC is shit because I'm a political refugee I took a high profile approach to my personal security like Assange and Snowden - you have been warned)

              were pedophiles before they were chaged if you see the youtube video description of what he linked to (video link in html source - due to archive org cock up)

              (notice the title of the page in your web browser is the name of the video on my youtube channel hojuruku with the same name. Garry Burns argued in court he never watched said video when suing my dad that we forensically proved was perjury)

               Thanks and I added you on YouTube. You have been fighting this stuff for years. As much as I don't want to make this about gay or straight I am willing to buy into the claim that gays are three times more likely to commit this crime. It's really starting to look that way!! JA for instance is admittedly gay. I'm not saying he does this stuff or not, just it seems to be following the alternative lifestyles, and surely not all gays are this way. But we can't ignore that it appears to be aligned with homosexuality or even alternative sex. Maybe that how they justify their sickness I don't know.

                My dad claimed scientific exemption to say the same comment as you did with sources on his original post here that made him spend 30 grand in legal fees so far for less than 3 sentences of text, and linking to a youtube video with a couple of baby rapists saying it's homophobic to oppose us getting little boys. This is the actual comment he made that relates to "mckee burns" in austlii.edu.au / www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au case law. So you have done worse. For having that opinion you are now an enemy of the state, regardless of the validity of your concerns. Welcome to the fight brother, as James Crowley of Grey State Movie said (my youtube intro video) before they killed him, his dog, his wife and his baby girl.

                Finally here are the 3 sources I go on and I can dig up links.
1) Most cited study on pubmed google "Homosexuality Pedophilia Pubmed" - Homosexuals 9-10% of all pedophiles.
2) Bravehearts.org.au child abuse fact sheet, wrote by the experts down-under. 35% of all children abused, were raped by gay men
2.5) Many medical studies have studied that homosexual pedophiles are 3x + more prolific or as they say promiscious - no suprise there considering the non pedophile gays are just the same and that's well documented.
3) The 10% myth or 11% myth in Australia if you go to humanrights.gov.au is totally debunked by CDC.GOV that says 1.7% of America is gay.
if 1.7% of the population is raping 35% of the children compared to the other 49 % of males you get the idea.
               </p>
               <p>
                From the point of view of the victim or a mother who is concerned about her kids. You are wrong. She needs to be the RISK of putting her child in a class, or scout event or whatever with a gay teacher is 20-30x times more likely than with a heterosexual to have her child raped on average. If you like gambling with your 5 year old boys virginity leave them alone with gay men. Yes more girls get sexually abused than boys - say 63%  (2% lesbian on boy pedos + 35% makes the total)- but that's group of people that consists of 48% of the population doing it. Why does such a small demographic make up such a large proportion of all child sexual abuse? Simple answer. They are peverts. I lost my child because of gay child fucking cop Christopher Kent Bowersox (he's registered sex offender - his paperwork on me at scribd.com/luke_mckee yellow document) and he got the tri-fecta of perversion. BESTIALITY, HOMOSEXUALITY, PEDERASTY. Also the number of leftists who are bisexual pedophiles shocks me to the core.
               </p>
               <p>
                Then the poor children who have gay parents, who come in contact with 100s of new gays a year, you can imagine how many times more likely they are to be left alone with a pedophile than an ordinary kid in an ordinary family. Gays with kids statistically speaking is child abuse - and that's the facts from the Government and the NGO's who know what they are talking about.

              Finally pizzagaters are going after the gay judges and their gay agenda. Amazing that in the USA you can't point out chickens as a child rape symbol without judges throwing up in jail. We are woke!

             The only one I have a VERY slight chance of thinking might be actually secure is apple.... I am not positive - but I think they might.

             but I know for a fact a lot about FB and their sec teams.... as well as how much google is compromised.

             Yes they have bc they took "govt contracts". Just watch Kevin Shipp's talk for Geowatch on YouTube. Lots of info explaining this. He's former CIA.

              Google, Facebook, and Reddit were not infiltrated per se. Reddit was after they killed swartz and his cannibal roommate Spez took over as CEO.
             </p>
             <p>
              Silicon Valley is overrun with these people. Angel/VC investors are huge avenues for this. Tech is disruptive, so you must own the capital funds. They do!
             </p>
             <p>
              Google, and Facebook were big partners with these people. That's why "the social network" movie was born. Controversy + to sell the story of a kid who just wanted to bring people together and didn't care about money. We'll have him screw over 3 shit heads, and we get to take a dump on Sean Parker at the same time.

             Look at their board and it'll make so much sense. Shameless defenders of leftist media demagoguery, all the way back to Gamergate. They are based in London and have access to the highest echelons of power, and are directly connected to ICMEC

             They are NoC officers of the cia (non-official commisioned officer).  These are the guys like in mission impossible that are told 'If you're caught, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of you and your activities'.   The guys that go in deep and have no backup, but are highly trained and placed in trusted positions.  Bill Gates is one, Steve Jobs wouldn't go along so he got the icy cancer dart.  You people REALLY need to watch 'George Webb' and his braverman series on youtube

            I mention the shady-ness of a school that somehow belongs to McLean Va, which gets mentioned a lot here, even though it's in Falls Church, a neighboring town with a protected pedo mayor.

            It also doesn't come up in google maps school search unless you search the name directly.
