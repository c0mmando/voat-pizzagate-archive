<p><strong>Mike Cernovich</strong> - He claims that he is being sued by Epstein, and this story is being pushed hard by alt media sites. He has provided zero proof of this claim, other than a fully-redacted document that has neither his or his lawyer\'s name on it</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dangerandplay.com/2017/03/03/billionaire-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-files-secret-legal-papers-against-mike-cernovich/">https://www.dangerandplay.com/2017/03/03/billionaire-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-files-secret-legal-papers-against-mike-cernovich/</a></p>
<p>If you read the opposition statement filed by Virgina Giuffre\'s (Epstein sexual abuse victim) attorneys, it is clear that Cernovich is acting against their wishes. Cernovich\'s friendship with Alan Dershowitz is well-established. Dershowitz is good friends with Epstein, has flown on the Lolita Express, and is a suspected pedophile.</p>

<p>So far today, he has re-tweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice.</p>
<p><strong>David Seaman</strong> - Many people have provided a mountain of evidence outing Seaman as a self-promotional shill. At this time in point, anybody connected with him should be viewed with suspicion. Time and time again, he has been caught contradicting his own lies and creating publicity stunts and playing the victim card.</p>

<p>Seaman even went so far as to rig his own &quot;Deep&quot; contest that would give away half a Bitcoin to one of his &quot;fans&quot;. Many of the videos that were submitted still had a 0 view count on Youtube after the contest had ended. The &quot;winner&quot; had by far the largest subscriber count of any submission, had donated to Seaman in the past, and wrote <a href="https://steemit.com/blog/@shayne/david-seaman-the-most-interesting-story-of-2016-17">this glowing puff piece about him a month earlier.</a></p>
<p>Today alone, he has tweeted about <a href="https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/838848155840053248">George Webb</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/838877785129168898">Cernovich</a>, and re-tweeted Brittany Pettibone.</p>
<p><strong>George Webb</strong> - Even after several people contacted him to tell him about Cernovich\'s questionable motives in regards to the Epstein case, he is still defending him in one of his videos today. I have already reviewed this up above. In addition, he is an unabashed Obama supporter, which in itself should raise major red flags to anyone in the &quot;truther&quot; community.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Joseph Watson</strong> - Another member of the Twitter re-tweet limited hangout. I haven\'t looked into him that much, because I find his content to be annoying. In this video clip, he claims that over-represented Jewish influence doesn\'t exist:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5FKsPvuU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58B5FKsPvuU</a></p>
<p><strong>Brittany Pettibone</strong> - I don\'t know that much about her, but she\'s definitely in the &quot;club&quot;. Constant back and forth re-teeting with the other members. Recently, she has re-tweeted Cernovich, Watson, and Baked Alaska, who is also mentioned in Webb\'s video and is tied to Cernovich.</p>
<p><strong>MILO</strong> - Former member of the limited hangout, until he was thoroughly taken down by the mainstream media. In my opinion, he was unfairly demonized by the MSM, which makes me wonder why his friends have all gone silent about him. You would think this is the exact type of thing they would be speaking out against and trying to expose. The reason is, that any association to Milo is toxic to one\'s reputation right now. They need to maintain their reputations and positions as thought leaders of the &quot;alt-right&quot; above all else. Milo was a sacrificial lamb.</p>
<p>This is not the full extent to which we are being manipulated, it can also be expanded to other charlatans such as Robert David Steele and the Alex Jones hangout crew like Roger Stone. I don\'t have time to do a full in-depth investigation at the moment, hopefully other true patriots on Voat, Reddit, and Youtube can shed some more light on this disturbing trend. At the very least, they need to offer an explanation. The &quot;alt-right&quot; and &quot;truther&quot; communities are being steered by thought leaders using the same tactics the mainstream media uses to steer the masses. The MSM constantly links to each other to add credibility to their narratives and propaganda stories, and if you dig far enough you\'ll often find there is no actual source. The New York Times using Washington Post as source, WaPo using CNN as a source, CNN using NYT as source, etc in a never-ending circle. This is the same thing that they\'re doing to the online community through these supposed leaders of the cause.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is a theory and I\'m not claiming that all of the above is fact.</p>

            do you think this explains how "violent molestation of children by pedophiles" became "child trafficking for organ harvesting" or more recently how "pizzagate" became "pedogate"?

             It's certainly possible, it's all about shaping and controlling the narrative. I wish I had the free time and patience to dive deep into researching this right now, but I've been busy lately. It's definitely on my list of things to do.

              i thought it was odd that David Seaman, Titus Frost and Ryan (rants) all released videos supporting the "pedogate" demonstration...  the first day i went to the gofundme it was a demonstration for "pizzagate"... next day i go, it's "pedogate" with no mention of pizzagate...
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT its just the way the banner shows on the gofundmepage, it cuts out pizzagate so all you can see is pedogate.. david seaman, titus frost and another who promoted it are all going to be there at the demo now.. i'm sure we've all had our doubts from time to time about various faces and voices but coming together to do what's right is what counts at the moment, for the children and to keep pushing for the arrests of the high profile giants of these child-sex abuse crimes.

              But you can kind of get an idea why they want to control every movement and piece of information...one reason would be to cover up their crimes against humanity.

            On another note about David Seaman, it's annoying to see that the shills actually managed to push the narrative that Seaman is some kind of disinfo agent. Only a retarded shill or a moron who hasn't watched any of David's videos would think that. David has only pushed info out to his audience and has been attacked relentlessly. He has done nothing but be a bullhorn for pizzagate and it's amazing you idiots seem to think the guy screaming fire is somehow trying to hide the fact theres a fire.

            Here we go again. I'm tired of this "alt-right" movement being shills. I don't care about them. I care about what we're doing here, investigating. Forget about all that 'disinfo BS stuff', Blah Blah Blah. We'll know the truth when we've found all the answers. Stop wasting our precious time.

            So I guess the answer is to discredit anyone with a large fan base who tries to get pizzagate out to the public? We need to keep pizzagate secret and make sure only nobodies on the internet talk about it?

            Looks like you simply can't abide anyone who really gets the word out about PG, alt right or Obama supporter, makes no difference, once they've actually consistently vigorously effectively represented on PG to a large audience, you hate on them. I completely fail to see how Cernovich, Seaman, Watson, Webb have mislead us. They all have their egos, they make mistakes,they are longwinded, I'm tired of their faces too, but still, fy.

            Ok let's get right into it shall we roundhouse1776.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just did a little research given your Trifecta Shill post. First thing I see is: "George Webb Supports Mike Cernovich, Highly Suspicious or Honest Mistake?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Aaaaaaaaaand you're a shill. You've posted articles attacking the credibility of Mike Cernovich, David Seaman and George Webb.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the Trifecta. You're trying to discredit the 3 people who got this whole story going. And you very deceitfully slip in shit like David Seaman is a "self-promotional shill".
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did you put shill in there ass-hole? Seaman is self-promotional yes. HE'S A JOURNALIST. But a shill is someone who's paid to push an agenda like you've been doing here for the past month as far as I can tell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wtf. Yes, what the fuck are you doing here shilling for child rapists and organ harvesters. You concern trolled George Webb? George Webb could very well be the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ for all we know given the CIA wants to kill him.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're trying to discredit a guy who's PUTTING HIS LIFE ON THE LINE to end the practice of child trafficking and organ harvesting in Haiti. Not to mention the 10 other horrible things he's discovered like Killary Clinton shipping Libya's Sarin gas precursors to ISIS.
           </p>
           <p>
            You remember ISIS don't you asshole. The CIA, John McCain, Killary Clinton and the Muslim Brotherhood thought they do a tag team in Syria and kill a whole fuck-ton of people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The worst though is your attacking George Webb. You are a disgusting piece of shit.

             Nobody wants to take down the pedophiles more than people like me. You are using the same logical fallacy that Seaman uses, that anyone who criticizes him is working for the pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the CIA really wanted to kill George Webb, he'd be dead already. The only reason these disinfo agents are getting away with as much as they do, is because there are people like you who blindly believe anything they say.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seaman is clearly pushing an agenda, first and foremost is to use Pizzagate to attempt to become rich and famous. If you can't see this, then you're beyond help.

                Yeah, I gotta hear this one. Lay it on me roundhouse. Why on earth would you be so fucked in the head to attack George Webb for trying to end the current gang rape of Haiti by some fucking psychopaths in our government.

                 Roundhouse1776 is buddies WITH ARMYSEER- just a fairly inept shill.  All comments are condescending and discrediting.

                  It's gems like this I love:
"My theory is that George Webb's purpose is to ensnare the 'truthers' and other people who are skeptical or see through the agenda presented by the more casual/mainstream thought leaders."

                 George Webb has released a lot of good info, and what is probably more important is the info he doesn't release. Since your reading comprehension is not very good, I'll repeat myself. They know the scandals are coming out, now it's about pushing the version of the truth that they want the masses to accept.

                  "pushing the version of the truth that they want".........Really? They're pushing the version that has Hillary Clinton covertly sending Libya's Sarin gas precursors to ISIS in Syria to carry out a false flag attack in Ghouta Syria THAT KILLED 1300 PEOPLE.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  George Webb is pushing the story that will put Hillary Clinton in front of a firing squad or hung by the neck until dead?

                  Lay it on my mother fucker. You tell me why Hillary and the CIA wants to push that side of the story.

Since your reading comprehension is not very good, I'll repeat myself. They know the scandals are coming out, now it's about pushing the version of the truth that they want the masses to accept."

            Thanks for all the valuable info, keep up the good work. My theories need some adjusting, but I think I'm on the right track. If the supposed Vault 7 release by Wikileaks turns out to be fake, I'll keep digging into these people tomorrow.

            Everyone needs to be careful and there perception and reality. I am not sure what or who to trust either... i do know that those people you talk about are all and have all been working hard on the projects and discovery of what is going on, Pizzagate and Deep State, Alex Jones for decades. Cernovich, i don't know much about him but we shall see. They have all been shut down. All of them. I dont know. no one does, but you are okay to have a hairy eyeball on anyone you like. I think they all believe pizzagate is real but they are also being banned from all venues for talking about it. Why?

            By your reckoning roundhouse, you're the only one that can be trusted to decide who is good and who is bad. So, kindly get your mug up on youtube like the others you out, and lead the way. If you can't do that, I and most others may have to come to some other understanding of your motives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit, No need to cite your proviso: Keep in mind, this is a theory and I'm not claiming that all of the above is fact.

             Not true at all, and I have never claimed anything even remotely close to that. There are thousands of people online that have good intentions and want nothing other than the truth and evil to be exposed. The same cannot be said about the people above. They are public figures, and as such, deserve criticism and suspicion when it is warranted. I and others, have found disturbing information about the people listed above and others.

            Sorry but you are wrong about this. They all have a piece to this massive puzzle. George Webb has all the dirt and is releasing them as part of the whole story. He is capturing all the suspects in a large dragnet

             The are releasing the truth as they want it to be told. Pizzagate and other scandals are coming out no matter what, steering the narrative is the new objective. There is undeniably a hidden agenda at work here.

            Of all the people you mention, George Webb is someone I have the most faith in.  That guy has consistently put out well-constructed, evidence-based theories - AND most importantly - isn't trying to sell me herbal tea, flashlights, or boner pills...
           </p>
           <p>
            The lack of any visible action based on Webb's stuff is driving me nuts though.  Like this Awan brothers thing.  How the fuck is this not on the front page of every news outlet?

            Anyone who uses the term "alt right" with a straight face should be viewed with suspicion. The op is the source of the blockbuster submissions "David seaman is as a total fraud" and "David seaman outed as a fraud EXPOSED!". This post is an attempt to lump a bunch of people together with very little evidence for each, in order to smear certain people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would recommend taking each person individually and gathering evidence for each, presenting it clearly and succinctly (not just a link to someone else's hit piece on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            ) and posting to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . This sub is more for evidence of child trafficking, not so much about any fucking person online who's ever mentioned it.
