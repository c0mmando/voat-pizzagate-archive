<p>If the car which came out of the woods as Trump\'s motorcade passed on Route 66 was an attempt to ambush the President, this would heavily impact the Pizzagate endeavor if it had been successful. Not only would it reveal serious flaws in Trump\'s security perimeter, but it would also, if successful (God forbid!) end for the time being all attempts to end the globalist pedophile industry since President Trump is our best hope to investigate and prosecute malefactors.</p>
<p><strong>DUBIOUS OFFICIAL NARRATIVE</strong></p>
<p>Two videos have surfaced of the incident. One from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWzc1qZp2M0">Clayton Hefner</a> on the same side of the road as the car, and one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDuhtlNOleQ&amp;app=desktop">Chris Robertson </a>from the other side of the street. </p>
<p>The driver, an 18 year old teen named Samantha Morris made the following statement: <a href="http://www.ky3.com/content/news/Driver-of-car-crashing-near-presidential-motorcade-is-talking-It-was-terrifying--442415653.html">http://www.ky3.com/content/news/Driver-of-car-crashing-near-presidential-motorcade-is-talking-It-was-terrifying--442415653.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;it was terrifying,&quot; said Samantha Morris, the driver.</p>
<p>Samantha Morris, 17, and Nikia Hicks, 18 were in that car on their way to work when their brakes suddenly went out.</p>
<p>&quot;I was pumping my brakes hard, they were smoking and i couldn\'t stop at all&quot; said Morris.</p>
<p>That\'s when she swerved to avoid hitting a gaurd at the entrance of her work and ended up feet from a pond.</p>
<p>&quot;i just thought we\'d hit a fence,&quot; said Morris. &quot;I thought there was a fence. We were crazy close to that pond. we could have drowned.&quot;</p>
<p>But instead they were surrounded by Secret Service agents, who they say combed their car for anything dangerous. They found no threat, confirmed their brakes went out and let them go. The Springfield police chief says there was no mal-intent.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a untimely unfortunate coincidence,&quot; said Chief Williams.</p>
<p>While this may sound crpbs.twimg.com/media/DIm00ATXYAAn0l0.jpg:mededible, a quick look at the area behind the embankment from which the car emerged tells a different tale: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a large pond behind the embankment and the area is densely wooded. Furthermore, the exit from Route 66 to the Bass Pro Base Camp was being guarded by a police car. Samantha may have veered off the road as it turns near the pond, since she says her brakes failed and she veered off the road trying to avoid hitting a guard at the entrance to her work. She allegedly plunged through dense bushes and trees along the narrow edge of the embankment (Google map taken in December), managing to avoid going into lake and a fence (what fence?), miraculously finding this path (shown at link) down the hill  and safely onto the sidewalk next to Route 66:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.2397342,-93.2486971,3a,30y,218.27h,89.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sg3V8f5lj6GGfnLUicZ36yQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">https://www.google.com/maps/@37.2397342,-93.2486971,3a,30y,218.27h,89.5t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sg3V8f5lj6GGfnLUicZ36yQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656</a></p>
<p>If we are to believe Samantha she is an incredibly adept driver and should sign up for Nascar! </p>
<p>However, Chris Robertson\'s video raises some questions. Before the car comes speeding down the path, we don\'t see any movement. In other words, we don\'t see Samantha wildly crashing and careening through the woods at the top of the embankment with an  out-of-control car. It just suddenly starts in motion and comes down the path as the motorcade passes, in perfect time to intercept the Presidential SUV, which can be seen going into the far right lane as car comes out of woods.</p>
<p>Take another look at the path the car took out of the woods: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.2397427,-93.2489633,3a,15y,168.07h,89.95t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1sQBUjlOMrOLJp2PBC46309w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i20">https://www.google.com/maps/@37.2397427,-93.2489633,3a,15y,168.07h,89.95t/data=!3m9!1e1!3m7!1sQBUjlOMrOLJp2PBC46309w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i20</a></p>
<p>Is it possible that hours before the motorcade arrived, the perpetrators may have hidden themselves from view and waited for the motorcade instead of the unlikely tale Samantha relates? Please note the following</p>
<p>1) When the car emerges, the brakes are not &quot;smoking&quot; as Samantha says. After bouncing over the culvert, the driver STOPS  on the grass. Did the brakes suddenly start working again? Perhaps the car was otherwise disabled, but it\'s odd that the runaway car is able to stop and also that Samantha was able to negotiate the path with her out-of-control car relatively unscathed, with no visible dents or scratches from her harrowing course through the woods.</p>
<p>2) The passenger who gets out doesn\'t look like a 17 y/o girl as claimed. </p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Many questions remain about the official narrative as it stands. Highly implausible that the incident occurred as Samantha related it.</p>',

            I was traveling once, before the election, and seen the word Jesus in the sky.  I couldn't believe it.  It was a chemtrail as it didn't dissapate for as long as I could see.  As for county officials, they play dumb.

            This video both convinces me this was some type of attempt and makes me feel somewhat better that they are operating in such an amateurish manner. It's the unknown that really scares you w/ PG, and seeing stuff like this makes me realize they truly are not all that powerful.

            I haven't seen hardly any chemtrails in my area since Jan 20.  I was hoping that was a thing of the past.

             Hi, Are_we-sure. If you'll notice, I didn't actually say, "The Secret Service is covering up a Trump assassination attempt." That's your own conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I am saying is that the official narrative is highly questionable.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You're pushing a conspiracy theory....the soft version of "Just asking questions?"  Or "something doesn't add up." 
 First off you use the conspiracy phrase "official narrative" which as I'm sure you know activates people's SpideySense around here.  And here's what that narrative is
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             But instead they were surrounded by Secret Service agents, who they say combed their car for anything dangerous. They found no threat, confirmed their brakes went out and let them go. The Springfield police chief says there was no mal-intent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Secret Service confirmed this was a case where the brakes went out on a car.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Why is this dubious? Why is a "narrative" instead of what happened?  Do you feel the Secret Service is incompetent and couldn't determine if the brakes were not working on the car?
           </p>
           <p>
            You claim it's dubious and you point to a highly biased and edited video calling it an assassination attempt.   Why is your narrative not the dubious one?  What are you claiming about the Secret Service?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is your conspiracy theory not the dubious one?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is it not dubious that you question the Springfield Chief of Police?  You have no evidence.  You have GOOGLE MAPS, FOR GOODNESS'S SAKES.   How do you think that makes you more qualified to understand what happened that the people ACTUALLY ON SITE?  You're a smart man, surely, if you took the time to stop and think, you would understand the difference between looking a map and being at the location.  Wouldn't you?  I would hope you would.  After all this location, these woods, that road would one that police department of Springfield, Missouri would be very familiar with.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             If her claim is false, which I HIGHLY SUSPECT it is
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Your evidence is basically your suspicion.  That's it.  You really have nothing else.   You have your suspicion and some belief that the Secret Service and the Springfield police know less about this situation than you do because you saw a video and looked at Google Maps.
           </p>
           <p>
            First off, you are posted a edited conspiracy video of the event that calls it an assassination attempt with zero evidence.  When evidence of what occurred is presented, you discount this evidence and claim this is possible sabotage and an ambush.  Even though the car never makes an attempt to drive onto the highway.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you wanted to find out what happened, the first thing to do would be to try to get a better sense of the event by finding the original unedited video.   The video you show is NOT from the person who filmed the event.  How do we know?  The video has a LiveLeak logo on it, meaning the guy on youtube stole it from LiveLeak, not downloaded it from his camera. The man who shot this footage is named Clayte, not Clayton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the original footage with the audio of those filming and no edits.

           <p>
            (BTW I love, love, love, the clickbait headline
           </p>
           <p>
            Vehicle attempts to ram Presidential Motorcade in Springfield, MO
           </p>
           <p>
            Followed by the disclaimer he put up afterwards trying to cover his ass from a libel lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            This video is for entertainment purposes only, and is in no way meant to accuse the driver and/or passenger )
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's example the conspiracy that the car was intentionally threaten the president motorcade?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why moving so slow?
Why no attempt to actually make it on the road?
           </p>
           <p>
            The other angle makes it clear the car is going much, much slower than the cars on the highway AND it makes clear the car turns away from the highway

            Yeah, what the hell is up with chemtrails? You see them all the time lately. I don't know what they're doing, but it can't be good if they're doing it right in front of our faces and not even trying to explain it, even with some baloney cover story.

             I'm watching "Ozark" on  Netfix. That show is enough to keep any sane person away from the area, or be guarded with tanks if there. Also  remember it took the corrupt dems and reps two years to be successful in the murders of Kennedy, and Kennedy and King. Are they trying dry runs, to check the security team?

            Here comes my favorite saying when I feel something is just not right.  This reeks to high heaven.  We could also say this stinks like three day old fish.  Security is also lacking imo. This is something that can be arrived at with common sense.  Are we going to have to have tanks guarding the POTUS now and in the future?  Evidently.

            The first video doesn't look too weird....it's not until you look at the second video coming out of the woods at the exact particular time the motorcade is going by......and you say, OMG!  Totally planned.  Where is the investigation?  This was highly suspect, even for someone who doesn't know much about how they keep a President safe or not.  Now, really worried that safety/security has really been compromised, much like FBIAnon predicted.  Oh, and Missouri is not far from the Arkansas mafia, either. Geez.

            Hmm.  Very odd for a path to come out of the woods with no way to get on that road.  If it was not meant to be driven on in the first place, why did she use it?  If that was her place of employment you would think she knew that road had no outlet.  Why would she even enter it?  Also the police made a pretty quick decision without proper investigation. considering this was a Pres. of the US.

            A question that I must ask is, Where does an 18 yr old get that kind of driving experience in the first place, unless like you say she is a Nascar Driver.  Driving through the woods and almost hitting a security guard would have seriously shook up any teenager.  Then to be able to control that car to come out of that small pathway (that seems to have been cleared out).  Was that path just freshly cleared or has it always been there.  For what purpose?  There does not seem to be an outlet from it onto the road. This whole think is certainly a conundrum.

              The whole think is strange and does not add up.  I am not convinced any of the details are true, really.  Another crisis actor or the guy at Ping Pong that had a debt to pay.  A way to get off with no jail time?  Is that how they work these things?  Hello, We Are Not Stupid.
