<p>The situation still hasn\'t been very easy to follow, though, so here is a chronological description of what happens in the two related emails to hopefully clear up some of the confusion:</p>
<p>First, John Podesta receives a forwarded email from the Sandlers on Friday 8/23/14 at 21:26 (9:26 p.m.) under the subject &quot;we have arrived&quot; which says they are on Martha\'s Vineyard. They give their location as &quot;55 Harbor View Lane in Vineyard Haven. About 5 minutes from Vineyard Haven Ferry.&quot; They provide cell phone numbers for Herb, Susan and Steve (any idea who Steve might be?). They note that Anthony Romero - possibly the same man who heads the ACLU - probably won\'t be attending due to &quot;a bad cold.&quot; They also say, &quot;See you Monday,&quot; and &quot;Let us know what time you expect to arrive.&quot;</p>
<p>Next, Kathryn Tate emails Herb and Susan Sandler under the subject, &quot;Links to Houses in Vineyard Haven &amp; Chilmark.&quot; This is on Monday, 9/01/14 at 12:05 p.m., more than a week after the Sanders\' email about their arrival (you have to wonder, then, about what Monday they were originally talking about seeing people on).</p>
<p>Tate signs the email as a representative of Kendall &amp; Kendall Real Estate, but the email account she sends it from is actually on her own ktate.com web site, which is no longer functioning. It seems to have gone offline sometime around the time that the Podesta emails came out.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/V3GBw">http://archive.is/V3GBw</a></p>
<p>Tate\'s email is addressed to &quot;Susan &amp; Herb&quot; and says, &quot;Here are links to the houses we drove by today located in Vineyard Haven.&quot; So apparently they had just looked at those houses that morning.</p>
<p>Tate sends links from kendallmarthasvineyard.com about three houses in Vineyard Haven.  For the third house, she writes, &quot;House across from the VH Yacht Club, which I feel the ceilings are too low for you and Steve, but Patty asked me to send along.&quot; Patty is probably one of the Kendalls.</p>
<p>Then Tate writes, &quot;Here are links to the 3 houses in Chilmark,&quot; also from kendallmarthasvineyard.com, which she provides without any description.</p>
<p>Then she adds, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for all piling into the car. It definitely was more fun with everyone and think of all the gossip you would have missed if we were in two cars.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any other questions about any of the houses.</p>
<p>Safe travels to all</p>
<p>Kate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later that afternoon, at 4:18 PM, Susan Sandler replies, &quot;Thanks, Kate. We all really enjoyed it and it was very informative for us, and were talking about how great we think you are.&quot;</p>
<p>The following day, Tate writes to Susan Sandler, CC\'ing Herb, at 10:04 AM, under the subject, &quot;You left something at the Field house.&quot; (apparently the &quot;Field house&quot; is 55 Harbor View Lane, which may have been owned by a Michael S. Field at the time, according to a post here: <a href="http://archive.is/9vtOG">http://archive.is/9vtOG</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1521155/7397984">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1521155/7397984</a> )</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.</p>
<p>Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.</p>
<p>I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.</p>
<p>Safe travels to all</p>
<p>Kate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later that day, at 2:54 PM, Susan Sandler emails John Podesta about the handkerchief, apparently under a different subject, &quot;Did you leave a handkerchief.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.</p>
<p>Susaner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Podesta replies the next day, at 9:29 PM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It\'s mine, but not worth worrying about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Susan replies the next morning, at 11:06, &quot;OK, thanks.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>On the location of the Field house, it seems pretty certain that it is indeed 55 Harbor View Lane, Vineyard Haven, which apparently had been rented by the Sandlers for about a week. A Michael S. Field resided at that address in the past, possibly as an owner, though I\'m not sure that\'s been definitely determined.</p>
<p>I did come across a couple of other possibilities, however:</p>
<p>The Aquinnah Field House</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/W2OF1">http://archive.is/W2OF1</a></p>
<p>And there are also homes in the &quot;Field Club&quot; of Martha\'s Vineyard.</p>

            I think this is very much speculation.  The idea that they would just leave a girl behind whether alive or dead is crazy.  What if the "maid" just called the police?  This is just a handkerchief.

             A "square" "cloth" "handkerchief" --&gt; a girl?  Yeah, not buying that one.  Needs a foundation to be plausible, not just an assertion.

            Had read that the FBI code says map refers to semen.  Recently saw - sorry don't remember where - that map  can refer to Minor Age P .... [person?  preference?], sort of like SWF (single white female).  Has anyone else seen this?

           <p>
            And had the impression that handkerchiefs (white and black referring to small child and sadism) were put under the child to catch the blood.  If that's right, do they become trophies?  Souvenirs?  And would that explain checking if it were Podesta's?

            After this it is most likely John had contacted Susan directly. It would of been more efficient at that time to contact her directly with instructions on how to handle the pizza/pillows/handkerchiefs than over email.

            Something that doesn't make sense to me: if Sandler is part of the conspiracy, why would she need to add the additional words "I think it has a map that seems pizza-related"? i.e. she could just say "the realtor found a handkerchief" and that should be enough to alert Podesta.

             That's a good point, and may be so. But we also just don't seem to have enough information to go on. For one thing, it's possible that any number of words in this exchange were actually code words for other things. If the handkerchief was something else, or the map was, then Sandler might have been sending a different sort of message to John Podesta. And does it mean something that the realtor described the handkerchief as "square" and "cloth" since that's typically what handkerchiefs are, or was she just being overly precise? It does seem more likely than not that Sandler did talk to the realtor before writing John Podesta and was going on some sort of verbal description of what was found, and not just the realtor's email.

            I think a lot of that makes sense and a situation like that is also very sadly plausible, but at this point we just don't know that to be the case, either. So something like that is certainly a possibility to keep in mind, but we also have to keep other possibilities in mind too.

            Perhaps the biggest question here, other than explaining what a handkerchief with a pizza-related map really is, is this - how did Susan Sandler know the handkerchief had a "pizza-related map"? Did she simply infer it from Kathryn Tate's description in the above email, or did she call her on the phone for a more detailed description of the handkerchief, or something else?

             If you go on appearances, then it seems most likely that Susan Sandler called the realtor, and from that talk she got a sense of what the handkerchief - if it was a handkerchief - looked like or was about. But again, there's no way to say for certain with so many things unknown.

             Something else about how Susan Sandler describes the handkerchief to John Podesta is that her description sounds uncertain. If the realtor told her that the handkerchief has a map on it related to pizza, particularly pizza restaurants, then there wouldn't really be any reason for her to have so much uncertainty about it as she does, saying that she thinks it has a map on it that seems pizza-related.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another possibility to keep in mind, too, is that pizza not only seems to be pedophile slang, but also to have some sexual meanings in general. So that's another possibility for what pizza might mean if it's a code word in this case.

              The phrasing "handkerchief...map that seems pizza related" is what is most obviously wrong about the string,  but the "i think" really sells the idea that even if something terrible

             That probably is the biggest question, and I was interested to know what people thought about that on the other thread that brought it up, and I'm still interested to know. It seems like we're just left with possibilities without a way of knowing for sure what that answer is.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that answer also seems possibly very connected to the answers to many other things, including what "the handkerchief with the pizza-related map" really is.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, as some people have suggested, maybe what was left wasn't even a handkerchief, but something else we can't even guess. In that case, the realtor and Susan Sandler were both trying to delicately deal with the situation, whatever it might have been.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, if it was really was a handkerchief, the realtor and Susan Sandler still might both have been in on the "pizza-related" situation if indeed there was one, and this wasn't just some innocent leaving of a handkerchief.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then another very big question is what the "map" is that's being talked about. It might be a real map - either part of the handkerchief, or drawn on - or code for something else. I know I've come across a number of slang words for map with sexual and/or pedophilia meanings. All these possibilities people have raised.
            </p>
            <p>
             But if we don't know what the "map" is, it's hard to know what Susan Sandler had to go on. And as people have said, we don't know if she had seen the handkerchief before, and so knew it was John Podesta's, in which case she might only have been pretending to ask him if it was his, but instead was letting him know that he had left the handkerchief behind. And she might know just from how the realtor described the handkerchief that it was Podesta's.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also have that seemingly strange question from the realtor to consider, about pillows, which hardly seems to make logical sense, as people have pointed out. The Sandlers apparently left behind some pillows they bought rather than taking them, and somehow the realtor knows that without having apparently seen the pillows.

             Interesting. She either called, inferred knowing Podest@, or witnessed the ordeal, knowing it was indeed pizza-related.

              If she had seen the handkerchief before, I would have thought that she would have been more confident about what it was and what it looked like, and wouldn't have needed to ask Podesta if it was his, and if he wanted it. Furthermore, if it hadn't been Podesta's, who else would she think could have left a handkerchief with a pizza-related map in the house?

            The logs also show Dershowitz on a flight with Epstein from Bedford, Mass., to Teterboro in October 1998, and a flight from Teterboro to Martha's Vineyard in 1999. And a 2005 trip from Massachusetts to Montreal shows him traveling with Epstein, "Tatianna," and others.

             That's an interesting question. My impression had been that the properties were looked at - driven by, at least - because someone wanted to rent a place. I believe they were all vacation rental places. Of course someone could be looking to buy such a place too, and the Sandlers might be such people.
            </p>

             I should have included the links to all these properties. Here they are:

               Yes I read your post, which was most helpful, in the recent thread about this situation, and also linked to it in my thread. Till that point I didn't think 55 Harbor View Ln was the Field house. I also saw that you showed a woman named Linda Comstock is living in the house:
