             Yeah, it is deranged.  Once fetal tissue becomes a commodity it creates a incentive to get more and more abortions just for the extra money.  Then you end up with horrifying stuff like what is going on with the Ukraine where women are paid to abort children so they can harvest the fetuses.  So the whole "the bodies would just be thrown out anyway.  Better to let some good come from them." argument misses the point that it perpetuates the process.

            I'm really just curious, because I've been looking into using my own bone marrow stem cells to help with a shoulder issue, but, why would they need to harvest stem cells from anyone when, as I understand it, typically you just use your own and it's rather painless?

             Their seems to be a connection between the youth of the body material is removed from and the result.  Older folk aren't so useful in organ transplants or stem cells.
            </p>
            <p>
             Motorcycle accident victims provided a steady supply of young healthy body parts, back when transplants were not so ordinary.  But people wanting parts has expanded beyond that early source.  Waiting for a liver or kidney can take a long time now, for ordinary people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rich in need, are looking for a supply on their time schedule.  That's how everything else works for them, they tolerate no waiting for cabs, planes, or perhaps body parts.   They expect the best of everything and feel entitled to it right now.   If the sky's the limit on price, lots of doors will open.  They understand young parts make them feel younger.

             It is a good question.  I believe they are going after the type of stem cells known as
             <a href="http://archive.is/ZmR3g">
              perinatal
             </a>
             stem cells.  There are scientists who think that perinatal stem cells are very promising.  Still, you would think pluripotent embryonic stem cells would be more sought after.  In Ukraine there are a lot of crazy treatments with this sort of stem cell, such as beauty injections, which are quite possibly pseudoscientific woo so sometimes the reason may not always even be logical.  I would much rather people use their own marrow than harvest fetuses and newborns.   All I know is that, for whatever reason, illegal body part harvesting for stem cells is far too common in Ukraine.

              I think infant stem cells have something to do with youth as well as the bone marrow of children. That is one of the main goals of these disturbed people to live forever, or stay young. That will do it at any cost

            Great research. Just when you thought it could not be any more evil. Paying poor women for surrogacy from test tube babies like puppy mills....the Clinton Foundation. Or worse paying to carry late term and forcing early birth for organ harvesting, stem cell harvesting.

             Thank you, Jem777.  I really appreciate the kind words.  It is completely evil and grotesque. The best I can do is to try to inform people of the depraved criminal stuff against newborns that goes on in Ukraine.
