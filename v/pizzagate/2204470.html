           <p>
            Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will raise the stalled extradition of former school principal and alleged sex offender Malka Leifer directly with Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem next week in a bid to dramatically step up pressure on Israel over the issue. The move will be part of a broader bipartisan Australian push to secure the extradition of Ms Leifer, who has claimed she is too ill to attend hearings in relation to her return to Australia to face 74 counts of child sex abuse while principal of an ultra-conservative Jewish school in Melbourne.
           </p>
           <p>
            An Australian political delegation, including Labor MPs ­Michael Danby, Mark Dreyfus, Mike Kelly and Gai Brodtmann, has also sought to discuss the issue with Israel’s Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked on October 30, the day before Israel commemorates the 100th anniversary of the battle of Beersheba in 1917.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of Ms Leifer’s victims, Dassi Erlich, and two of her sisters also abused by the former principal, will also meet Ms Shaked next week.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australian authorities have been dismayed by the Israeli justice system which has, in effect, shielded Ms Leifer from facing justice in Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Leifer’s lawyers successfully argued last year that Ms Leifer was psychologically unwell and too ill to attend extradition hearings. In May an Israeli judge ordered that the proceedings halt while Ms Leifer underwent a psychiatric treatment — a process that could stretch on for years. The judge lifted her house arrest, allowing her to walk free after she was arrested in August 2014 at the request of Australian police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in May, Ms Leifer was photographed at a festival in northern Israel, raising further doubts about her claims to be too ill to attend extradition hearings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last month, Mr Turnbull met Ms Erlich and her sisters and promised Canberra’s support.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We are very grateful for Malcolm Turnbull’s support” Ms Erlich said told The Australian yesterday. “All we are asking for is justice. We want Malka Leifer to come back to Australia to face the charges against her. I can’t say how much this would mean for myself and for others ...”
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Danby said: “It is now nearly four years since those Victorian charges (against Ms Leifer). Perhaps the Israeli judicial system and the Israeli Minister of Justice might consider having an independent psychiatric panel re-evaluate Ms Leifer’s ability to go before an extradition hearing in Israel and be returned to Australia to face those very grave charges.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia’s Jewish community has also stepped up its push to influence the case, with prominent Jewish lawyer Mark Leibler meeting Ms Shaked in Israel in September to express the growing frustration in the Jewish community about the stalled extradition proceedings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Leifer was helped by senior members of Melbourne’s ultra-orthodox Adass community in 2008 after they became aware of allegations of sexual abuse involving Ms Leifer, who was principal of the Adass Israel School. Victoria Police would eventually charge her with 74 counts of sexual assault and rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2015, former Victorian Supreme Court judge Jack Rush ordered the school to pay $1,024,428 in damages after Ms Erlich sued the school.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Leifer’s abuse of Ms Erlich began when Ms Erlich was 15 and continued for years. The leaders of the Adass community were widely criticised for helping Ms Leifer to fly to Israel on the night when allegations against her were first raised with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            In his judgment, Justice Rush stated: “The failure of the board to report the allegations to police prior to arranging Leifer’s urgent departure is deplorable.”
