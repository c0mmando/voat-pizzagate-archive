<p>I was doing searches for July 10th and suddenly it hit me right smack dab in my face -- was the IT party Seth attended actually communicating with Kim  dotcom\'s INTERNET PARTY? </p>
<p>It really could be. Kim dotcom said Seth was in communication with . If Seth were in communication, he could have easily been found out since others knew. Once it was confirmed that Seth was the leaker, there was no more need for speculation. There was only a hastily arranged plan. It\'s why the shooting was so sloppily done and botched. </p>
<p>I mean, if there were an internet party, there\'d have to be some sort of record of it. That\'s what companies do best ... keep records. It really does fit that Wheeler had it half right and that\'s why he couldn\'t make headway finding out more.</p>',
