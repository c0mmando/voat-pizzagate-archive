<p>This post, from yesterday (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1545981"> John Podesta is behind Scalia murder plot</a>), took me down an interesting trail. I suggest that you read that thread and then come back to this one; because I will not be able to include all of the details uncovered by <a href="https://voat.co/user/TheJesusDude">TheJesusDude</a></p>
<p>I started out by investigating <strong>Jerry Rapp\'s</strong> Facebook page, and learned quite a bit about him. I\'ve archived a great deal, but will link to the main pages (as key elements seem to get lost in the archiving translation). Please take a rational approach to following through on any leads or connections that you find, and share them here. There was a thread, this morning, where someone completely misinterpreted a comment by one of his friends and basically accused a guy of being a pedophile when he was simply talking about a hospital bed.</p>
<h4><strong>Possible Pizzagate Connection</strong></h4>
<p>There are a few reasons that I am honing in on this, and why I spent all night tracking through what I could find out about this guy. This is no smoking gun, but it may be a key in tying these people together and directly to John Podesta. </p>
<p>There was a comment, regarding a Jimmy Comet Instagram photo, that stuck with me. I can no longer find that thread or comment. Essentially, the commentor stated that they were almost positive that they knew the person, and divulged a relationship close enough to recognize him. The last that they knew, this person was living in California (which Jerry Rapp did, at one time); but they weren\'t sure as to his current location. They explained that he was in the film business, and that they wouldn\'t be surprised to learn that he was involved in Pizzagate. They hinted that someone could make the connection, if they tried, but they did not feel safe enough to ID him.</p>
<p>After reading the thread proposing a link to Podesta and the supposed script for the Scalia murder, I began looking into Jerry Rapp. As soon as I saw a photo, my memory of that post was triggered. I think it is worth further investigation.</p>
<h2>Take a look at <strong><a href="https://sli.mg/1lqdbZ">this comparison</a></strong> and let me know what you make of it.</h2>
<h4><strong>Please Help Research This</strong></h4>
<p>The photo comparison is not enough to link Jerry Rapp to this scandal. However, I do believe that this lead needs to be further vetted or debunked.</p>
<p>Jerry Rapp is a ghost writer who writes and produces in the horror genre. He is located in Kansas City, MO, but is active in red carpet events and film and music festivals; so it\'s not out of the question for him to move in the same circles as Alefantis and Podesta.</p>
<p>I have archived the following links, and will replace with archived versions if anything happens to these. Because of the information that does not translate in the archiving, I\'ll post the direct links, for now. If anyone has time to dig further and download/archive anything they find, please help me follow these leads and add to what I\'ve found so far.</p>

            There's a superficial resemblance, though without a better image I'm inclined to think we're looking at Kreher in the construction photo - after al, he's a direct connection to the construction company and J Achilles Alefantis, and this other thing, Jerry Rapp, is interesting but tougher to substantiate, being several degrees past the subject/property on its surface.
