<p>With all this, I believe I can complete a revised time line for the crimes against Heather O\'Rourke.</p>
<p>Timeline:
Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987.
Suspects: Steven Spielberg</p>
<p>Happy Days:
Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler</p>
<p>The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death.</p>
<p>Location: On the set of Rocky Road</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. Heather\'s illness started to manifest around January 1987. The episode was released in May of 1987.   She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worseneded. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.</p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples.</p>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by repeated anal rapes.</p>
<p>Note: As I deduced regarding the Judith Barsi murder, &quot;The Best Lies are based on a Truth.&quot; seems to also apply to this case. Chrons was likely used as a cover up due to certain factual truths about it. Chrons is more common in females and it is very hard to detect unless you\'re a surgeon.</p>',

            New here, just started to dig into this nightmare. Here’s a link to an extremely creepy statement about Heather O’rourke. It completely goes against the narrative that was presented to the public. This is extremely odd behavior, possibly outright deception (should be noted he was a pall bearer at the child’s funeral).

            <p>
             Either way, he just blurted out that the official narrative is full of shit.

             Suspect he's lying about the suicide though. That commentary was creepy.

            Is that Culkin interview actually real? Holy shit.

            Remember the Hampstead kids talked about a pretty unremarkable sports shop I think it was that they said was the place where the satanic paedo ring their father was part of got their human skin shoes made.

            <p>
             Given the kind of threats he receives (there's a CDAN about it), if my deduction is correct, the threats and the contents of that interview are linked.

              Thanks for all your work on this, Dark knight.
Although it may not be apparent, this horrific information is continually seeping outwards to a widening audience of increasingly receptive Normies.
             </p>
             <p>
              The powerful psychological factors impairing good people from accepting these events as factual are continually being overcome by the hard evidence your work provides.
We CANNOT allow this evil to continue unabated.
Again, I thank you.

               I'm seeing these very threads showing up in multiple places both on twitter and on the internet, so there's definetely signs of what you're saying.
              </p>
              <p>
               I just wish that same awareness were spreading regarding the Barsi case.
              </p>
              <p>
               I believe both the O'Rourke and Barsi cases are the thing that can bust pedowood wide open. If normies can associate the rampant sexual abuse in Hollywood with two child actresses that were deeply loved, then they can be more easily red pilled to pizzagate due to "their" big shield (Hollywood/the media) being torn off.
              </p>
              <p>
               I believe we are at the point in this investigation where its time to start spreading awareness of these cases. Spread them across the internet and social media like wild fire. Its time for #JusticeForHeatherORourke and #JusticeForJudithBarsi to go viral and strike the killing blow.

                I agree. Many people aren’t even into politics and what’s going on in the world. It amazes me. But, A LOT of people are into entertainment, (Hollywood, etc...) Especially younger crowds. Also, seeing the child actress in movies or tv would make it much more real for them than just hearing something on the news.

                I so very much want the masks ripped off their faces.  What is underneath is even uglier than we see now.  I don't really remember Hoffman, but I have been repulsed by Marshall and Winkler for years. They have pervert written all over them.  Steven Spielberg is in a class by himself.  Vile.  Thank you darkknight for all your hard work in trying to gain justice for Heather and Judith.  The horrors they experienced were beyond comprehension  but the desecration of their bodies' the sick act of stealing their skin'  is unimaginable.  For what purpose?  To wear?   The sick evil monsters.  Shoes.  Do any of these sick Child Rapists have red shoes?  I hate to think of the pleasure they derive from wearing them.  Like Tony P.  and others.  I too believe proof of the crimes they committed will be the downfall of disgusting Tinsel Town.  I don't care if movies are never made again.  Let them all burst into flames and melt into the fires of hell like the witch in the Wizard of Oz.
