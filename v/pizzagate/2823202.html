            The key to this case is Madeleine's genetic defect that she shared with George Soros.

             The McCanns were warned by the Portuguese Police not to draw attention to Madeleine's coloboma, lest her "kidnapper" harm her by trying to conceal or alter it in some way, but they did so anyway because it was, in their own words, "a good marketing ploy."

            If Madeleine was sold into a pedophile ring, how is that consistent with the Portuguese police's belief that she died at the home on the day she allegedly went missing? I'm not favoring one theory or the other, but I fail to see how both of them fit together.

             I think they were pimping her out and her would be rapist came to the apartment, something went wrong and the child died, possibly from an assault or a fall.  She also most likely died earlier in the holiday, as there is no credible sighting of her alive after Sunday 29 April, as well as suspicious changes in the parents' behaviour starting from Monday onwards strongly suggest that whatever happened to Madeleine occurred on Sunday or the early hours of Monday morning.  The PJ's contention that Madeleine met her death on Thursday was based mainly on a statement by crèche nanny Catriona Baker in which she stated she helped serve high tea to families with kids in the crèche on Thursday afternoon, the entire McCann family included.  The PJ took her as a credible witness, but it has since emerged that Baker may have known the McCanns
             <em>
              before
             </em>
             the holiday (she certainly became very chummy with the McCanns after Madeleine's reported disappearance, so much so that they invited her to spend Christmas at their home), no other parent with children in the crèche remembers a high tea being served at all that week and there exist three different versions of who brought the children to this phantom high tea (Kate says in her book that Gerry picked the kids up whilst she went for a jog along the beach, the crèche records say she picked the kids up and Gerry said in his initial police statement that he and his wife played tennis all afternoon then they both picked up the kids; no mention of Kate's run along the beach).  Baker, therefore, cannot be considered a credible witness.
            </p>
            <p>
             My contention that Madeleine McCann's death involves elite paedophilia is based on the fact that the British Security Services, Police and Government all conspired to obstruct the PJ's investigation; I don't think they would have acted this way to cover up a mere accident.

              Thanks for explaining your theory of the case. It's pretty similar to what I think happened in the JonBenet Ramsey murder: her parents were involving her in a pedophile ring, the abuse got out of hand and led to her accidental death, and they needed to cover it up. While I'll need to do more researcher on Madeleine's abduction, I think your theory makes a lot of sense.

               Thank you.  There are many parallels between the McCann and Ramsey cases, to be sure.  To be honest, I initially thought it was a case of accidental death until I watched Richard D. Hall's excellent documentary series on the case.  It was from that that I learned of the disturbing possible connections to paedophilia (Dr. Kathrina Gaspar's statement to British Police regarding Tapas 7 member David Payne making sexually inappropriate remarks/gestures about Madeleine to Gerry McCann and Gerry McCann's name popping up in the CATS system, suggesting he may have been under investigation for child abuse at one time) as well as the unprecedented protection they've received from the British Government and Security Services which went way beyond just helping out their citizens abroad.

            You can never solve this one, no matter how many pieces of evidence you look at.  Reminds me of OJ and JFK.  I've decided the whole thing must have been planned long in advance--like before Madeleine's birth.  She had that eye thing common to elites, and somehow the Knights Templars seem to be involved.  Oddly some elements of the story seem to be taken from the Azaria Chamberlain case.  I'm not sure anyone died.  It's a kind of psyop.

             I think you're right, alas.  The only way the truth will come out about Madeleine McCann is if one of the parents or the Tapas 7 grows a conscience and confesses.  And they'll probably be suicided before that.

            I have decided that the McCanns hired criminals to look for criminals.  They also kept putting everything into their foundation.  People must stop donating to them.  They are like many other charities.  Lying.
