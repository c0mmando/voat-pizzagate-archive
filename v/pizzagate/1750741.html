            Great post and great song.  When the history books are written this movement will be the cornerstone of our new America,  an America where pedo Politicians hang from the trees for all to see.

            Hey I like your style, you're like a breath of fresh air. We've been in this bunker for what, 4 months now? We need positivity like this. Bring it n breathe it!

            In every situation, living in close quarters will mean people 'bug' each other. However, we know we're all for one cause, the children, and that unites us in all our squabbles.
           </p>

            Guys, please know that whatever we discuss and debate, regardless, I've got your back ; )

            Hello 30 minute account! Can you address why you believe this is a fictitious conspiracy theory? What parts of the evidence linked in the sticky here doesn't work for you?

            All the Alex Jones shenaniganry has had me visiting this sub again, and a lot of the vitriol against him makes me sad. No, he's not "the leader" of the operation, no, he doesn't quite get the whole picture here, no, Alefantis is not innocent. But why is it so hard to believe that Jones finally got threatened so hard he had to denounce Alefantis statements?
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of us here recognize that Alex Jones is doing something weird here, against his normal MO. Instead of taking that as a hint that something happened to him, everyone's just yelling "FUCK YOU ALEX JONES! FUCKING SELLOUT! CIA DISINFO OP!" and not looking too critically at the situation. If Alex Jones reads a lawyer-written statement, says he won't talk about Pizzagate anymore, then has a "special" 2 days later re-iterating Alefantis is innocent, why in the world would you take that at face value? You could almost ask him to "blink twice for help" at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            As someone
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1750169">
             astutely pointed out
            </a>
            , Jones going on about how Alefantis is innocent puts a target on his back. That might be the point, consider that? Alex getting his ass sued off, has no more ad revenue, and the only way for him to indicate what's happening was to say, "ALEFANTIS IS INNOCENT, I WONT TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE," and then going again 2 days later, "ALEFANTIS IS INNOCENT, I DID THIS ALL OF MY OWN FREE WILL, DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO HIM." Especially right before Alefantis shows up on 60 minutes to laugh about fake news?
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, it seems like he got threatened hard enough by lawyers he had to retract, and also did his hardest to indicate his viewers shit was going that he was legally bound to not talk about. Alefantis is one of the 50 most powerful men in DC, why is this so hard to imagine?

             I wouldn't say AJ/Bill has woken people up. My take is that we have two kinds of people/souls on this planet.. Those who can't think for themselves and go with the herd.. Group think/hive mind.. And those that can think critically.. Think for themselves.. The latter are always going to wake up sooner or later with or without Alex. I do feel AJ is controlled opposition.. Just an actor playing a character of Alex Jones.. and his role is to make anyone who questions authority or the status quo look like a raving loon.. That's why hes so in your face and rants..Think about it.. How many of your have mind friends immediately put you in the same category as AJ when they mock conspiracy nuts. He is the player boy for the truth movement to make us look like raving loons..  If you watch him closely you can see the whole thing is an act! He has done us a great disservice! He has made truthers look like nutjobs.. Hot heads etc.. He is not our friend.. Think about this.. Look deeper into his persona and you'll see!
And watch the youtube "Alex Jones is Bill Hicks 15 reasons" and you'll see! Seriously!
We have been played.. He was a setup from day 1.. Im 100% certain of this now.

              I've said "I agree" to so many of these responses it's almost weird to get one I disagree with!
             </p>
             <p>
              I have to disagree 100% with the idea that Alex Jones and Infowars haven't redpilled the shit out of people over almost two decades. While I agree that there are those who can't think for themselves and go with the herd, there are three levels here: MSM, InfoWars/Drudge level redpill, redpill that people themselves put together over putting together information over the years. There are definitely people who just religiously follow InfoWars and it is their "truth," as they buy their Super Male Vitality and Prosta-guard and whatnot, but to be interested in sites like InfoWars, I believe you have to be distrusting of your current media sources. There's no reason to believe this distrust wouldn't continue to Alex Jones for a good bit of these people. Especially with the many other alternative media sources available these days, many of those distrusting of MSM have sought out as many media sources as possible, having far more than just one citizen news site to visit.
             </p>
             <p>
              To me, if we look at this from a media attention sort of way, Alex is desperate to hang onto what was a near monopoly on "alternative news" and seeing the likes of Paul Joseph Watson, Mark Dice, and more makes him more worried. He hired Paul Joseph Watson quite a while ago, and recently commented on making him move to his Texas studio so he would start having his own slots on Info Wars. He also told Mark Dice in an interview recently it would be great for Dice to come to Texas so he could have his own time slot on InfoWars. This is more about him retaining the InfoWars brand as THE PLACE TO BE when it came to truth in news, in my opinion, than disinformation. This is the battle he's losing, the battle for relevancy, when PJW, Dice, Cernovich, McInnes, and more, are FAR more interesting and relevant than InfoWars 24/7.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I don't believe Jones is Bill Hicks. I still don't get why people believe this. Why would you want to be one of the time's most visible comedians, disappear off the earth, and then start pushing "conspiracy theories?" Him being CIA disinfo is far more believable than that. And with Alex Jones in the public view for 20 years, you think someone would've confirmed that beyond a doubt by now...

               Yea i was saying how it seems pretty convenient that he got such a prominent limelight and its like hes been supported the whole way through.. and so much more.. 
And yea im just gona have to go ahead and disagree with you there on the whole HIcks/AJ thing,  no hard feelings.. :)
we could question his motives and why he might do such a seemingly odd thing.. but it still wont stop me from knowing its him. 
WHY are half the most famous female actresses really born males.. we can see the evidence in this video and only ask why..
The video evidence speaks for itself, as does the evidence of Hicks/AJ been the same person once i saw all the evidence i was convinced. but i could be totally wrong of course.
Pardon the flat earth reference in the title, its not about that.. (move along now, there is something to see here, but now is not the time or place for THAT)

             OK, so if he's lying about the facts surrounding pizzagate, for whatever reason, then at the very least can we agree to use the many other sources INSTEAD for our pizzagate info and advice? This just seems so obvious to me.

              Absolutely agreed, 100%. Alex Jones was never the main source for pizzagate, and he won't be. He's just thrust himself in the middle of the situation after being silent for months for reasons we've all speculated on. I mean, I'm pretty sure he's not even up on the shipping company connections, based on his two recent "reports," why rely on someone who isn't onto months old information?
             </p>
             <p>
              My big thing is to not throw the baby out with the bathwater he's pissed in, because there's still value there. Him talking about the rest of the pedogate links is reason enough for that.

             We all have a right to our opinions.. Ive never had a high opinion of Bill/Alex even tho ive defended him sometimes in the past.. I recognise his MO.. Hes in it for the fame and money mostly I feel.. Even when he was Hicks it was never to help us.. He always ranted about how fucked we were and how corrupt govt was screwing us.. And hes only done the same since then as AJ, exactly the same were screwed ranting and never offering solutions. That's my take on him.. Its never really changed much.

             For Alex's sake I hope he is ok but I agree with you that I think it looks a lot more like he was threatened, or his kids held at ransom for like an hour or something.

             I think the anger, at least for me was he did this the day before the March in DC, he then went on again and called internet researchers basically trolls and lastly, it insults our intelligence that JA is innocent. As you said, JA is one of the DCs most powerful people. As a Pizza owner? Really? How is he so powerful?
            </p>
            <p>
             But at least he did say Pedogate is REAL and I think focus should be back on Clinton Foundation, CGI and MediaMatters.

              I agree that the anger from this statement coming right before the march, which was definitely intentional. The question was, whose will was it that forced the statement the day before the march? Alex Jones will or the demands of a lawsuit/settlement potentially leveraged against him?
             </p>
             <p>
              I agree with you on it being completely fucky that one of the 50 most powerful men in DC is "a pizza place owner." I don't believe that's all he is either, otherwise he wouldn't have enough money or influence to scare Alex Jones into bending the knee until the rally was over. It was an intentional push for Alefantis to clear his name in combination with the 60 Minutes episode.
             </p>
             <p>
              Him saying pedogate is real and pointing out everyone else who is connected to this scandal is a big indicator, to me, that it was Alefantis's people specifically that threatened him. Personally, I think pizza places are connected and used for money laundering, but the biggest leads are likely to be shipping companies. Most the big child trafficking arrests have happened in port cities and George Soros inherited a shipping company from Paul Soros.

               I totally agree about the shipping companies. I researched that 4-5 months ago. Saw some YT vid (wish I saved it) where a guy talks about he worked at unloading. There were two separate ports and the ship would give a "signal" (coded word) for special cargo. They would dock in the further port and were checked by customs by a paid off group.
              </p>
              <p>
               He said they would dock in the evenings, undcover of night and the smell of the cargo was horrid. Some kids make it and some don't. All kids would be drugged so they were quiet. It was horrible. Not sure what they did with the bodies that didn't make it. I'm sure the vid is scrapped by now too.

             The reasons for Alex's treason are unimportant.  Every man has a choice to make whether he will bow before evil or die fighting for humanity.

              That's your opinion, and I respect it. I believe InfoWars has been redpilling people for years on years, and losing Alex Jones would be a net loss. If he chickens out, my gut says pizzagate is onto something bigger and more provable than most things he's ever talked about, so much bigger that people would do whatever they could to stop him from parroting the true message.
             </p>

              We are very lucky we have many other journalists rising in this age of free information, people who do the real footwork to prove their points instead of rebroadcasting from a studio with guest speakers and researchers doing the work for him. But Alex still plays a part in information broadcasting. I'm not willing to write him off yet, but I'm taking his info with slightly more salt than I used to.

            I have Alex Jone's back, I have David Seaman's back, I have HoneyBee's back, I have Titus Frost's back, I have Mike Cernovich's back, I'm not gonna sit around and attack them. Alex Jones should not have apologized to James Alefantis and he clearly hasn't done enough research on him if he truly thinks he's innocent. I don't care if David Seaman is using PizzaGate to increase his position as a journalist, this is the biggest story since 911, you would have to be a complete idiot to do anything else. And everyone accuses him of that, and it only reinforces the fact that pizzagate is real, because why would anyone try to increase their publicity on reporting something that is completely fake, that would ruin your reputation completely. David Seaman is his own person with his own mind, he doesn't deserve to be attacked, and in the end he is doing a lot of good for the world.

             I would never defend any asshole who calls all the PGers "online trolls."  Even IF you believe he was threatened with a lawsuit (I assure you, he wasn't), there is no excuse for that.

             Ever set foot in a courtroom?  CREDIBILITY OF THE WITNESS is everything.  EVERY source must be scrutinized with a critical eye.  We can't afford to have "turds in the punchbowl" if our goal is to wake people up.
