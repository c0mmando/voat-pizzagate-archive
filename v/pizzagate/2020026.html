<h2>2013 article:  &quot;Was Sir Jimmy Savile an MI5 Asset?&quot;</h2>
<p>This is an interesting article that discusses the inter-workings of child sex slavery, blackmail, Jimmy Savile, MI5, royalty, government, and the Cabal.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Child abuse campaigner <a href="http://archive.is/wpQel">Charles Frith</a> intelligently answers the question was Jimmy Savile an MI5 asset in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Of course Sir Jimmy Savile was an M15 Asset.  But what is M15?  how does it function? and what is its purpose?</p>
<p>M15, known as Five, is the UK security Service supposed to operate entirely within the UK.  
</p>
<p>One of their functions is to Vet people who may be given Security Clearance to view UK Secrets. That is <strong>secrets MI5 and the people who run the UK part of the international intelligence organization believe it is in their own interests to keep secret.</strong>  And or <strong>otherwise MI5 propagate the fiction that  they have enemies from whom secrets must be kept.</strong> One secret they want to securely keep is that <strong>the main enemy and prime target for MI5 is the British Public.</strong></p>
<p>Yes <strong>Jimmy Savile was vetted by MI5 and given top clearance, he could be trusted to keep the secrets</strong> of the Police, Special Branch, MI5. the Royal Family, and Politicians like Margaret Thatcher, Peter Morrison and Leon Brittain and others.  <strong>Savile was a rampant peadophile who exploited and procured children for the child sex trade and porn network.</strong>  Sir Jimmy Savile was also famous and worked for the State funded and <strong>totally corrupt  media propaganda arm of the security and intelligence services the BBC.</strong></p>
<p>The Telegraph revealed that files show the BBC\'s has secret links with the Security Service, and at one stage MI5 was responsible for vetting 6,300 different BBC posts - almost a third of the total workforce.   All these attributes meant <strong>Jimmy Savile was totally under control and a perfect fully vetted intelligence asset.</strong></p>
<p>The overall function of MI5 is to control the internal population, that is anyone living in the UK. They must prevent this \'internal enemy\'  from causing trouble  to their masters. Their fictional Master is the  UK Democratic Government and the high flying group of highly paid civil servants who allegedly support them. <strong>Their real masters are the elite behind the Central Banks and global big business.</strong>  Their Masters business involves arms sales and development, mineral extraction such as gold, diamonds, gas and oil. Their Masters are big landowners and run the lucrative covert organised crime businesses of Drugs, Arms and <strong>Pornography.</strong> </p>
<p>One secret the Police and  MI5 must prevent the British public finding out is that they now function as a secret arm of this  global criminal organization and their original function of protecting the Realm and the public has long passed.  How do they keep this from innocent insiders and the public who pay them?</p>
<p>Officially it goes something like this, MI5 is the Political arm of the \'Security Services\' they liaise through a group called BOX with, what used to be called, Special Branch, the political wing of the Civil Police.  This is the open structure.</p>
<p>Secretly the civil police work closely with the MI5 and  police officers, in the know,  are often seconded to MI5 and visa versa. [...]</p>

            Yes he was an "asset," there is no denying that.. Someone signed off on his security clearance so there will be a paper trail. He was used in their entrapment schemes.

            I remember that skit, but I walked out of the room and was I mad when I saw it discussed on here.  I hate that show now, they are filthy and disgusting.  They were funny years ago.  Now they are joking about Robot Pedo's? Pathetic.

             The author linked to it in the first sentence, the Charles Frith article.  Frith mentions The Telegraph investigation that revealed MI5 vetted BBC employees, of which Savile was one.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many mentions of this online, since Savile was found to be a pedo.  Why did he pass security vetting?  And why didn't he get arrested for pedophilia?
            </p>
            <p>
             As for "top" clearance, I think they are referring to numerous family holidays spent with Prime Minister Thatcher, "unfettered" access to the Royal Family, etc., he was someone Britain's most important people could "trust."
            </p>
            <p>
             I have even read he was an advisor to elite corporations.  It's all bizarre and horrible.
            </p>
            <p>

             <strong>
              EDIT
             </strong>
             to add:
            </p>
            <p>
             A 1990 article reprinted in The Independent mentions Jimmy Savile's bizarre level of influence (he died in 2011, two days before Halloween):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              [people] imagine that because Savile is charitable he is also unworldly. He isn’t.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Many businesses and organisations use him as a conduit to the Royal Family; he can pick up the telephone to most of them
              </strong>
              and has long worked with Prince Charles (“the most caring fellow I’ve ever met – oh, unbelievable”) on the problems of the disabled. He is
              <strong>
               an habitué of Highgrove and Buckingham Palace, of No 10 and Chequers, where he often spends Christmas or New Year
              </strong>
              – though he carefully points out that he has been friendly with all the past four Prime Ministers because Stoke Mandeville is Chequers’ local hospital.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, he is very, very well connected;
              <strong>
               many multinationals use him as a consultant and not just for PR purposes but for marketing advice.
              </strong>
              To the public, he remains the silver-haired, track-suited jester, but those who have worked with him take him very seriously indeed.

             Exactly.  There had to have been/has to be others doing what Savile did, who are still alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             TPTB-media want people to think he was just a man with a unique predatory madness and connections to the elite, but I speculate it was just his IC job and a role he was playing, and that he had more control over his deviance than it seems.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, there are probable a dozen or more people in the West who have the same IC asset child sex slave procurer role.  I wonder who else is one aside from Jeffrey Epstein.

            Savile was suppose to be Knighted by Prince Charles.  Thee was such an uproar it did not happen.  Also I believe that he was a procurer for the Royals and British Elites.  He also made many visits to Haute de la Garenne on Jersey Isle.  This was written about and is a horrible horrible story. Here is an article for Newcomers and those that need to refresh their memories.

             Horrible man.  But actually he was knighted way back in 1990.  After he died in 2011 people called for it to be taken away, but apparently the knighthood only applies when someone is living.

              Well now we know why it was not rescinded.   The forfeiture committee – whose members include the cabinet secretary, the top civil servant at the Home Office, the top lawyer at the Treasury and the top official in the Scottish government – made the decision to recommend the removal Goodwin's knighthood. The Queen has the sole authority to rescind a knighthood, after taking advice from the committee. A THOUGHT:  They said that the honor ends when the person dies.  Well, isn't that just ducky.  Those poor survivors of Savile's heinous acts have to live with the fact that he was rewarded with Knighthood for raping them. Lovely.

              Drats!  I thought they succeeded.  There were some really horrible charges out of Thailand I believe that created the whole stink. I believe him to be the worst if not one of the worst British pedophiles. Thanks for the link.  Thanks for letting me know.  I am sad:(

            Probably the Mi5, Scotland Yard or MI6 had dirt of socialists, connections and spies in the IRA Irish terrorists, info on Communists, the Jewish Zealots, the Paki Afghan warlords and slavers, Royalty, Political elite you name it....and probably un-willing to give it up and not willing to expose these peoples because of leverage or some weird behind the scenes deal...if you think the CIA is corrupt as fuck...well they basically copy what those corrupt gayass weird criminal spy agency and secret society were doing in Europe etc for decades before them.
