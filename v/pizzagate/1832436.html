Buck use to mean The word for &quot;male goat&quot; in Old English was bucca or gatbucca (see buck (n.)) until late 1300s shift to he-goat, she-goat (Nanny goat is 18c., billy goat 19c.). Meaning &quot;licentious man&quot; is attested from 1670s (hence goat-milker, name of a bird formerly believed to suck the milk from goats at night, but also old slang for &quot;a prostitute,&quot; also &quot;the female pudendum&quot;). To get (someone\'s) goat is from 1910, American English, perhaps from French prendre sa chèvre &quot;take one\'s source of milk,&quot; or more likely with notion of &quot;to steal a goat mascot&quot; from a racehorse, warship, fire company, military unit, etc. Here is the link to the dictionary so you can read it for yourself.

The adjective of camp is Camp (adj) tasteless,&quot; 1909, homosexual slang, of uncertain origin, perhaps from mid-17c. French camper &quot;to portray, pose&quot; (as in se camper &quot;put oneself in a bold, provocative pose&quot;); popularized 1964 by Susan Sontag\'s essay &quot;Notes on Camp.&quot; Campy is attested from 1959.

            Somebody posted on this 3 or 4 months back.  If I remember correctly, there was a video out there of a chicken hawk (adult gay male) takes young boy (young buck)  fishing and camping to sexually abuse. That's what happens often with Boy Scouts and perv scout masters going for camping/fishing trips.

             Pizzagate is based on Daily Mail article 2010 that ties Laura Silsby to Alifantis through Max Maccoby. Silsby smuggled 33 children in Hailti from Friends of The Orphans - an orphanage that was run bu Max Maccoby - a lawyer who represented Alifantis &amp; Brock in $850 000 blackmail case. PG is also based on Wikileaks emails where pedophile codes were used - reference to pizza out of context - hence the moniker Pizzagate. Very big similarities to the Page Gate (2006 involving Republicans - Hasterd, Mark Folly Jack Abrahms, and our buddy Jefrrey Epstein and a pedo island of Guam in the Marianas). Alifantis case is very similar to the Dutreux case - an obscure pizza joint owner listed as 49th power player in DC who owns 15 properties. Dutreux - unemployed guy owned 6 homes
Nobody is laughing here in Australia. It is even bigger and scarier than any of us imagined.

            The name of the restaurant is intended to mimic a New York restaurant that  became famous as a place that felt you were no longer in NYC. -- Mary's Fish Camp.  This restaurant  was very successful with lines down the block when it opened.  It is well known in the food world for high end food in a very relaxed atmosphere. It also was known for letting the ingredients shine through, not over futzing with the manin dish.   Similar to what Carole Greenwood was going for with her restuarnat.  She was the chef/pwner of the restaurant that became Buck's Fishing and Camping and describes the restaurant as a "campground."  The menu is seafood heavy and is cooked over a wood fire and is known for being local and seasonal like Mary's.  Greenwood would have had approval over the name and would have vetoed it if it didn't make sense as a restaurant name.

             Also... it's branding itself as a hip, upscale restaurant and quirky names are normal and expected in that field. Look at the top Michelin-starred restaurants in English speaking countries and those that aren't named for the owner or head chef will often have some whimsical name such as "Grace" or "The Fat Duck" or "The French Laundry".
            </p>
            <p>
             Heck, even the suburban mall parking lot chain restaurants often get in on this when they want to market themselves as upscale. "The Olive Garden" isn't a garden store or olive bar, it's a bad Italian restaurant that spends zillions of dollars advertising itself as a fancy place with Tuscan-trained chefs and so on. "Red Robin" isn't a birdcage-heavy pet store, it's a burger joint that will have you know its burgers are "gourmet". Why would a restaurant be called "Comet Ping Pong"? Well, why would a restaurant be called "Ruby Tuesday"?

            Campy and fishy is widely used in drag culture.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A type of traditional, over-the-top drag. Campy queens usually don't intend to be a female impersonator, they're traditional, original, &amp; over-the-top.

            <p>
             adj. A term used to describe a drag queen who looks extremely feminine, or one who convincingly resembles a biological woman. The term is a reference to the scent of a woman's vagina, which is colloquially likened to the smell of fish. Although the term is considered to be a compliment among Drag Queens, it is often considered to be an insult among biological women.
