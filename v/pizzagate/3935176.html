             Not sure at the moment, something just seems way too convenient about pinning it on him.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, why on earth keep a parcel addressed to her in the car?
            </p>
            <p>
             Was he in a FedEx uniform when they found him, and if so, does that really confirm it was him?
            </p>
            <p>
             To top it all off, looking at what he claims the FBI told him, it seems woefully inconsistent for him to then take on the role of malicious stranger at the door...
