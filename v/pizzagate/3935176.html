<p>On his website, Roy Den Hollander described himself as an &quot;anti-feminist&quot; lawyer who defended &quot;men\'s rights.&quot; His personal writings and life\'s work reveal a toxic stew of sexist and racist bigotry.</p>
<p>He had unsuccessfully filed lawsuits against bars and night clubs offering &quot;ladies\' nights,&quot; claiming they violate the 14th Amendment, and he filed suits against the federal government, challenging the constitutionality of its Violence Against Women Act -- the &quot;Female Fraud Act,&quot; as he referred to it -- and against Columbia University, for its Women\'s Studies program.</p>
<p>Federal authorities on Monday said Den Hollander is suspected of shooting the husband and son of US District Judge Esther Salas at her North Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The FBI called Den Hollander the &quot;primary subject,&quot; and said he is dead. Two law enforcement sources told CNN that the suspect died of what is believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attorney penned lengthy documents filled with bigoted and sexist content on his website. One document, which he called a &quot;Cyclopedia,&quot; is 152 pages of anti-feminist musings.</p>
<p>In the so-called &quot;Evolutionarily Correct Cyclopedia,&quot; Den Hollander made chilling remarks about &quot;solutions&quot; to what he called &quot;Political Commies&quot; and feminists.</p>

             Not sure at the moment, something just seems way too convenient about pinning it on him.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, why on earth keep a parcel addressed to her in the car?

            <p>
             Was he in a FedEx uniform when they found him, and if so, does that really confirm it was him?

             To top it all off, looking at what he claims the FBI told him, it seems woefully inconsistent for him to then take on the role of malicious stranger at the door...

              It's all very sketchy. Not sure what to think yet. Interesting to watch and see what else is uncovered. Too high profile for it to just be a mad guy with a grudge.

              I agree about the package, unless he wanted people to know it was him...what was in package? Also, pretty convenient she was in basement. A Judge with no cameras?
