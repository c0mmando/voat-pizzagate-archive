             Actually say that very poster printed in the Civil Police station I was in after I punched the italian dude in the face. (he was with a child, too touchy for me, I knocked out his teeth)

            <p>
             I pointed out that the ice cream company has a LOGO that is identical to the heart in heart...they just looked at me like...huh?
