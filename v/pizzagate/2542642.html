            I think it's relavent to point out that since 9/11 Frontline ceased being an outlet of trustworthy investigative journalism and became a propaganda spigot. Literally everything they broadcast is deceptive. Just saying.

            I despise pedos. They deserve to be hung. However, the charge of pedophilia requires the victim to be under the age of 13. Otherwise they are minors or underage, which is a charge of statutory rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is surprising to me about this story is MSM is pointing out child marriage is still legal in most states. The pedo problem is so deep into the system. We need to start with the cops and judges before we can start get them out out positions of power. Then we can get the laws we need to pass.

            Dammit, shame on Vermont.  We are supposed to be the conscience of the Nation.  I call upon all loyal Woodchucks to go and ask their so-called "representatives" how fucking flatlanders beat us to the punch.

            More generally, though, shouldn't the marriage laws conform to the statutory rape laws?  If someone's not old enough to agree to a legal contract, they shouldn't be able to get married; since marriage is, yunno,
            <em>
             the most sacred of contracts
            </em>
            .  But if two 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds or some combination of 16 and 17 want to marry each other, then if the parents give their blessing, so be it, long as they can get divorced just as easy and there ain't a stigma attached to it.

            Eh, yes and no. The most successful marriages I have personally witnessed (still married and own the farm at a late stage of life, with pretty good health at 70 to 80+) are when kids get married between 14 to 18, usually closer together in age group in the country. Rich people that marry young just spread wealth, as they are both gold diggers. Natural laws dictate that older people and younger people are attracted to each other for various psychological reasons. In rural USA it is encouraged to marry young for good reasons. After 25 there can be serious health risks in women and babies. Marriage is a legal contract and is not binding for general baby making or sex procured by any nefarious means. I am not saying that the laws in each State are perfect, and without loopholes, but I am against that house bill.  If your precious widdle girl got knocked up by the clumsy kid next door ages(?), would you (A) have your neighbor cut his nuts off and go to prison, (B) abort mission, (C) steal the kid and  ...(D) fake ID,  (E) kill the young man, or (F )Shotgun wedding?

              14 and 15, still married, and lots of gran and great children. Yes they may have been coerced in certain manners common to Christian communities of the time, but I believe it was a good thing, or turned out to be a good thing. Talk to really old people and you will understand. Some of them are still alive.

             There is a fucking difference between a shotgun wedding and a freaking pedo using the law to his advantage...kids go ahead and marry away your pregnancy secrets fine but dont DARE compare that situation to a freaking grown ass man using this to avoid the stigma and jail time that goes with being a pedophile. Its sad that those things are literally washed away by a marriage licence!! SHAME SHAME SHAME!

              I agree, I think. The law is the law, and we all agree to the law. Complainants still must abide so. You are the second one to insinuate me of somehow siding with pedos, even as I point out why it happens in society, and in legalized terms. I believe in the original Constitution of the United States before the War of Northern Aggression. For those who do not understand, that means the States have the right to determine what is the correct path for their civilians. States often copy policies that are successful. Feel free to tell how I mixed up facts though.

            This is because girls with teen pregnancies need to marry baby daddy and parents are allowed to give permission for girls to marry. How many people do you know who got pregnant in their teens? I know a lot. But yes, it should still be illegal if it's with a pedo.

             My parents lived and were married in Europe at 18 and 19 and people say all the time that things were different there and kids got married younger.  None of my relatives got married younger than that.  I think a lot of people marry someone way younger for sex abuse or for a slave.  This makes slavery legal.  We still have slavery in this country.  It is bad enough we had and have black slaves for centuries, but now we have them all colors.  Shameful beyond words.

              I had ancestors who married very young, even in the 20th century. One pair of great great grandparents seem to have even lied on census records about their ages. Probably lied to whoever married them too. They both stayed married into old age and raised a ton of kids, even some grandkids that one of their kids wasn’t raising. My best guess is that my great great grandma was somewhere around 14-16 when she married.

               Well, having kids  should not be a deciding factor.  Many of these girls  that were forced to marry by their parents were bought with a dowry.  Thus poorer parents were happy to sell off their daughters.  Many men wanted younger girls so they could have boys to work on the farm. Hopefully people are smarter these days since many want to keep their daughters and sons at home and not have them talked into marrying by and adult that is a good talker and groomer.  Young children are not experienced enough to realize what these groomers are really after.  I am not saying this was true for your grandparents, but women and girls were looked at differently in those days.  They were second class citizens and shamed if not married by 20 and called spinsters at an early age.

                Of course women were looked at differently, it was before feminism. Men worked outside generally and women worked inside and made babies, and that was not only normal but considered ideal and natural. The whole thing about arranged marriages is a separate issue, though I don’t like the idea of anyone marrying against their will.
               </p>
               <p>
                So my only point is if there are two rednecks in Kentucky or wherever, who are, say, 18 and 16 (like President Andrew Johnson and his wife when they married), and they want to marry, and her parents consent, I don’t see any reason in making this illegal just because some genuine perverts take advantage of the laws and marry 10 year olds. Granted, even 20 year old girls today are often dumb as bricks and not ready for responsibilities, let alone teenagers. But marriage before adolescence should be outlawed, full stop.

               Yeah, this article can leave your head scratching for sure.  Whenever you have anything they are trying to change you have to wonder what is really behind it.  It is true that too many poor people which are mostly black and brown are arrested for marijuana possession, but I have wondered too, that the pedo elite are wanting to legalize it so that pedos cannot be charged when using it on children.  They are really smart when it comes to changing laws to benefit their crimes.

            Upvoat!  That picture makes me want to throw up.  I did a post on this I think before, thank you so much for keeping this in the forefront.  We really don't post enough about this.  I am so happy to hear about Delaware passing this bill, which is surprising because Delaware and Connecticut are both Cesspools.  Also I believe that's where Biden lives.  Ugh.  I have to get the pic out of my mind before bedtime.

             Irony so thick you could cut it with a knife. Dont forget that this is also the state with one of the most horrendous cases being that demon doctor. Boggles the mind that this is the first state to do this and yet still letting these acts go on with little or no jail time for the villans!
