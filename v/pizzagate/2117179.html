<p>I was interested to see the following quote at the bottom of the page:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tam Dalywell of the House of Commons had this to say, &quot;This is garbage from right-wing think tanks stuffed with chickenhawks, men who have never seen the horror of war but are in love with the idea of war.  Men like Cheney, who were draft-dodgers in the Vietnam war.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s spelled  Dalyell, not DalyWell,  but aside from that  the word  <strong><em>chickenhawks</em></strong>  stood out.</p>
<p>Chickenhawks is a traditional name from his era referring to kiddy diddlers, or boy lovers. Considering  that period of time the Franklin Scandal stink was still in the air, and later project flicker shows the investigation  of  \'<em>chickenhawks</em>  was quietly and discreetly dumped. </p>
<p>Dalyell was describing American politicians when his own house of commons has  a lot of information supporting UK political chickenhawks.</p>
<p>He died in Jan 2017 so unfortunately no interview can be held to ask for details.</p>
<p>The use of the  word  Chickenhawks supports c.p. with the US congress. 
Any thoughts on this? <br />
Did anyone during that era come forward and question Dalywell when he was alive?  Any UK members on board who might know or have access to this?  
</p>
<p>**This is important because it could show a member of UK parliament attesting to chickenhawks within the US senate, specifically in association with Dick Cheney\'s name.
Potential for U.K. dig into material. **</p>',

            : I am giving this an "Accuracy in Question" flair. Dad was a chopper pilot in Vietnam and a "chickenhawk" is NOT a "chickenlover". It's someone who sends other people out to fight and die and doesn't risk his own hide. It's a common term in military circles, especially among the guys being sent out to risk their butts by ringknockers and other officers who've never been under fire.

             You've assumed a definition.  How are you sure?
             <br/>
             American politics is full of men who could be classified under both definitions, based on military action and Franklin Scandal issues.

             Thanks for the ping, but afraid I am not familiar with Tam Dalyell - I see Vindicator mentiones that -  chicken hawk is not equal to chickenlover, but according to the 2nd definition on dictionary.com it is:- chicken hawk - 1. Also called hen hawk. (not used scientifically) any of various hawks said to prey on poultry. - 2. Slang. an older man who seeks out young boys as sexual partners. - Sorry I was not more help guys. - Not that I disagree with Vindicator about its true meaning, it probably did start out as meaning 'It's someone who sends other people out to fight and die and doesn't risk his own hide'.

              Well if you take the term literally, as in chickenlover, it may be a problem.  BUT.  I think I have seen that chicken hawk is a term more used in the UK.  You know, as there are certain things that we share but have different meanings.  There can be a small "slang" change and still mean the same. I think I saw the term used with Saville, but don't quote me.

               Looks like they may have stolen the term 'chickenhawk' from USA Air Force, as this pilot, Robert Mason wrote a book called Chickenhawk, nothing to do with paedophilia, its about his experiences as a helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War.

             Project for the New American Century (PNAC): Cheney's Monstrous Scheme
            </p>
            <p>
             By Mary Louise
            </p>
            <p>
             The blueprint for our current foreign policy was being written back in 1992 by then-Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney.  His writings set out a new doctrine that called for U.S. power in the twentieth century, to be that of an aggressive and unilateral approach that would secure American dominance of world affairs by force if necessary.  This "peace through strength" policy has been unfolding from the day Bush, Jr. took office; the strategic planning of it was done during the Clinton administration with funding from the military-industrial complex, energy companies, and right-wing foundations.  Over time, those working on these new plans evolved into PNAC, established in 1997 with members Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz at the helm.  May God help us!
            </p>
            <p>
             In September 2000, the PNAC updated and refined Cheney's original version into a new report entitled: "Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources for a New Century" calling for unprecedented hikes in military spending, American military bases in Central Asia and Middle East, toppling of non-complying regimes, abrogation of international treaties, control of the world's energy sources, militarization of outer space, total control of cyberspace, and the willingness to use nuclear weapons to achieve "American" goals.  This plan by the neo-conservative or neo-con think tank, PNAC, shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control whether or not Saddam Hussein was in power and says the U.S. for decades has sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security, revealing that a premeditated attack on Iraq to secure a regime change was planned even before Bush took power in January, 2001.  The lengthy blueprint for U.S. global domination can be accessed at

             In order to truly understand how despicable and repulsive Cheney and his schemes actually are, we must revisit the past before we continue.  A CFR member; Cheney was Chief of Staff to Gerald Ford, Secretary of Defense to George Herbert Bush, and Wyoming's only Congressman.  There is a hunting lodge near Greybull, Wyoming where Dickie Dearest was obsessed with "A Most Dangerous Game" (human hunting) and addicted to the thrill of the sport of traumatizing his victims while satisfying his sick perversions.  Although this "game" was devised to condition military personnel in survival and combat maneuvers, it was used on Cathy O'Brien and other slaves as a means to further conditioning of the mind to the realization there was no place to hide, as well as traumatization for ensuing programming.  According to Cathy, this game had numerous variations on the primary theme of being stripped of clothing, turned loose in wilderness areas which were enclosed in secure military fencing, and hunted by men and dogs until caught, raped, and tortured.  This is our Vice President! (Editors note - we'd like to make it clear that these allegations are just that, allegations, and are not proven by anything more than testimony).
            </p>
            <p>
             There is much more to Cathy's sad but true story of being a CIA mind-controlled slave that she has so bravely informed us of on

Warning: the content will make you furious and ill, but at least you will know the hidden, dark, dreadful, and hideous side of these monsters who have seized power according to their plan.

             We are witnessing the Trance-Formation of our great Country from one that stood for freedom, justice, refuge from oppression, and an opportunity for a better life based on principles worth dying for (as many did), to the new emerging American Empire reminiscent of the Roman Empire.  The movies "The Fall of the Roman Empire" and "Quo Vadis" with Robert Taylor and Peter Ustinov are definitely worth watching.  It is difficult for the average, decent person to imagine or believe what unscrupulous and ruthless people do and how they think.  Americans need to ask the hard questions that the press usually avoid, and connect the dots for themselves.  If we are told to jump off a cliff, should we do it?  Of course not.  But if we do not stand up for what is good, lovely, and true we will surely be dragged along down the long and dark, shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.  We must diligently question and resist the immorality of this new policy of endless war with an endless budget, provided for by putting the squeeze on hardworking taxpayers who are also expected to sacrifice their own cherished offspring as toy soldiers in their end wargame, on the altar of bloody sacrifices.  World politics are a chessboard upon which tyrants insanely intoxicated with power, play people like pawns of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
             Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer recently wrote, " The fact is no country has been as dominant culturally, economically, technologically, and militarily in the history of the world since the Roman Empire."   He is one of the voices or opinion leaders demanding pre-emptive action, calling for the USA to reject its Constitutional heritage proclaiming itself the heir to the Roman Empire and who is part of a small but well financed policy faction calling themselves neo-conservatives.  How does that grab you?  The New American Empire or Pax-Americana, a world order enforced by U.S. power controlled by Cheney and the gang, who make the Mafia and the Roman Empire look like altar boys.  Cheney and Bush's doctrine essentially declares that anyone who gets in the way will suffer the threatened consequences.  This strategy of permanent war abroad, will result in a permanent domestic state of emergency which means a permanent state of siege for all Americans.  In this devilish pursuit of world conquest in the name of U.S. interests, Bush is acting under strategic policy that demands the continuous demonstration of a universal American "right" to impose its will on Planet Earth.

             Mankind's ability to see is in decline, as part of the de-sensitizing conditioning that has been perpetrated upon us.  People in this changing world landscape, need to regain the capacity to perceive the visible reality as it actually is.  Because there is so much to see, something like visual noise makes clear perception near impossible when our lives are in fast forward to a warp-speed operational tempo that offers no opportunity for reflection.  With media manipulation and perception management at work, those who cannot see reality are also unable to hear correctly, therefore falling prey to the demagogical spells, sophistries, and pandering of any powers that be.  Deeper comprehension or cognition is required for sharper discernment.  Our essence of inner richness as spiritual beings, is the ability to grasp reality with intense awareness.  Human nature itself is threatened and the integrity of human existence is directly endangered.  There are no technical solutions to moral problems; when a country ceases to be good, it ceases to be great.

             PNAC, the monsterchild of Dick Cheney speaks with forked tongue regarding the "new manifest destiny of the new American frontier" to disseminate our liberty and values.  The Bush administration has brazenly launched an all-out assault against our civil liberties using fear tactics while trying to hide the fact that weapons were supplied by the U.S. to our "enemies".  Tam Dalywell of the House of Commons had this to say, "This is garbage from right-wing think tanks stuffed with chickenhawks, men who have never seen the horror of war but are in love with the idea of war.  Men like Cheney, who were draft-dodgers in the Vietnam war."   Cheney is depicted in the related following animated satire that is a spin-off of the Twilight Zone called the No-Fly Zone:

            <p>
             The PNAC intends to explain what world leadership entails through issue briefs, advocacy journalism, conferences, and seminars.  Also, the "Committee for the Liberation of Iraq" is setting up offices on Capitol Hill, which appears to be a front group spin-off from PNAC and its mission statement is to replace the Saddam Hussein regime with a democratic government, engaging in educational and advocacy efforts to mobilize the U.S. and international support for their policies.  The Project for a New American Century, www.newamericancentury.org, is an initiative of the New Citizenship Project (501c3).
