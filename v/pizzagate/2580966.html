            A psychiatrist administers drugs to people based on a handbook, and still has a DR. attached to his/her last name. I can understand a Criminal Psychologist being related to a case though. Paralegals must die because they know everything.

             A grudge holding serial killer.

           <h1>
            Suspect in 6 Arizona killings never got over his divorce
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dwight Lamon Jones apparently never put his bitter divorce behind him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Almost eight years after splitting from his wife, the Phoenix-area man began confronting people connected with the breakup and shooting them, killing six people in four days last week before ending his own life as police drew near, authorities said.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far, investigators have been unable to determine a precise motive for the shootings, but they say three of the victims were directly tied to the divorce — a forensic psychiatrist who testified about Jones' mental health and two paralegals who worked for the law firm that represented the suspect's wife.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other victims included a marriage counselor who was apparently targeted in a case of mistaken identity and another man and woman whose ties to Jones have not been made public.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The first person he killed was a forensic psychiatrist who testified on his wife's behalf that he was "a danger to his wife, his child and himself" because he suffered from "anxiety and mood disorders."
           </p>
           <p>
            He then went after his wife's lawyer. The lawyer wasn't there, but he killed two paralegals in the office.  The fourth person was not involved in his divorce, but his was in the same office space of someone who was.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Police cornered Dwight Lamon Jones, 56, Monday morning in an extended stay hotel in Scottsdale where they had tracked him. As police cleared surrounding rooms before making the arrest, Jones fired seven or eight of shots at officers, Slavin said.
"The gunfire stopped, and they methodically moved forward, clearing carefully, ensuring that they were safe," Slavin said. "And eventually in this action they found that Mr. Jones had killed himself, self-inflicted gunshot wound."

              How do we even know if that guy is really dead.  And how do we know that they have the right guy in jail for the Baseline Killings.  Another cover up maybe?  Maybe Pitt was starting to connect things.  Maybe the Baseline Killer and Jon Benet Killer were connected and the serial killer in jail is taking the wrap for some elite or part of a pedophile ring.  Either way there is something rotten being cooked up in Phoenix.

               Scottsdale is in line with the Satanic HWY system. I still can't find the link, but it is pretty obvious when you drive around like a trucker.

                I know about the Satanic Hwy.  Wow.  Here we go again.  You can't make this stuff up.  I think Tucson is becoming one of those controlled places.  They are popping up all over now.  They are working furiously now.  Could be we are finding things way to fast.

                 Scottsville was one of the originals when the Satanic HWY was very smallsville. There is also the one in Virginia with a very interesting history.

                  Yes, well I was going to post a link but there are so many pieces of this Hwy in so many states.  Virginia Tennessee Utah Arizona California all the way up near San Fran.   I think this was called Route 666 at one point.  They are trying to change the narrative on that.  Hmm.

                   No. I am telling you that there was a site online that had the whole thing (at the time) routed out. I have been doing this waaay before PG. Maybe it could be pulled up from the wayback machine?

                     There was no sinister intent behind numbering the highway 666 in
the 1920s. Yep. Remember that satanist who lived on the 14th floor, but it was really the 13th? Ramirez.

                  How do we even know if that guy is really dead. And how do we know that they have the right guy in jail for the Baseline Killings. Another cover up maybe? Maybe Pitt was starting to connect things. Maybe the Baseline Killer and Jon Benet Killer were connected and the serial killer in jail is taking the wrap for some elite or part of a pedophile ring. Either way there is something rotten being cooked up in Phoenix.

                That was really creepy.  Could not watch all of it.  Creeped me out.  I don't know if he is who they say he is or not and anyone can make up a story as we all to well know.  Yes, sexual assault criminals should pay and be held accountable, but we have to make sure we have the right people

              Great point!!!!!!! Are_we_sure quotes CNN then says it ain't a hitman - this gunman shot those two paralegals in the head; one was possiblely fleeing when hit with a round in the head! That says this gunman can accurately give a head shot with a moving target.... that ain't a guy that couldn't get over a fucking DIVORCE!!! That's a hitman!

               And, what is really unbelievable is that they guy just couldn't get over his divorce from 8 years ago, so he just now decides to start killing people? That's not very typical of how these types of dudes operate!

                Way too MANY  holes in the "official police story". Why shoot and kill two paralegals..instead of the actual attorney that represented the divorce case????????
