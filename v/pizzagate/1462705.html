Some women asked them serious questions like if they want to be with a small boy, then what about when the boy grows up, and that alone caused a huge argument. They were able to exist and grow, because they don\'t have sex, so that\'s the grey area that allowed them to thrive. If anyone can find that video and upload it to youtube, it would help to validate and verify that these groups do exist.

           I need your help. I'm trying to locate a very old video that aired on tv sometime in the 80's or 90's. I think it was The Geraldo Rivera Show (1987-1998).

            Have you ever known such a group before to walk onto a tv talk show, show their faces while holding hands with children, say who they are and what they believe in, then walk away without being charged of any crimes? I'm sure times have changed and at the time they just were in shock and didn't know how to handle it, but that video might help to identify who is at the very top, or who used to be anyway.

            While looking for that, I found a few things.

            Mike Echols ran a sting on a San Francisco pedo group in '92.

            A partial archive of Geraldo Rivera's other show "Now It Can Be Told".  I thought that the pedophile episode may have been here instead, but it's not in this partial archive of the show.  Perhaps it's in one of the unlisted episodes?

             It doesn't exist on the internet at the moment. Someone with everything on VHS or DVD is going to have to dig for it. Then transfer it to the internet.
