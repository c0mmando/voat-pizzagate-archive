           <p>
            Unlike other researchers of child sexual abuse, I have been highly sceptical when it comes to Carl Beech being legit.
           </p>
           <p>
            My first take on him was that he might have been a plant intentionally set up to discredit legit accusers.
           </p>
           <p>
            He clearly lied on several occasions.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you look at his pics - imo it's obivious that he was sexually abused at some point.
           </p>
           <p>
            He first went to the police, and accused his father of abusing him.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they didn't charge his father.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, he went to the police again, this time claiminig he was abused by his father and various powerful people - who all had already been accused by others, or even been convicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might be possible that he did some research on the internet, and made that part up, to gain more attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, although I know that
            <em>
             they
            </em>
            sometimes intentionally put cp on computers of whistleblowers, I think that he really was into child pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw footage of MP Tom Watson, coming forward with the Carl Beech accuations in Parliament, and something just didn't add up. (Just a spider sense feeling.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Nevertheless, sending him to prison for 18 years is outreageous imo. It was clearly done to scare off other accusers.

             <p>
              At Newcastle Crown Court again today at the trial of Carl Beech, as he continues his evidence
             </p>
             <p>
              Wilton Street being the first. Beech says he remembers the name of the street, “it’s where it all started for me”.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Carlton Club” and “yacht” are the next locations.
             </p>
             <p>
              Beech says different drivers would pick him up when he lived in Kingston but he did not engage in conversation - “they didn’t talk to me”.
             </p>
             <p>
              Returning to the yacht, Beech says he couldn’t see the name of the yacht, he can’t recall one. He says it looked like a large yacht, “again, I was small at the time”. He says it was white with three separate cabins.
