            LOL - Millennial Falcon has been a bug up my ass like for fucking ever. He takes down my links, but allows others to post the same links. I don't complain because there's no point. My only hope was that someone would be diligent enough to notice. Thank you poster. I admit sometimes I'll post something that is rule breaking. But this guy is fucking ridiculous. Anyhow thanks to the person who posted this, it shouldn't be up very long. The rest of the posts within the above link were likely deleted by MF and were provided by whoever posted this. Quite the pleasant surprise. I just thought I would joyously comment. I'm more a PG enthusiast /promoter than investigator. My mother died when I was 4 and I endured several years with a family of pedophiles as a youth. My wife doubts PG and asked why nobody came forward. She doesn't understand. I never told anyone until recently. I'm nearly 60 yo.

            thanks for keeping up the fight. your wife is lucky to have you but people who haven't experienced abuse/trauma/corruption don't see it, or understand how severe the impact is. the "get over it" advice is repugnant and cruel. don't get over it, keep speaking up. you may be saving someone else without even knowing.

            In 1972 Kissinger gave the Saudi's a deal they couldn't refuse, white children forever in exchange for saudi only selling their OIL in US Dollars. That deal some 40+ years ago has led to 800,000/year children in USA to go missing and 8 million/year world-wide

            Go back to reddit, dumbfuck. If Peter Thiel were involved, we'd be on him like crack on ass, but he's not. Find legit proof or fuck off.

               Perhaps U can send us a deliverable keyword list of allowed topics or OPS on Pizzagate? I get so confused, it seems tolerance is more based on username than subject line, often I see a post deleted, then another  user posts the exact same link it and doesn't get deleted, what's the secret? what do the bots allow? or not allow? Is there a preferred user list of bots that can post and not get deleted?

                 Now wait, I have seen links posted and deleted, then a few minutes later a user 'friendly' to the mod's the exact same link doesn't get deleted, I have seen this many a times.

                <p>
                 The mods have even said, that when they know a link has a high potential to get a large number of up-voats that only there clique of preferred users should be able to post such links.

                   Well that essentially is the problem. On many occasion I have jumps through the hoops made the changes you requested and reposted. Then 10 minutes later another MOD deletes the post you accepted for another bullshit reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The problem is that every so called "MOD" on
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                    /v/pizzagate
                   </a>
                   while the same person and/or the same BOT programmed by the same owner, all are randomly deleting anything they feel like deleting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now what do you Propose to solve the problem, when a poster meets the requirements of ONE MOD, how can he meet the requirements of ALL mod's, you don't have a "MOD stamp of approval", you seem to have 2-4 hour shifts where different mod's step into for 'duty'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also lots of mods here delete by username, seen that many a times.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm NOT talking about U, I'm talking about all the mod's.

                   ? The only thing I can think is that its all just a psycho game to wear people out and make them quit investigating pizzagate.
