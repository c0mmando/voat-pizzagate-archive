<p>A car which careered off a cliff in California killing a family of eight may have been driven off the highway intentionally, according to police.
The Hart family died after their SUV crashed down on to rocks in the Pacific Ocean in northern California.
Police said they believe the car was stopped by the side of the road before accelerating to as fast as 90mph over the cliff.</p>

            "An entire family vanished and perished during this tragedy," Allman said, though he added that it is still possible Devonte and two other children had been left behind with someone and weren't inside the vehicle.   Left Behind?  He is admitting it is possible they were not in the vehicle.  WOW.

            What if the women were running a stable for someone else’s benefit? They “owner” of these children becomes unhappy with the sloppy manner that these assets are being managed and rolls up the operation. The ladies try to escape with hopes of starting a new child brothel somewhere. The boss catches up to them on the highway, forces them to pull over and hops into their vehicle. He drives the car off the cliff, bailing at the last second.

            A good investigator would wonder where they get their money. How do they pay their rent, feed the kids and maintain their vehicles, etc? Follow the money.. always helpful to do that.

             The PPD riot squad followed the fireworks with a direct and full charge against the protest, which was, as usual, accompanied by a guttural, storm-trooper cry that resonates in one’s bowels and makes one feel like vomiting. Many fleeing from the grenade’s impact and fulguration panicked at the charge, tumbled over one another and created a scene not unlike a stampede. Some may not have anticipated such bellicosity from the Portland Police, who only earlier that morning became the subject of a nationally-disseminated social media meme of an officer hugging a 12-year-old African American child who appeared old beyond his years—particularly not at a voyage christened by Reverend Jessie Jackson’s peaceable rhetoric. But the same officer pictured hugging a child was seen later that evening ramming protesters with a police motorcycle, and Reverend Jackson’s words seemed put to the test in the haze of flares and grenades as the police charged the crowd.

              People that go looking for trouble usually find it. Is there an example of protest or riot effecting social change? Perhaps Rosa Parks, or the Tennemen square guy, but mostly it just seems like violence for violence’s sake and fodder for fake news propaganda.
             </p>
             <p>
              More good could be done with letters to the editor, social charity contributions, literature, heck... even graffiti. I pray I never see someone I care about running around in the streets waving a protest sign trying to get clubbed or gassed by the police.

               What infuriates me is that BLM and some other groups are riling these people up into a frenzy and it only ends up with some of them getting killed, clubbed over the head, tased, or locked up.  Makes me wonder what their real purpose really is.  The truth is that there is such a vicious circle with this stuff nothing ever gets to the point of achievement.  All the money Soros and others have spent on it they could have set up small businesses for these people for jobs.  Yes, you are right there are many other ways to be helpful.  They do not want to give the help that these people really need.

                There are sadly many people out there with empty heads, responding emotionally to everything. When we feed ourselves on accurate knowledge, emotions don’t get sparked by those empty reactions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Right now, people collectively are like an ocean storm, raging and clashing chaotically like waves. Everyone seems to be open to be “triggered” by a comment or idea, and simultaneously seeking the opportunity to “trigger” their “opponents”. There is no shelter from it in the world these days, and so many are mindlessly jumping of the cliff together to go protest in the streets.

                 It happened during the 60's and now they are stirring it all up again.  People don't realize now, just like then.  They are stirring us up again, if we let them.

             Free speech is law of the land but op should take your criticism seriously. This is why i see people complaining of derogitory against other races here. I never saw it before. We can be pro white and leave out the stormer lingo and get a much better reception.

            Seems like a lot more going on in this story.  Were these children being abused?  What connections to child trafficking/welfare orgs are there? It doesn't sound like the truck is new enough to be fully controllable (without being modified), so I doubt it was a hit, but who knows.  Also, how did they fit all those kids in the truck? And 3 weren't found? Where are those 3 kids?

            I can't look at that face of that little boy again.  The one crying while with the policeman.  This whole thing has made me so sick while reading these articles over and over.  I want to know what happened to those children.  I got so upset I could not finish the article.   One thing I feel is that I completely agree that this was not any kind of accident.  One thing that has occurred to me is if those women wanted to take that SUV over that cliff to commit suicide and take the children with them where are the other three children?  Why have they not been found or why is there not a large search for them.  The car could have been controlled as well from another area, as we now is now possible.  Something is not right.

              At this point there is no evidence of anything except this car went over the cliff.  No suicide note left.  But it is a possibility since the tracks left showed that the car was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  So really since these two officers have been connected to a Sex Swapping Op then they possibly could be involved.  But again, there is no proof of that right now, it is only under discussion.

                If you read this report that was featured in the link I sent you, you will get an idea of the corruption in that county.  Most def something nefarious went down with that accident.  That guy Barney pretty much can order anything Carte Blanch in that area.  I kid you not, this is a Controlled Area.

                that ran with this theory and I totally believe it because he posted info about the Sex Swap charges.

              Either they did drive off that cliff at a high rate of speed, with all the children in the car and 3 of them were thrown out and are in the water somewhere, or all children were taken and trafficked  and the women took off and somehow that car was controlled and sent over.  There are other answers, the women could have been taken into that Sex Swap Ring run by the 2 LE Officers and the children were sold off.  Remember that that little boy was in the news quite a bit.  Maybe someone saw those kids and wanted some of them.  We know how that works.  The fact that the 2 officers have been involved in an unsavory business, really puts this in a very different light.

               It is terrible whatever has happened to them. The neighbors tried to help the kids and then that happened. Wonder if it happened because their dark secrets were revealed to the neighbor. That poor kid hugging the cop was crying for reasons no one knew at the time.

                I know.  I can't look at his picture anymore.  I nearly broke down today.  All I could think of is that these kids were used.  They used these kids to get paid to protest and the kids did it out of the goodness in their own hearts.  I have to stay away from this case a couple days.  It is making me sick.

                 Why do children have to suffer like this?  I just wish he would have said something to that officer, maybe everything would have turned out differently. I'm sure they lived in fear and they were told what they could and couldn't say. Makes me sad for them too.

             I suggest you look into the Sherriff and the Coroner of this county.

             Hint&gt; Sherriff ran a Sex Cult and the Coroner is a Grand Mason.

              Look at this what I found:
              <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/12/was-the-ferguson-protest-hug-photo-staged">
               https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/12/was-the-ferguson-protest-hug-photo-staged
              </a>
              I truthfully believe that photo was a set up/staged.  Officer Barnum is not as he seems.  Found this in The Comments:  Just came here to say that Barnum, at this same protest and within hours of this photo, threatened a crowd of protesters with his police motorcycle and then repeatedly ran into one of the protesters before driving through the crowd. I witnessed it personally and it was reported on.   This is back in the news because of the tragedy which has now happened to Devonte and his siblings.     I find this remark shocking.

              I just read this whole article on Heavy and it is so full of more facts.  Brings up so many questions about that car and I read all the comments.  Some were totally stupid racist homophobic stuff.  But so many were spot on.  I just can't let this go.

              Maybe you have already seen it, but I too have to question that someone said they had jobs.  I don't think that is true.  Also they were getting quite a bit of money for adopting those children.  Also, they remind me of the Turpin Family.  Abuse, Home School, Keeping Kids Inside, Children Skinny Parents Well Fed.
