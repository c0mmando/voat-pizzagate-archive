<p><em>Lucifer\'s Lodge</em> by William H. Kennedy is a highly disturbing book detailing various accounts of pedophilia and other forms of sexual abuse as well as Satanic ritual among Roman Catholic priests, as well as speculation concerning various Satanic secret societies and sex magic cults which have infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church. The author, a friend of Father Malachi Martin (who wrote a fictional account detailing Satanism within the Vatican, <em>Windswept House</em>), has unearthed many very bizarre and twisted details of the sexual activities of predator priests. However, unlike certain other books which have been made available detailing the sex scandals (particularly within the Boston Archdiocese under Cardinal Bernard Law), this book attempts to show that Satanic abuse may be involved. As noted in the introduction, by Tracy R. Twyman, throughout the Old Testament the ancient Hebrews encountered various depraved sex cults (which included bestiality, homosexuality, and pedophilia) which were repeatedly condemned by that ancient people and their God, Yahweh, as Satanic in nature. Satan, or Lucifer, is regarded by Christians to be a fallen angel, cast out of heaven for pride before God, and according to Christian doctrine has been trying to destroy Christ and His Church since its inception. Indeed, to instate the reign of Antichrist upon the Earth, Satanists seek a worldwide institution to serve as a vehicle for their diabolical plot. No institution could be more fit for that role than the Roman Catholic Church and its venerable hierarchy. The author distinguishes between modern day Satanists (of Anton LaVey\'s Church of Satan, for example) who are mere hedonists and self worshippers, and the more diabolical kind (unrecognized by modern day Satanists) who may engage in human sacrifice and sexual depravity. The first chapter of this book concerns the original &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; of the 1980s, a modern day witch craze, which brought many innocently accused into the spotlight. However, as the author notes, this original Satanic scare may have merely covered up the more diabolical kind, which currently may exist within the Roman Catholic Church. The author next considers some severely sick and disturbed individuals among the Roman Catholic priesthood. Many of these are sexual predators, although not all pedophiles (and quite a few are blasphemers as well). Perhaps one of the sickest individuals considered is that of &quot;Father&quot; Paul R. Shanley, a &quot;priest&quot; in the Boston Archdiocese, who engaged in pedophiliac and homosexual acts with countless victims (especially among disaffected and troubled youth), was an active member of the Gay Liberation movement, and whose perverted speech on &quot;man-boy love&quot; served as inspiration for the founding of the ultra-sick NAMBLA organization. This part of the story is particularly difficult to take, and the reader may feel him or herself having to retch several times over as he completes this most vile chapter in the history of pedophiliac priests. The odd thing about these priests is that nothing was done to defrock them and remove them from interacting with the youth by the Catholic hierarchy. In fact, many of them were given protection or variously re-assigned. The author also examines the secret psychiatric hospitals where many of these so called &quot;priests&quot; are sent to be &quot;cured&quot; of their diabolical disease. The author also shows how certain other priests within the Church, particularly those of a traditionalist bent, have been prevented from stopping the perverse actions and goings-on. Indeed, one Father Alfred Kunz, a friend of both Fathers Malachi Martin and the Dominican Charles Fiore, was found murdered, in ritualistic fashion (his throat was cut, having revealed the secrets of the brethren and a mutilated calf was found nearby), for having promised to reveal details of the pedophiliac priesthood. Much of this book is spent detailing various aspects of the secret societies involved in Satanic ritual and &quot;sex magic&quot;. The author refers to these as &quot;the underground sewer&quot;, referencing Saint Thomas Aquinas and his remarks on prostitution. According to certain heretical movements (and according to the popular book <em>Holy Blood, Holy Grail</em>), Christ may have been married as well as promiscuous and have spawned a bloodline. This is certainly the most diabolical of all heresies, attempting to mar the innocence of Christ. Indeed, even the Mormons have been known to believe such things, and supposedly a geneological chart detailing the supposed &quot;bloodline&quot; of Christ through the French and Merovingian kings can be found at their temple in Salt Lake City. The author argues that this cult has infiltrated the Roman Catholic Church as well, perhaps as far up as the Vatican, and refers to it (as did Malachi Martin) as &quot;Lucifer\'s Lodge&quot;. Certainly this is a most disturbing revelation. The question remains as to what Catholics can do to reclaim their Church from the treacheries of Satan. Given the sorry state of the American Church it remains a difficult question to answer. The Catholic hierarchy, overtaken by liberalism and the so called &quot;Spirit of Vatican II&quot;, continue to enact diabolic &quot;reforms&quot; within the Church and protect pedophiles and homosexuals. Indeed, many of the homosexual priests are blackmailed by the pedophiles into protecting their cult. Satan\'s serpents continue to move against Christ and His Church as well as climb the rungs of the hierarchical ladder making their way up to the Pope himself. Perhaps this is an indication that we are living near a time of great turmoil, as revealed in prophecy.</p>
<p>BREAK</p>
<p>I am posting the review not to foster discussion on the doctrines or history of Christianity, nor to mar the countless men and women of all faiths who work for the good of humanity.  Posted only to highlight yet again a recurrent theme in the unfolding saga.  This book is well researched and well written insofar as it provides insight into areas that are not given much visibility or credence.  Kindly save arguments on the finer points of religion, metaphysics, and occultism for elsewhere.  This is about the kids.</p>

            thank you, very interesting. something I want to point out is that both Traditionalist culture and liberal culture within the vatican are involved in the corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            " The author also shows how certain other priests within the Church, particularly those of a traditionalist bent, have been prevented from stopping the perverse actions and goings-on."
           </p>
           <p>
            and see also this statement:
           </p>
           <p>
            "the Catholic hierarchy, overtaken by liberalism and the so called "Spirit of Vatican II", continue to enact diabolic "reforms" within the Church and protect pedophiles and homosexuals."
           </p>
           <p>
            if you compare this to the political landscape, we see liberals and conservatives both caught in the pedo corruption. this points not to a left / right issue, but a hidden core with tentacles in all factions, playing them out against eachother and serving themselves.
