             I remember this guy now. He harassed me in private message right after SenateAnon made his threads, claiming I was working with David Brock and James Alefantis. It looks like he had a series of threads on voat that were made in a style similar to George Webbs video blogs (using terms like day X, Week X, etc.). It appears to have ended on week 8. Week 8's post starts off by accusing Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt, HighLevelInsider and SenateAnon as being the Youtuber Tory Smith, and claims they are "working with David Brock". He also bizarrely accuses me of "screwing up" because I said that I learned information from senate anon. Nothing he says makes any sense.

             He also goes on to accuse HighLevelInsider of being Qanon. It looks like his last thread is dedicated to accusing every person who ever researched these topics as being sock puppet accounts of Tory Smith and therefore we are all Qanon. I have no idea what he thinks he accomplished with this, since he did not back up anything he said with facts or even logic. For some reason he is very dedicated to defending Paul Ryan and wants to shift the focus onto John Boehner and Glenn Beck.

                 This quotation by Viktor Schaumberger suggests that water can aid in remote viewing:

                 Here is what I have gathered so far from this video:

                 <li>
                  <p>
                   warm water freezes more quickly than cold water

                 <li>
                  <p>
                   when falling through copper spirals, thin strands of water produce high electrical voltages and tiny water droplets reverse their direction of fall, contrary to the laws of gravity, and move UPWARDS (ie, levitation). This is observed in waterfalls, which have a beneficial effect on health. Specifically, waterfalls ease asthmatic complaints.

                   there is a lot of talk about alternating between the "right hand and left hand path" of the water. Then there's these diagrams of water currents which looks like "666" to me:

                 I don't exactly understand this, but someone else is thinking along the same lines as I am with the '666' symbolism. This site also claims that Schauberger showed that a natural river flowing sinuously across the landscape recharges its energy towards the positive or yang on

                <p>
                 Question: are occult symbolism, beliefs and rituals such as '666', the baphomet symbolism and the phrase "as above, so below" really just an elaborate misdirection to keep people from figuring out these principles of nature?

                 There are a lot of interesting claims on this site. Here are some examples:

                  The most important function of biological water is to facilitate rapid inter-communication between cells and connective tissues, so that the organism can function as a coordinated whole. Though not recognised by mainstream science, living water in fact performs this intercommunication function between all organisms, groups of organisms, populations, natural kingdoms and the world, creating a network of sensitivity throughout all of life, even between life on Earth and the Cosmos, so that nothing can happen without affecting other processes; all are linked together by water. In this way, it drives evolution.

We believe they are held in the etheric or quantum field, often encoded in sacred geometry.5 For example the indispensable container for the emergence of new life is the egg shape, the only shape in which water can circulate spontaneously: the egg and similar shapes like the pine cone, or spiral structures such as seashells or leaf designs have a symmetry defined by phi (Φ) or ‘The Golden Section’.

                 I answered this in a reply to the account named "ThePathoftheTruth". I will paste that entire reply again for anyone who is reading this. But first let me answer some of these questions:

                <p>
                 Water is the worlds most valuable resource and the great lakes are the largest source of freshwater in the world, I believe. The importance of the great lakes if obvious even without knowing anything about waters special properties.

                  I don't know the answer to this, but I have a question. While searching this I came across a twitter account claiming to belong to Majestic12, and from what little I read so far, they seem like they might be on our side. Should I perceive this organization as potentially friendly, or are they an enemy?

                     I tried to find this information out the other day but only came across the strange fact that there is a chain of George Webb restaurants which exist only in Wisconsin. I will look again, but is there anything to these restaurants or is this just a bizarre red herring? I have never believed "George Webb" was really named George Webb, but I always thought his name had something to do with Gary Webb.

                   This is definitely the mark of the beast. Bill Gates just did an AMA about this, saying everyone in the world was going to get a unique ID, combined with a microchip under the skin, that will have your medical history on it.

                   ) I learned that it may be possible to combine some of the mind control technology that exists with television screens, and I believe they were supposed to be making flat screen TVs and LCD screens at that plant. The only thing I can think of is that they are going to create some kind of electronic devices that will either interact with the microchip that is going to be placed under peoples skin, or somehow interfere with peoples consciousness in some way.

The state of Wisconsin had made an agreement with Foxconn whereby the company would receive subsidies ranging from $3 billion to $4.8 billion (paid in increments if Foxconn met certain targets),

                  Dahmer was shy with occasional bizarre outbursts, but he was also very charismatic. In fact, while on a class trip to Washington D.C. Dahmer called the White House, with confidence, and managed to get clearance for him and two classmates to visit the vice president’s office.

                  The Beast of Bray Road (or the Bray Road Beast) is a creature reported in 1936 on a rural road outside of Elkhorn, Wisconsin. The same label has been applied to other sightings from southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois. The Beast of Bray Road is described by purported witnesses in several ways: as a bear-like creature, as a hairy biped resembling Bigfoot, and as an unusually large (2–4 feet tall on all fours, 7 feet tall standing up) intelligent werewolf-like creature able to walk on its hind legs and weighing 400-700 pounds. It's also said that its fur is a brown gray color resembling a dog or bear.

                 These mounds only exist in Wisconsin for some reason and this particular mound appears to have the potential to teach archeologists a lot about early mound building cultures because it is still in tact. They are believed to be burial mounds.

It is made up of two Mexican words, atl, water, and an, near; and the country was probably so named from its proximity to large bodies of water. Hence the natural inference that the country about these great lakes was the ancient residence of the Aztecs.

                 It had a population of 20-30,000, which was not surpassed by Europeans until the 1800s. The residents had long-distance trading relationships with other settlements, linked by their use of the rivers for transportation. For example, items found at the settlement include

The bones of another person were bundled together with cord and placed near them. Once this construction was complete, and the bodies were inside, the building was burned.

                 Between 1890 and 1910,The mines and lumber industries shut down, leaving people unemployed, ultimately causing the banks to fail as well. The cold and bleak Midwest winters and the threat of starvation added to the blight, and talk of witchcraft and devil worship circulated among the residents. Diseases spread and many turned to alcohol for comfort. In this 20-year period, the seemingly doomed residents of Black River Falls succumbed to a downward spiral of suicide, murder, destruction, and darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                 -After the banks collapsed, a distraught farmer decided to take his own life. Wold dug a hole in the ground and placed dynamite in the hollow. Then the farmer stuck his head in the opening and lit the fuse.

                 -In the early 1890s, a diphtheria epidemic ravaged the town of Black River Falls. As a result, many children passed, which subsequently caused schools to close. Citizens also burned down houses of the sick in an attempt to stop the disease from spreading. The epidemic caused even more suicides and murders due to the grief and panic caused by the deadly illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                 -A Black River Falls resident named Sarah Smith was buried alive while in some kind of "trance," or coma-like state. Her body was found partially on its side, and the hand was positioned toward the face. Reportedly, Smith had bitten her fingers half off, and it's believed this occurred when she realized her fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 -There was also 60-year-old woman who doused herself in kerosene and burned herself alive after finding a small soar she thought was cancer.

                <p>
                 -A traveling group of approximately 50 drifters swarmed a small community. They invaded the Sheldon farm and decapitated 18 of the owner's chickens. The farmer, believing that Satan had taken control of his property, burned the farm to the ground.

                <p>
                 -The prohibitionist movement may have also started here after a father consumed a large amount of alcohol and beat his infant. He then tried to strangle his wife when she intervened. However, some neighbors arrived and saved the wife - although the newborn had already passed. After this incident and several others believed to have been fueled by alcohol, temperance meetings were held in town. The "Temperance Society" strived to thenceforth protect women from degradation and indecency.

                 -A young boy named Nestor Provancher visited a hypnotist. Afterward, he couldn't speak louder than a whisper for four months. Medical examiners believed that the boy was still under some kind of hypnotic trance, which did not permit him to talk as he once had. Nestor remained essentially mute until the trance broke months later.

                 -Mary Sweeney claimed to have destroyed over $50,000 worth of glass and was known throughout the state as the Wisconsin Window Smasher. She was a former school teacher who ran away from her husband and used cocaine liberally, noting that it "quiets her nerves." Sweeney was jailed more than 100 times and was eventually sent to an asylum.

            These sites turn up no matter which name you use I think - I googled someones name about ten days ago, and  those weird sites were among the search results (last pages) - they are not uncensoring in these cases, but for some odd reasons, they are connected to the google search algorythm. But it would be interesting to find out why this has happened nevertheless.
