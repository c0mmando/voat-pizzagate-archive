<p>Sasmita Ghosh’s arrest makes the seventh as of late. The State’s Criminal Investigative Department (CID) made the arrests. According to the Hindu, “The CID had unearthed the child trafficking racket during raids at homes and nursing homes in Baduria area of North 24 Parganas district, in Behala in the southern fringes of Kolkata and some other parts of south Bengal in November last year.”</p>
<p>Abortion clinics in the area were convincing mothers to give birth to their children in exchange for money ranging between $1,400 and $4,500 USD</p>
<p>Other birthing centers told mothers their children were stillborn, when they weren’t, allowing the clinic to steal the babies for sale on the black market. </p>
<p>The children were transported in bread baskets to nursing homes in the area where they would remain until they were sold into servitude, as sex slaves, or brothels.</p>
<p>“It is a huge network of NGOs, nursing homes, doctors and middlemen dealing in illegal adoption and baby trafficking that the police have busted.</p>
<p>investigators believe foreigners were buying the children. Currency from other countries was found at the same time the children were discovered. Several corpses and skeletons of infants were also unearthed in the raided businesses.</p>
<p>Hama Amadou, an opposition leader in the Sahel state of Niger was sentenced to one year in prison for providing babies to Niger’s elite societywas sentenced to one year in prison for providing babies to Niger’s elite society.</p>
<p>“Prosecutors claim that Amadou was one of a group of people accused of smuggling babies from Nigeria via Benin to wealthy couples in Niger by falsely claiming the parenthood of around 30 children,” according to Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany’s international newsgroup</p>
<p>Childlessness is Niger is looked down upon, so one way the elitists solved their own infertility problem was to take someone else’s child as their own.</p>
<p>“At the turn of the last decade, Niger’s elite went through a baby boom. Women who had been childless for years were suddenly celebrating the birth of their first child.” The miraculous blessings of motherhood reportedly came at the expense of someone else’s presumably stolen, purchased, or seized baby. </p>
<p>Amadou was tried in asentia and his lawyer says the allegations are politically motivated</p>
<p>Closer to home, Child Protective Services, as TFTP has consistently reported, is authorized to kidnap children at will, and place those children in foster care homes. The government’s own agency charged with protecting children, routinely displaces babies, children, and adolescents away from their parents in order to supposedly protect those children.</p>
<p>Many of those same CPS workers are abusers as well, who sometimes place those kidnapped children in the homes of sexual predators, where they are routinely victimized. The terrorist organization evokes fear in the hearts of so many parents. The power CPS possesses is legally unmatched in all of society. If you’d like to peruse our archives of CPS articles, you can do so by clicking here. Children are being ripped from their parents for something as innocent and well-intentioned as homeschooling.</p>
<p>If child trafficking arrests of government officials can happen around the world, why is it so far-fetched to think it cannot and does not happen here in the U.S.? The reality of the situation is that it is not at all far-fetched and even admitted. But the American spin machine is able to make anyone who talks about it look like a crazy person. The problem is getting so large, however, these sickos are having a hard time keeping it under wraps. As the Free Thought Project previously reported, former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney says if the government actually investigated it, child trafficking would destroy both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

              The international adoption trade is a mess. Plenty of normal people adopt stolen/coerced children without even knowing.

               A lot of taking advantage where kids are involved
              </p>
              <p>
               Some of the people who work with these agencies might not know whats going on either

               At one time Russia wouldn't allow adoptions 
Not sure if they changed that

              <p>
               Ethiopia also stopped all adoptions overseas
              </p>

            Pizzagaters should be proud of the work they have done. I don't think OXFAM would be admitting a pedo problem if it wasn't for you guys. Maybe governments will follow suit and look at their own problems.

             Some hospitals are hooked up for organ harvesting.  They have put their friends in top positions to infiltrate.  It takes good digging to find them, but it's not impossible.  Any hospitals backed by the Masons or Charities are Suspect.  Shriner's Children's Hospital is one.

             That's one of the  Most Horrible things I have read.  What diabolical minds they have.  Nothing is to Evil or Violent.  They get bored and they think up a new one.  It seems their acts are escalating.  They are getting angry that we uncovering it all.  Shining the Spotlight.

                Was on the main news tonight. And discussed in Parliament whether to stop the funding. Also other cases slowly coming forward, think they said 29 so far.

            I think this is the most important part in the first article:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              If child trafficking arrests of government officials can happen around the world, why is it so far-fetched to think it cannot and does not happen here in the U.S.?
             </strong>
             (...) But the American spin machine is able to make anyone who talks about it look like a crazy person.
