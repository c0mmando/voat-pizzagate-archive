<p>Oh and also, it seems as if his mom, Noreen Gosch, has also dropped off the face of the planet. She has not replied to emails to her website in a long time, and it\'s impossible to get a copy of her book about her son. (Noreen Gosch has been attempting to expose PG for 30+ years.)</p>
<p>Noreen\'s website for Johnny :
<a href="http://johnnygosch.com/">  http://johnnygosch.com/</a></p>
<p>And you know what that brings me to, that I\'ve been meaning to post about? Anyone else notice that IMDB.com deleted all of their discussion boards that went along with their movie webpages? After the documentary &quot;Why Johnny Can\'t Come Home&quot; came out, I started checking out imdb\'s page for the documentary, maybe once a week or so. And I\'m sure you can imagine, the discussion boards on that website definitely contained conversation that TPTB surely didn\'t want broadcast to the world.</p>

<p>After seeing the value in reading imdb \'s message boards for that documentary, I started looking up other films and documentaries (&quot;Eyes wide Shut&quot;, &quot;Human Trafficking&quot;) on imdb to read the discussion boards. Soon after, IMDb.com DELETED their entire discussion board function.</p>
<p>Looking back now, the timing seems to line up with our PG mission. Are they trying to suppress our voices?</p>

            I hadn't heard anything about Johnny possibly being dead, or the dental work stuff, and I've never heard or seen evidence that Noreen was lying. Links? I also don't think that it ruins the three witnesses' credibility that they were forced to abuse other children. But actually, I don't remember Alisha Owen saying anything about that...?

            General speculation was that Johnny Gosch WAS renamed Jeff Gannon (male prostitute w/online pic for all to see) when he resurfaced as a "journalist" w/White House clearance during the GWB admin (a probable psyop, the elites love parading their thinly disguised handiwork in front of the public, which is a borrowed witchcraft trick). If he was kidnapped as Johnny, he was likely an MKULTRA victim who was renamed Jeff after his programming, useful in various ways to the world of CIA-State Dept intel-ops.

             Thanks for the heads up about moviechat. I posted this Voat link to IMDB on The Neon Demon movie discussion board with the headng "Pizzagate is real" and IMDB announced shutting down the boards 5 days later. It's still on moviechat.
