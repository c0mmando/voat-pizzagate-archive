            Good essay! Not sure where it was going at first, but it eventually got to pizzagate. Just one excerpt:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I do recommend everyone at least look at the evidence he and others present. I went into the issue rather skeptical, but was surprised by the sheer amount of weirdness and evidence regarding Comet Pizza.  There is a problem with Pizzagate that is difficult to overcome, however; namely the fact that to my knowledge no victims have come forward.  This is not to say there has been no crime, but anyone hoping to convince the general public of wrong-doing in this kind of scenario is going to have a very hard time without a victim to reference.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is doubly difficult now that an armed man was arrested on the premises of Comet Ping Pong while “researching” the claims of child trafficking.  Undoubtedly, the mainstream media will declare the very investigation “dangerous conspiracy theory.”  Whether this will persuade the public to ignore it, or compel them to look into it, remains to be seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I fully realize the amount of confusion surrounding Pizzagate and the assertions by some that it is a “pysop” designed to undermine the alternative media.  This is a foolish notion, in my view.  The mainstream media is dying, this is unavoidable.  The alternative media is a network of sources based on the power of choice and cemented in the concept of investigative research.  The reader participates in the alternative media by learning all available information and positions and deciding for himself what is the most valid conclusion, if there is any conclusion to be had.  The mainstream media simply tells its readers what to think and feel based on cherry picked data.
           </p>
           <p>
            The elites will never be able to deconstruct that kind of movement with something like a faked “pizzagate;” rather, they would be more inclined to try to co-opt and direct the alternative media as they do most institutions.  And, if elitists are using Pizzagate as fodder to trick the alternative media into looking ridiculous, then why allow elitist run social media outlets like Facebook and Reddit to shut down discussion on the issue?"

             The biggest, most eye-opening thing for me is the sheer volume of assertions that the world governments (at least the "western" ones) are run by pedophiles. That is not a new assertion.  I literally read the post where FBIAnon said that WL was gonna give evidence of a disgusting child trafficking coverup and did not believe it.  Not in the least. But then I read the emails.  I did some research.  It all fits.  This isn't new.  This is what's been happening since the end of WW2 if not before.
