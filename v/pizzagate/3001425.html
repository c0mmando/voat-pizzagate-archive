<li>You will often see in print that  the D\'Alessandro name is often spelled differently - (with 1 &quot;s,&quot; 2 &quot;ll\'s,&quot; etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Way back when, Baltimore\'s Little Italy was a tiny, close-knit community of row houses and Italian restaurants.  Nancy\'s father, Thomas L. D\'Alessandro, Jr., (hereinafter &quot;Thomas D&quot;)was born of immigrant parents in a waterfront row house in 1903.  He challenged his neighbor in 1938, Italian-born Congressman neighbor, Vincent Palmisano, and won.  Thomas D served until 1947 and then was elected mayor of Baltimore for which he served 12 years.</p>
<p>He allegedly was a &quot;constant companion of notorious mobster Benjamin &quot;Benny Trotta&quot; Magliano and other underworld figures during his political years.  Magliano was identified by the FBI as one of Baltimore\'s &quot;top hoodlums&quot; and was widely acknowledged as the representative for NY\'s Frankie Carbo and later became a made guy in the Lucchese family.</p>
<p>In 1947, the FBI investigated Magliano for securing a draft exemption for himself and prize fighters he controlled by falsley representing they had essential employment at American Ship Cleaning Company which was operated by John Cataneo.  Maglianao and his boxers had no such employment, and they were convicted with Cataneo in federal court for the scam.  Peter Galianao, one of the convicted boxers, told the FBI in January 1947 that Thomas D was a constant companion of John Cataneo and Benjamin Magliano.  It was reported that they worked hard for Thomas D\'s reelection to Congress and on his campaign at that time to become Mayor of Baltimore.</p>
<p>The FBI never investigated Thomas D concerning this or numerous other allegations involving hoodlum associations and public corruption, but...coveniently, while in Congress, Thomas D sat on the appropriations committee and was a friend of J. Edgar Hoover.  Regardless, the allegations against Thomas D continued to pile up.  Finally in 1961, President Kennedy requested the G-men to address &quot;allegations of D\'Allesandro\'s involvement with Baltimore hoodlums: with favoritism in awarding city contracts; protection for political contributors and the prosecution of local cases.&quot;  President Kennedy wanted to appoint Thomas D to the United States Renegotiation Board which was a government watchdog against profit gouging by defense contractors.  A February 6, 1961 memo from Hoover to the Baltimore and Wahington Field Offices cautiously advises: &quot;The White House has requested that we proceed with a special inquiry investigation, but that if substantial derogatory information were developed, we should report this and discontinue any further inquiries because substantiation of any of the allegations would eliminate D\'Alessandro.&quot;</p>
<p>The allegations against Thomas D for one thing or another continued without consequences until the summer of 1953 when a child gang rape trial against the then Mayor\'s 20 year old son, Frankin Roosevelt D\'Alessandro (hereinafter FRD).  FRD was one of 14 youths charged with having committed rape or perverted practices on 2 girls, ages 11 and 13.  FRD was the only one of the 12 tried at that time who was successful in obtaining an acquittal.  Following this acquittal, a Baltimore Grand Jury indicted FRD on charges of having committed perjury during the trial.  FRD was tried on the perjury charge and was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Any and all allegations against Thomas D were conveniently ignored or explained away, and on March 28, 1961, he was sworn in a s a member of the United States Renegotiation Board by President Kennedy with 21 year od Nancy at his side.</p>
<p>Around the same time that FRD was going through his thing, the matriarch of the family, Anunciata D\'Alessandro, got into trouble when she admitted on the witness stand to receiving $11,000 from a contractor named Dominic Piracci, who was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the city.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Piracci\'s daughter married the oldest son of Thomas D and Anunciata, Thomas D\'Alessandro III, who also went on to become Mayor of Baltimore.</p>

<p>Being unable to find a complete D\'Alessandro family tree, I cannot confirm that the next person addressed is a relative, but she works in Baltimore, and therefore, I believe the chances that Alison D\'Alessandro (hereinafter AD) is either a blood relative or through marriage are good.</p>
<p>AD once worked as the Archdiocesan Director of Child and Youth Protection in Baltimore.  Enter in Cathy Cesnik and the aftermath - understanding that it often takes years for victims to tell authorities about sexual abuse; the fact that the statute of limitations expired for bringing a civil action against the church and school for enabling and covering up the abuse;  and then the push to extend the limits via Bill 642 being unsuccessful.  There was Kevin Murphy, a lawyer for the Maryland Catholic Conference, who argued against the bill, pointing to a &quot;weakness of human memory&quot; that could put accused &quot;citizens&quot; at risk.  He also asserted that allowing victims more time to come forward would give the sex criminals more time and opportunity to abuse additional victims.</p>
<p>Alison D\'Alessandro offered up the same argument - &quot;The reality is that the perpetrator often remains in a position of close access to children until an allegation is reported to the civil authorities and the employer.&quot;</p>
<p>For the 6th time, the bill died.  State Senate President Mike Miller and Judiciary Chair Joe Vallario refused to let it come up for a vote.  The bill was finally resurrected, and while the new rules still aren\'t inclusive to all survivors, they give those sexually abused as minors the right to pursue damages - from individual offenders as well as organizations that allowed abuses to continue - up until 20 years after they reach majority age.  The new law also enables victims to sue up until 3 years after a defendant is &quot;convicted of a crime relating to alleged incident or incidents.&quot;  
</p>
<p>The Archdiocese of Baltimore has never publicly admitted that the sex abuse in Archbishop Keogh High School, which was alleged to have affected at least 50 students in the late 60\'s and early 70\'s, actually ever took place.</p>
<p><a href="https://forensicfilesnow.com/index.php/tag/the-keepers/">https://forensicfilesnow.com/index.php/tag/the-keepers/</a></p>
<p>I then found a document dated &quot;October 14&quot; but no year from SNAP (Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests) titled &quot;Child Sex Victims Want Catholic Woman Ousted From Governor\'s Panel.&quot;  That woman is Alison D\'Alessandro.<br />
The report states that AD fought to prevent clergy from being mandated to report abuse in Maryland, and she helped stop those molested as kids from being able to expose predators.  Additionally, SNAP accused her  for helping to thwart attempts to reform Maryland\'s &quot;predator-friendly&quot; statute of limitations for child sex abuse and improving reporting requirements for suspected sexual abuse of minors.  The report continues that she repeatedly protected known pedophiles, misled survivors, accused survivors of fabricating stories, and protected church secrets rather than protecting children.</p>

<p>AD no longer works for the Diocese.  Her next position (and likely her current position) is with the Baltimore Child Abuse Center where she is Senior Consultant/Senior Policy and Program Specialist.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bcaci.org/our-team/">https://www.bcaci.org/our-team/</a></p>
<p>Lastly, I discovered a Tweet by MD Cathoic Conference (advocating for the policy positions of the Archdioceses of Baltimore and Washington and the Diocese of Wilmington) dated February 4, 2016, in which Alison D\'Alessandro and Kevin Murphy are slammed for protecting pedophiles and not children.</p>

<p>Talk about a culture of evil and corruption.  Nancy Pelosi is a dangerous, damaged woman and whatever relation Alison D\'Alessandro may be, the same may hold true.  Pelosi was one of 6 children and has 5 of her own.</p>',

Sam rose in the ranks , despite having around an 8th grade education, due to his enjoyment of murdering people, to traveling the world meeting with heads of state.

            This whole, uninteresting history lesson amounts to a "bad seed" fallacy: i.e., "she had a piece of shit in her family, therefore, she's a piece of shit."
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who takes this as a real criticism, take a look at your own families. Not a criminal to be found? Ok, then you can criticise. Let's be real: everyone is one step removed from a piece of shit. If that's the standard, no one is fit for politics. Of course, that's preposterous. This is more smear campaign with no substance.

                Based on what evidence? Listen shit-for-brains, if Hussein Obama had destroyed his notes and ordered his Farsi translator to remain silent after his 5th meeting with the Iyatolla of Iran, your fucking head would explode. And so would mine. For good reasons. That's a good sign the guy is hiding deals he really really doesn't want anyone to know about.

                But if Trump does it, you're ok with it. Let me guess, you think if he let his intel people see the contents of his talks, there would be war. Amiright?

                  It was a good deal for us, if our intentions were to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Again, no surprise you didn't know that. You've got to be pretty fucking stupid to be ok with the current POTUS sucking Putin's cock at every possible turn, and think the Iran deal was bad. You've been convinced to be a tool for a hostile nation's agenda. You're part of the problem. I doubt you'll ever be able to come to terms with that, even if the country falls apart as a result of the Trump presidency. But history will document the participation of the dumbasses who helped put a stake in this country. Your grandkids will likely suffer because you can't pull your head out of your shithole.

                    You just don't know what you're talking about. It was Iran's money. We froze their assets years ago. The nuclear deal itself is a very good deal for anyone who wants to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03JdbYggUTs">
                     This video is a good explanation.
                    </a>
                    I dare you to inform yourself of the facts.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump pulled us out for one main reason: it had Obama's dirty black dick all over it, and he can't abide by a deal that Obama successfully made. It would be like learning your wife used to fuck black guys all the time, right? How could a white guy possibly live with that?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So with the deal, we get to guarantee Iran will not have the capacity to produce nuclear weapons, and we get to check on them every 90 days, and we get a spy presence on their home ground. Now, we don't get to spy on them, and they don't have to wait to produce nuclear weapons. The only people this benefits is Israel (who wants any excuse to use US troops for their goals), and Syria and its allies.
