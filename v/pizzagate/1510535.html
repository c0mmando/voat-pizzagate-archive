<h2>The Apes Tour Diary</h2>

<h2>Band plays at private homes with children, bondage, and filmed porn</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>We pull up at Alec’s house after 10:15. ... A little Japanese girl approaches me. “Oh, um, that the one that I use ketchup. It have corn syrup.” I’m cursed.</p>
<p>Monotonix don’t hold back because they are playing in someone’s home. The fires are set. Ami jumps in a trash can. He dumps the remaining salad and scatters it all over the kitchen. He tapes youths together with duct tape. At one point, he touches a skate board that is cautiously held by a long-haired blond youngster, wearing glasses. The boy’s face becomes terror- struck and then furious. He grabs his skateboard and runs out the front door. I think he is running home until he reappears moments later. He has broken the skate board in half. I guess that the boy felt it was contaminated after Ami touched it. Perhaps he felt compelled to destroy it completely. I plan to console him later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Detroit was a hoot and a holler. We got there around 9:00 pm, just in time for the van to skate across the yard of ice designated as parking lot in the suburban housing subdivision.</p>
<p>several people were watching some kind of net porn...</p>
<p>I sat down at a table to collect myself after the tense drive. In front of me, for my reading pleasure, was a copy of The Poor Man’s James Bond. I remembered this book from my college years. It’s something akin to The Anarchist’s Cookbook. The first page was covered with hand-written text. It was titled “The Do it Yourself Home Suicide Kit”. There were precise directions for how to quickly and efficiently cut and bleed yourself to death. A razorblade was taped to the page. I went to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The bathroom was only half complete but not undecorated. A large orange pentagram was painted on the tiled wall above the bathtub.</p>
<p>I was encouraged.</p>
<p>While I was changing back into street clothes, I listened to the dialogue from the other room. It went something like this.</p>
<p>“We should get naked,” from an adult male voice.</p>
<p>“Do you think? It would be weird to get naked,” from a young female voice.</p>
<p>“Wow, there are naked people in my living room,” from the voice of the host.</p>
<p>“We should take pictures!” from the adult male photographer that had been capturing the entire evening with very professional gear.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe there is a porn shoot going on in my living room!” from the host.</p>
<p>I stuck my head around the corner. There was the guy who earlier had worn the computer monitor on his head, now nude, with a naked girl on each side of him. They looked young: there were lots of flash bulbs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a little 3-year old boy playing on a bike across the street. He called out to me. &quot;Come over here!&quot;</p>
<p>I walked over and then he said &quot;What’s your name?&quot;</p>
<p>Before I could answer, he shouted &quot;Come in my house!&quot; Boys are really to the point at that age! Sure saves a girl a lot of time!</p>

<p>My name is Amanda, and I play organ/keyboards for this band called Apes. We are based in Washington, DC and we have been together officially since 1999. I have been playing music with two of these fools since I was 15. </p>

<h2>History of wearing costume and using a voice changer</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/E7SaA">https://archive.fo/E7SaA</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I showed up at Jeff’s and everybody was busy with needles and thread, doing last minute costume fixtures: rainbows, big eyes, wings. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/NF5Uw">https://archive.fo/NF5Uw</a></p>

<p>Without the voice changer, this speech would be pretty pathetic. </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/MJejN">https://archive.fo/MJejN</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought a book about an Iranian girl who gets tortured. </p>

<h2>Kleinman works with children</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/E7SaA">https://archive.fo/E7SaA</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to start off by apologizing for never finishing the Apes/Enon tour diary from the Fall 2003. There were only a few shows left to write about but I took a job as a full time special educator after the tour was over. Between the job, tutoring, 4 days a week of band practice, and a furious exercise routine (Jeff and Erick maintain that this is an addiction like any other), I never finished it.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/4UWPZ">https://archive.fo/4UWPZ</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a teacher again. 4 hours a day. I am teaching in a middle school, 2 math classes and one section of biology. I will wait to tell the rest of the tales of the last exploits of the road (Nov and Dec Apes/Mod tour 2005) as I know my students love the apes website and for now, its best the two worlds don\'t mix. I know you understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Kleinman family</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/BG939">https://archive.fo/BG939</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we played, I was struck by the volume of these loud man-fans in the front row screaming my name over and over. Eventually when I looked at them, I recognized my brother and his friend who were totally trashed and raging like bull dogs. After the show, they wanted to beat up my friends. My brother is 3 years younger than me, married to a wonderful woman, owns a house, a fancy car, and makes about 9 times as much money as me. He was a lacrosse player.</p>

<p>There is a whole lot of madness in that house. But this story is not about my family. Someday I will write about the childhood. Its not your average &quot;White trash Jews coming up in North Potomac, MD story.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Kleinman and Schmid have an earlier hardcore band Nightmare Assault from Baltimore, MD</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/QA9id">https://archive.fo/QA9id</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to SUNY Purchase for one year, 1991 to 1992. After that year, I ran off to France alone, and ended up transferring to U of MD. It was there that I moved in with Jeff and we started the hard core band known as &quot;Nightmare Assault.&quot; Good memories.</p>
<p>Everyone loves a clown, unless they are chasing you with a steak knife.</p>

<h2>Kleinman wanders around at night alone, sometimes in costume</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/4UWPZ">https://archive.fo/4UWPZ</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackie Majik and I are jamming most evenings and after dark, I wander the city alone. While I wander, I meet strange and interesting characters that sometimes provide interesting conversation and occasionally add wisdom to otherwise uniwse days. There is one particular person that I met this week that stands out. This is a person that I may meet again and if there are things worth sharing, I may mention them again in this forum.</p>
<p>I met him on the Calvert Street Bridge when I was wandering late Tuesday night and he stopped me because I was wearing a red ski mask. Usually I wear the ski mask so people won\'t talk to me but I guess he was intrigued. I noticed him because of his....well...it really doesn\'t matter...at this point I\'d rather keep his physical deformities out of the discussion....</p>
<p>6th period bell just rang, I have to stop hiding in the music supply closet...more to come..</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Kleinman kept a secret anonymous blog</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/PRdlS">https://archive.fo/PRdlS</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ape life never stops but I had been keeping an anonymous secret blog since early January and devoted quite a bit of time to it. It was a blog that I have been needing to write for quite some time. I had been wanting to incorporate elements of the secret blog into this one but I got the stop/block warning from my crew. So I went under.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Kleinman has an eating disorder</h2>
<p>Note that survivors of child abuse often exhibit eating disorders, especially bulimia.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/MJejN">https://archive.fo/MJejN</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That night began all of my horrible eating, sleeping, and sleep-eating habits of tour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that Kleinman finds herself sleepwalking and eating:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/MJejN">https://archive.fo/MJejN</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably about an hour later, I wake up in the kitchen. My hand is stuck in the peanut jar and there is peanut butter on my face. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>More behavior indicating Kleinman suffers from blackout and dissociative disorder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next morning, I got up early and did go running. Someone honked at me and gave me the finger. When I got back, people were waking up. Paul Q (from Modey Lemon) asked me if I had been hungry in the middle of the night. I said, &quot;Why?&quot; He said that he and Anders saw me come out of my room, go into the kitchen, and start rustling around. They said they started talking to me from the other room and I walked over, looked right at them, said nothing, and closed the kitchen door.</p>
<p>I have no idea what I ate. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/PRdlS">https://archive.fo/PRdlS</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anorexia is a bitch. It’s like being possessed. Anorexia claims more lives than any other mental illness. It’s also much more difficult to recover when it starts in adults with a history of being overweight. That was pretty much my case history. I finally got help around Christmas. At the present moment, I am ‘in recovery’.</p>

            I have to start off by apologizing for never finishing the Apes/Enon tour diary from the Fall 2003. There were only a few shows left to write about but I took a job as a full time special educator after the tour was over. Between the job, tutoring, 4 days a week of band practice, and a furious exercise routine (Jeff and Erick maintain that this is an addiction like any other), I never finished it.

Eventually when I looked at them, I recognized my brother and his friend who were totally trashed and raging like bull dogs. After the show, they wanted to beat up my friends. My brother is 3 years younger than me, married to a wonderful woman, owns a house, a fancy car, and makes about 9 times as much money as me. He was a lacrosse player.

            And it's worth mentioning since I did not originally state it but NEVER NEVER EVER TRY THIS! It is extremely dangerous and you can easily end up dead or shot by someone who is fearful for their lives. I'm not exaggerating or using hyperbole when I say this.... the look in my roommate's eye when he went through these prescription induced episodes was literally satanic and pure evil (he had absolutely 0 control over his thoughts and actions and 0 ability to think rationally). He'd tear up everything in the apartment, punch holes in the wall, threaten to kill people..... and the next day he wouldn't remember a thing. There were several times where I wanted to Baker Act him for the insanity.

             The next drive is to Shreveport, LA. We are playing a house show. There is a kid who lives in Shreveport named Alec. Alec loves music, bands, and shows. Alec loves them so much that he opens his home to these bands and invites them to play in his living room. He also opens his home to other local lovers of music. Tonight we are going to play at Alec’s house, known as Cooper Manor. We are supposed to play between the local opening band and Monotonix. We have mild concerns that we will have to play do after Monotonix as, quite honestly, they are a tough act to follow. The dramatics in their show, and the mess that they leave, are a rocky foundation upon which to play one’s set.

            Gawd. This reminds me of the "trying too hard to be weird" crowd from high school. Seems like it may have begun as just that and then they connected w the JA group and were brought into the
            <em>
             actual
            </em>
            group of fucked up, dark/evil, pedos.

            Heavy breathing and all of the sasha lord bands are some of the most disturbing aspects. I'm suprised i really thought majestic ape had to be a man. I'm waiting for someone to decode the hand signals at the end of one of their vidoes. watching these videos and knowing you are being bombarded with subliminal messages bothers me.

             I haven't watched any of their videos all the way through, but I believe what you're saying about "hand signals".
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's my thought; I read her
             <em>
              Linked In
             </em>
             stuff &amp; remember being shocked &amp; sickened when I realized that she is a TEACHER.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't recall atm but I think it said that she has degrees in Special Education &amp; if the other degree or Special Ed work has to do with deaf children,
             <strong>
              COULD ANY OF THE HAND SIGNALS BE RELATED TO AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE?
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             My cousin majored in Deaf Education when I was little. I remember her teaching me a few signs &amp; the alphabet as well. And as the video is something I don't think I could ask her to watch (she is one of the kindest, sweetest, innocent souls I have ever known.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we couldn't find another person who knows ASL really well I will consider asking her, but I hope I don't have to put this horror into her heart ~ she would never be the same, &amp; I guess that's on me &amp; is my selfish line I don't want to have to cross) I may try my hand at it, no pun intended!

             <p>
              I noticed this when viewing the Heavy Breathing video here (this is the first one I saw):
              <a href="https://youtu.be/N_gGhrIO6ps">
               https://youtu.be/N_gGhrIO6ps
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              There are a many disturbing things here, but what immediately caught my eye was her use of sign language (or some kind of variation she was improvising). In particular:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://i.sli.mg/xo6Q7h.jpg">
               SLiMG Image
              </a>
              Voice over is "No need to speak..." while she makes the motion of scissors cutting, presumably cutting out someone's tongue.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://i.sli.mg/n2eIvv.jpg">
               SLiMG Image
              </a>
              Voice over is "... I will send my thoughts directly to your mind."
             </p>
             <p>
              It seems to me these gestures are something you'd use to terrify children, and it looks as if she knows exactly what she's doing. Kleinman also loves to drop very inappropriate sexual references. Another image that caught my eye was her again using sign language to show a person walking -- with an erection. Again, this strikes me as something a sadist would do to sexually abuse a child.

              No definitely don't her watch. Those videos are full of subliminal programing and horrific visuals that you only see when pausing but your subconscious decodes them. To me they look like secret society type signals that i have seen b4

            Really important work on this post.  I went on an upvoat frenzy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The story about Detroit amounts to a confession everything PG has been alleging is true.  Satanism?  Check.  Sex with minors ("adult" v. "young" clearly stated)?  Check.  Creating images ("very professional gear") of said sex?  Check.  And that's just one of the pieces of evidence you discovered.
           </p>
           <p>
            But for Kleinman being politically connected in DC, agents would be swarming her by now.

             Are you reading a different blog entry? It sounds like this was going on at a place they were playing and they were surprised and creeped out by it and in fact high-tailed it out of there:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I stuck my head around the corner. There was the guy who earlier had worn the computer monitor on his head, now nude, with a naked girl on each side of him. They looked young: there were lots of flash bulbs.
             </p>
             <p>
              The promoters started bringing in snow covered couches from the backyard, in preparation for the Apes overnight stay.** We decided to get a motel.**

              Nope. I read it, and in fact they played, got paid, and wanted to go back because they were short-changed.

               And they described it as a "hoot and a holler" -- not the weirdest damn thing I've ever seen and I'm now a material witness in an upcoming criminal trial.

              But not call the police.  The Apes are OK with it, even suggest enjoying it, but are smart enough to avoid getting caught.

              In my entire life I have never 'stumbled' into a satanic underage sex photography event.  Makes me wonder how something like that could happen to anyone.

                  According to Amanda Kleinman's own words, she saw an underage porn shoot in progress and did not find it important enough to alert the authorities.  She was, however, concerned about not getting enough money for the gig.  She understood the shoot was illegal and got away from it. But, her general impression of the whole event was that it was a "hoot and holler".

            Good job! I'm sensitive too and protective. I homeschooled mine for a year and wanted to pull my hair out. If you can handle it, that's great! There are kids groups and churches where they can socialize. Now that I have learned about pizza gate, it sure does make me think twice. I feel bad for people who have to put toddlers in daycare. They are too little to tell you what's wrong if something is happening. I was blessed and never had to do that.

            The vacaroo recording of "Lee" Kleinman saying he is gettin a sex change may be fake. Vocaroo is copyrighted 2007-2016 yet in this video of Kleinman from 2002 at the 2:00 minute mark there is a good close up view of Kleinman telling a joke and she is clearly a woman.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBQyn44YVRg

            Same comment as yesterday. Great research into what's behind the art. But it doesn't read as true. It reads like bullshit. Of course these people have a body of completed work so it's more than words. Great work.

             Yes, i'm starting to think that way too. Especially people who are connected to charities/orphanages or work with children. Maybe if only to tell their co-workers to keep an eye out. It's definitely possible that the people who have to work alongside these pervs already have their suspicions and just need a nudge.

            I doubt they meant a website on the dark net, their website is dark. Needs a bit more background before I can say for sure they had a tor website at some point.

            Exactly who is the teacher?  I'm a little lost as to what evidence goes with what person but if there is anything inappropriate for a teacher, the school needs to be informed.  I'm quite serious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, cynic (realist?) that I am, the principal, district superintendent, half the teachers, counselors, cafeteria staff, and maintenance workers are probably all spirit cookers themselves.

             I think that Amanda Kleinman and James Alefantis both pose as Majestic Ape. Some of the images of the lips look far too thin to me Amanda Kleinman, but is an exact math for JA

               Ive studied psych, and Ive seen a few photos where I am convinced it is not a woman. In trying to understand the mindset of these kinds of people, who post extremely questionable material and demonstrate a very sick humour towards children, why the need for a costume based around anonymity, i know its not a astonishingly new concept for a band to do for maybe attention or whatever - but check out this video. I have heard people say this is laced with subliminal messages, I don't know how I can confirm this. Maybe someone with the skills, if they could prove it has these embedded images, and we could strongly imply that this is JA as, honestly - to me its a dead ringer.

                I think the conclusion a lot of on VOAT have come to is that sometimes the "persona" is played by both male and females. This makes sense b/c if we follow their philosophy stemming from the whole Egyptian "fish and 14" linked to Osiris and Iris who engenders her son Horus who at one time had no gender then we can clearly see they are replicating this ancient Egyptian ritual manifested in this act in their videos.
               </p>
               <p>
                In one of their sick music vids (I think Neutered Noel)... the guy is typing on the computer chat room at night and talking to Majestic Ape who appears to be the (trans or gender neutral one). By the end of the video the nerd guy with glasses is placed where Majestic Ape was sitting and the original nerd guy is now wearing a bra and underwear signifying Majestic Ape's transformation on him.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's the same thing played out over and over in all of their vids in some shape or form and in a lot of the art work they reference. I can post images that prove my point concisely, but not now b/c I'm at work but Jerry Saltz who these sick fuks revere posts a ton of reference material with men and women having both the same gender and identity at the same time which is what Majestic Ape's character is reflecting vis a vis Horus (Aleister Crowley said we are living in the Age of Horus, which is another hint to MA's role) not having a gender and being transmuted his gender by ISIS copulating with a dead Osris that was cut up into 14 pieces and resurrected back to life through ISIS' magic (the penis was eaten by the fish, which describes their fascination with hot dogs and bizarre art with penises displayed everywhere as well as in their music videos).

                 Thanks you. 
This looks like JA to me. Amanda Kleinman appears to have a relatively full bottom lip. Many of the images of the Majestic Ape have a person with extremely thin lips, identitcal to JA

                  James Alefantis might direct or produce the Apes videos tho.

             You're repeating a popular but questionable assertion which also makes no sense and proves nothing but does serve as a kind of persistent distraction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile my post above clearly and directly references how Kleinman herself writes about wearing the mask and using the voice modulator back in the 2000s. I'm not buying what you're selling.

               I'm referring to Kleinman as a man (cf. Kleinman is Alefantis). The recording you linked to has no source, but that said, the recording does sound like the Majestic Ape character doing her "act". If that is the case, she's been doing her crowd warm up as Majestic Ape for many years. If you listen to what you posted, she's telling an outrageous, shocking story in the character of Majestic Ape. It's her creepy routine. She is not telling her life's story here.
              </p>
              <p>
               Her blog and other information clearly point to her being Amanda for quite many years. Also, the first photo you reference (Before) clearly isn't Kleinman.
              </p>
              <p>
               Finally, I neglected to see all the (((tribe))) bullshit of your last post. Please just stop.

            These guys were poor when they were touring as The Apes; at least Kleinman was. They stayed on floors and Kleinman speaks about being in debt. All of this changes after they start playing at Comet, stop picking up outside lead singers and keep just with the core group (coven?), and they become more involved with the Alefantis crowd -- Kleinman gets a sweet job at Corcoran, Schmid works as webmaster for Alefantis, Jackson has a remarkably well-received career in art. It's also around this time as Heavy Breathing they start to make more polished videos, many of which include a lot of disturbing "subliminal" content. This turn is undoubtedly linked to their relationship to Sasha Lorde, who picks up managing the band in their post-poor Apes period.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is more in that Apes blog, including a reference Kleinman made about loving retarded boys, but I can't seem to locate it now.

             Anyway, after I hang up with the mechanic, I have a panic attack. I don't have $1,000. I don't even have a credit card with room for more debt. My parents have been helping me with my rent payments since I was in the hospital. I have medical bills from Johns Hopkins that are almost as bad as my credit card bill.
            </p>
            <p>
             I never exactly know how to proceed in high stress situations so I defer to my old standby behavior. I call home. My dad answers. He was asleep. He yells at me. I hang up. I email my mom at work. She calls me back and tells me I have to go back to teaching. I have to get a job. I have to get a real job-- the kind that gives you health insurance, paid vacations, and a bi-weekly check. These jobs don't accommodate tour schedules. They don't let organ players go when its time to go. The children need their teacher unless their teacher is going to have a baby, or is going to have surgery. My parents are not wealthy people. They have their own problems. They can't save me. I don't expect them to save me. I just want them to make it all better.

             So, the guy, on the bridge. He approaches me. Its dark. Its cold. He looks creepy. I look creepy.
            </p>
            <p>
             He speaks first.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Are you a crotch rot or a fetus face?" he asks tentatively.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Hmmm..." I'm not really sure how to respond. After all, I have eyebrows, so I'm not really a fetus face. And I'm not harboring any yeasts or fungal infections so I'm not really a crotch rot either. But he seems like he could be interesting and I don't want to alienate him right off the bat so I just say "Both, I guess. How bout you?"

             "Neither. You want to go forage for some wild lettuce saxifrage in rock creek park? You look like a forager," he states.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am familiar with this lettuce saxifrage. I am dedicated to feasting free on wild edibles and this is one of my favorite wild salad greens. Even though its dark, we head for the park.

              Just so you know the wandering at night thing is probably linked to "prescription cocktailing".... I had a roommate in college that would take multiple Ambien (sleep meds), multiple Xanax (downer), drink a handle of vodka, and even sometimes take adderall (an upper)... (Jimmy Comet posts tons of prescription med bottles suggestively on his Insta photos)
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyways, there are tons of references online for you if you mix even a bit of alcohol while on ambien, the person can experience sleep walking and extremely bizarre and violent behavior where they blackout and don't know what they're doing.
             </p>
             <p>
              There were several times where my roommate would do this and he'd walk around an apartment complex with an "air shotgun" banging on doors and telling everyone to get ready for the aliens.... just really strange stuff. Just wanted to add this b/c these people are probably not randomly doing this, it is more than likely medically induced through prescription meds or other drugs.

            The Maryland connection makes sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first video I saw of Majestic Ape / Heavy Breathing was this one:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The uploader claims the original video came from Ari Srabstein, whose channel is this:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCotn9auEMq_3d7KL7dGNQAQ">
             https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCotn9auEMq_3d7KL7dGNQAQ
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Where you can see that they have filmed other live performances with the same quality of camera/audio work, but they presumably pulled the Heavy Breathing video after it was discovered there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found an old blog of Ari Srabstein, where they first report that their location is MD, but then report later that their location has changed to Washington D.C.:
            <a href="https://theworldofarisrabstein.blogspot.com/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see the content between the blog and the YT channel is a match.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also found them here:

            And elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here, as well, it is confirmed that they were in MD at least until they graduated from high school, and the dates correspond with the blog claiming they were first in MD and then later in D.C. :
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ari-srabstein-36360765">
             https://www.linkedin.com/in/ari-srabstein-36360765
            </a>
            <a href="http://archive.is/vnE3N">
             http://archive.is/vnE3N
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So it looks like they were a fan of a horror sub-genre in theater, major Tim Burton fan, and like to make films. They went to D.C. after graduating from high school, and at some point filmed a live performance of Heavy Breathing. I would just assume them to have been attracted to the creepy genre of it all and there for that reason alone, except for this from your archive:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There is a whole lot of madness in that house. But this story is not about my family. Someday I will write about the childhood. Its not your average "White trash Jews coming up in North Potomac, MD story."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Because if you look at their petition towards Hot Topic on change.org that I linked, they also have their location specifically as Potomac, MD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could just be a coincidence, I guess.
