<p><strong>PART 2</strong>: 
As seen above, his new show is about a gender &quot;spectrum&quot; aimed at children. His older shows are available on Netflix.<strong>Netflix has removed the segments which discuss gender as being XX and XY---in other words male and female only.</strong>This is another example of the agenda to not only sexualize children, but to give them perverted propaganda in the guise of &quot;science&quot;. Here is the old show segment:</p>

<p>How many &quot;scientists&quot; do you know of who have a patent on ballet &quot;en pointe&quot; shoes?--shoes which have never been manufactured as the existing shoes used by professionals are fine. </p>
<p>Here\'s the patent: <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US6895694">https://www.google.com/patents/US6895694</a></p>

<p><strong>All this, and Nye\'s own weird career path from Cornell (CIA) to Boeing consultant to stand up comic (begun by winning a Steve Martin look alike contest) to TV entertainer/brainwasher point to his heavy involvement with Intelligence.</strong> This is not surprising at all, considering his back ground: his father, whom his mother later divorced, was a POW who allegedly &quot;went missing&quot; on Pearl Harbor day. His father made a sundial out of &quot;a shovel handle&quot; in the camp, and supposedly that was his business endeavor after the war--making sundials.</p>

<p>His mother was a spook for sure and these things are often generational. They admit she was recruited out of college (which is SOP for the Intelligence services) to become a &quot;code breaker&quot; during WWII. But, <strong>even after the war, she could not speak about what she actually did</strong>, though plenty of code breaker did speak about what they did after the war:  Nye said, &quot;People would ask her what she did during World War II and she\'d say, \'I can\'t talk about it, ha ha ha!\'&quot;</p>

<p>So, the son an ex-POW who makes sundials and a woman whose only documented work was in WWII Intelligence goes to Cornell and then goes on to be a mouthpiece for promoting the agenda of the pedo elite.</p>

           Something about Bill's photos (the eyebrows?) remind one of Michael Aquino. In some photos, it seems he is made to look purposely sinister:

            Great Post! Very detailed with a lot of links. The ice cream orgy is horrible. What children are watching these days with this forced transgender agenda is horrible.

            Good post,  thanks for the work you did putting this together. Why were one of the videos not available? Can you provide an alternative source?

             I will look for one. It was working when I put it up. Notice how quickly this was buried. I think it's because of comments I have made on other posts.
