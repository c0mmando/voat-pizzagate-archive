The post got a generally positive response, with a few (expected) &quot;you\'re a nut&quot; comments. He gave me permission to share, and I can provide the URL to the post if anyone would like to directly share. Text is as follows:</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Fuck you John Podesta
Keep on calling it &quot;fake news&quot;.
Your days are numbered and you know it.</p>
<p>Fuck you too Business Insider, linking the The New York Times article that &quot;immediately debunked&quot; jack shit.</p>
<p>Why don\'t you tell your readers about how NY Times CEO Mark Thompson also covered for Jimmy Savile while working at BBC News, killing the documentary on his pedophile AND necrophiliac ways.</p>
<p>Don\'t buy this shit about #pizzagate being &quot;fake news&quot;, it\'s more real than they would have you believe.</p>
<p>NY Times doesn\'t address a damn thing of substance in their hit piece article. They built a strawman with only a few straws and they plucked these hand picked straws to make you all believe it\'s been thoroughly debunked, when they didn\'t even come close.</p>
<p>Just look at that adorable picture of James Alefantis on the NY Times article, with his big smile lovingly fulfilling a customers order personally. </p>
<p>NY Times says he never met Hillary Clinton.
How do they know? He visited the White House 5 times, it\'s in their log books and he spent the night each time, so I would like to know how they know he never met her. Especially being that he dated Media Matters founder and Hillary booster David Brock.</p>
<p>Let\'s go ahead and put that in the undebunked column.
But notice how they leave that out, the fact he visited the White House 5 times and has a personal photo of Obama that he took himself playing ping pong with a child during one of his visits.</p>
<p>This happens throughout the article, where they omit the bigger pieces of evidence while dispelling the stuff where researchers were &quot;reaching&quot;, which happens in an open source investigation.</p>
<p>NY Times then goes into a PR frenzy and it takes them several paragraphs to get to the next &quot;allegation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The restaurant has kid-friendly features like Ping-Pong tables and a craft room.  Famous natives like members of the band Fugazi have held small shows there. &quot;</p>
<p>They also have &quot;kid-friendly&quot; entertainment from bands like Sex Stains and Heavy Breathing, which make many references to pedophilia in their act. All ages welcome to these kid-friendly events.But that doesn\'t fit the NY Times &quot;investigative&quot; narrative, so it was conveniently left out in favor of an act that doesn\'t sing about raping children.</p>
<p>&quot;The eatery, which seats 120, is a mash-up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of Mr. Alefantis.&quot;</p>
<p>Ya, let\'s talk about some of those &quot;modernist murals and paintings&quot;. How about some detail NY Times? What about the huge mural of a naked man playing ping pong with an alien, which has recently been repainted to give the man some clothes. Or how about the modernist paintings of implied nude women holding severed heads? Perhaps NY Times spent too much real estate doing PR damage control and had to make light on these details.</p>
<p>The article then goes into the relationship Alefantis has with John and Tony Podesta, shall we talk about their taste in artwork? Little girls standing in a row with red paddled butts, discarded girls in ponds floating like dead cadavers, a man on a table about to be eaten by 2 other men, which hands in John Podesta\'s office. &quot;Better to be the men with the knives than the man on the table&quot; John retorts when asked about the painting by visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;Some posited the restaurant was part of a larger Democratic child trafficking ring, which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some&quot; being the key word here. The restaurant itself needn\'t be the central hub of the trafficking. NY Times glossed over the Instagram pictures, wait, check that, they didn\'t say squat about what alarmed these #pizzagate researchers. Small girls taped to tables. Babies with cash in their mouths. A man with a baby boy with beads connecting them with a comment by James Alefantis aka Jimmy Comet replying &quot;#Chickenlovers&quot;. (Chickenlover = gay man that loves small boys) </p>
<p>That is not conspiracy theory code, or FBI code, that is known throughout the gay community that chickenlover=boy lover.
It also means a chicken fucker, made famous by South Park, but in context with the image James Alefantis posted and commented on it means this....
chicken lover - An adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males&gt; <a href="http://www.definition-of.com/chicken%20lover">http://www.definition-of.com/chicken%20lover</a>  
</p>
<p>NY Times also offers this tidbit, &quot;The F.B.I. said it “does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.”</p>
<p>Make of that what you will. NY Times then breifly mentions the troubling images of the children, but they don\'t say anything about them other than they are being misrepresented. The parents declined to talk on record however for &quot;fear of reprisal&quot;, even though they could remain anonymous if they wish in order to set the story straight and offer a reasonable explanation to the more disturbing images.</p>
<p>Then the remaining 3 paragraphs is about poor James Alefantis not having any real recourse to the situation.</p>
<p>So I ask you, wtf has been debuked???
This is the article people point to that &quot;instantly/immediately debunks&quot; the story, so where is the debunking??? Am I just missing it?</p>
<p>If that is a debunking, then I am a monkey\'s uncle.
And fuck off with this &quot;there was not even a basement&quot; trash.
First of all this isn\'t the OJ Simpson trial.
&quot;If the glove doesn\'t fit we must acquit!&quot;
&quot;The basement don\'t exist so you all must cease and desist!&quot;</p>
<p>Bullshit if we must quit.
First of all, a lack of a basement isn\'t proof of innocence.
Secondly, we believe we did find it. It\'s in a place called the #pegasusmuseum which was bought by Alefantis from the Moonie Cult, remember them?
<a href="https://youtu.be/PYBU08FhIfY">https://youtu.be/PYBU08FhIfY</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/2_Louyxj3Cc">https://youtu.be/2_Louyxj3Cc</a></p>
<p>We even have the building permits filed by Alefantis to build the basement. The #pegasusmuseum is NOT open to the public and it is a fake business. It also directly overlooks a children\'s playground, so people with children living in the area BEWARE.</p>
<p>So what now that we may in fact have found the basement that Alefantis posted in which one of his followers(employee?) called it the @#KillRoom&quot;? Which Alefantis replied #murder. We didn\'t dub it the Kill Room, they did.</p>
<p>And if you look really close at Alefantis\'s Instagram profile pic, it is a picture of Antinous the 13 year old Greek boy lover of Emperor Hadrian. The cult of Antinous was to become very popular in the Greek-speaking world. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty_in_ancient_Greece</a></p>
<p>Make of that what you will. But this is all still barely just scratching the surface. I am leaving out the other businesses, also with pedophile logos located right next door and directly across the street, such as Besa Pizza, Terastol, and Beyond Borders, in which Besta immediately changed their logo once researchers pointed it out.</p>
<p>As for Beyond Borders, they specialize in Haiti children refugees. Then you have the Clintons intervening for one Laura Silsby as she tried to smuggle 32 Haitian children illegally out of the country. Emails show Hillary wanted to be updated on Silsby\'s arrest and Bill Clinton stepped in to get her sentence reduced. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children\'s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children\'s_Refuge_case</a></p>
<p>Then you have the bogus lawyer Jorge Puello Torres who was advising the jailed New Life Children\'s Refuge unwitting human traffickers, who himself was wanted in several countries for human trafficking, in which the NY Times themselves did a piece on. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/world/americas/16haiti.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/world/americas/16haiti.html</a></p>
<p>Those working for Silsby were probably unwitting accomplices, but Silsby herself knew better and was not only warned beforehand not to try to take the kids out of the country without proper documentation, but was caught trying to smuggle 40 children out of Haiti even before this.</p>
<p>Oh what a tangled web they weave when they choose to deceive. So what now skeptics? You still think #pizzagate has been &quot;debunked&quot;? You still think it is &quot;fake news&quot;? Again, I am just barely scratching the surface here. I made no mention of the creepy spirit-cooking and I did not post any of the creepy images with the creepy comments by Alefantis, nor did I post the uber creepy videos of &quot;victims&quot; Heavy Breathing or Sex Stains. I wrote all of this just off the top of my head, spending a majority of my time looking up links to post for verification.</p>
<p>Here is another link to Joe Rogan talking about it with Alex Jones that brings up a few more tidbits that the MSM isn\'t going to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qTWU0v1WPjM">https://youtu.be/qTWU0v1WPjM</a></p>
<p>So before you go calling #pizzagate reseacher tinfoil hat wearing nutjobs, try researching it for yourselves and stop depending on the mainstream media, which I am sure most of you haven\'t even bothered to read. You just hear the NY Times debunked it and that was good enough for you.</p>
<p>Go ahead and try to debate me in the comments, but you better know your shit, because I don\'t tolerate fools or trolls.</p>

            Yes that is very good. Only thing I would add is the mural in the bathroom (I think he referenced a naked man playing ping pong?) But the mural in the bathroom of a guy jerking off that was left up apparently for some time. In an adult club maybe but in a child friendly restaurant?? What parent wants their kid to see something depicting a guy jerking off??

            , could you add the links to the FB post you are quoting as well as the crappy article by the NYT (archived) you reference? That would really solidify this. Thanks.

             It is not perfect. I'd encourage necessary changes. While I can see how connections to Brock should leave open the possibility, that is purely speculative.

            Im giving you advice. Mods are going on crazy deleting sprees. If this gets deleted, don't give up. They won't reply to messeges or comments and detailed explanations why they're deleting.

            I'm tired of the censorship and shadowbanning on VOAT. We came here from reddit for this exact reason, and we've come to far to switch platforms now.
