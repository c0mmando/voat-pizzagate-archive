<p>This is absurd. This guy wants to \'debunk\' pizzagate, an investigation about a possible pedophile ring that includes people close to the Clintons and likely the Clintons themselves, by pointing out the relationship between Jeff Epstein and <em>Trump</em>?</p>
<p>As far as I\'m aware, Trump traveled to Epstein\'s island <em>once</em> and never went back. Furthermore, when a complaint was made that Epstein was making advances on an underage girl at one of Trump\'s clubs, Trump banned him from the club for life (I believe this was after Trump\'s trip to the island but I don\'t have an exact timeline). Meanwhile, Bill Clinton traveled to this island 26 times, leaving Secret Service behind on several occasions, and Hillary went there half a dozen times herself.</p>
<p>What is wrong with these idiots? You want to criticize Trump\'s connection to Epstein when it was entirely unclear that he knew anything about the actual pedophilia? Fine. But to do that as a way to suggest that people should be looking at Trump <em>instead of</em> the Clintons is pure insanity.</p>',
