<p><strong>Brief overview of Magick</strong></p>
<p>In Western esotericism there are two general categories of magick, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path_and_right-hand_path">left and the right hand paths</a> the distinctions can be pretty blurry, but in general the right is relatively... neutral in its actions which the left endorses full scale black magick (including human sacrifice). Freemasonry, general, is an example of the right hand path, the Temple of Set is an example of the left. </p>
<p>For many of the left hand path sects the way to ensure the strongest magicks is through perversion, blasphemy, the breaking of taboo etc. This is a fairly standard perception throughout cultures: you can gain power via breaking the rules and laws, but that comes with great risk. This isn\'t specific to christian symbology, this extends fully. Symbology used by white wiccans, or benevolent folk magick is just as useful as symbology stemming from any other faith or system. </p>
<p>In short, take a symbol that is good and use it for something wicked, in doing so you can bring forth more power. Hopefully this makes sense up to this point. </p>
<p><strong>Connection to DC</strong></p>
<p>Aleister Crowley ties into the elite circles of the US. A particularly interesting \'coincidence\' would be George Bush\'s grandmother giving birth to him 8-9 months after being involved with Crowley\'s sex magick (Check out the <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread333028/pg5">pictures</a>). Crowley was very influential in western esotercism and heavily influenced a number of left hand adherants including Michael Aquino and Anton Lavey. </p>
<p>A month ago a fellow here posted this:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1451794">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1451794</a> </p>
<p>Michael Aquino, ex-military PSYOPS, founded the Temple of Set and is at the very least on good terms with the Order of the Nine Angles as his commentary [here] shows(http://www.trapezoid.org/thought/commentary.html). Allegedly abused children, and considering his involvement with ToS and O9A I\'d say it\'s pretty much guaranteed, hell the O9A genuinely endorses killing and abusing children for ritual purposes. This guy was balls deep in military/CIA shit and he is <a href="http://exposinginfragard.blogspot.co.nz/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html">bad</a></p>
<p>You might want to also consider that Cathy O\'Brian claimed to have been abused by Hillary Clinton, following MKULTRA with Aquino himself. </p>
<p>There is allegedly a lot of occult based symbology going on in and around washington DC (<a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/chapter3/">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/chapter3/)</a>). Some of this will be due to right hand path people doing weird shit, but I\'d bet good money that a significant chunk is on the left hand. </p>
<p>Then of course there are the things that most in \'conspiracy\' circles are well aware of. The bushes and clintons involvement with the occult practices at Bohemian Grove; where they conduct ritualistic offerings to Minerva. Minerva is symbolised by an owl. This might seem harmless, but considering that a good chunk of those involved with Bohemian Grove also frequented Epstein\'s island where they keep a statue of a Bull/Cow and a strange temple it\'s simple to put two and two together and come out with Minerva and Moloch. The worship of Moloch is indisputably left hand. Minerva seems closer to the right. So we have a large of chunk of the global elite seemingly involved in both left and right paths. </p>
<p>Which leads to the line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With fingers crossed, the old rabbit\'s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crossing of fingers symbolises not just luck, but the crossing of paths. </p>
<p>An old rabbits foot is a staple of folk magic and superstition, it is the right path. </p>
<p>The sacrifice of a chicken (which could well be a metaphor) is the left path. </p>
<p>So we have the crossing of paths through the ritualistic tainting of a right path symbol during a left path sacrificial ceremony. </p>
<p>I\'ve seen plenty of people claim this is just some kind of inside joke. Personally I don\'t know many people who would, in jest, manage to make solid reference to actual ritualistic practice. You have to either be familiar with the practice itself or be an example of <em>extraordinary coincidence</em>. </p>
<p>Furthermore anyone well versed in that shit isn\'t going to be running around making jokes about it unless they are way down the left hand path. The symbolic use and act of directing your energy towards it gives it legitimacy even in the abscence of the ritual itself. So spending your time consciously focusing on it is not something that people opposed to the right hand path would do. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It looks like occult ritual, it sounds like occult ritual, it reads like occult ritual, the people recieving it have ties to the occult and the \'joke\' only makes sense in reference to the occult. The occult is linked to washington DC heavily and into the circles at BG and Epsteins island. Not to mention spirit cooking which is blatant as fuck left path. So, if it\'s just a joke as the <a href="Ihttp://www.thediplomad.com/2016/03/oh-stooooooooopidity.html">sender himself claims</a> it might be wise to explain why it was uncannily accurate.</p>',

             The reason I recognise the Moloch line as a ritualistic description is due to my first hand experience in occult circles. Those I integrated were closer to the right path but they were well versed in the application and theory of the left.

            I firmly believe all these people are worshipping Satan.  I can't see any of them taking the 'right path'.  In fact, what's the point of taking the right path at all--aren't you simply a Christian who believes in kindness, compassion and love if you take the right path?

            If they are wanting to subvert, create chaos, groom and sexualise our children, foist pedophilia on us, create wars, I'm assuming the Illuminati wanting to install a new world order are taking the left path?  Is all magick (left and right path) about worship of Satan?  Do the Illuminati believe that Satan is an alien?

            If Freemasons also carry out ritual abuse, aren't they taking the left path (you say they take the right path)?

             Yeah Christianity (depending on the branch, but generally) falls into the right hand path. Symbolism, ritual, focused energies, that's all there in the Church. There are others are right path and not abrahamic in origin, technically there should be plenty of those from hermetic traditions that are on the right hand as well. Unfortunately a huge proportion of the hermetic groups are infiltrated or created by left hand path adherents (to the extent where I personally assume anyone from those groups is left hand unless I have
             <em>
              very
             </em>
             good reasons to believe otherwise).

             I've known a few white wiccans who were definitely not Satan worshippers. That being said most people are only going to turn to magick for a reason, and that reason will almost always be to
             <em>
              obtain power that they do not have
             </em>
             . Mix that with a bit of arrogance and you have a recipe for disaster ("I can cantrol it"). They let dark things into their life, into their mind and they just sit their whispering to you. Eventually it catches on. Sure you might get some power, but the cost is always too great. Yet the temptation remains.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no idea what truly secret societies do, or do not believe. They may use ritual sacrifice and abuse as a means of attaining leverage and control, they may also actually believe it. Or they might night. As for what they might think the dark ones are I don't really know. All I know is that after seeing people use that kind of power to do seemingly impossible things I (even though I'm an atheist) believe that at the very least there are things which can give people physical power that they
             <em>
              should not have
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The most dangerous aspect though is the use of such power to do good deeds. If I use power obtained through collusion with dark forces to perform an exorcism (which is very effective) then I appear good, while practicing evil. That's where things get concerning. How do you know who is good and who is evil masquerading as good? Without experiencing both sides it can be very difficult to tell.

             Yes. Any ritual abuse = left hand. It's sinister and malevolent in nature. That being said I've heard conflicting reports regarding freemasons. Some say ritual abuse is in all of them, some say its a schism where some do and some don't. Others says its something that you don't know till you're further up the chain. Personally I don't trust them lol.
