<p>I read a couple of articles recently about Chrissy Teigen and company disabling their twitter after being exposed for pizzagate-related material. While screenshots of tweets are better than nothing, it is better to have a third-party archive of the tweets. That way, people can\'t say they were photoshopped. If the tweets in question were deleted within the past 3-6 months, you may be able to recover them from a search engine that has a cache feature. To my knowledge, three that have this feature are google, bing, and yandex. I will give the instructions for google, but most search engines will operate similarly. When you go to one of the search engines, you can find all of the tweets for that particular account by typing in &quot;site:&quot; and then the twitter URL. (e.g. site:https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen) Also, check the mobile URL as some tweets may have only been cached with that version too. (e.g. site:https://mobile.twitter.com/chrissyteigen/) If you are looking for a specific tweet, you can put the search term in front. (e.g. pedo site:https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen) On the search results, it will include all of the old tweets. In order to open the old tweets, you will have to click on the down arrow to the right of the URL and right-click on cached. From there you will need to paste that cached URL into archive.is and the tweet will be archived permanently. Below are some of the tweets I archived for Chrissy Teigen. She had thousands of tweets so I didn\'t go through all of them.</p>

            This escalated quickly. I was on the fence with this all started with Chrissy Teigan and the more I looked at her stuff it became the same story as the investigation into James Alefantis. We want to find the key that tells us this is all a lie. The more we dig and find out this is all just a misunderstanding the more it appears not to be. Whey are you hashtagging the word "pedo" MULTIPLE times? Why would someone, or anyone do that? It just doesn't make sense. That sort of behavior doesn't add up.

             yeah, it's pretty fucking weird. i actually don't follow a lot of pop culture very closely if at all, and also i don't follow hellywood too closely either. so it seemed a very strange allegation when i first heard it. those tweets/hashtags are just too fucking weird tho. i mean what the hell does she mean? what else COULD it mean? any ideas? it looks pretty fucking brazen to me.

             Thanks for doing that. Could you list the tweets you archived and the archive URLs? Sometimes they are harder to find in the search feature on archive.is than you would think.

              but surely most people are clueless as to whether someone is a pedo or not. most of us are... this is pop culture, and most are just following vapid people like her without any thought process other than "she or he is cool" but once they are outed, and the truth comes out... then people will start being red pilled. its tough but this conversation came up last night among the younger set in our family... i just listened and most of them were like she is not a pedo people are mean (talking about the barage of tweets on her twitter yesterday)... but i just simply asked : how many of you put a pizza emoji next to your baby when you post a pic on Facebook? all of them just stopped, thought about it and then admitted that it was a little weird. I just smiled. baby steps.
