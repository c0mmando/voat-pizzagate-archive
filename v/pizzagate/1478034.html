<p><strong>Research paper 3 - Finding victims</strong></p>
<p>Finding victims is essential to breaking the case. People researching this must possess the utmost sensitivity and respect for the victims, and also take extreme precautions when it comes to their privacy (and ours).

            Like somebody else pointed out,  the feds are sitting on the Clinton Foundation leaks and have all the evidence they need.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they're all waiting for the global public to forget and move on to the next big trauma, so they can carry on  ''business''  as usual.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, these are the children of the world that have no voice.
            <br/>
            So,  I think it's a matter of standing up and demanding that those CF  leaks be brought to a full legal hearing, and that the Project Flicker be re-opened,  and the Franklin Scandal be re-opened on grounds that the pedo issues were never dealt with in regard to that case.

             Yes, I agree, but this investigation has to assume this is not going to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am asking for people here to collaborate on in depth research papers. As I said, I believe that will maximize the chance of success.
