<p>During his confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) asked Barr whether he would conduct a &quot;full and thorough investigation&quot; into the Justice Department\'s handling of Epstein\'s case, in particular, the non-prosecution agreement from 2008.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Senator, I have to recuse myself from Kirkland &amp; Ellis matters, I am told,&quot; Barr said at the time. &quot;And I think Kirkland &amp; Ellis was maybe involved in that case, so I need to sort out exactly what my role can be. I will say that if I\'m confirmed I\'ll make sure your questions are answered on this case.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>According to Law and Crime, Kirkland &amp; Ellis were involved in the Epstein case and the firm\'s senior partner Jay Lefkowitz is among the list of notable attorneys, which also includes Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who have once represented the billionaire.</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, the federal investigation into Epstein came to an end after he struck a controversial deal with prosecutors, pleading guilty to two Florida state prostitution charges, despite being accused of sexually abusing more than 30 minors. His possible life sentence was watered down to 13-months in Palm Beach County Jail, financial settlements to multiple victims and a requirement he register as a sex offender. </p>
<p>The deal also granted immunity to Epstein\'s co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta, reportedly oversaw the deal and has since defended the agreement as appropriate under the circumstances. In February, a federal judge ruled that Acosta illegally kept details of Epstein\'s plea deal from his victims.</p>

             I wonder if Barr himself was a student of Epstein. Quite often, children of a private school headmaster go to the same school.
This relationship is KEY to the Epstein case and would be a good reason Barr is now AG. Is this why he UNRECUSED himself? Does he personally know something about Epstein?

             Epstein didn't have a degree, but was hired nevertheless by Donald Barr.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which begs the question whether he knew him before he applied, or whether he even suggested to Epstein to work at the school.
