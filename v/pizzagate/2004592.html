<p>I so wanted to do a post on this bitch. Her name came to prominence back in 2010, and now she’s being touted as presidential material. Well, if being a whore and spreading her legs is the criteria for being the democratic candidate for the President of the United States, then, hell yeah! She’s qualified. But we’ve had enough of those prostituting themselves in office, don’t you think? It’s why I believe it’s time to think and act strategically. The press aka Propaganda Machine is doing their best to advance the narrative that the loud mouthed bitch should be the candidate in 2020. I say, let’s not let that idea gain traction and it’s why I’m writing this post. This is my effort to undercover what this scummy follower of The Cannibal Queen is all about. There are several sticking points that will knock her out of contention, most especially her refusal to interfere in the handing over of a child to a non-biological father. Both she and Jerry Brown have done nothing to return that child to his biological mother … but let’s start at the “beginning” of her political career and why I’m categorizing her as “a complete whore”. </p>
<p>Ms. Harris received national recognition in 2010. It’s the year she won the primary for California’s Attorney General. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-the-female-obama-wins-primary-for-california-attorney-general">http://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-the-female-obama-wins-primary-for-california-attorney-general</a> </p>
<p>Naturally, it was the libtard Daily Beast that advanced the agenda of positioning this player on the chessboard by suggesting she was the “female Obama”. They even likened both of them to having a “greyhound physique”? WTF? That big-eared, triangle-headed man that occupied the White House has a “greyhound physique”? I object on behalf of greyhound’s everywhere, but then, I evidently don’t smoke what this faux news outlet’s writers do. Ironically, Ms. Harris’ body does come into play. How? Well, it has to do with how she even got on the ballot.  Did it have to do with her brilliant mind? Her scruples , principles and honor? Her morality and stalwart positioning on doing what is right? No! It had to do with something as crass and base as picking out an old corrupt shell of a man and giving the old geezer a go in bed. </p>
<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/06/at-dem-convention-kamala-harris-demands-opportunity-open-to-everyone-but-had-special-career-help-from-powerful-boyfriend/">http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/06/at-dem-convention-kamala-harris-demands-opportunity-open-to-everyone-but-had-special-career-help-from-powerful-boyfriend/</a></p>
<p>Yes, Willie Brown was the old geezer selected, and it was Willie Brown behind Ms. Harris’ rise to through the ranks because of her exploits through the sheets. She sure is inspiring for young women. Forget about having a work ethic when you can just suck some codger’s dick. Here’s some background: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/06/at-dem-convention-kamala-harris-demands-opportunity-open-to-everyone-but-had-special-career-help-from-powerful-boyfriend/">http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/06/at-dem-convention-kamala-harris-demands-opportunity-open-to-everyone-but-had-special-career-help-from-powerful-boyfriend/</a> </p>
<p>The Brown-Harris affair didn’t last long. She was spotted dating talk show host Montel Williams in 2001, but Brown continued to support her, helping her as mayor to become San Francisco’s first black district attorney over Terence Hallinan, a popular two-term incumbent. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as for the 2010 election that The Daily Beast lauds …. hmmmm …. her win is questionable: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harris was narrowly elected California’s Attorney General in 2010. The election was widely seen as fraudulent, according to John Fund, co-author of the 2012 book “Who’s Counting?: How Fraudsters and Bureaucrats Put Your Vote at Risk.”
Despite voter registration rolls that showed Democrats outnumbering Republicans statewide by some thirteen percent, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley led Harris by 34,000 votes after more than 7 million were counted. But after provisional ballots were counted, she was declared the winner by approximately 50,000 votes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Willie Brown proves the saying, “There’s no fool like an old fool,” by still championing her. </p>
<p><a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/06/18/kamala-harris-jeff-sessions-senate-debate-willie-brown-san-francisco-mayor">http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/06/18/kamala-harris-jeff-sessions-senate-debate-willie-brown-san-francisco-mayor</a> </p>
<p>So she was artificially buoyed to the national level, but how is she staying there? Let’s get into the second of the talking points outlined above, and that is, how she’s funding her war chest and her links to Dennis Hastert. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tortreform.com/news/trial-lawyers-helping-calif-ag-financially-dominate-gop-challengers">https://www.tortreform.com/news/trial-lawyers-helping-calif-ag-financially-dominate-gop-challengers</a> </p>
<p>With the weight of her war chest alone, California Attorney General Kamala Harris might be able to crush her four Republican challengers … 
Harris’ campaign finance reports show she received contributions from dozens of attorneys, including trial lawyers from out-of-state law firms.
Last February alone, eight donations came from the Dickstein Shapiro law firm and its attorneys.
Dickstein Shapiro, based in Washington, D.C., is also a lobbying group with six offices across the U.S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she’s CRUSHING her Republican opposition through these donations, and they’re coming from out-of-state law firms? Anybody else find this odd? I did so I looked up these douchebags at Dickstein Shapiro LLC to find out a little about them. Lo and behold this scumbag outfit was the one where DENNIS HASTERT WAS EMPLOYED! Here’s the announcement of his joining the firm in WaPoo: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/30/AR2008053002852.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/30/AR2008053002852.html</a></p>
<p>Saturday, May 31, 2008 
Former House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) has agreed to join the lobbying law firm Dickstein Shapiro as a senior adviser, the District-based firm said yesterday. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how did that work out for them? Let’s see: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/hasterts_lobbying_firm_rocked_by_his_indictment-242076-1.html">http://www.rollcall.com/news/hasterts_lobbying_firm_rocked_by_his_indictment-242076-1.html</a></p>
<p>Posted Jun 1, 2015 12:00 AM. Ex-Speaker J. Dennis Hastert’s sudden resignation from his K Street firm is the latest and most public setback for Dickstein Shapiro, a shop already scrambling to rebuild amid a client exodus, tumbling lobbying revenue and high-profile employee departures. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the exodus was so massive, that Dickstein Shapiro were forced to close their doors. Kind of puts a tear in your eye, doesn’t it?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>February 17, 2016. Dickstein Shapiro shuts its doors for good after revenue lags, lawyers defect. </p>
<p>A drumbeat of lagging revenue and high-level departures caught up with one of Washington’s major law firms last week as Dickstein Shapiro closed its doors and went out of business</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, but don’t be too sad. Like in Pedowood and other fairy tale lands, the Cannibal Elite never really let their brethren down. It’s all a show and so up steps Blank Rome to the rescue! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/269188-blank-rome-buys-out-struggling-dc-firm">http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/269188-blank-rome-buys-out-struggling-dc-firm</a></p>
<p>02/11/16 06:26 PM EST. The law firm Blank Rome has acquired Dickstein Shapiro, taking on more than 100 attorneys.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“But WTF is Blank Rome?” Sleepy Beauty asks upon awakening from a twenty-year sleep. 
“Why they’re the scumbags that defended Penn State during the Jerry Sandusky sex/child abuse scandal … now go back to sleep!” the wizard ordered. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/667192/pennsylvania-powerhouse-blank-rome">https://www.law360.com/articles/667192/pennsylvania-powerhouse-blank-rome</a> </p>
<p>Hoffman himself has been at the head of one of the firm’s most significant litigation matters, representing Penn State University trustee Joel Myers in his effort — along with others connected to the university and state government — to roll back sanctions imposed by the NCAA in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. The organization lifted most of its sanctions in January.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aw, isn’t that sweet? I mean, why should mean ole sanctions be made against innocent Penn State? Ridiculous, right? </p>
<p>It’s good to know that Kamala Harris’ war chest can still be filled, but what about those donations? Why would an out-of-state lobbyist want to give money to an attorney general like Harris? I saved you the trouble of speculating. Here’s something the NYT wrote back when they were reporting news and not spewing propaganda: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html</a></p>
<p>OCT. 28, 2014.  Lobbyists, Bearing Gifts, Pursue Attorneys General</p>
<p>A lawyer for 5-Hour Energy roamed the event, setting her sights on Attorney General Chris Koster of Missouri, whose office was one of those investigating the company.
“My client just received notification that Missouri is on this,” the lawyer, Lori Kalani, told him.
Ms. Kalani’s firm, Dickstein Shapiro, had courted the attorney general at dinners and conferences and with thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. Mr. Koster told Ms. Kalani that he was unaware of the investigation, and he reached for his phone and called his office. By the end of the weekend, he had ordered his staff to pull out of the inquiry, a clear victory for 5-Hour Energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read further, you’ll see that these “donations” are currying favor with the attorney generals to stop pesky lawsuits from proceeding. But that’s illegal, isn’t it? Not anymore. Whether this was why the money was given to Willie Brown’s former bedmate, I can’t say and will leave it to you to figure out.</p>',

           In fact, the exodus was so massive, that Dickstein Shapiro were forced to close their doors. Kind of puts a tear in your eye, doesn’t it?

            February 17, 2016. Dickstein Shapiro shuts its doors for good after revenue lags, lawyers defect.

            A drumbeat of lagging revenue and high-level departures caught up with one of Washington’s major law firms last week as Dickstein Shapiro closed its doors and went out of business

           Oh, but don’t be too sad. Like in Pedowood and other fairy tale lands, the Cannibal Elite never really let their brethren down. It’s all a show and so up steps Blank Rome to the rescue!

           “But WTF is Blank Rome?” Sleepy Beauty asks upon awakening from a twenty-year sleep. 
“Why they’re the scumbags that defended Penn State during the Jerry Sandusky sex/child abuse scandal … now go back to sleep!” the wizard ordered.

            Hoffman himself has been at the head of one of the firm’s most significant litigation matters, representing Penn State University trustee Joel Myers in his effort — along with others connected to the university and state government — to roll back sanctions imposed by the NCAA in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. The organization lifted most of its sanctions in January.

           It’s good to know that Kamala Harris’ war chest can still be filled, but what about those donations? Why would an out-of-state lobbyist want to give money to an attorney general like Harris? I saved you the trouble of speculating. Here’s something the NYT wrote back when they were reporting news and not spewing propaganda:

           <p>
            A lawyer for 5-Hour Energy roamed the event, setting her sights on Attorney General Chris Koster of Missouri, whose office was one of those investigating the company.
“My client just received notification that Missouri is on this,” the lawyer, Lori Kalani, told him.
Ms. Kalani’s firm, Dickstein Shapiro, had courted the attorney general at dinners and conferences and with thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. Mr. Koster told Ms. Kalani that he was unaware of the investigation, and he reached for his phone and called his office. By the end of the weekend, he had ordered his staff to pull out of the inquiry, a clear victory for 5-Hour Energy.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           If you read further, you’ll see that these “donations” are currying favor with the attorney generals to stop pesky lawsuits from proceeding. But that’s illegal, isn’t it? Not anymore. Whether this was why the money was given to Willie Brown’s former bedmate, I can’t say and will leave it to you to figure out.

            I am wondering why this isn't hitting HOT page status? and all the crap posts burying it from NEW. I've noticed this before with your posts, Quantokitty, full of good new info but not getting deserved exposure. I think you are being intentionally buried. Today has a influx of dubious posts by new members with immediate commentary by other new members we've this seen before as a tactic to seed shills. Anyway, just wanted to point this out. I think this post should be flared important.

              keep doing it,  your work is important, &amp; in my opinion, worthy of a larger audience. Even just a simple link cross posted on

            Great Post! For those unaware Kamela Harris is a senator being groomed for the presidency, she is a lying, curruption b***tch. As shown in Op's post. She is a puppet of HRC, Soros &amp; Obama. She has been censured several times in congress for attacking witnesses. Do some more digging on her.

             Thanks. Yes, a total puppet, and I'm only getting started. Her covering up for pedos is enough to nauseate anyone. And the human trafficking case? That alone should drive her out of politics and make her unfit to hold office.
