            The rules on the left of the page:
           </p>
           <p>
            (1) ALL submissions should be directly related to Pizzagate, and this is how we define Pizzagate. It is the responsibility of the poster to demonstrate relevance. In most cases this will require a Discussion post where you provide a brief explanation of how your content relates to the investigation. Sometimes there will be content (like an article on Pizzagate) where a link post with an accurate, descriptive title will be enough to satisfy this requirement.
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) EVERY claim that is made as part of your post needs to be sourced. If you are asking a question, give a brief summary of what led to your question, and provide sources for those elements. If you are giving an explanation of how your content relates to Pizzagate (satisfying Rule 1), and you need to connect a few dots to do so, please provide sources for your "dots". If you wish to ask general questions about Pizzagate, please do so HERE.
           </p>
           <p>
            (3) LINK posts (VIDEO, IMAGE, ARTICLE, etc.) all need to include an accurate description of the actual content. If you can't provide an accurate summary in the title of a Link post then you must submit it as a Discussion post where you provide the link with a brief description of the content.
           </p>
           <p>
            (4) META submissions and general discussion submissions without sources will be removed. To avoid diluting the front page, please make those sorts of submissions HERE. Please bring any meta concerns you have HERE (this is also where the mods will discuss moderating the sub, so you are welcome to participate in those conversations as well).
           </p>
           <p>
            (5) Standalone MEMES will be removed. Please post standalone memes HERE. If you feel that a given meme can be used to raise awareness, please link it as part of a Discussion post where you source the elements that it is related to and discuss the best ways to use it. If you want to discuss the accuracy of a meme, again, link it in a Discussion post that sources the relevant elements from the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            (6) NSFW submissions (gore, nudity, etc.) must be labeled as such. This is not an adult subverse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adspam, illegal content, and personal info about Voat subscribers will be removed, and the offender will be banned.

            Please review BEFORE you submit content. Submissions not meeting these requirements will be removed and you will be asked to resubmit your post after making the relevant changes.
