            I've thought about this too. The investigation is going deeper, and information is slowly spreading, but how do people avoid this becoming another 911 conversation? Get too extreme, and the subject becomes discredited. Go to slow, and the subject fades away. There needs to be a clear and focused strategy that will deliver the one two punch that's needed to blow it open completely. So far that hasn't happened. The emails and pizzagate just cracked the shell. The most obvious evidence that got me into this stuff were the emails, that messed up video, and the pizzagate evidence, like the Instragram stuff, and just the nature of that restaurant and owner in general. If that info got me into this, perhaps we can start really pushing that more and demand explanations. Push the most obvious and damning evidence to get more people interested. Other than that, this investigation needs some actual hard undeniable proof. That's just the only way it's going to work. But who is going to find that proof? Are there people in the FBI, CIA, other organization or Trump that are actually looking for proof or have it already? If they do, why haven't they shown it to the public? Could it be that they are quietly trying to take this whole thing down? Or are they doing nothing at all? How would we know for sure? Is anybody willing to try and find proof themselves? The investigation generated a lot of names and locations. Surely somebody can get their own photo or video evidence. How hard could it be? Or is there too much heat now any all the suspects are laying low? The hard part would be somebody actually having the will to leave the comfort zone of their life, and spend a considerable amount of time traveling the US or Washington DC to find this evidence. So many questions right now. I wish I knew more.

            OP's "sober" realism seems a little drama queeny but does have a point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being a perv trafficker pedo or evil agent of corruption (all of which I think jimmy comet and pedostas are) is not the same thing as eating babies until proven so. It's enough to go after the trafficking pedophilia and pimping. And leave moloch and Satan versus lucifer talks to the freaks that do that anyway with their own weird agendas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and the money, no doubt lots of illegal things being done with money.

             Top 3?
Thats difficult to pin down, but general advice from GG is no witch hunts, no harrassing people, keep pushing online until it's next to impossible to deny the truth, keep a level head and work the evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of the harder stuff will be, don't give anyone an opening of attacking your credibility, (funny coming from someone with dodgey spelling due to mistyping and laziness I know), and try and don't get caught up with crazies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even harder still, especially because this is a touchy subject but we need to find humour, we need to meme our detractors into submission, any one that isnt implicated but defends these fucks needs to be laughed out of the room.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know this is real, we know its happening, we need to have the confidence to laugh at anyone that; after being shown the evidence, still tries to shut down the discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Humour and bants will win this. Even though its fucking disgusting... we need to find humour here somewhere

            Yes and so with evidence you now have something to show people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the deal, you have to craft your presentation in such a way that people you speak to make their own way there.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you had said to me 12 months ago that the entire US government is being coopted by a group of kiddy fucking cannibals with intents on subverting the global population into ine giant labor and rape farm, I would have laughed you out of the room and pissed on your infowars.com t-shirt.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I have seen enough compelling evidence if my own accord to believe thats quite a probable scenario.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, not everyone has seen what you have seen, and you haven't seen what I have seen. There are still way too many people approaching this with a cold open, where as perceptions are only formed where they are led by observation.

            Thats all I'm saying is, get people talking, drop little crumbs of new knowledge on them, people love to gossip and get fired up... we need normies to get fired up.

            They can and will if the presentation is unpalatable.

           <p>
            An example, say 911 was done by a government, heck the US government, do you think that's something people would want to tolerate more or less than kiddy fuckers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Look around, 911 truthers cant be heard either way because the convo is already dead. They have become a joke because of their insane presentation.

             Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth is populated by over 2800 very cogent and credentialed experts. They can't help it if the six behemoth corporations who own and operate 90% of everything most people see or read choose to ignore them in entirety. They are not remotely a joke but rather another beacon of light in a dark and upside down world. Their presentation is excellent and comprehensible to anyone with a semblance of reason, but I trust your not one of those folk.

               A typical criminal court case to determine the guilt or innocence of one man can take weeks or months of court testimony and require the presentation of thousands of pages of evidence. To remotely do justice to a presentation intended to determine 9/11 truth with the precision one would expect in a court of law would require more presentation than the aforementioned by perhaps by orders of magnitude. The problem with those who still believe a rag tag group of illiterates pulled off the most sophisticated covert non-state sponsored operation in the history of man is that they don't make the effort to actually research, and nothing I can provide you with is going to change that, so I have to respectfully decline.

                 You slid your own thread and completely discredited it by implying that 9/11 happened essentially as you were told by the six mega-corporations that control all media. And your request is ridiculous on every level. There are literally tens of thousands of individual bits of information and potential sources to cite, many that come from retired and active duty pilots, engineers, physicists, fireman, police, military, and ordinary citizens, and virtually all of them are devastating evidence of collusion among the PTB to effect 9/11, but you think I'm going to pull the
                 <strong>
                  one
                 </strong>
                 magic rabbit out of a hat here and now that finally sways you, or your friends. By my reckoning, you don't even acknowledge that the official 9/11 narrative is disputed by real people. Either you are a piss poor researcher or a classic disinformation agent. Regardless, I don't need preparation for what's to come because of 9/11. You do.

             Okay but here's my point, if these people are as powerful as they are, do you not think they have the resources and manpower to coopt a fledgling movement? These people infiltrate highly secure govermment facilities and terrorist organisations for breakfast. They can't infiltrate a sane conversation with people you know though.

              yeah we can't underestimate the depth of subversion. I can't really see how anything could possibly stop the volcano from erupting eventually. they can delay and slow the overall process but preventing the end? nope

               But if all that turn up are shills and trouble makers... well.. by the time the word gets out everyone you know already is skeptical enough to see the media as liars and the trohblemakers and shills for what they are.
              </p>
              <p>
               The people involved already know we are here, they are watching us all on this forum, daily.
              </p>
              <p>
               So it's better they are stuck watching as the people you know are redpilled around them

             Thank you. Shitty MS paint infographics and running around shouting at people who just wanna grab a slice with their families isn't going to get people on your side.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are still a huge majority of people who dont know what pizzagate is, we can't be harrassing these people just cause they want a pepperoni pizza...
            </p>
            <p>
             Pedos are already socially unacceptable, so you know you're not going to change hearts and minds with a show of people at a pizza place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think about it, who are we trying to convince? Regular people... the protest isn't a nuanced conversation, it's unwieldy, difficult to control who says what, and you have to realise if the people we are up against are the same people who topple govermments for a living, do you really think yoir little protest is gonna go smoothly?

              I'm with you on that. I was simply shown the comet photos and podesta paintings and was asked what i thought of them, then i redpilled myself. Plus, why are they protesting at comet, everyone there in the neighborhood is cia or a pedosatanic cannibal and in on it.

            I'm not talking to investigators and diggers, thatwould be clear if you actually took a breath and read what i said.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am talking to the nutjobs screamimg about how they are grinding up kids and putting them in hamburgers and how they are trying to summon moloch.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am on the same page as you, we have all worked too hard to have stupid shit like a coopted public protest destroy the credibility of the real evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a little mental exercise for you:
What do occupiers, 911 truthers, ufo abductees, chemtrailers, preppers, tea baggers, illuminati truthers have in common?
They are the butt of jokes.
Gamergaters? Not so much, they got shit done. The media has a big bloodied nose, feminism has a big bloodied nose, sjws have a big bloodied nose, the UN has a big bloodied nose.
Gamergate did that.

            Ok, first off spelling errors galore! Second, too much anger, so I am guessing this was posted by a Pedo or ProPedo! Jake Tapper is this you?

             Did you miss the bit where I am giving you solid tactic advice? We need to pivot away from public protests, I mean did you even see the PG rally at CPP? I, and many others have worked too hard building dossiers to have shitheads run around with a plastic tarp cape banging pots and pans, shouting about pepperoni and tacos, ruin this.
            </p>

             So, no, fuck you. You are a shill, but I can only presume you're doing it for free.

              You come across like Beck, hot under the collar and rubber room ready.
I agree that the UFO shit is total BS! 
However, we who know that pizzagate is true, do not like being told what not to do by someone who obviously has no clue what all these Elite Pedos freaks do.

               know pizzagate is true.. well that's all that matters right? Oh wait you don't have mind control so you'll have to rely on your innate charm and persuasive skills... fuck.. forgot who I was talking to.
              </p>
              <p>
               Imagine you are someone completely cold to the whole idea, you have no clue what pizzagate is and then imagine, how might you be convinced of this? What evidence, what discussion, would convince you? How would you react to the way it was framed?
              </p>
              <p>
               Take UFOs for example, imagine the type of conversation, evidence and presentation it would take to convince you...
              </p>
              <p>
               Apply those principles to how you approach this... lemme guess a news story about a collection of spergs shouting about ufos wouldnt do it, would it?

                First, if you do not get the truth out there it will not matter what you do.
So, sugarcoating this Evil will backfire!
So leaving out the satanic rituals and eating kids is lying. These freaking fucks really do this Evil shit!
Once, you leave holes in your message the opposition will swipe in and use it to discredit your whole message.
I have not seen a believer in pizzagate push UFOs or the brother crap. That is more inline with shills.
All you can do is keep putting the truth about pizzagate out there.

                 I understand you, but ever remember those tv shows where there is a premise of the evil innocent lookijg kid, or the creepy neighbor but everyone else doesnt see him burying bodies inntbe backyard or whatever.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Remember those shows? If you start ranting at people about stuff outside of their realm they cant relate and so they dismiss it..
                </p>
                <p>
                 Think of it like a path or a bridge, you need to start at the side they are on and lead them across, you're not lying you're presenting the truth in a way that can be digested..
                </p>
                <p>
                 You start talking to people about how more and more people in power are being found to be pedos and as the evidence surfaces the more likely they are going to believe the next round of evidence
