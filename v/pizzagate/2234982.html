           <p>
            I posted this on reddit, but no one seems to want to respond and discuss the issues I raise :( so I'm going ng to post it here, too, hoping to get some responses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, show of hands of people who actually read the entire court filing. I have a bunch of issues I want to discuss!
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Is this George Webb Sweigert? The filing says he resides in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but also states he is registered to vote in Oregon so that could support the LinkedIn profile being the right person. (Side note: isn't it illegal to reside in one state and be registered to vote in another? If so, not sure why one would want to admit that in a court filing.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I don't see any mention of any law firm in the filing. Is Sweigert going to represent himself and the various Jane and John Does from every congressional district in the country? Assuming the Sweigert whose LinkedIn profile I linked to is the same guy, he isn't an attorney. I know a defendant can choose to represent them self with out representation of a barred attorney, but can anyone act as an attorney for the purpose of filing a class action suit? I thought that was the reason attorneys had to be barred in jurisdictions.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Neither of the Clintons are listed as defendants in the case. Thoughts?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The filing states that ARMZ Uranium Holding Company was established by the principals of the podesta group in 2012. Wikipedia states that the company was founded in 1992 and is the wholly owned subsidiary of another group who itself is wholly owned by the Russian government. Can anyone explain that or why Sweigert would get that information wrong in his filing?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This memo attached, Sweigert makes an attempt to argue that the prosecution hasn't been successfully following its responsibilities and requests that the court allow him to take over prosecution. I assume he is referring to the Imran Awan case. That case is in the preliminary stages so I don't see how one can argue that prosecution has acted irresponsibly just yet, but I guess you could try. Then, at the end of the memo it seems like the whole point of the memo was to simply request that the court take into consideration the use of Andre Taggart as a witness in, again, what I am guessing is the Awan case. Does anyone think differently?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In support of his memo he lists various sources of information and supposed statements of fact, yet he doesn't include any of those documents as evidence for his claim. In fact, it appears in regards to his claims of the occupation of Suraiya Begum, he is starting that he is certain he can prove that she does what he claims she does if he is allowed access to information that he believes will prove his claim. That's an odd line of thinking. Thoughts?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              After all of that, the jury demand and the memo, Sweigert attaches just two pieces to be entered in as evidence. Both news articles with one being an investigative opinion piece. Am I wrong or alone in thinking that is some pretty thin evidence to back the claims you made in your filing?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              While this filing definitely left me at times confused and scratching my head, I hope it is allowed to proceed. There are so many claims made. He claims fraud, espionage, illegal wiretapping, bribery, blackmail, probably illegal collusion with foreign governments, what I assume is illegal weapons dealing, and more things I probably missed. He makes a lot of claims. Thankfully, though, the US court system is not reddit where one is assumed to be guilty until they can prove their innocence. If he has the evidence to back his claims up as he says he does, let him make his case and attempt to prove the defendants guilty. It's put up or shut up time.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>

            These are all Spoliation letters. The lawsuit is simply to hold the evidence including pizzagate, organ trafficking, money laundering, Uranium trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were served to over 500 members of congress and Senate, to the Podesta’s, HRC, Clinton Foundation, FBI/JTTF, Awan Spy Ring, Uzbek Uranium truck drivers, MPDC police, The US DOJ, DA is many states who are implicated, law enforcement agencies, homeland security, etc, etc

            He is not Mossad you guys have been taken on a ride that was intentionally said to throw people off who were issuing death threats...
           </p>
           <p>
            We served them almost two weeks ago in silence after gathering over 10,000 evidence pieces, video, photographs, Whistleblower testimony from inside FBI, CIA, NSA, and others on film.

                Who's protecting him and keeping him from being silenced?

                As a targeted individual, what were they doing to him? Microwave technology or what?

              <li>

             SWEIGERT is the name everybody has always said is Webb's real last name unless that is a lie too. Considering that Awan and Huma are named I'm thinking it is the same George.

            Webb is a spook and his material is of no use. Webb said months and months ago that any CIA or FBI should reveal their info beacuse arrest were going to start and they might as well be on the right side. I laughed at him then and he is even more useless now. There was no investigation, it was being covered up, so how could arrest be starting soon? Worthless old Mossad spook.

            I like GW, and I am his friend on fb. We used to text back and forth more before he became too popular.

            I do not fully trust him, especially since admittedly avoids 9/11 and Mossad. He also avoids pizzagate. But, to his credit, he will acknowledge all of these things when pressed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the things he says about the law, lawsuits, pizzagate, and Podesta don't make sense at all. On the other hand, no one can deny that he has an autistic level of understanding about a 1000 different cases of intertwined deep state corruption cases (and some insiders feeding him info).

            Webb has done more for investigations of the elite scum than anyone else. He has revealed many bits of info that have been proven true. Haters are going to hate, I know but he has helped.

             I have a hard time getting over the Mossad connection. I also wonder why they have not fried his brain or stopped his heart with microwave technology, or something. He seems to be allowed to operate with impunity like most people cannot. He hasn't done anything terrible but there is just something about him that makes me leary. And like I said, Mossad...

              Any more on microwaves being used like this? I've been reading about high frequency stock trading and how they switched from fiber optic lines to microwave to send buy/sell orders.... just want to know more of what the tech is capable of out of curiosity.

             Nothing is happening. Not a word about the Satanic CIA pedo rape torture murder ring. You are being played. We are not winning, they are not sweating it and they are not going to jail. Weistein is crude with women. Doesn't sound like the Satanic CIA pedo cult of DC to me. The entire system including the media is involved in this.

             Agreed. Mossad. Never gonna be able to trust this guy. - Doesn't anybody else find it odd that this fucker always shows up when OTHER SHIT is about to hit the fan? - - Just, ... can't trust him. I want to. But I can't let myself believe. - I'll be the first to retract when his shit turns out to be legit.

                How did DonkyButtHole escape that loony cell again? Honestly we can do without your filth here defiling every page you comment on!  Your handlers need to be in custody, they are not doing their job right!....or are they? Maybe that is their purpose.....agitation, and disinformation.  But still.  After all these months you'd think they see no one BELIEVES YOU!  📢 Hi
