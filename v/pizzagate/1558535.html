<p>I have been on the Pizzagate train from the very beginning and it has enlightened me to the world of conspiracy theories, many more like reality theories in my opinion. Since the Podesta emails broke my eyes have been opened to a whole new world that I never knew existed. I never cared for most conspiracy theories but after looking into past scandals like the Franklin Cover up, Cathy O\'Brien, MK Ultra, New World Order and so many more my whole world view has changed completely.</p>
<p>When the Reddit sub was banned I moved over to Voat and was immediately put off by some of the subs but it seems they were here to stay regardless of my opinion. I had various usernames and looked into a lot of how Pedophiles operated on the internet, NAMBLA, Boy Lover, Girl Lover and Child Lover groups and provided a fair bit of information.</p>
<p>After a while I looked back into many of the past scandals in order to educate myself on such a foreign concept, and I am wiser for having done that. At some point my posts were getting removed, and I lost faith as I believed Pizzagate to be about education and the wider subject of stopping Child trafficking and abuse not just related to a DC Pizza place and the Podesta\'s.</p>
<p>I since deleted my account and moved back to Reddit recently but have caught myself coming back to here again to check for any new developments.</p>
<p>I had many numerous accounts on Voat and provided what I belive to be good information. I also have amassed a large collection of books and articles on all sorts of scandals which I am a better person for knowing about and sharing.</p>

<p>So many past scandals have had an unbelievable amount of witnesses and the culprits have gotten off scot free or on lesser/unassociated charges see Epstein and Hastert.</p>
<p>I believe in the freedom to research what a person individualy feels is important so will continue to build my knowledge of networks and how these people operate as well as looking at the wider picture of those who are really in control of world politics and the decisions they make.</p>
<p>Good luck to all those who keep increasing their knowledge and working for what they believe in, in the mean time I will continue to dedicate myself to widening my knowledge of other past and related scandals.</p>
<p>If we look back to the Podesta emails we have targeted CPP because they hosted fundraisers for Podesta and Hillary, then the 4Chan code came in that after doing a fair bit of safe research I know to be incorrect. The FBI symbols are legit but there are many more and most Pedophiles do not use them unless part of a Pro-pedophile Political movement.</p>
<p>I would just say look at the source, evaluate the emails, allow a bit of room for creative performance outsider art and maybe some things will reveal more information when you go back to the roots. There maybe more clues there also as to how or whether there is an operation of child trafficking in Washingtong DC.</p>
<p>We know those high up have normally sacrificed all morals getting to the top, and there will be skeletons in the closet that have been used for blackmail purposes in the past.</p>
