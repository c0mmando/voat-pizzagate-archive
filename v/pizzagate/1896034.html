             Everyone knows about the big 6 and 5, and this is the 'jewelry coast'. I try to stay positive though. The non participation could be a massive cover up while Trump is overseas or it could be a ruse from up top. You can not just give out all your plans when you are at war. Either way, eyes are watching. Debby Washername is sweating bullets all of the sudden though. Makes one wonder why.
