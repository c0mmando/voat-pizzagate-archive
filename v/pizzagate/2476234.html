   If you haven't heard of the monsters Sarah &amp; Jennifer Hart yet, get googling. I am really frightened that the 3 missing bodies were simply sold off before they drove the rest off the cliff :(

            The women are not the traffickers. These two lesbians do not have the clout, juice or violence necessary to conduct an organized criminal operation. Their operation would be poached by someone tougher in a heartbeat. I’ve read enough about this at this point to agree that the kids were abused. They are the product, but the moms weren’t the producers. They were more likely just groomers or stable keepers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why were they waxed? If I could venture a guess, I would say it was because they were lazy or sloppy. Why are their kids reporting to the neighbors? How is it that the kids are escaping? Why is one of the kids a famous internet meme, for hugging a cop during a protest? Good stable hands don’t let that happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something is fishy here, we all smell it. But there’s definitely more to it than just a sinister lesbian couple driving off a cliff. I think it’s part of a bigger operation and the deaths are a message or a botched cleanup.

            I can't get past this awful case. I'm curious about  the adoption of these 6 kids. Adoptions are expensive. Were any of these kids siblings? How did these women pay for that and afford to move all over the country?

             I feel you, I'm just consumed with anger and grief about this story myself -
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm also very curious about how they bought a 400,000+/- house with only one of them working at Kohl's. (?!?) As for the adoption fees (I have looked into it personally), it is almost zero cost to adopt "hard to place" (aka older kids, sibling groups, medically or emotionally disabled children) out of the foster system, it's really only expensive to adopt healthy infants in the US. Our child protection social services are stretched to their breaking point with all the kids in care that most states with cover most if not all adoption fees just to get kids in homes.

            I don't think they had time to make a sale. I believe the other kids were thrown from the car and washed out to sea. Pretty rough surf there, so they may be fishbait by morning. Unfindable.

            Can anyone find where they actually put the pictures of the kids still missing with their names attached? I think they don’t want to show us what they look like in case they use them as crisis and/or regular actors in the future.

            Yes, I am afraid we will never Really Know what happened to those children.  I have a sick feeling that we are not getting the whole story here.  Is somebody covering for those women?  Have people really seen all those bodies?  How do we really know ANY of those kids are dead?  Could they all have been sold off?  Maybe the women are not dead either.  Stranger things have happened as we know.

              That's because the bodies of the children they found were in the ocean. I think they presume the others might have been carried away by the water.

                   I totally agree with him and believe that the women could have been killed outside the car and put in the SUV and it was sent over the cliff at a high speed.  Control of a car is easy if you know what you are doing.  Or they were just killed elsewhere.  Remember one LEO Allman is coroner.  Neat and Tidy.

                The Sherriff is a Mason, right? Do we have any other hints that he might be involved in a sex cult? I haven't followed the news about this case as closely as you have.

              <p>
               it's pointless to say now but what kind of 'caring' parent buckles their seatbelt but doesn't tell their kids to buckle up?

                The reports I read said the family was driving in a 2003 chevy or gmc extended cab pick up truck. No way two women and six teenagers would fit safely in that truck! And there just isn't enough seat belts for all of them if they actually all were in there

                 it's hard to tell but, if you zoom in on the back of the car, you can see the handle to open the rear gate. It's not a pickup truck, otherwise that handle would be closer to the top of the tailgate.

             Poor Devonte.  And he is dressed as an animal in both videos -

              screen capture

              Yeah, this is so fucked up... I'm amazed at what you found already, all I've managed to do is rage &amp; cry while I watched all her fucked up YouTube videos of those trapped, doomed children uncomfortably dancing with adults, or singing "we are provided for" over and over while looking like they are doing the best they can just hoping to get fed.

             Yes.  So many adults did fail these kids. It seems nowadays people are not interested in the saving of children but just spoiling their own. They give their kids everything but what they really need.  Attention and love.  No not attention by giving them what they want but what they need .  Time.  Good simple food.  Basic clothing needs.  Take time to color with them and read to them.  Bake cookies with them instead of buying fancy cookies or baking classes. If possible, those neighbors should have invited those kids over.  There are ways to knock on the door or leave a note.  Ask if they can come bake cookies and help those women out.  When I was growing up (I know things were different) families knew all the kids on the block.  We had better behave or someone's mother would snitch on us.  People are just too busy now to be involved.  Something was def missing in that home.  Many things should and could have been done before those police were called.

              The way of life you have described is all but gone now that both parents work full time and society tells us kids need to be overly scheduled in activities, sports, and more structured activities. What was so bad about a slower paced life with less "things"? Nothing! Families, children, and society were better for it.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I'm not bashing families where both parents have to work to survive, but all too many times both work so they can afford their lifestyles with new cars, huge houses, and all of the flashy "look at me stuff". It's just not worth it!

               I agree.  Yes, and even though some may still be short money, maybe they could do with just a part time job for Mom so she could be home when the kids get home, just enough to help out.  Believe it or not, the people next door, the Mom starts work at 6 am and the husband gets the daughter going to school and he goes to work.  The Mom gets off at 2pm and she is home when the girl gets out.  They have a good life actually.  Very family oriented.  They work really hard!  They have a house and 2 cars.  There are ways people can work things out for the kids.  This may not work for everyone, those hrs are not avail. at all businesses.  I am so sick of all the electronics they have to have.  The latest is this Alexa thing.  Scares me to death and they are buying them for the kids.  It's just a status thing for the parents with their friends.  Things.
