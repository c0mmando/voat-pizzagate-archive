            This is all what is called "low-hanging fruit," the "open secrets" that everyone knew about. Hell, I'm in the Midwest and have no connections at all to Hollywood and I knew about Weinstein, Spacey, et.al. years ago. Ratner may be the new one, but he's no different. A legendary sleazebag and serial abuser/harasser. I do find it funny that Olivia Munn is speaking out. If she decides to be completely honest, then Aaron Rogers should be extremely nervous at this point (but not for harassment.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing to notice is that none of these people are at the top of their game as far as making money for the studios. Weinstien hasn't had a hit in five years, Spacey is more a critical darling than box-office draw and House of Cards had declined in viewers. Ratner is not hot, Singer is because of X-Men, but he can be replaced.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll know Hollywood is taking this seriously when the MONEY MAKERS are the ones that are brought to light. Otherwise, this is just an attempt to get this behind them as quickly and painlessly as possible.

            There are also sexual harassment allegations against BRETT RATNER, the director that took over for Bryan Singer in X-Men: The Last Stand.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <a href="http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/brett-ratner-natasha-henstridge-accused-sexual-harassment-1202604256/">
              http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/brett-ratner-natasha-henstridge-accused-sexual-harassment-1202604256/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Henstridge told the Times that Ratner, 48, allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him during an incident in his New York apartment in the early 1990s when she was a 19-year-old model.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Actress Olivia Munn detailed what she described as several disturbing encounters with Ratner. In one instance, she brought food to his trailer during the filming his 2004 film “After the Sunset.” Munn alleges that Ratner emerged from the bathroom wearing no pants and “furiously masturbating.” Munn later sparred with Ratner after he claimed during a 2011 TV appearance to have slept with her. A few days later, he apologized for making that statement during an appearance on Howard Stern’s radio show.
