<p>A classified advertising website accused of being a “hub” for the sex trafficking of children has shut down its adult section in the US.</p>

<p>The editing practices amounted to &quot;coaching&quot; traffickers and pimps in how to make their ads appear legitimate while continuing to sell girls and boys into prostitution and modern-day slavery, McCaskill said.
