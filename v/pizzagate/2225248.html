             Re Bryan Singer, Have been told Singer's parties changed at one point to require security checking ID's of partiers. However I've always known fake ID's are the norm in So Cal. Popular gay hangouts and bars are always getting busted for not being scrupulous enough when they serve liquor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Issue is that Bryan Singer's parties have a rep of offering quantities of all kinds of drugs and alcohol but very little food. The huge swimming pool is the primary source or partying. Swimsuits not allowed supposedly due to the chemicals in the pool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Run-a-ways from Religious and Conservative Mid Western and Southern families have long found their way by city bus to the streets of Hollywood. Being driven by limo to a huge  mansion in the Hills of Hollywood overlooking the City of Angels, walls covered with pictures of male stars when they were young, film awards and charity citations, and of course, the biggest, most beautiful swimming pool they'd ever seen with an incredible view of the lights twinkling below.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next morning there's always a mile long line in front of the low-cost and free clinic in West Hollywood offering medical treatment , honest advice, and counseling. No one ever wants to hire anyone that's poor for an acting gig. The wealthier the talent, the easier it will always be for them.

             Do not know how to use VOAT search function. This is a 11/2/17 CDAN Blind. That's why I re-posted it here. CDAN Blinds are getting traction. If you know of another website to publish this and other Blinds, please assist. Americans need to know exactly what is going on to be motivated to take action.

             Bohemian Grove has been stated as a consistent, reliable source of income for those who can produce fresh, young, teen boys. Don't know if current POTUS has ever attended. That's the biggest link in the pedo rings between DC and Hollywood.

             Everything I know is 2nd hand info. While my sources are very reliable, and verified by many clearly in the know, as well as  usually backed up by online articles in trendy media catering to the So Cal and entertainment related world, I don't feel comfortable revealing names for that reason.

             CDAN even states there are many, many aware  and plenty who have complained. What good does it do if nothing is ever done? Show me anyone in CA government or LE at any level who would do anything to imprison and heavily fine the accused? Start with firing the compromised judges &amp; police dept heads.

             Voaters have criticized those who know who won't risk their lives and their careers to come forward. This Blind clearly states the exact same perps have committed hundreds of crimes, resulting in death &amp; misery to many. To say nothing of the heavy burden on the already overtaxed CA medical care system for the indigent, the lack of space for those with drug &amp; alcohol addictions who cannot afford treatment on their own, the overwhelming homeless issue and huge number of street kids going nowhere.

             This is not about adult women complaining about what they had to do to get prominent, extremely well-paying roles with multiple side benefits in HW films. Not saying it's OK at all to have to trade sexual favors with men into heavy kink and degradation for major speaking parts and Vanity Fair covers, as well as to be touted as the next big starlet by a then top power player who gets anyone he wants Academy Award nominations and pap tours. However I think the general public resents most of them (hello, Gwyneth Paltrow) for complaining after they obviously repeatedly went back to HW apparently willing to do anything including selling their soul for career changing roles.

             Teens, tweens, and children are also stigmatized by CA government and LE total apathy for wanting a performing career even if it was their naive parents choice. HOW DARE SAG-AFTRA suddenly send all members an email asking them to speak up if they're harassed. Did they spell out exactly what they intend to do to correct the problem? How they are going to protect members from being permanently blackballed? I've already stated how a mother was so scared for her life and that of her very happy working child actress then on a series that she immediately moved across the country after a threatening meeting with the TV show's producers and power houses.

            Thurs Nov 2, 201Today's Blind Items - The Financier
Back in the day, he was an actor. A fairly successful child actor. As he started getting a little older, he played the game the way he was told. When he wasn't old enough to drive he was hooking up with that A list movie producer and that A list mostly movie director that keeps popping up. He spent most of his time though with a guy who taught him about money while also having sex with him. I say sex, but our actor was not yet legal so lets call it what it is - rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            The money guy schooled our actor on how to make money. Meanwhile, the actor was also used to bring in young male actors for the sick fantasies of the previously mentioned and also the sick fantasies of investors. I can't tell you how many child and teen actors ended up dead from drugs or booze or just suicide because of these a-holes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It hasn't stopped. Things have just slightly changed. The mentor of the actor has to lay low all the time now. He is always watched by authorities. The actor though can move freely. He makes a ton of money which is used to finance movies for the director and the producer. Almost every movie they change the name of the finance company to keep people off the trail. Where do they get the money? Politicians, executives and anyone else who wants to have sex with young boys. The actor has a supply chain from acting schools and casting calls to model hunts and everything in between. The former actor uses his political connections to make people guardians of some of these boys. Can you imagine the sick f**k who knows what is going to happen to these boys but approves a guardianship for the boy to live with the guy who is going to rape them?
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, people have spoken up. People have complained. You know what happens? Nothing. The voice gets hammered back down. Maybe some cash changes hands. Maybe the troubled youth ends up dead. A victim of the drug crisis or gun violence. The guardian did everything they could say the stories. Gave the youth a loving home.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you go back a decade, you will see the fields of Hollywood littered with the dead bodies of actors who were victimized by this group. The deaths might be publicized but not the aftermath. None of the dead actors ever get in a memorial during Oscar or Emmy night. They just are child or teen actors who couldn't handle fame. No, they are actors who couldn't handle being raped and living their lives after years of abuse.7  "The Financier"

            Involves misleading/tricking hundreds of hopeful tween &amp; teen actors into believing they will be guided to success. Ends in countless drug addicted, suicidal, dead talent at far, far too young an age. Off-the books, tax-free profit for a greedy few. "Personal Manager" in reality big time Pimp to the super wealthy, politically connected. Likely consistent supplier to "Bohemian Grove" as well.
