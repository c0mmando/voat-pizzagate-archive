            Comey frequently conducts business outside the box. His 7 page pre-testimony statement is a case in point (Was it sworn and subscribed to in the presence of a notary?). In this fashion Comey could control the narrative for the media and for the history books. Folks might recite a sentence or two from the testimony but practically speaking no one is going to be walking around with a cumbersome transcript in discussing Comey when they have a handy narrative to refer to. Those examining Comey may not have been able to elicit the answers that  Comey wanted everyone to hear so he upstaged the hearing with his statement in advance. It should not have been made part of the record until after the hearing. Such tactics are not permitted in a court room and they should be disallowed here.

            Wow 😂 I'm going to send him this link. Just kidding lol. I agree tho. Even Wikileaks said the FBI are going to spill now like Niagra falls. What was so irritating is that so many democrats were talking crap about their homie Comey. They were saying how it's his fault that Hillary lost blah blah blah. Who wasn't on that list? But, many wanted him gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Steve Pieczenik said people in the FBI are against Hillary and want to clean out the corrupt deep state. He has friends as well as connections that are in the FBI. He goes on Alex Jones. Right before the election he said that they, including him, had formed a soft coup against Hillary Clinton. So now that Comey is gone, they will have more freedom. This guy knows his stuff.  This is just a small part of his bio....
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Steve Pieczenik is the first pychiatrist to ever have served as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. He served four presidents as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Bush Sr. and was a Senior Policy Planner under president Reagan. Dr. Pieczenik worked directly with, and reported directly to, Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            He made

             this video
            </a>
            before the election.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Trump fired Comey, the democrats milked it all they could, trying to say how wrong our president was and that he did it because of the Russian investigation. That's the only reason these bastards are on the news acting like they are on Comey's side. Behind the scene, I've heard that many are glad and want him gone.

             Good comments. I remember that Dr. Pieczenik video. 
Comey lost all credibility after covering for and exonerating Hillary for blatant crimes ("no intent" when she mishandled classified info), I saw no point in having him say anything before the intel committee yesterday.

             He even excused the fact that Huma used Weiner to print out classified documents for her.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Comey said Abedin appeared to have had a regular practice of forwarding emails to Weiner for him "to print out for her so she could then deliver them to the secretary of state."
             </p>
            </blockquote>

             He'd lie if the truth sounded better.

               Saw that somewhere, didn't read the linked post you give ... why did he admit to that, what was the strategy there? As if that's all they talked about. Maybe it's a limited hangout statement. Throw some red meat to the "other side."

              I bet he hates Hillary for starting this mess haha. Now, just like she did to him, he should start saying that he got fired because of Hillary. That way they can play the blame game. That would be entertaining.
