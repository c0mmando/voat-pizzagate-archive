            I have made comments about Racine, and hopefully are archived here. The reason I made those comments is because I lived there for about a year. I lived in Mena, Arkansas for longer. The only Kevin I knew there was my room mate from Florida, and he was in and out of jail frequently. Huge white guy, kind of narcissistic, and I hope that is not him. He certainly would fit the enforcer stereotype though. I just made a phone call to see if I can clear up on my end.

            Alright, time for a come to Jesus moment OP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your family of alerted members isn’t enough to stop the targeted killing or ‘random accidents’ that are employed by these asshats. The two hroups you need to watch for are spooks and kikespies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Learn how to check any vehicle you are going to ride in for tracking and or tampering. Make sure to avoid anyone who has the classic pattern of cargo shorts, polo shirt and raybans. I don’t know what it is about spooks but they all default to this attire eventually. Also, THEY ARE NEVER TALLER THAN 5’10” if doing field work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kikespies are more dirty, from now on anyone matching the chart of jewish phenotypes is now a threat to your life. They will all do work for kikespies if asked. Especially if they are informed that you are a threat to jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            Start a habit of purging your harddrive for all content regularly.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will resort to framing if they can’t find a good method of accidenting you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep up with what you’re doing, you aren’t making headway until they start intimidation. After that they start acting on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            God speed.

What normal person would go scanning posts about Racine and trying to cover it up of not a shill. A lazy shill even, uses same copy pasted lines. Bad shill, bad.

            That 70’s Show was set in Racine featuring Red and Fez as main characters with a cast dominated by Scientology.

There is a reason why Trump closed The Deal for the 8th Wonder of the World from the public at the last minute. Many plans have been foiled to avoid exposing The Truth. There are many more connections that few know of including the Bushes, Clintons, McCain, Obama and elite power players.

            These comments are bullshit. If u can’t call this crazy shit out here, where can u? Look at bill smith. He was best and most authentic YouTube researcher and he stopped bc he struck a cord w the Tom hanks shit and knew he was gonna end up off a bridge on Route 66. THIS KIND OF SHIT GOT US WHERE WE ARE NOW. Acknowledging and calling out local corruption is only way to gain to put this country back in the hands of the people. Starts locally and it is our responsibility you fucking scumbag niggers.
           </p>
           <p>
            And dude, u really need to explain yourself out of the gate and put the links to prove the shit after each point.  This didn’t exactly captivate anyone. U sound emotional which turns people off. I didn’t even click the links bc I like to read first, then decide if I give a fuck enough to source. Write a better story. And be safe. I actually believe you and it sounds like ur fucked. God bless.

            No, gamepwn, they're not trying to scare you into

             not

            looking at Racine. They're using reverse psychology to enforce the narrative and make you think it's a legitimate line of inquiry so that you

            They've tried recruiting many people over the course of the last few years and they run all sorts of manipulations and gaslighting to do it or to attack anyone who questions their antics or walks away from their narrative after being roped in. They're currently running several sockpuppet accounts in here as of recently, also, in an attempt to revive the narrative after months of spamming garbage from TTT + alts and several others larping as TTT (yes, that's right, they larp as a larp – the original TTT doesn't swear but just the other day in

             Jenny Moore did investigating into Racine. Jenny ended up dead. I've been doing a lot of research into Racine. There is a user here constantly warning us about Racine. Now I'm being told to watch out for my life and not look into Racine.

              Probably should have used a different online persona for shit like this, but what's done is done. Now you can figure out how to make that work in your favor, if need be. Can't go back, so charge forward I guess.

               I've found a lot about Racine and a lot of it gets deleted for really illogical reasons. This for example details a bunch of "vampyric" crimes occuring in Racine and the nearby areas. In one example, a minor had her finger cut off and a shot glass was filled with blood and drank. Then they tried to cauterize the wound first with a car cigarette lighter, and then with a blow torch. All of the people in this thread were given lenient sentences, indicating a systemic pattern of judges (ie elites) letting people off for crimes against minors that involve maiming and blood drinking:

                https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3717644
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               This thread was immediately deleted for "having no connection to pizzagate"; despite all of the perpetrators being given lenient sentences or flat out avoiding criminal charges at all, and in spite of the fact that a Wisconsin state senator thought the problem was so bad he drafted legislation specifically targeting "vampiric" crimes, it was claimed that there was "no connection to elites" and promptly deleted within 24 hours.

               WIC was a team of people looking into it. They all ended up dead according to a user named Trustthetruth.

                 It's pretty easy to prove when you start looking into it. The amount of times I've done a google search on someone suspicious and included "racine" in the search and got hits is too many to count and it's way beyond what would be expected from random chance. This happened just the other day when they deleted somebodies thread about the Hearst family:
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3757460">
                  https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3757460
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Given all of the MK Ultra connections to the Hearst family mentioned in that thread, I googled "William Randolph Hearst" "Racine" and immediately found that he was not only connected to the place, but also to a cult that promotes a one world government.

                   Yeah the teenager involved was 19 so it apparently doesn't count. And even though NXIVM, a group that abused minors, was keeping dossiers on her family, it still doesn't count because the person they were keeping a dossier on wasn't being accused of anything in that thread. For whatever reason they apply an extremely narrow, hair splitting application of the rules on certain topics.

            Haha. 2020. The year America finally self-immolated and the year kevdude somehow became scary.

             I don't give a fuck who Kevdude is, all I know is I'm receiving death threats now. Jenny stayed quiet and ended up dead. I'm NOT.
