            Okay this is the article that finally got me to register on voat, I've been following this sub for months now. NXIVM HQ is in the town next to mine. I had no idea. I noticed weird craigslist ads last month that I thought were Scientologists which is possible but I'm thinking NXIVM (this town is a bit away but it's close enough). There's like six or seven postings, check the activity partners sub, they're easy to spot.  Also the Times Union did an article on him and his shitty cult in 2009, google it, they somehow obtained a child from Michigan who is six years older now (so probably adolescent or nearabouts) and the child is not much more than an experiment to Raniere (who obviously has psychological issues from being so different as an adolescent and not being able to relate to women other than via control). Real empowerment and enlightenment comes from learning the plants around you, building your own stove and fire, ALONE. This is upstate fucking NY, go out in the woods, don't be spoon fed this bullshit. My fellow women sicken me with their hopeless dependence.

            **"A man tried to run over parents and their children at a train museum. Witnesses and victims think this was an intentional act, read the article comments.

            The museum is across the street from the Rob Reiner Children and Families Center
           </p>
           <p>
            This is related to pizzagate because Rob Reiner is circumstantially tied to sexually assaulting Corey Haim. Reiner follows the Jerry Sandusky / The Second Mile model of interfacing with deprived children.

            : Rule 4. Rule 4, indirectly relevant? Fuck you! A man tried to run down children across the street from pedo Reiner's child grooming facility. I know what's wrong with you, you're a pedo apologist. Burn in hell you piece of shit. I'd wring your fucking neck myself.

            Now, let's go to the pattern of PEDO SCUM in Hollywood: Most of these vile primates have come out loud against Trump; Most are LIBS/DEMS; have a TALMUD ( jewish background ) Now Rob Reiner fits that like OJ's GLOVE!

            VIDEO: Hollywood Blabbermouth Rob Reiner Suspiciously Defensive, Blames Trump for Harvey Weinstein’s Alleged Rapes OCT. 17 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            "Ask Rob Reiner about Harvey Weinstein and suddenly he sounds like a worried man. A very worried man. Perhaps he should be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smoke. Fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            A seasoned investigator would be lining Reiner up for a polygraph after watching this display of lunacy." "And the morons posing as journalists at MSNBC’s Morning Joe are no better.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listen for yourself. Watch the wheels comes off Reiner’s alibis for Weinstein as he tries to pin Hollywood’s sex abuse troubles on everyone except Hollywood."
           </p>
           <p>
            LOOK TO THE COMMENTS : "Greta G • 22 days ago He is acting suspicious, like a perp returning to the scene of crime talking to police or just protesting too much, unwittingly bringing attention to himself. Reminds me of Raskolnikov gabbing to Petrovitch in Crime and Punishment. Rob Reiner is rumored to be a pedophile. Corey Haim."

            "Morning Joe co-anchor Willie Geist asked Reiner,
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are millions and millions of people who do not watch this show that actually like what they hear from Donald Trump. And they aren't taking messages and orders from us in the media. But they listen to what he says for themselves and vote for him. How do you explain that?"
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are a lot of people who are racist," Reiner quickly replied.

            Is this fight already over? Because the police are pretty much pedo enablers. Do they sit back and laugh when they hear these stories? Get off on it? I don't understand. I don't.

                I'd never heard about Raniere before, thanks for the info. I hope Ms. Oxenberg speaking to prosecutors will lead to some results.

                I had to think of Nigerian women who are trafficked to Europe; before they leave, they undergo a Voodoo cult ceremony, some hairs or tiny parts of fingernails are taken by a priest, symbolising they are from now on spiritually 'owned' by him.
               </p>
               <p>
                Human rights activists say these women, when they have arrived in Europe and discover that they are not going to work as waitresses, but are forced to work as prostitutes, don't dare to flee, because they fear the priest's revenge and his spell.
               </p>
               <p>
                And the American women in Raniere's cult are blackmailed with nude pictures and the cheques they had to hand over...
               </p>
               <p>
                F*ck all cults.

              Its just another way to dehumanize and make a victim feel like powerless property. Every time the victims see the brand on their body the subconscious mind registers that it is a piece of property.

               I see. "Property" , the cult-mind then sees themselves as 'their' property. No longer an individual mind, but a 'hive-mind'!
