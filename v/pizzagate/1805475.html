             Dear Vindicator,
            </p>
            <p>
             I sincerely disagree, being the content is most relevant to exposing the major worldwide scandal of pizzagate which includes 'spirit cooking' and completely extradites the entire spirituality aspects of their cannibalistic rituals. I did move the post (as you suggested) to the /pizzagatewhatever category.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do appreciate your tight moderation of the community on voat, and your efforts in regulating such a hard topic and I apologize if I by any means detracted from the community guidelines and regulations. I wish you the best if your truth seeking and research. If you reconsider republishing the post without the article; here is the direct link to the video only:

            A section from the book of Enoch, a little bit of ancient text to give context...
           </p>
           <p>
            "CHAPTER VII.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose for himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and they taught them charms and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants. 2. And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three thousand ells: 3. Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, 4. the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. 5. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood. 6. Then the earth laid accusation against the lawless ones."
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            And then from chapter XV:
           </p>
           <p>
            "8. And now, the giants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. 9. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men, ⌈⌈and⌉⌉ from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; ⌈they shall be evil spirits on earth, and⌉ evil spirits shall they be called. [10. As for the spirits of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.] 11. And the spirits of the giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth, and cause trouble: they take no food, ⌈but nevertheless hunger⌉ and thirst, and cause offences. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women, because they have proceeded ⌈from them⌉."

            Truth is certainly sometimes stranger then fiction...
           </p>
           <p>
            But we know this...
"And of them also prophesied Enoch, who was the seventh from Adam, when he said: Behold, the Lord cometh, with myriads of his saints; to execute judgment upon all; and to convict all the wicked, because of all the deeds they have wickedly committed; and because of all the hard speeches, which they, ungodly sinners, have uttered.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are they who murmur and complain of every thing, while they walk according to their lusts; and their mouth speaketh shocking things; and they flatter people, for the sake of gain."
