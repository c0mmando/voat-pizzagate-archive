            This isn't a victory, this is a major step backwards. Now trafficked children and sex workers are in more danger. Prior to SESTA/FOSTA people used neutral sites like backpage to recover lost family members sold into trafficking. Police used them to pose as johns and catch predators. Now this major resource for fighting pedophilia is gone and the children are cast into the shadows where they are more likely to never be found.
           </p>
           <p>
            On top of that, now platforms are at a much higher risk for the actions of their users. This is a major step in internet censorship. Since they will not want to risk the liability of user actions, Google and others will be setting up bots to auto-ban any content that appears to be soliciting sex, whether or not they are correct. They don't have a great track record. For example, their platform to fight online hate speech called "Perspective API" completely fails to infer context in people's posts. It flags statements like "I am a gay woman" or "I am a black man" as toxic because it can't tell if the user is making fun of someone. It even flagged "I am a jew" as more toxic than "I don't like Jews".
           </p>
           <p>
            That means it will have no chance in hell in telling the difference between someone giving testimonial of their time as a child sex slave and someone actually selling kids. It literally silences victims. This is a gigantic loss.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't believe me, just search "FOSTA" on twitter and see what sex workers think about it.

            "Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement (September 2016)
This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
At the heart of the Rothschild &amp; Co Group’s approach to business is a deeply-held sense of responsibility to its people, to the environment and to the communities in which it operates.
Over the years, the Rothschild &amp; Co Group has been developing and implementing policies designed to take social issues into greater account in its businesses, and circulating these among its employees. Whilst the impact of the Act predominantly vests within N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited (“Rothschild”), the initiatives taken in response to the Act are built on a common set of values on which the Rothschild &amp; Co Group’s internal operations, relations with stakeholders and investment decisions are based.
In the financial year ending March 2016, Rothschild undertook a risk assessment of (1) its current staff profile and recruitment practices (covering employees, contractors and agency staff) and (2) its supply chain (focusing, for this first year of the Act’s applicability, on its tier one suppliers). In this risk assessment we looked at the potential for vulnerabilities in relation to slavery and human trafficking, considering the probability of such risks materialising, the impact of them doing so, and the control mechanisms we already had in place that attempt to mitigate such risks.
Staff profile and recruitment practices
In relation to risks within our business, we found that we have rigorous HR policies and practices which are in line with our obligations pursuant to the Act. Background checking procedures are thorough and apply equally to permanent employees and contractors. We have not found any evidence to suggest that modern slavery is present within our business. We will continue to adhere by our stringent standards.
Supply chain
Our first tier suppliers were categorised by the risk evident in the sectors and the jurisdictions in which they operate. We compiled a list of high risk sectors where slavery and human trafficking is considered to be particularly prevalent, and have referred to the Global Slavery Index to determine the list of the countries where slavery is most widespread, as a proportion of the population. The composite parts of this double-headed approach of sector and jurisdiction will be reviewed annually to ensure our methodology remains relevant and robust.
Using these two concepts of sector and jurisdiction we accorded our suppliers the appropriate rating on the following basis:
 Low risk supplier: a supplier that is BOTH (i) working in a sector which is considered to be low risk, AND (ii) incorporated in (and predominantly operating within) a jurisdiction which is low risk.
 Medium risk supplier: a supplier that is EITHER (i) working in a sector which is considered to be high risk, OR (ii) incorporated in (or predominantly operating within) a jurisdiction which is high risk.
 High risk supplier: a supplier that is BOTH (i) working in a sector which is considered to be high risk, AND incorporated in (or predominantly operating within) a jurisdiction which is high risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            The results of our due diligence found that the vast majority of our first tier suppliers were low risk. Additionally we have some medium risk suppliers and a very small number of high risk suppliers. As a response to this, in future contracts with suppliers we will implement a variety of measures depending on the level of risk presented (including (1) asking that the supplier represents and warrants that they comply with the Act (to the extent applicable) and other anti-slavery legislation, (2) requesting that the supplier will adhere to our Anti-Slavery Policy, (3) specifying the level of background checks we want performed on staff working on our contracts, and (4) requesting that high risk suppliers submit an annual slavery and human trafficking report setting out the steps it has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of its business).
The risk assessment we completed will be repeated in each financial year in order to ensure that our internal and external processes continue to be held to high and exacting standards. As our actions gain momentum and we receive vital feedback from our suppliers, others in our industry and key stakeholders shaping the response to the Act, we will expand our remit to reach through our supply chain, beyond our tier one suppliers.
We are committed to rooting out instances of abuse in our business and supply chains and re-affirm our zero-tolerance approach to slavery and human trafficking.

N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited September 2016"

            The FBI always takes down independant trafickers. This is not news. We need to put a stop to the FBI/CIA elite child traficking opperations. Again, this is nothing new, they always arrest the competition, gives them the veneer of ligitimacy to the sheeple. Why do you guys spend so much time here when you cannot retain anything? I'll speak in language you can understand..Bahhhh, meh, bah, meh, bah bah....

            Cindy McCain, wife of Sen. John McCain and an outspoken advocate against human trafficking, said she had heard that federal law enforcement officials had raided not only Lacey’s home but every office of Backpage world-wide.

            “They’ve confiscated everything and shut the website down,” she said.

             I guess they talked about human trafficking, not so much about 'fighting' against human trafficking....

             Btw. Carm, I will also put in into my post about this case, David Matthews, Pippa's father-in-law, has been accused by a second woman of raping her - in the 1980s.

               Thanks, Carm, but I won't be able to update the post with more info than I just told you....all papers only mentioned that a British woman has come forward. No details yet. Will keep you informed! :-)

                  Victims always need someone as their backup, and at their side for moral support.  It is so very hard to stand up to these vile rapists.  To know especially, that it was a trusted family member is even more disgusting.  Courage beyond belief.

                    I have not seen any of this on the news as of yet.  I wonder how they will sugarcoat this farce.  A very short blurb of a report and words of "move along folks"  nothing to see here.  Or the entire thing will just be swept under the Royal Rug.

                       But I can't see a post like this that was deleted by mods there. So the only explanation would be that OP has self-deleted. In these cases, the posts don't show in the 'removed submissions' log.

                      I am shocked that she is getting any cooperation at all from the S.Yorkshire  Police.  Savile hangout.  Rotherham is in Yorkshire.

              I always almost have to laugh when someone is accused of rape or abuse 20 years ago.  What have they been doing in the meantime?  Hmm.  He was born in Rotherham.  Rotherham is in Yorkshire County, Jimmy Savile's Stomping Grounds.  Somehow I just can't believe their paths never crossed.

            Is this a good thing? I'm asking and haven't been following this.  Was the owner actually playing a part in the human trafficking or was it just others using the site?  It seems like when you know down all the central places these things are taking place that a more secluded or offline black market would form; at least now you know where many of them congregate.

             Netflix has (had?) a documentary about this “craigslist” style website that allowed trafficking. The complaints against backpage stacked up, they went to court even. Kids have been getting abducted and sold through this website, and there was some evidence that they have encouraged or supported, if I remember the gist of the doc... many here have been waiting for the end of backpage.

             The raid is because FOSTA passed, eros.com was also raided last week. I don't know if he knowingly peddled child prostitutes but he's probably going to be in deep shit because of the sketchiness of the website. He had a straight up "escorts" section for a while. The other US based illegal escort sites are soon to follow in their footsteps

              How is FOSTA even constitutional?  This is a bad law that puts the blame in the wrong place and allows for kiketrolls to post CP here and then submit complaints to the FBI.

             After watching this whole shitshow for a while now it seems to me that setting up a company that runs a website (any kind) costs lots of money. If you are making games then you go to Angel investors, if you are trafficking in Humans you go to the devil.

              You can believe what you want but I don't think the owner was affiliated with the illegal side of things.

              You gotta think about how much good this guy did by starting backpage.  It made it a whole lot safer than standing on the corner all night with a pimp taking their money.  Instead women are able to work independently and much safer for both the escort and John.

              Running a website costs little to no money, if you're a competent coder. Economies of scale. A small website costs pennies to run, per month, but may look just as professional as Microsoft.com or even Facebook. You pay for the traffic. And if you're getting millions of hits per month, you now have other ways of making money. That's how that shit goes down.

                No, the home of the owner of Backpage is in Sedona.  I don't know where the McCains live.  Somewhere in Az. also.  But here is the kicker.  He just announced that not only was Lacey's home raided but ALL offices of Backpage!    AND LOOK AT THIS

                    Yeah, and for the umpteenth time.  My mother is 90 and has only fallen once, only when she slipped on some food on the floor at a party.  And she dusted herself off and got up and danced. I don't think the blood drinking is even helping her.

                 I don't see anything bad about this bill though I have almost zero trust for McCain though. Q just insinuated maybe he has something to do with human trafficking.  He also hasn't even voted in Senate this year, so it is interesting he can still tweet several times a day and keep up with this stuff.

                  Laura Silsby has gotten married.  She has a different last name and is working for a company connected with Amber Alert.  Figure it out.  Who are they alerting?  They public that a child has been taken, or the criminal to let him know that the cops are looking for him.  An Expansion of Amber Alert should Ring Alarm Bells.

            Something happened to throw Q's plan off so he had to start dropping pizzagate related material into the mainstream just to shake the trees. Things are heating up guys (and gals) start looking into Ray (Rachel) Chandler.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, here is a vid of Marshal Mathers describing his own experience with PG, considering how his name is coming up so much recently it is relevant:

             https://hooktube.com/watch?v=FKaN8HwO7AI
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Relevant to Pizzagate since very solid leads are to be had by following the crumbs left by Q, whether you believe in him or not.

               Post 1080 is interesting.  It must be about the Porton Down/Skripal thing in the UK.  Very sloppily done.  Most people think it was the British intelligence services that did that despite the coordinated  mainstream media narrative that 'Russia did it'.  They are panicking.

                1080 is specifically referencing the FF Chem attack in Syria, although Q does use double meanings frequently. The Skripal FF is being put to good use though, the Rats in the American Embassy (Russia) have all been forcibly recalled to the States and will be either retired or dispersed.

                Taxes are over-rated. Besides, never trust a guy who doesn't file an extension.
