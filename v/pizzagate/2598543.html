            I am reminded of a couple of Lolfieldandlove's 'Programmed To Kill' videos on Youtube on Henry Lee Lucas &amp; Otis Toole, two of the worst serial killers America has ever seen.  They claimed to be members of a cult called 'The Hand of Death' and in addition to carrying out contract murders for the cult, they claimed to have participated in abducting children and taking them into Juarez to be raped and murdered in ritual sacrifices/child porn/snuff movies.  Strangely, Lucas and Toole, who were caught, tried, convicted and condemned in Texas and Florida respectively, both had their death sentences commuted by the usually execution happy then Governors of those states, George &amp; Jeb Bush.

             <strong>
              advertise credit on billboards above the rural area’s muddy roads.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Many families have come away with nothing more than regrets.

                HoHo. Just think that they get money from almost all charities and found.  CF CGI You name it We should look up a slew of them &amp; I bet there will be a ton. I will go out on a limb and wager that money is being siphoned off all of or 3 largest cities and going to fund their evil ops.  Just a guess.

             sure.. but once again, PG Mods are not letting Voaters speak with their votes like the rest of the entire platform that honors free speech.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, what ever happened to Pizzagate Bot?  Was Pizzagate bot archiving too many SOURCES and linking them together, allowing people to see the WEB of child sex trafficking?
            </p>
            <p>
             Boy.. how about we significantly improve
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             and make it 1000x easier for researchers to SOURCE their posts by BRINGING BACK PIZZAGATE BOT ??
            </p>
            <p>
             I move that you create a STICKY and allow VOATERS TO VOTE on whether

              Ian, the guy who ran the Pizzagate bot left Voat. If you or anybody else knows how to run a bot like this, you are kindly invited and very welcome to create and run one.

               Really?  I thought is was a code program, because Pizzagate bot was almost always first to comment on any post, even before Derram.
              </p>
              <p>
               That indicates it was a program in the system.

               Is that something you were told or has it been 100% verified ?

                Nope. It was a user who created it, and when he left, the Pizzagate bot left with him.

                     when you say something like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     thought is was a code program
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You are indicating that you don't know what you are talking about, so I can understand your confusion. If PGBot was faster than derram, it's prob because they set it to check more often. It was only tracking one subverse, after all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Otherwise, my recall is the same as think-'s. I assure you it was not part of the 'system'.

                       I can't see how a bot for a specific subverse will
                       <em>
                        ever
                       </em>
                       be an integral part of Voat.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       As far as I remember, the PGBot was pretty clever. So the difficulty may be less in the implementation but in the precise idea behind it. That being said, someone will then need to host and run it as well as (ideally, although this is a smaller task) get the Voat API keys from Putts.

                        Pizzagate Bot left after there was a bruhaha when he began using his bot to against another

                        user whom he thought was a spreading disinfo. That researcher, who had published a number of well-written articles on normie sites and had quite a few well-upvoted posts, naively doxed themselves. PGB and a couple of others began attacking them on multiple threads in the comment section based on where the person worked, where their grandfather worked, and the town they lived in, claiming they were connected to the murder of Aaron Schwartz.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The user deleted the self-doxing comments and submissions they had put up, but PGB used his archive to repost them, which is in direct violation of several parts of the Voat User Agreement.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I deleted his re-doxing comment and pinged the O's to the fact that I did it. A large shitshow ensued over whether what he did was okay, with multiple mods and O's commenting with different opinions. He wanted to know if the bot itself was a violation of the Voat User Agreement, even though I had called him out for misusing the information it scraped, not for the automatic thread-linking feature.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Shortly thereafter, the bot went away. As I recall, Putt was pinged in the original discussion and I certainly gave the user who was doxed the information about how to contact him to make a DMCA takedown request to have it permanently removed from the Removed area. I don't know what happened after that, if Putt had anything to do with PGB's exit from Voat, but he stopped posting directly thereafter.

            Thanks for this post.

            I would just like to add my experience and opinion to this conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Legal immigration is not terribly inconvenient. Reasonable people that go to the US can do it legally. It’s more inconvenient to go to Disneyland, which has higher security (yet somehow still has a pedo underground).
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ve brought my wife (not a citizen) across a couple of times. We had an appointment at the consulate days in advance. She was interviewed. She paid a modest fee. It wasn’t ‘convenient’, but it wasn’t outrageous. There are provisions for refugees, the poor and those seeking asylum for any number of reasons. Those provisions are as reasonable as you would expect them to be after decades of debate and adjustment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their is very little excuse, reason or sense in trying to enter ANY country illegally.

You can probably count the Rabbis on one hand that are willing to speak out against their parasite brethern.

             illegal immigration/refugees is 100% about long-term replacing white populations and provoking political turmoil in their countries.  it's not some business move or mass-Satanist-kidnapping scam, jfc.  you cover for jews even when you Name them, loser!
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope to god these 'migrants' are being victimized in every possible way and orifice and that they spread the word in their brown countries so that they are too scared to risk coming and instead grow some balls to fix their own problems in their own countries.

               The only time Jews get their hands dirty is when they are counting the cash or raping the children.

            I like most of your thread, but you slipped in there  how the children are being protected when they are separated, not potentially trafficked. This does not jive to me. More like, the non parents are part of the trafficking, and the authorities, take the children to centers where they are held and then parceled out for trafficking. This gives them the veneer of legitimacy that they are "rescuing' the children, when it is likely the way they move children. Men bring them in, children taken by authorities, detained at Walmarts who are in cahoots with FEEMA, then the children disappear.  You also threw in  your typical phony left vs right nonsense in an attempt to say Trump is fighting the traffickers. I want to give you credit for this thread, and I will. But you are trying to say the authorities are not doing the trafficking. This makes me want to thumbs down. Did they do something about the Finders or any other cases? They cover up. They are part of it. Not the Dems, all of them. Remeber, PG is an alt right conspiracy.

             I adequately cover your concerns about DEM/REP's in the final point.  The Finders controversy was over 20 years ago and the government is it's most turbulent period of flux since the Civil War, so that is barely relevant here, at all.   Because you deny Q, it prevents you from putting the pieces together.

              MQ Ultra is a Qreepy Crazy Qult. Scientists are desperately working on a Qure for Qrackbrain. The Qcaine causes delusions of belonging to a secret intel group and creates a rush of endorphins. This Qonfounds the mind because the Qcaine binds to receptors known as the Qpiod receptors in the brain.

               Funny.. because Q was saying THREE MONTHS ago that Goodlatte and Horowitz were working together to bring down the FBI and HILLARY and I didn't hear any of that from YOU.
              </p>
              <p>
               Turn on any MSM channel and tell me who is talking right now in Congressional Hearings and exposing the criminals at the FBI.

                I have seen you say many times that the whole MSM, all of them, FOX, MSNBC, CNN etc....are all just liars and its all fake. By process of extrapolation we can use the powers of deductive reasoning and conclude that what they report on in Washington D.C. is also just a fake drama to distract us from important topics, and keep us from taking productive action. D.C. WANTS us to watch them and they only feed us mind poison. All news from Washington D.C. is a shit sandwich.

                  Its known at the "Jesuit Theatre." The Jesuits invented the Magic Lantern and developed the art of theatre, known as acting. They are actors on a stage. The only thing they are serious about is getting a better snout position at the taxpayer pig trough of money. The rest is fake drama. This is why nobody hardly ever really goes to jail because people only go to jail if they do something to piss off the secret societies brotherhood.

                    Because Trump is a Larper too. His father and son in law both affiliated with Chabad. Soros and Rothschild bailed Trump out of debt through Wilbur Ross, long time Rothschild agent. Trump's father left Chabad a large tract of land to build a temple on. Trump has a life long affiliation with criminals and child exploiters.

           <p>
            -The chain link dividers are a necessary evil, they separate children from adults, bad people from good, etc.

            -You wrote this, he discusses that
            <strong>
             all immigrants pay thousands of dollars to Mexican cartels to make this trip
            </strong>
            ...and
            <strong>
             the women (I don't think he said it but obviously many men and children too) are sexually assaulted along the way "and worse once they get to America" by the cartels

              Yes, the continued debt bondage of most illegal immigrants to the cartel seems to be intentionally kept secret by most who support illegal immigration.
             </p>
             <p>
              I did dig up one 2014 MSM article that actually discusses it.  I just made a comment on it.  When payments can't be made, the banks are right there to hand out loans to pay the cartel!

              More from that article:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The banking system encourages the risky behavior. Jorge Gúzman, the manager at one of two Banrural banks in Nebaj, said loans are more likely to be approved if the family applying has a relative up north sending back money. The loans are supposed to be for construction or farming improvements, but Mr. Gúzman said “most people are not honest about why they are borrowing.”
