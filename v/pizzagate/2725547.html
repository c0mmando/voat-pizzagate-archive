<p>Former Oklahoma state Sen. Ralph Shortey has reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors months after investigators uncovered a secret life that they say involved child pornography and a rendezvous with a 17-year-old boy he had met through Craigslist’s personal ads.</p>
<p>Shortey, a Republican who resigned last spring amid allegations that he had solicited sex from the teen, will plead guilty to a child sex trafficking charge, his attorney, Ed Blau, said. Prosecutors will drop three child pornography charges as part of the plea deal.</p>
<p>“After looking at all the evidence and case law and statutes and everything else, we just felt that this would give him the best opportunity to come out with the best outcome possible,” Blau told The Washington Post. “It would’ve been an extraordinarily difficult case to win a trial.”</p>

            I wasnt quite getting the "sex trafficking" part until I read about his Craigslist posts" looking for a boy, the younger the better"  .  Apparently this particular incident involved a 17yo.who acted on his own and may have been able to legally consent to the sexual encounter, hence the difficulty in prosecuting the case. The evil here is the fact that he solicited young boys which could have resulted in a pimp providing him with a very young trafficked child, i.e. 9 or 10 years old. Indeed how do we know whether or not he actually scored a trafficked child from his previous 13 ads, not just the 14th  one that resulted in a response from a 17yo.  Fortunately he had child pornography on his computer that gave law enforcement something else with which to arrest and prosecute him.  Then the CP charges could be used to wrangle a plea bargain on the trafficking charge.  The llaw works in mysterious ways and here we succeeded in getting a perp off the streets for awhile. With credits for "gain time" time he'll probably only serve 5 years at best. But he will forever be labeled a sex offender.

But here...is what drew me to attention...."Since the formation of Eden-Barn Foundation in June 1999 as a non-profit charitable association in the State of Nevada, the original principle of assisting orphaned, destitute children worldwide has further expanded to include the elderly. The original dream of creating a “pleasant and delightful storehouse” has now evolved into reality." Give me some feed back on the symbolism and if you have a Flicker account drill into it...

            They dropped the CP charges and will be locked up. So, the abc article said he sent CP over the internet.  How much of it?  He was looking for boys on craigslist.  Was he producing CP with those boys?  Was he part of a ring?  There are too many questions unanswered for me.  Also, it says he could get life.  Well, he did not.  He got 15 yrs.  Stinks.

             15 years is longer than most of the sex offenders around here get. I've never found anyone's record with more than 10 years served. He'll probably be released from prison and converted to an informant within a couple of months.

              I agree.  Certainly he will be released because of good behavior, and we will never know.  That's why we still have so many they keep releasing them.  We can keep weed smokers in for an eternity but child rapists and abusers, well, nevermind.

                Slap on the wrist for CHILD RAPISTS.    Life of Mental Torture for a Protective Mother.  Possibly they will end up sending Denny to some mysterious Japanese Island. Hmm.    She had Chrons  Disease and took cannabis oil.  Her son spoke up at school that Mom smoke a lot.  DCFS took him away because BIG PHARMA got it's undies in a bundle.  Kansas stood up for the Drug Cos.  not for a Citizen.   Again Our Govt. stood up for a Chile Rapist and let down the Victims.  Justice has taken a hike.

              I believe some of the CP makers are being shut up and shut down for a reason by corrupt LE.   Get them before the truth comes out.

               It is the perfect collateral to ensure compliance among the minions. The elites actually do the deed, they make the minions hold the material so if they start talking they get discredited, a minimum sentence, and a hot rap. This is why the investigation into pentagon staffers stalled, military industrial complex wants to keep the leverage they have.

                Couldnt put it better...
Its a heirarchy that is a main factor behind the hidden cabal...
It should be ..the higher u are the more accountable one should be...
The debt system doesnt allow a citybdenizen ...who comes in as a private debtor status to place a charge on the individual...
The only way ine can do that is through universal jurisdiction (wiki : universal jurisdiction) . Even deep state don kissinger is shit scared of it..
Anyone on tye planet can place a charge on anyone payable to the US treasury..
Universal means catholic..and thr US is the military arm of the Catholic book keeping system operating under dum diversas ...
It is the machination that keeps the peace and war for Rome..
We can inly activate it and charge incompetence and criminality of politicians by moving to reduce debt at the US treasury..
Until we act different ..politicians and beauracrats will hide behind thr immunity of the public office ..
that trumps private charges ...
By reducing debt u become surety to the US and its debt system ..and everyone who has taken oath to the constitution is answaerable to the surety..
Dum diversas means until different ...
The US military might is a hammer ...at the moment we have , out of ignorance of our surety status , deligate complete respinsibility to this hammer  to these criminals in the public office..

                And the DOD viewing CP went unpunished as well.  They know how to sweep things under the rug.  But whistleblowers, now that is a nasty lot.
