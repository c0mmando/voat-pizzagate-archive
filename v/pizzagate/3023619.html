<p>&quot;UN Peacekeeper Discovers Sex Trafficking Inside The UN With Ties To The U.S. State Department</p>
<pre><code>The Facts:

Ex Nebraska policewoman, Kathryn Bolkovac, who served as a UN peacekeeper and worked under DynCorp, a military contractor, where she learned about elite level sex trafficking involving the UN, the State Department &amp; Military exposes the truth.

Reflect On:

Numerous disclosures have been made, yet none of it is ever presented in the mainstream media, and if it is, they attempt to debunk it. Why does this type of activity always involve prominent &quot;elitist&quot; people? Why is it always covered up?
</code></pre>

<p>The topic of pedophilia is a disturbing one for sure, what’s even more disturbing is that this kind of thing continues to happen all over the world, particularly among the global elite. There are literally too many examples to go through, whether it be the pedophilia that’s been exposed inside the Vatican or the fairly recent NBC news report accusing Hillary Clinton covering up a giant pedophile ring within the state department, this thing is hitting the mainstream.</p>
<p>What really blew the lid off the topic was the whole Pizzagate scandal, although labeled as “fake news” by those who control the mainstream media, as organizations like Wikileaks felt it very important to release that information, and question it.  Then you have people with strange connections to the Clintons and other ‘global elitists,’ like Jimmy Savile, who was well connected with the Royal Family, as well as Jeffrey Epstein, who seemed to be well connected with Prince Andrew. In fact Epstein and prince Andrew have been implicated again in a new court case. You can read more about that here.</p>
<p>There are countless lawsuits, accusations, and more constantly going on that the public is completely unaware of. The Vatican alone has dished out approximately 4 billion dollars to settle child sex abuse claims, and right now, the prominent Vatican official Cardinal George Pell, who has been found on multiple occasions to be connected to large pedophilia rings, has been charged and convicted. You can read more about that here.</p>
<p>Above are not even a fraction of the examples that are out there, this is a very big issue with a lot of evidence behind it, but we don’t really know about it because not many people hear about it, and most of it is so downright unbelievable that it’s hard to blame them, but also discouraging when it’s not really acknowledged.</p>
<p>Apart from what’s mentioned above, we have people from within these “cliques”, and others from police forces, as well as intelligence agencies,  investigating this type of thing. Ted Gunderson, a former Director of the FBI (LA Branch) was one who spent a lot of time in this area, if you haven’t already heard of him I suggest you check him out. He did a lot of investigating into elite level child sex pedophile rings as well as children who’ve been used in strange rituals.&quot;</p>

            We have posts about her story. Kathryn Bolkovac
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Bolkovac">

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kathryn Bolkovac is a human rights advocate, consultant, former police investigator with the Lincoln Police Department, and former monitor with United Nations International Police Task Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. She came to prominence when she sued her employers for unfair dismissal after she lost her job following her attempts to expose sex trafficking in Bosnia. Her story was shown in the film The Whistleblower and told in the nonfiction book, The Whistleblower, with journalist Cari Lynn.
            </p>
            <p>
             Originally hired by DynCorp Aerospace, a British subsidiary of US based DynCorp International, in the framework of a UN-related contract, she filed a lawsuit[1] in Great Britain against DynCorp for unfair dismissal due to a protected disclosure (whistleblowing), and on 2 August 2002 the tribunal unanimously found in her favour.[2] DynCorp had a $15 million contract to hire and train police officers for duty in Bosnia at the time. She reported such officers were paying for prostitutes, raping underage girls and participating in sex trafficking.[3] Many of these officers were forced to resign under suspicion of illegal activity, but none have been prosecuted, as they also enjoy immunity from prosecution in Bosnia.
