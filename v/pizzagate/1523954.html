<p>One of our FBI insiders can confirmed the Intelligence community indicates John and Tony Podesta were in Praia da Luz, Portugal on May 3rd 2007– the day Madeleine McCann vanished.</p>

<p>Also, it was reported that the Podestas were staying with another wealthy friend of theirs, known as ‘Clem’ (Clement Freud). Clement has been accused by multiple women of sexual abuse in their youth. Unfortunately, we have yet to see any additional evidence (besides the mugshots and FBI Anon\'s assertions)  that confirms the Podestas presence in Praia da Luz.</p>
<p>At the time of the McCann abduction, an email was sent from John Podesta’s account on May 4th but it has been report it that it was sent by his assistant.</p>
<p>Searching through Wikileak’s Global Intelligence Files (Stratfor) I was able to find a few emails of Tony Podesta that haven’t received much attention.
There are no major revelations in the emails, yet they do provide some interesting details. The emails concern Tony Podesta’s subscription renewal for receiving Stratfor geopolitical intelligence reports.
There are 2 emails penned by Tony Podesta</p>
<p>1)	<a href="https://i.sli.mg/RfSVOz.png">https://i.sli.mg/RfSVOz.png</a></p>

<p>The first email is dated June 4th 2007 and T. Podesta signs off from Lausanne, Switzerland.
The second email is dated September 17th 2007 and T. Podesta again signs off from Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Researchers have been trying to place the Podesta brothers in Portugal for Madelaine McCann’s abduction May 3rd 2007. 
Perhaps this can be useful in creating a more detailed timeline for the Podestas. At the very least, it could provide a clue to where they were afterwards.</p>
<p>Digging further I was able to locate Tony Podesta in Lausanne by searching through Stratfor subscription lists.</p>
<p>(2007) 
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/26/262132_copy-of-all-paid-accounts-07232007-xls-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/26/262132_copy-of-all-paid-accounts-07232007-xls-.html</a></p>
<p>(2010)
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1318076_bawl-of-whacks-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1318076_bawl-of-whacks-.html</a></p>
<p>(Don’t want to Doxx, but it’s not hard to find)</p>
<p>The billing address for the subscription matches a L’Hotel-du-Marche in the Swiss Alps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hoteldumarche-lausanne.ch/">http://www.hoteldumarche-lausanne.ch/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hoteldumarche-lausanne.ch/en/informations/">http://www.hoteldumarche-lausanne.ch/en/informations/</a></p>
<p>So, Tony Podesta is a regular of L’Hotel-du-Marche in Lausanne. We have emails from 2007 where Tony signs off from Lausanne and we have a billing address from Stratfor for Tony Podesta as L’Hotel-du-Marche from 2007-2010.</p>
<p>Podesta connections to Switzerland include Mr. Hansjorg Wyss the Swiss billionaire who directed pharmaceutical experiments on elderly people resulting in the death of a several people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a related development, the Justice Department earlier this month refused to turn over documents sought by Citizens United under the Freedom of Information Act in seeking to understand why Wyss’ top four executives went to jail but he didn’t in a medical scandal in which five patients died as a result of an illegal drug testing program run by his former company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wyss is not only a donor to multiple Democratic campaigns (serious concerns because he is not a US citizen) but also donated $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, the Center for American Progress and also paid John Podesta $90k in consulting fees.
Additionally, Wyss was involved in a ‘nasty sexual scandal’ with a former employee resulting in a $1.5 million settlement.</p>

<p>Like I said, there are no major revelations here but maybe others can find additional leads, articles, emails, etc. to nail down where the Podestas were in May 2007.</p>
<p>Just a thought, we know that Tony Podesta is an avid art collector. Maybe he attended art shows in Europe, purchased art, or was interviewed about his art collection?</p>',

             Hey, no worries. I think it's a good thing that people look into the same things, you may catch some details that others missed, you know? Recently, I got side tracked by another rabbit hole...mainly digging into Dyncorp.
But when i was looking into Lauzanne Switzerland, i started looking into establishments, institutions close to the Hotel-de-Pres, like art museums and the like. I didn't find anything too interesting there but i did look into a school for the blind that was close by. Can't remember the name atm something "aveugle" (french for blind). My train of thought was that it could supply victims/ easy prey. You may want to look into that more?

            Still trying to establish the Podestas wherabouts around Maddie's disappearance, but I came across two more e-fits that are being circulated on a Spanish site. Those two men clearly do not look like the Podestas, but maybe someone here recognizes them as being acquaintances of the Podestas???

            I have potential sources in Portugal and could serve investigation pertaining to that. I won't have much available time, but if there's any assistance you guys may need in researching more specifically about Portugal you can DM me, and I'll take a look into it. Keep digging.

            You would figure some sort of credit card transaction would leave a good trail. Of course that involves finding cards associated with the Pedo bros and then getting access to the records.

            I could not place any of the Podestas in Portugal in early May 2007, but I was able to narrow down the timeline a tiny bit:
           </p>
           <p>
            End of April: Tony Podesta among visitors of artDC during April 27 through 30, 2007
            <a href="http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/lawrence/lawrence5-14-07.asp">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Early May: Photo of John Podesta taken at American Progress on May 2 (can this be technically verified somehow?)
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/americanprogress/542528805">
             https://www.flickr.com/photos/americanprogress/542528805
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            (EDITED) May 11: John Podesta testified about boosting teacher and principal quality before the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee on May 11,

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT 2: The Podesta mentioned in Australia is NOT "our" Podesta, so we haven't confirmed the wherabouts of any of them during those early days of May!
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT 3: Nothing for this specific timeline, but this email shows that John Podesta is obviously used to travel to Madrid "for the weekend", so it is at least possible that he went to Portugal for only a short period of time in early May 2007:

             Nice work placing Tony in DC April 27-30th 2007! I had a feeling his art collecting would help us locate his whereabouts.
And it does appear that John Podesta can be placed in Washington on May 2nd according to the photograph.

             Anyone know of any free and easy to use Timeline creator programs? I've been messing around with a free PowerPoint timeline generator but it's very restricting.

             Mr. Wyss is on the board of directors of the center for american progress CAP which was founded by John Podesta.

              http://archive.is/dRHxP
             </a>
             . The same CAP which helped by sharing floorspace with David Brock while he setup his anti right wing propaganda machine Media Matters.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you have ever heard of pnac - project for a new American century, it will be troubling to note that the CAP were rumored to have authored a document suspected to be the follow up to that project in 06 - 07, few credible sources but not something I think to be totally dismissed.

              Podesta ran Hillary's campaign.  Anyone that he's ever met was likely hit up for a donation several times. Pedo ring or not, if you're trying to get a president elected you call fucking everyone you have ever met for cash.

              Instead, they make what Miller calls "Herculean" trips to Europe and further afield to buy art. It is perfectly normal for them to leave Washington on Friday evening and return the following Monday morning, having visited more than one European capital in the meantime.

              My thoughts exactly. I wrote in another thread how one of the Comet Ping Pong related artists was given the Keys to Florence, in Italy, last year, so no doubt a few weekend parties are being thrown there, no holds barred.

               Jeff Koons is not a "Comet Ping Pong related artist."    The only connection is that Alefantis likes his stuff.

               I'm probably going on confirmation bias alone, but just want to put this out there: I've seen some confusion regarding what pizza might actually be code for. Some say boys, some say girls (boys would be hotdogs). But I noticed some other potential code words often refer to ethnicity or nationality (e.g. tortillas from Mexico). Could there be any possibility pizza is actually code for the geographic origin of the "merchandise"? That being the case, it could be Italy. Anyone knows if there are more leads pointing to Italy? Anyway, it could just as strongly be Chicago, I assume. Just wanted to put this out there. One thing is certain: the pizza code's actual definitive meaning is still dubious and not unanimous. Hope I helped!
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: Or could this be the American "Florence".. Damn USA always copying names. I didn't actually open the link, can anyone confirm or deny this?

            This is great research, good job. I think the best way to pin either Tony or John Podesta in Portugal is to get the passenger manifest of the private jets these guys flew on to get to Europe. It would be the same technique that was used to prove Bill Clinton visited Jeff Epstein's Pedo Island. They got someone who works at an airport to photocopy the passenger manifest. :-)

            Good stuff. I have an inkling of where the brothers might have been. And if the theory is right, it would tie in with one of the witnesses testimonies. No, I don't think they were staying in Portugal. I think they were at a spot way more convenient, but I need the proof. And the art would tie in.

            Something that often crosses my mind is to understand the ritualistic nature of satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, we know that Madelain McCann had a rare eye defect known as Coloboma which is revered by some satanists and thus perhaps she was specifically targeted
           </p>
           <p>
            This graph could be useful -
            <a href="http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm">
             List of Satanic Holidays
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As you will notice in the far right column describes the ideal age and sex of victims corresponding to specific satanic holidays and dates.

             there was controversy over the father McCann not being her real father, (she was born IVF)
            </p>
            <p>
             therefore leaves open she could be a test tube baby or the genetic daughter of someone important, maybe Soros?   many believe the parents lied about the abduction and that it was actually a scenario where they were relenquishing her back to her "keepers"

              YES. This is it. Gerry and Kate McCann were co-conspirator's in the abduction. Madeleine is the biological daughter of George Soros, and this specifically relates to the ritualistic satanism.
             </p>
             <p>
              The nature of the dark occult rituals is most effective when it's bloodline based. There is a science to the so-called 'black magick'. I believe it's possible that Soros has many such surrogate families who keep his children, who are later used for ritual and sacrifice.

                Fair enough. Take it as wild speculation, unless you believe in the validity of psychic or clairvoyant-provided information - which I don't expect anyone to without good reason.

               <p>
                I very much want facts that can stand up in a court of law, but hope that I can spark inspiration that will lead to discovering more solid evidence. I would be happy to provide further information about my source through DM but I think sharing here might make some people angry.

               The satanists believe that in order to contact their sacred entities, you must have some royal blood traveling back to the annunaki. Which is completely fucking stupid if you consider who the annunaki were. Or who they believe the annunaki were. The royal annunaki never bread with humans. It was their ruthless soldiers who raped human women. King David was nothing but an annunaki/ human hybrid soldier bastard child, who beheaded a full blood annunaki soldier. The part they leave out in the story sometimes (depending on the region of the account) is that David was about 7 feet tall when he fought the 8 to 9' tall Goliath.‭ Another thing they don't consider is that the annunaki picked soldiers to guard their royalty that were extremely ruthless, and had zero empathy. So with that in mind, who better to perform seriously psychotic satanic sacrifices, than someone with zero empathy or emotion. This is what attracts the entities. Total lack of any morals, standards, empathy, compassion or love. This is who the demons are truly looking to recruit. It has nothing to do with blood. It is your rotten soul, your  mind they are after.

                I think I get what you're saying with royalty vs non-royalty Nephilim, and I think we'd be mostly in agreement... The Illuminati families are a combination of genetics and soul identity. I do think blood connections play a big role in their rituals... Annunaki is a broad term referring to more than one ET group (post Atlantis). With the Khazarian factions we're referring specifically to Sirian-Orion origins (ancient 'gods' of Mesopotamia and Old Testament.) I believe George Soros to be Orion-Reptilian on a soul level, as many of Rothschilds and Rockefeller people are, but his DNA (like many people good and bad) is a combination of human and ET DNA, whether royal or not I'm not sure it matters in actuality. I do agree it's the soul that is the biggest connection to the demons/Archons. The Sirian gods they might think they're serving are no longer around. Satan/Hadad/Set was one of these guys... Lucifer on the other hand relates more to the Archons/demons and that being is still working with the Orion soul incarnations. In my opinion Lucifer is the closest thing they have to a 'master' at this point, and any form of satanism serves the reptilians they are incarnated from, and the Archons/demons they cooperate with (under the supervision of Lucifer - once Archangel - now plasma based AI parasite).

                 The soul is earths largest misconception. We firmly believe in two things. Life and death, yet the constant dialogue in our own heads exists somewhere, we can close our eyes and see anything we can imagine. Even if this constant dialogue, and mind blowing capability to imagine any possibility is human. We still don't fully acknowledge our third and most extraordinary real connection to a place between life and death that exists inside of you and me. It's very real, we go there every fucking night. Our society has chosen to almost totally ignore our greatest power. The archon/ demon thing I have heard before. Im not really familiar with it. Scientology? That was invented by L. Ron Hubbard. A satanist and notorious pedophile. So it's probably bullshit. These people know the true history of earth, and it is not we are taught in school. It can be found online, but you must be able to discern in order to find it. Discerning is an almost super natural ability to see the truth from lies. Discern!
