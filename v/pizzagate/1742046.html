             Where have you been living int he last five years? On the moon?
It IS a political movement because only leftists are openly in support of pedophilia. The article explains why that is the case and gives leftists an excuse.
I thing Milo is way too generous with leftist scum and I think the problem is that Marxism is mental illness.
Right is right and left is wrong.

              Bullshit. Whatever party is in power is in control; hello, Franklin Cover Up calling... that's republicans. John McCain, republican... it's a political issue, not a party issue. The moment parties are mentioned (as if the one party has a monopoly on exploiting people) it's trying to fracture the following; it's trying to count on party loyalty so the other party, the "offending" party is wholly complicit, when in fact, it's the system in which these parties exist, which is the true sorce for the issue.

            An obvious question where the answer is known by any in the know. They signed up for the beast system. Pedophilia in the name of blackmail, ritual and pleasure is part of the agreement. In exchange, they are allowed to join the club and gain the fame and fortune they would be denied if they had any ethics. Even David Chapelle gave in. Now he is grotesquely rich, but surrendered his self respect and credibility. And he would do it again if he had the choice.

            It's obvious to me how far we've fallen when even Breitbart opens with this statement, which is obviously meant to not be too accusatory, judgemental, or harsh:
           </p>
           <p>
            Quoting this excerpt from Salon, Breitbart says, “I’m a Pedophile, But Not A Monster” reads the headline. It’s a long, self-pitying screed that ends with a call to be “understanding and supportive” of adults who crave sexual intimacy with children."
           </p>
           <p>
            Breitbart opens with the response: "Forgive me if I’m not first to start the standing ovation. In fact I’m pretty sure most people will find the existence on Salon’s website of this post both shocking and distasteful."
           </p>
           <p>
            Treating this as a debate and arguing against this Salon "point of view" begins to transform the pedophile criminal plague into mere political discourse. It's almost like Breitbart is trying to, ironically, justify its position against child rapists, without saying "child rapist." The irony is that Salon should be ashamed to even print such garbage, and Breitbart should be on the attack, not justifying a defense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Salon editors can go to hell, and child abusers and rapists can go to hell. There needs to be zero tolerance for trying to normalize this evil. People, you can live, and live more happily, without cable tv and vanity magazines. Don't rationalize it by saying "Yeah Salon is trying to normalize pedophilia, but I love their fashion advice." NO, get them where it hurts: their wallet. Cut off the money supply to these scumbags. Sure, the CIA and corporations will still fund them and pay for advertisements, but control what you can control and keep fighting for what we cannot, but should, control.

             <strong>
              already a become a debate
             </strong>
             , full of a LOT of "thoughtful" conversation and WORDS, that resonate with young SJWs who are able to dredge up sympathy for just about anything humanly abnormal, as long as they are able to percieve their sympathy is on the side of "love and care for all humanity", even (and even especially) the monsters. LENGTHY studies and papers on the subject, produced by "science/medical professionals," are being used as political tools, and I don't think I need to explain that further here.
            </p>
            <p>
             To just say this is

              can't argue with facts, so you don't have a clue
             </em>
             kind of response. I admire and THANK these people who work hard to supply supporting
             <strong>
              evidence
             </strong>
             in the fight against normalizing pedophilia, fighting fire with fire. I agree that publications like
             <em>
              Salon
             </em>
             are scum, but those outlets aren't folding anytime soon, and if fire isn't fought with fire, they never will be.

             This is accurate and well put, good job.  Salon is detestable left wing claptrap and they are only one of many channels promoting this disease.  There is no doubt in my mind and many others that TPTB are succeeding in normalising paedophilia and modifying its definition as a mental disorder rather than a criminal act.  It is heinous to witness this psyop at play and distressing to see the apathy from the zombie sheep in such great number.  In a relatively short time I predict we will see paedophilia regarded as both a mental disorder and a sexual orientation.  There can be no doubt that humanity is Satanically possessed.

             On another note, I wouldn't pay heed to Breitbart.  IMO they were compromised when Andrew was murdered and are now a joint CIA/MOSSAD controlled opposition front.  Cherry pick from them like so many other dubious sites and exploit their position and fame for the benefit of the universal fundamentals (truth, beauty, justice, love) but don't stare into their lights!

            This is the big ugly secret, they defend it because it's the ultimate blackmail,  1/3 of our politicians are involved according to fbi anon, I believe it's probably more,  I wonder how can we let 300 depraved individual rule over 300 million,  it's time to wake up and say no more

              I get that much, any organization making an effort to normalize pedophilia obviously needs to be looked at.

              The fact of the matter is demonizing any group of people as the majority offenders is not only dangerous, it's blatantly false.

            Seeing as Milo's a conservative, he would portray this as a "left" problem, even though it's happened and been an issue on both sides of the political divide. This thing is beyond political lines, and don't let anyone suggest otherwise.

"Pedophilia itself is of course not confined to one side of the political spectrum. But defending it does seem to be. Pro-pedophile activism continues to surface on the Left in a way that it simply doesn’t on the Right. Salon is one of the worst offenders: the left-wing website runs sympathetic features on pedophilia with alarming regularity."

              I'm referring to the partisanship expressed, implying only the left defends pedos. That why Republicans were defending Hastert?

               Commie, you're in bed with a political movement that promotes feces as art, child molesting, spirit cooking, cannibalism as art performance and much more.
Cultural Marxism is mental illness.

               I don't think that's the writer's claim. He's saying, as a political movement, the left is generating pedo-friendly ideals, conjuring sympathy for the poor, affected pedos as a group no different than homo or transexual.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't get me wrong. I think it's just one big machine and there really isn't a left or right. I do think it's worth being aware of which direction the programming is coming from, though.

                And I can see that as well. My main goal was to highlight the direction the programming was coming from, and that I disagreed with the suggestion that only the left was defending pedos (as both have defended pedos, it's just arguably certain ones on the left defending the act itself, rather than the actors).
