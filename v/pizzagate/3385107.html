<p>It’s certainly a conversation starter.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein had an oil painting of Bill Clinton in a blue dress — lounging on a chair in the Oval Office — hanging up in his Manhattan townhouse, according to law enforcement sources.</p>
<p>“It was hanging up there prominently — as soon as you walked in — in a room to the right,” a source told The Post. “Everybody who saw it laughed and smirked.”</p>
<p>But the bizarre home decor didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Epstein, 66, also kept a mannequin hanging from the ceiling — dressed up in a wedding gown, the source said, noting how the doll was situated above a staircase.</p>
<p>A woman who visited Epstein’s $56 million home confirmed the existence of the Clinton painting to the Daily Mail, but didn’t mention the mannequin. She was able to snap a picture of the painting, which was posted online Wednesday.</p>
<p>In it, the former president can be seen lounging on a chair in the Oval Office — pointing toward the viewer — while wearing red heels and a blue dress similar to the one Monica Lewinsky famously donned during their White House hookup.</p>
<p>A piece dubbed “Parsing Bill” was painted and sold by a New York-based artist named Petrina Ryan-Kleid. Saatchi Art, an online art gallery, describes it as an “oil on canvas” with dimensions of 40 W x 40 H x 2 in. The painting inside Epstein’s home appears to be the same size, and sources told The Post it was also done with oil.</p>
<p>Attempts to reach Ryan-Kleid were unsuccessful on Wednesday night. A relative, when reached by telephone, said he knew of the painting’s existence but was unaware of a connection to Epstein.</p>
<p>The Clinton camp did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>',

            were compromised, you had the photo shoot ie. Bill in blue. Therefore how many photos are there...….hmmmmm?

            The Clinton painting + bills 26 visits = a clear understanding of who had who's foot on who's head. Almost like epstien wanted to make it known to all. Imagine having that portrait hung in your place when your friend whom it depicts visits a lot. Awkward...or?

             No it is not, everything THEY do is against the creators thought. To tell/show teach in the open WILL always be their highest mockery. Well times up, and death by free will is their plan to get away.

             What stood out to me, besides the 9/11 references, was the obvious references to JFK Jr.  Playing with airplanes under the Presidential desk in the oval office.  A lot of people missed that clue.   His plane crash paved the way for Hillary to become the next NY Senator....  There is a LOT to be read into these paintings.  Remember, "Modern Art" is a CIA op.   These people hide their misdeeds in plain sight.

             I posted that painting yesterday on fb ........can't figure out how to copy and past here .........but the caption  is "On the day of 9/11, George W. Bush visited the Booker Elementary School in Florida and was sitting in a chair reading 'The Pet Goat' (the book was upside down). While he was reading this book, the elementary school children were reciting these words: Kite, Hit, Steel, Plane, Must.
            </p>
            <p>
             9/11 is playing out while these kids are chanting 5 words and 3 of the words happen to be directly linked with the events of 9/11...Hit Steel Plane.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the video, they actually break right after this and this is the exact time where the man comes and whispers into President's Bush's ear that the nation is under attack. The word kite is also interesting considering Kite has multiple meanings...like "Let's go fly a kite". Check kiting or check fraud, floating funds from one account to another account without actually having the funds in either account (which is very interesting with Rumsfeld's announcement the day before 9/11 where they were missing 2.3 trillion dollars). Then there is also the term "kite' - which is an Egyptian bird linked with the Goddess Isis used in ceremonies to bring back the dead. 9/11 is the first day of the Egyptian Calendar.. The Month of Thoth. . . . the more you know."

              Don't forget the JFK Jr. references.   Jr. playing under the presidential desk....   He died during W.'s presidency paving the way for Carpetbagger Hillary to take the NY Senate seat.
