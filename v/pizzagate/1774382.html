<p>&quot;Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same 
postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade 
contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder 
of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was 
not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that 
these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades 
in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The 
existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at 
the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk 
and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to 
elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to 
exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I 
investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became 
quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. 
There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by 
Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 
160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US 
dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, 
positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty 
that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to 
the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the 
risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated 
appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in 
the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two 
currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be 
treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these 
positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded 
in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do 
not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they 
were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept 
secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all 
instrument types.&quot;</p>',

            regarding Panama Paper links. I can't RESEARCH each item right now, I have to go to work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Panama Papers have lead to arrests of high profile political parties. If we can connect the dots to hedge funds, money laundering and off shore shells/tax evasions to CGI and others, we might have a chance.

            This is big! I think the lack of traction is because hedge funds are hard to understand. Is this LMR the same as Aaron Dover?

            ETA..sorry I see you are referencing that. I knew there had to be something with a hedge funds, CGI, and Pedogate tied together.
