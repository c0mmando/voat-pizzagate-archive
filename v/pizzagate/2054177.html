            1.) If Trump raped someone the intrinsically intertwined video would have been released long, long ago 
  2.) 'Katie Johnson' as a source- is sketchy as fuck 
  3.) Numerology in itself is 110% not evidence of child rape kind of a stretch dude funky coincidence but i would chill with the numerology, i walk past 666 main st. almost everyday. 
  4.) Trump tower is NOT 666 feet tall which claim is likely an intentionally misleading statement as easily verifiable by a simple google search, it is 664 feet, so yeah objective fact: that is untrue. 
  5.) 666 is common in other occult circles, (Trump knows more than one may think)  Doesn't make you a child raper. 666 arrangement often symbolizes three planetary oppositions, three is also symbolic for the holy trinity. 
   6.) "Sympathy for the devil" is an extremely common, popular, even mainstream song
            <br/>
            7.)  "The false trumpet concealing madness"- that phrase is 110% arbitrary to Trump as an individual
   8.) Trump is allowed to have a sick sense of humor, i do also. i have called my sister hot several times jokingly, do I want to bang her? 
  9.) Anyone can make allegations. i can too- but unfortunately for your theory clearly crafted hearsay (to me) absolutely does not qualify as objective evidence, especially for child rape, kinda pushin' it. 1
  10.) 'Katie Johnson' just so happened to come out weeks before the election? c'mon give me a goddamn break. I'm sure in egyptian hieroglyphics too or some fuck or basically any language throughout the world my name translates to 666. 
  11.) Honestly, based on your blatantly projected loaded ideological semantics, Hillary-supporter similarly emulated tone, you essentially come across as a disnfo agent. your wasting our time and energy to real issues. Trump is on our side. Be objective

             Hope you're not talking about me, because I 100% agree with you. POTUS Trump is THE person to bring it all to light. Check my post history. I believe he liked this tweet as a warning to us that's where the Deep State is taking this whole thing.

              New to this not directed towards you bro. so passionate about stopping these fuckers i usually don't do forums but i had to today. both democrats/republicans guilty. they are all going fucking down and they know it. i would like a peaceful firing squad, preferably towards the genital region, preferably live broadcasted... I'm so glad this site exists. the censorship actually backfires because if something is worth censoring- logically- there must be a pretty damn good reason. i have NEVER EVER seen a degree of censorship for this it's insane. Kick em' where they're vulnerable. for the children. never fucking stop

               This is it. Mass disclosure is imminent. I personally believe this site was created by Trumps counter insurgency team. It'll be used as proof in grand jury trials as evidence of a civilian investigation. It will also be used to identify anyone trying to impede the investigation of a Holocaust of children.

            , the guy whose tweet Trump liked, has pointed to
            <a href="http://archive.is/elXdJ">
             evidence that he did so on archive.is

           <p>
            So now we can be sure that Trump really did like and then unlike the tweet.

             by the guy whose tweet it was. The guy hates Trump and believes the rape accusation, so he was freaked out about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             LA_Trump saw it as well. I can't explain why Trump liked the tweet at 3 am DC time, then unliked it at 5 am DC time, but that appears to be what happened.

                 In my view it SAYS there are 12, but I only see eight of them. And the AHamilton tweet isn't among them.

                 Not sure what it means. Maybe he did unlike the tweet, or maybe it's a problem with different regional Twitter servers not updating efficiently. Guess we'll know for sure in a while.

            It's very tiring watching the circus at the White House. So many unforced errors, such bad and amateurish messaging. The Mooch fiasco. The daily trainwreck of the Mueller investigation. But every so often, there's a bit of cleverness that gives me hope again. Like Stephen Miller's press conference on immigration. Or Seb Gorka, on the rare occasions that he speaks out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now there's this. Trump did indeed like this guy's tweet, accusing Trump of raping a 12-year-old on Epstein's private island. And as much as I cringe at stuff Trump says sometimes, this does read to me like 4D chess. This isn't random, it isn't "covfefe" type blundering. This is Trump laughing at his critics and winking at the crowd, very deliberately.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a story Winston Churchill told about the London blitz in 1940, that seems especially appropriate to this moment. London was being bombed by the Germans every night. Tens of thousands of people died, big parts of the city were burned down. Churchill emerged one night from his bunker after the all-clear and stood in a doorway with some of the workers who had come up for a little air. One fellow looked over at his Prime Minister and remarked, "It's a grand life, if we don't weaken."
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing is ever certain, especially when it comes to this kind of horror. But I confess, Trump really raised my spirits with this. I'm not going to weaken. Onward and upward.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Wow, this is the first comment I've ever made that got two downvoats. Not sure why unless it's for calling the White House a circus. But it is one, much of the time. I can be pro-Trump and still admit when things aren't going well.

            </p>
            <p>
             Katie says that she was 'fully warned on more than one occasion by both' Trump and Epstein 'that were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave' that she 'and her family would be in mortal danger.'
            </p>
            <p>
             "Trump slapped Johnson in the face with his open hand and angrily stated that he would do whatever he wanted and that he was in charge," Katie Johnson's lawsuit states.

              What you believe and what can be proven in a court of law are two different things. I wouldn't doubt Trump banged a 12 year old girl. But without EVIDENCE it doesn't matter. They obviously scared the shit out of whoever was going to testify against Trump in court so there needs to be some sort of video or photographic evidence. That's what Brownstone operations are for, precisely this reason: to produce video and/or photographic evidence of rape, pedophilia, infidelity etc.

              Okay, this explains the downvoats much better.

             <p>
              I can't really say much about Nostradamus and 666 Fifth Avenue and all that. I don't care about numerology. But it is fair to question whether the allegations against Trump are real.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would start with
              <a href="https://jezebel.com/heres-how-that-wild-lawsuit-accusing-trump-of-raping-a-1782447083">
               the article in Jezebel
              </a>
              describing how the story first developed. Needless to say, Jezebel is not a pro-Trump media outlet, but they found "Katie Johnson" far from credible. Other gossip outlets had the same reaction: They wouldn't touch the story, or would only report on it if it was heavily flagged as doubtful.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is true that Trump's lawyer suggested that Johnson's lawyer could face sanctions, but that was only after one judge had tossed the case as frivolous, and after numerous observers
              <a href="http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/yes-donald-trump-was-accused-of-raping-a-13-year-old-but-this-lawsuit-has-little-chance-of-succeeding/">
               like LawNewz
              </a>
              pointed out major flaws (like the statute of limitations).
             </p>
             <p>
              When this story surfaced, I took it to be the Clinton camp anticipating accusations that Trump would later make against them -- much like the Russia collusion nonsense. The Clintons took huge bribes for handing over uranium to Russia, so of course they had to build up hysteria against Trump on that score. There's even an email from Podesta, back in 2015, mapping out their vulnerability and how it required allegations to be made against Trump.
             </p>
             <p>
              I take this case to just be more of the same. We don't have email evidence like we do for the Russia nonsense, but the sequence of events is quite clear. They don't have real dirt on Trump, so they have to manufacture this woman, who is never available to reporters, who has no fixed address, and whose complaints keep getting tossed or discounted by neutral third parties.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can see you are pissed off, and my answer may not satisfy you. But that is where I wind up on this story.

                This observation can be illustrated by one of the more colorful figures of the early twentieth century, Aleister Crowley. Crowley was born in England, where he first encountered John Nelson Darby's dispensational premillennialism. After a few years as a member of the British Theosophical Society, Crowley created his own religious system, which he called “Thelema” and which, according to him, was based on a revelation. In 1904, while Crowley and his wife were on their honeymoon in Egypt, his wife had a revelation of the god Horus sent through his messenger, Aiwass. When Crowley and his wife visited the Egyptian Museum, they found Horus on an ancient Egyptian stele, with the number 666. In Crowley's own report, this god dictated to him the Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis), which was to be the theoretical foundation of Crowley's new religion, Thelema. Crowley's followers came to call the Egyptian stele the “Stele of Revealing,” even though it was in fact a Theban funeral stele from the middle of the first millennium bce (from the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth dynasties). Furthermore, the stele does not contain the number 666; this was simply the catalogue number from the former museum in Boulaq, where the stele had first been displayed after being excavated from the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut in Dayr el-Bahari by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette.

               Are you aware how naive your response sounds. Are you incapable of applying just a bit of critical thinking to the supposed overwhelming evidence that Donald Trump is owned by huge corporations, especially the big banks, And is actively involved in pedophilia, alleged by many victims who mocks those who's lives he´s crushed.. The evidence is overwhelming.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyways... let’s assume for the sake of the argument, An "invented" Katie Johnson did manufacture a smear campaign against Trump colluding with the alt-right, reported by the Jewish controlled media.
              </p>
              <p>
               How do we dismiss Katie's "RECORDED" interview with the Daily Mail?

               How do we dismiss her story collaborates with other Trump victims?

               How do we dismiss Trumps incestuous statements about his children?

               Oh yeh, thats right..... Your trained in the fine arts of topic dilution, a text book response straight from the shill handbook. Trump's Alleged Rape Of 13-Year-Old Girl Isn't Going Away because its true. Pizzagate was connoted so Katie Johnson would be forgotten.

                Okay, fair enough. You've got some more sources. But so do I.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's true that the Daily Mail interviewed Katie Johnson. But then on the day before the election, Nov 7, they published
                <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3914012/Troubled-woman-history-drug-use-claimed-assaulted-Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-sex-party-age-13-FABRICATED-story.html">
                 a follow-up article
                </a>
                saying that
                <strong>
                 her claims about Trump were not true, and that Katie Johnson was not her real name
                </strong>
                . Whoever she is, she may well have been raped by Epstein, and by another man, during the summer of 1994. But she herself admitted that she did not know who the other man was at the time, and only came to believe it was Trump years later, when watching The Apprentice.
               </p>
               <p>
                You say that the case won't go away. But it has gone away. It was dropped in October 2016 and so far as I can determine, nothing has come of it since. I see a half-dozen or so random tweets of the #justice4katie hashtag. The Justice For Katie website doesn't mention that the case was dropped in October, doesn't point to anything after September. It hasn't been updated in nearly a year.
               </p>
               <p>
                The same is true of all the other women who accused Trump before the election.
                <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/12/31/trumps-sexual-assault-accusers-have-no-known-plans-to-sue-remained-silent-since-election/">
                 None have actually filed a lawsuit
                </a>
                (unlike, say, Paula Jones v. Bill Clinton). I certainly understand that suing a sitting president can be intimidating, but don't you find it just the tiniest bit odd that despite the Women's March, and wall-to-wall media hostility toward Trump, and the essentially unlimited legal budget that they would be handed by countless liberals, not one went forward?
               </p>
               <p>
                Now, as for all the stuff about Trump wanting to have sex with his daughter, and his generally predatory attitude toward women -- hey, the man is a vulgar narcissist and an asshole. I've never said otherwise. He has said a great many cringe-worthy things, and I wouldn't want him around my daughter. But then I wouldn't want any recent president around my daughter, with the possible exception of Jimmy Carter.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't have to like Trump. The issue for me is simply, is there a chance that he might actually prosecute the pedos? If there isn't, it is hard to justify spending time here. But at the moment, I still think there is a chance that he can get it done. The sheer insane volume of shit that the other side is throwing at him convinces me as much as anything else. Why are they so hysterical?
               </p>
               <p>
                I hope my tone comes across here as I intend it to. You're entitled to your concerns, and I'm not dismissing them. I just think the balance of the evidence favors Trump.
