<p><strong>NAME</strong>: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_A._Cohen">STEVEN COHEN</a> (not to be confused with the Congressman from Tennessee of the same name, nor New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s chief of staff, nor the editor at The Nation, nor the Democrat bundler in Chicago...) </p>

<p>First they inflate the values by cultivating the artists through gallerists like Gagosian and Saatchi and complicit auction houses like Christie\'s and Sotheby\'s, reaching 9-figure transactions often since 2009.</p>
<p>Then they start tax-exempt foundations or private museums, like Bill Clinton’s Jewish friend Eli Broad of L.A., whose personal attorney was Hillary as far back as 1983, because established museums don\'t want to display their retarded “contemporary” artwork anyway and because they can save millions in taxes by donating cash or even stock to it. <a href="https://preaprez.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/hypocrisy-on-exhibit-at-l-a-s-broad-museum-opening/">sizzource</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, if it\'s a public tax-exempt organization, the deduction is not what it originally cost you, but rather the arbitrarily appraised value of the “piece,” like Marc Quinn’s head sculpted from his own frozen blood (sold 1991 for £13k, appraised in 2005: $2.8m).
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-you-need-to-know-before-donating-art-1418619045">Sizzource</a></p>
<p>As the museums generally have to serve the public good to get these benefits, it is a natural place to host groups of kids without suspicion, and this doubtlessly would have been the motivation behind Alefantis’ Pegasus Museum, with its watchtower over the playground.</p>
<p>So suppose we\'re having a slow summer.  A phone call is made and the former curator of the NY Museum of Modern Art, Agnes Gund (Ohio banking family, Obama appointee, married a Jew), announces she that she\'s selling a painting to Cohen for $165m and putting $100m of that into racial justice because her granddaughter is a coal-burner.  
</p>
<p>(One of the biggest names in art curating, she muses whimsically that at one school in Queens the children speak 130 dialects and languages.  “Where else do you have that in the world other than New York?”</p>
<p>Answer: in the dysfunctional and violent schools of the other Zionist-occupied cities: L.A., Miami, Chicago, Philly.  Meanwhile a 10th-generation Palestinian Arab unfortunate enough to be in Israel must learn Hebrew but zero Israeli Jews learn Arabic, which is much easier than an English-speaking learning Spanish.)</p>
<p>This $100m -- a tenth of a BILLION dollars -- will support the “Equal Justice Initiative.”  Rather than waste time considering the possibility that it is NOT more Jewish sabotage, the astute goy will instinctively search the organization​’s name (which are intentionally long and tautological) + “Soros.” </p>
<p>In this case you find the founder is one Bryan Stevenson, who advised Obama on police reform while sitting on both that task force and the U.S. board of Soros’ Open Society Foundation.

<p>So that\'s what rags like the Jew York Times report as “charity.” You can\'t tell me the absurd prevalence of interracial couples in the media is because they believe it will usher in racial harmony, because in Israel a Jew cannot even legally marry a gentile. Where\'s all the mixed marriages with the Ethiopian Jews they had to let in under the Law of Return</p>',

            I second that equineluvr. Who could have imagined a year ago the role that pseudo-art plays in human trafficking. And I bet it plays a role in many other sleazy transactions amongst the elite, domestically and internationally.

            Superb research and dot connecting, DonKeyhote.  ^
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course the Jewish aspect is critical since it lies at the CORE of PG.  The brainwashed PC idiots, Jews, Jew apologists, and shills DO NOT want this discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The art and foundation/museum angle is critical to understanding the financial aspects of these operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Sizzsource piece is a real gem.
