             There have now been 255 allegations made since former Crewe Alexandra player Andy Woodward lifted the lid on the murky world of abuse in football by opening up about being abused by ex-coach Barry Bennell.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It says that Barry Bennell moved to the United States. Does anyone have more info on what he is doing now, or where? the Podesta nephew Michael Paule Carres's linkedin says he is planning to set up a soccer organization in the Michigan area, probably near or in Kalamazoo. Suggestion: Heads up to soccer fans, players and parents...

             ...Earlier this month, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which is co-ordinating the nationwide police investigation Operation Hydrant, said more than 500 complainants and 184 potential suspects had been identified.
            </p>
            <p>
             The inquiry involves up to 248 football clubs, spanning all tiers of the game from the Premier League down to amateur level.
            </p>
            <p>
             Latest figures show the total number of potential victims standing at 526, with 97 per cent identified as male. Their ages span from 20 to four....

             Speaking of the impact of the abuse, he said: 'I felt shame, I felt my childhood had been taken away. I spent my late teens in turmoil, absolute turmoil.'

             Two women have also claimed they were indecently assaulted by Keith Weller, who played for Tottenham, Millwall, Chelsea and Leicester and was capped four times by England during a glittering career.

            </p>
            <p>
             The accusations were first made in 2002 when a number of women told the Metropolitan Police that Weller had molested them as children in the mid-1960s and early 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
             Critics said the force's original handling of the Weller case is an indictment of how child sex-abuse allegations were treated before the Jimmy Savile scandal...
