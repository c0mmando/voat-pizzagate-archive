<p>The maneuver would allow the administration to continue negotiating a controversial trade agreement with Malaysia and 10 other Pacific nations. Legislation authored by Sen.

<p>The story of the ‘Saudi Royal Donation’ has gone up in smoke, thanks to the clear and forensic detail provided by the FBI.</p>
<p>Step by step, down to the date of each dollar transfer, the Feds have spelt out in their report how, in just a matter of days, $681 million (RM2.6bn) raised from 1MDB’s so-called Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) bond issue was passed to Najib’s now notorious personal AmBank account in KL.</p>
<p>They point out that this was the very same bank account into which earlier transfers were traced from the previous 1MDB heists, processed through the companies Good Star and <strong>Blackstone</strong>, which were both controlled by Jho Low.</p>
<p>These were the people around Jho Low and they include the American Joey McFarland, who had become the Co-Producer of <strong>Red Granite Pictures</strong> together with Najib’s step-son Riza Aziz. </p>
<p><strong>Joey, who fancies himself as a discerning art collector</strong>, was at the centre of a picture-buying spree, in the period after the 2013 election, when Najib sent much of the money back to Tanore from KL.</p>
<p><strong>The FBI details how Jho Low and his gang set about laundering it through art</strong> and other high value purchases.</p>
<p>According to their instagram accounts, this tight gang of thieves considered themselves “family” – tied together by their joint misdeeds, which are now bared to the world in this report.</p>

<p>The FBI has traced a huge haul of valuable modern art purchased by the conspirators, often at record prices, over the following months via their account at Christies, as Jho Low and his pals started to style themselves as ‘art lovers’ and ‘art patrons’. </p>

            The artist is no longer the font; he is the shallow pool. Not the oracle, but the sump. The collection point of a thousand polluted expectations. The political tool of the untalented. The residue of education. The handmaiden of the self-appointed in social criticism.

            The Obama administration will remove Malaysia from its official list of the world's worst human trafficking offenders, according to Reuters.   THIS is disgusting.   This spoke volumes about the real agenda of BO and HRC.  Let's see what DJT is going to do about that.  Is he going to allow Malaysia to participate or knock them out.  That will tell us a lot about him too and what is the real truth.

             You Won’t Believe What Leonardo DiCaprio Auctioned Off Last Night

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The auction, which was curated and organized by DiCaprio’s personal adviser, Lisa Schiff, also featured works by Pablo Picasso, Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Marc Quinn, James Turrell, and Urs Fischer, among other collectible artists. A 2016 George Condo painting, Blue Diagonal Head, was also snapped up by an eco-minded buyer. Simon de Pury was the auctioneer for the star-studded event, which raised funds for ecological concerns worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
             The evening boasted an A-list guest list including actresses Cate Blanchett and Reese Witherspoon; actors George Clooney, Bradley Cooper, Jonah Hill, Tobey Maguire, and Edward Norton;
             <strong>
              U2 frontman Bono; filmmaker Steven Spielberg; and a slew of supermodels.

              It is well known that "Uncle Terry" is a pervert. He's another one who's still getting away with it. And another Obama connection.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               He is the Annie Leibovitz of his generation, having shot every culturally relevant celebrity of the past decade — Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Beyoncé. He is the man behind Miley Cyrus’ controversial makeover and directed her video for “Wrecking Ball.”
               <strong>
                In 2007, he photographed Barack Obama for Vibe.
               </strong>
               His work appears in nearly every major fashion publication, and he has done campaigns for multibillion-dollar luxury brands.
              </p>
              <p>
               He also likes to be called ­“Uncle Terry,” has depicted himself copulating with a sheep, and once embarked on a project called “Breaking in the Carpet,” photographing himself ejaculating on rugs in random hotel rooms.
              </p>
              <p>
               But in the fashion industry, Terry Richardson — he of the plaid shirt, oversized eyeglasses and omnipresent “thumbs-up” gesture — is notorious for years-long, rampant reports of sexually exploiting and abusing his models.
