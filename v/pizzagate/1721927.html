<p>The hotel is owned by the <strong>Enchantment Group</strong>.  Here is their portfolio: <a href="http://enchantmentgroup.com/our-work/">http://enchantmentgroup.com/our-work/</a></p>
<p>So, 3 properties in Arizona, one in Irvington VA and one in Eleuthera, Bahamas.  I couldn\'t help but notice the proximity to military bases.  They are quite proud of their Bahamas project in Eleuthera : <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/enchantment-group-expands-to-the-caribbean-300073222.html">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/enchantment-group-expands-to-the-caribbean-300073222.html</a></p>
<p>Well, it turns out that Eleuthera has quite a fascinating US military story, some of which is written in this blog: <a href="https://archive.is/N9KI9">https://archive.is/N9KI9</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eleuthera Auxilliary Air Force Base (AAFB) began operations in September of 1957, and was the location of the United States Air Force Eastern Test Range (ETR), originally known as the Atlantic Missile Range.  Eleuthera AAFB was Range Tracking Station #4 in this system.  The Eleuthera AAFB was part of the Air Force Missile Test Center\'s Atlantic Missile Range, which was used for long-range monitoring of rocket and guided missile launches, controlled targets, drones, satellites, and lunar probes for the Air Force, Army, and Navy.  The Atlantic Missile Range included a dozen bases around the Caribbean, and even further away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that blog includes stories of a murder and a drug plane crash.  Apart from the fascinating history, it seems that in more recent times the area has been the subject of accusations of a prostitution ring at the local girl\'s school: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_the_Bahamas">Human trafficking in the Bahamas</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Education is investigating allegations that some high school girls in Eleuthera may be involved in a prostitution ring. This report is the only indication that Bahamian citizens may be victims of human trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2010, a distraught mother accused<a href="http://bahamaspress.com/2010/07/01/mother-says-how-pedophile-officer-took-her-son-to-canada/"> the Royal Bahamas Defence Force of raping her son and taking him to Canada</a> without her knowledge :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My boy was just 15 at the time when he entered an after school programme. A man in the community who also worked at the Royal Bahamas Defense Force conducted the programme. My child was not distant from me prior to his involvement, but as he began to participate, more and more he became disconnected from me.</p>
<p>“I could not believe what I was seeing, BP. The passport department has issued my son a travel document –without my consent– for him to travel with a stranger. They raped my child and took him outside the country!” she said fighting back tears and questioning how could this happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that even the Prime Minister of the Bahamas Perry Christie has been accused of being a pedophile himself: <a href="http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/2011/08/desperate-christie-pretends-he-will-sue-the-punch-10904.html">http://www.bahamasb2b.com/news/2011/08/desperate-christie-pretends-he-will-sue-the-punch-10904.html</a> .  And there are many other stories of his corruption.</p>
<p>As an aside here he is with Bill Clinton, back in 2003, when the then President visited the Bahamas <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mgpIA">http://imgur.com/a/mgpIA</a></p>

            Initially all the  analysis and back-engineering [ET] done at Patterson, later to become Wright Patterson USAF Base.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, these functions were transferred to Groom lake, areas S4 and then S2 and finally to the Four Corners areas into cloaked bases underground. These underground bases opened up to receive aircraft and trucks. One well known was is located outside Sedona, Arizona allegedly connected to the large Argo Tunnel accessible through a hotel in Denver at one end for top brass to enter.

            Check out what alleged DEEP UNDERGROUND Military bases say about Enchantment!  I've personally spent time hiking at Enchantment, dining etc...Enchantment DEAD ENDS into these mountains in Boynton Canyon...can totally see how this would be true.
ARIZONA 1. Arizona (Mountains) (not on map) Function: Genetic work. Multiple levels 2. Fort Huachuca, Arizona (also reported detainment camp) Function: NSA Facility 2. Luke Air Force Base 3. Page, Arizona Tunnels to: Area 51, Nevada Dulce base, New Mexico 4. Sedona, Arizona (also reported detainment camp) Notes: Located under the Enchantment Resort in Boynton Canyon.

            Awesome research. I knew something was up with this whole Sedona forum and the remote Enchantment Resort. I first posted about the Sedona Forum here.

            I include links to all their attendees. Hillary was definitely there and may be at the next one thats coming up on April 8th I believe. This Sedona Forum needs more looking into and media attention. You know something ain't right when McCain is hosting a private event with the rothschilds, bilderbergs, trilateral commision and cfr members and a few peeps working for Soros.
