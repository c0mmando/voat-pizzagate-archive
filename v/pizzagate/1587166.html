<p>Why would anyone post eerie photos of a kids’ play park; a courtyard in a block of flats,  and a poorly kept and locked ‘community garden’ on Google Maps Local Guide, and offer no review? </p>
<p>Watkins reviewed a local pharmacy, ‘CVS’, close to Trolley Park and the Flats which he frequents/ed to get script filled for ‘med’s. … Here’s the review.</p>
<p>CVS
3031 14th St NW, Washington, DC 20009</p>
<p>Lee Watkins</p>
<p>★★★★★
Frequently back ordered on common meds at the pharmacy, and forget to fill orders that are called in.  Usually late on the orders they do fill, and long lines.  Poor service all around.<br />
Helpful?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103620145943754859011/reviews/@36.4095098,-83.9413395,5z">https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103620145943754859011/reviews/@36.4095098,-83.9413395,5z</a></p>
<p>Does this all seem above board to you?  
</p>
<p>What sort of person would post photos of a young girl’s head looking as though the body was buried in a playground? And another of the upper torso of a young boy looking as though he’s headed into a garden bed? </p>
<p>Why post multiple images of the surrounds of a locked community garden and then distort the images and place part of  black column in one that clearly doesn’t exist.  Why would anyone go to the trouble of doing this?  
</p>
<p>So what do we know for sure?</p>
<p>LW has recently (this month) posted 3 locations on Google Maps; Trolley Park near Pegasus Museum; the courtyard of a block of flats, and the outside of a locked community garden – which are all in close promixity to one another.</p>
<p>Neither of these locations is reviewed by him.</p>
<p>Could it be reasonable to suspect that these photos were posted in order to communicate with others? They have an incredible number of views for 3 pretty ordinary locations. </p>
<p>We know LW has reviewed a pharmacy where he frequently picks/ed up ‘meds’ and that the pharmacy is close to Trolley Park, the flats and the community garden.  He has reviewed a vehicle tire garage which he rates highly. He cycles and takes note of cycle racks.  He has lived/s in Baltimore.<br />
Trolley Park, 1225 Fairmont St NW, CVS Pharmacy, and Euclid Street Community Garden are out of district, if he still resides in Baltimore.  He may live and/or is closely connected to the flats at 1225 given his access and interest in the said property and posting of 5 photos of its courtyard. 
He likes to review chicken and pizza and his ‘fav pizza is the 3-cheese pizza with a few extra toppings added’ ... </p>
<p>Just saying...Don\'t really think this is debunkable do you?</p>',

           Why would anyone post eerie photos of a kids’ play park; a courtyard in a block of flats,  and a poorly kept and locked ‘community garden’ on Google Maps Local Guide, and offer no review?
          </p>
          <p>
           Watkins reviewed a local pharmacy, ‘CVS’, close to Trolley Park and the Flats which he frequents/ed to get script filled for ‘med’s. … Here’s the review.

           ★★★★★
Frequently back ordered on common meds at the pharmacy, and forget to fill orders that are called in.  Usually late on the orders they do fill, and long lines.  Poor service all around.

           Does this all seem above board to you?
          </p>
          <p>
           What sort of person would post photos of a young girl’s head looking as though the body was buried in a playground? And another of the upper torso of a young boy looking as though he’s headed into a garden bed?
          </p>
          <p>
           Why post multiple images of the surrounds of a locked community garden and then distort the images and place part of  black column in one that clearly doesn’t exist.  Why would anyone go to the trouble of doing this?
          </p>
          <p>
           So what do we know for sure?
          </p>
          <p>
           LW has recently (this month) posted 3 locations on Google Maps; Trolley Park near Pegasus Museum; the courtyard of a block of flats, and the outside of a locked community garden – which are all in close promixity to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
           Neither of these locations is reviewed by him.
          </p>
          <p>
           Could it be reasonable to suspect that these photos were posted in order to communicate with others? They have an incredible number of views for 3 pretty ordinary locations.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know LW has reviewed a pharmacy where he frequently picks/ed up ‘meds’ and that the pharmacy is close to Trolley Park, the flats and the community garden.  He has reviewed a vehicle tire garage which he rates highly. He cycles and takes note of cycle racks.  He has lived/s in Baltimore.
           <br/>
           Trolley Park, 1225 Fairmont St NW, CVS Pharmacy, and Euclid Street Community Garden are out of district, if he still resides in Baltimore.  He may live and/or is closely connected to the flats at 1225 given his access and interest in the said property and posting of 5 photos of its courtyard. 
He likes to review chicken and pizza and his ‘fav pizza is the 3-cheese pizza with a few extra toppings added’ ...

           Just saying...Don't really think this is debunkable do you?

            These reviews could possibly be coded msgs to convey kids are needing to be picked up, dropped off, etc.  Also, someone had said that most of the houses around the park are owned by two people.  They could be taking a picture to inform someone what building they are being housed in.  I think these reviews are a great way for a pedo tto convey messages in plain site  Kinda like "when I say this in a review, you know it is time to come"  You might be on to something.  I would keep watching the reviews and pics.
