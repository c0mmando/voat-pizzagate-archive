In February 1987, two men from the Finders bringing six children with them were arrested in a Tallahassee park on child abuse charges. All of the children were filthy and unkempt, and they told police that they only got food &quot;as a reward&quot;. The men were arrested, and it would later be found that two children had signs of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Because the Finders men were from DC, Tallahassee police suspected an interstate child abuse network, so they contacted the US Customs service. USCS began a joint investigation with the DC MPD, raiding the Finders warehouse and finding evidence of child porn, Satanic worship, importation of children, and terrorist connections. However, the investigation was then shut down by the CIA.</p>
<p>Many people have seen the <a href="http://tedgunderson.info/index_htm_files/US%20Customs%20Service%20Report%20of%20Investigation%20FINDERS.pdf">US Customs report</a>, which tells this story. But to my knowledge, nobody has acquired the Tallahassee PD documents until now. One of my friends did a public records request for me and uploaded them <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwnI6PcRU44rdWppM2ZPUERnYTA">here</a>.</p>

            ".  The original finders police report (if I remember correctly, going to have to go back and check) stated that an informant who was previously able to corroborate important information explained how these men would answer babysitting ads for work and would gather information about the family, working hours, etc.

            Perhaps the children they found with colobomas were especially targeted for abductions?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, just as a side note, the first thing that came to my mind when I read that the children were given oranges as rewards for following instructions and being good was that picture on JA's instagram of the little girl standing in the shopping basket, tongue out, with an orange being presented.

            But Nick doesn't know about these other ties. Yang was exposed due to a missing nuke. It led to Yang and the illegal alien working there, under Jeb, Florida was selling out it's missile technology to China! I asked the investigator why would even JEB do this?!! The answer was simple. MONEY. The actual person to contact is John Caylor. Insider-Magazine.

            Yes, I was planning to get this information to Nick Bryant. (
            <strong>
             EDIT
            </strong>
            : I've done so; he was quite appreciative and plans to disseminate it to some of his friends.) Especially interesting is the apparent confirmation that the Finders were involved with mind control.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for a connection between the Finders and Aquino, I have found something interesting, though unconfirmed. It involves the case of Richard Hamlin, who was convicted of beating/torturing his wife Susan and getting her to fabricate stories of Satanic abuse at the hands of her father, Dr. Sid Siemer.
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071113103221/http://www.geocities.com/richardwhamlin/openletter">
             Hamlin maintained
            </a>
            that she revealed the abuse on her own, they went to the police, and after the police didn't believe her, she changed her story (likely out of fear of retribution from her father) to say Richard had abused her. There seems to be a reasonable amount of evidence to support Richard's case:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We have been able to obtain Susan’s diaries and journals. They support completely her original statement of 2/26/04. Susan wrote that she was molested, raped, and tortured by her father and she wrote of molesting her children with her father and by herself.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have just received a report from a handwriting expert which confirms that Susan’s diaries and journals were not written under duress or dictated. She wrote them freely and with deep thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have found a high school friend of Susan’s who will testify that Dr. Siemer molested her while she and Susan slept in the Siemer living room.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have found that Susan’s sister Terri Aal has been involved in counseling due to her belief that she was molested. Susan has stated that her sister initially believed Dr. Siemer molested her but has “no memories.”
            </p>
            <p>
             We have found a note written by Susan to a Siemer associate and conspirator in the murderer plot of me. The note was written by Susan to declare that she no longer wanted to be a part of the murder conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have obtained my 2nd son’s kindergarten “wish list,” written seven years ago, where he wrote: “I wish my mom would stop licking me.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This open letter from Hamlin also says the following:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Renowned and well-respected investigative reporter, Virginia McCullough from NewsMakingNews.com has discovered the following:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Individuals who wish to remain unidentified have said that Dr. Sid Siemer is a high ranking member of a CIA sanctioned child molestation ring called "The Finders" and also a senior member of the Order of the Trapezoid, consisting of worshippers of the Temple of Set.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Of course, an anonymous source doesn't help prove anything, but if true, it places Siemer as a high-level member of both the Finders and a group worshiping Michael Aquino's church.

            This is what  I  don't  understand-the  CIA is managing  and  controlling  all  of this,  but we  never  zone  in  on  these  international bastards-they  are the elephant  in  the room, until they  are  brought to heel all  of this is  just discussing the  murder  after the effect-chasing this  ghost you  never  catch-nobody  wants  to  do  it   but unless people get  to  the root  cause  its all  for  nothing

            What computer system are they using to transmit messages this way in 1987..and from a van?? 
The whole "game caller" and many other aspects seem like standard mk ultra style experiments.
They found over 20 floppy disks that were "programs"?? like what kind of programs? 
the china thing is really unexpected what is up with that

            Located a book called "The Game Caller." This could be a psyop. Or insurance. But this book, written like a novel, by someone that claims to have been in "The Finders" group attempts to reveal his experience. One question though. How did he remember all his conversations from this many years ago? Many interesting details are in this book if even the tidbits are accurate.

             Yeah, and in 64.jpg of the TPD docs, it turns out that they were instructed (over the Finders computer network) to use that cover story if stopped by police. Which proves the group expected they might be arrested and were prepared to lie to police.

               I don't remember seeing them explain why they were at the park in particular. The broader question, in my mind, is what they were doing in Tallahassee. According to Mary, they went from DC through a network of farms all the way to Kentucky, then headed down to Florida. An adult Finders member said they were working on some kind of construction project in Kentucky (see 62.jpg), and after the project reached a standstill, they decided to take the children on an "adventure" to Florida, where they saw Doug Ammerman's parents in Gainesville before going to Tallahassee for an unknown reason.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is one potential theory I have for why they were in Florida. The Florida and Georgia area

               </a>
               resembling that of Franklin, with connections to Coggins Farms in Lake Park GA and the infamous John Couey/Jessica Lunsford case. Even more strikingly, the ring is said to have helped a Chinese spy and illegal alien (working for

               , a company with political ties to the Bushes) acquire a false ID, which makes me think back to that strange China connection the Finders have.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, weird China connections are present for both the Bushes and Clintons. Jackson T. Stephens, an Arkansas powerbroker who helped rescue Clinton's 1992 campaign with a large loan, was business partners with the Riady family,

                I've known about the Finders, Lundsford case and I've known about the Yang case, more than just the the Chinese guy. Rep. Tom Feeney ran this stuff. I know the Whistleblower involved in creating electronic voting machines, who did it at Yang! It was this election fraud that led to the pedo ring info. But lt led to Franklin, not the Finders. There was more to see there as info on the Finders case was slim. These police reports are important. Now you a need to read the story by great investigator John Caylor. It will tie it together for you. Jeb Bush is very involved, he was the governor. Rep. Feeney was always put up as chair of the "technology committees. This story is where my journey began, after realizing our election results were flipped on our electronic voting machines. Please read as it brings it full circle. Also tied to Whistleblower testimony before congress. Here are both links.

                 Oh yeah, I know quite a lot about all of that: Yang Enterprises, Clint Curtis, Tom Feeney, the John Couey case, etc. - it all ties together. In fact, I think I remember you commenting on one of my recent posts about how Yang was an IT contractor for Florida's foster care system. I followed the same journey you did: after learning about election rigging, I learned about all the other corruption tied to Yang Enterprises.

                I think they are exporting kids out of China.  Remember that American woman who worked at Chinese embassy and had connections with Trolley Park? I think this nefarious biz has been going on a long time.

                Wow, thanks for all the info and replying!  I am pretty sure that Jack Ma (Alibaba) has some significant ties to the Clinton Foundation.  Imagine all of that shipping Alibaba does around the world.  Alibaba is also involved in the internet and security systems and entertainment .   And the Chinese govt  has such a poor reputation with respect to human life.

            The finders are most certainly still operating. Most people haven't heard of them though. It's crazy how quiet they have stayed since the high profile incident in Florida.

            Could you please re-upload these documents on another site. There has been discussion in the past about how documents on google forms, docs, drive, etc. could be a honey pot for catching pizzagaters. Don't get me wrong, I don't think you are a shill, I just want better security here.

              You know, know that I think about it, the article I read was about a lawsuit or something against John Podesta where the viewer had to click on a link to a view-only google doc. Up at the top of the screen it would show users listed as "guests" with random animal avatars. I can't find the article now, but I think the thinking was that if a pizzagater was signed in with a google account, the owner of that document would be able to see the gmail address and thereby be able to dox the pizzagater. I don't know if not being signed in gave away any other info such as IP address.
             </p>
             <p>
              As far as my suggestions for places to upload, If I need to upload pics I ususally use
              <a href="https://imgtc.com">
               https://imgtc.com
              </a>
              which is reccomended by
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/PizzagateMemes">
               https://voat.co/v/PizzagateMemes
              </a>
              and can show up in the body of voat threads without needing to open a new tab. You will need to remove the metadata ahead of time, but the nice thing about that site is that you don't need an account to upload.
