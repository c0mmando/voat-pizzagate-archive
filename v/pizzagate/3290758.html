<p>Fairfield Hills State Hospital, Newtown</p>
<p>&quot;The Damned Story: Opened in 1931 to help alleviate the overcrowding at other state mental hospitals, Fairfield Hills housed &quot;mentally ill&quot; (aka &quot;the criminally insane&quot;) patients from across the state. Built on over 770 bucolic acres, the 16 buildings—all connected by underground tunnels—were home to over 4,000 patients when filled to capacity. Like many of its patients, Fairfield Hills projected an outward image that seemed quite pleasing; what was happening inside behind closed doors and out of the public eye, however, was alledgedly much darker and disturbing.</p>
<p>As you might expect, Fairfield Hills was typical in its treatment of the mentally ill—electric shock therapy, hydrotherapy, psychosurgery and frontal lobotomies were common early on, resulting in a few suicides and &quot;mysterious&quot; deaths. Stories of abuse and cruelty were rampant. In short, it wasn\'t a happy-smiley, fluffy-kitty and shiny-rainbow type of place.</p>
<p>With less and less patients being treated there, Fairfield Hills was closed by the state in 1995. And that\'s when it seems the troubles began.&quot;

<p>SANDY HOOK: Gene Rosen Identified as Official FEMA Employee</p>
<p>&quot;Gene Rosen – Retired Psychologist and FEMA Employee involved in Community Theater and Public Access TV.  Also Reads to Elementary School Children.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gene Rosen is a retired psychologist who lists the infamous Fairfield Hills State Hospital in Newtown as a former place of employment.&quot;

<p>Whispers of Fairfield State Hospital
Something needed to change...</p>
<p>&quot;In 1941, the patient overload continued and led to a high staff turnover. Not only did employees resign from exhaustion, but because World War II demanded their services elsewhere. Advertisements for summer jobs were placed in the local papers—in the hope that younger people would fill the empty personnel slots. The introduction of Electric Shock Therapy to Fairfield’s repertoire also looked promising. 
But in November of that year, the first hints of darkness emerged.
The sudden death of a patient prompted an autopsy, which revealed that the man had been severely beaten to death. Five employees were fired. Two of the attendants were convicted of manslaughter, and one of assault.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of the 1940s, conditions improved once more. The 1950s ushered in new personnel—and a film for psychology students, titled Man to Man, was shot on the grounds in 1954. But that same year, a former psychiatric aide named Chuck Hall wrote an exposé on the neglect and brutality he witnessed at Fairfield. The hospital attempted to counter this by making architectural changes and promoting a more welcoming, home-like atmosphere. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Although Fairfield attempted to pivot into a drug and alcohol program, the hospital died a slow death. Finally in 1995, the facility was closed.
Most of the hospital’s buildings are connected by concrete tunnels, which were primarily used to move patients back and forth in bad weather. Corpses were also transported this way. The buildings of the hospital are both closed and boarded up, although enterprising ghost hunters have found more than a few ways inside.  Those who have visited Fairfield report sounds of wailing and anguish—always from an indiscernible direction. The tunnels that connect the buildings are reportedly a hotbed of sounds ranging from wall scratches to the rustling of medical equipment. Cold air, even in mid-summer, fills the corridors, and those who visit report feeling sick until they are completely off the grounds.
With local police ramping up their patrol, access to Fairfield is now virtually nonexistent. There are, however, walking trails and paths for the public.&quot;

<p>&quot;TUNNELS NEAR SANDY HOOK SCHOOL FOUND
Lo and behold I found that there ARE tunnels underground right near Sandy Hook School. They are under the Fairfield Hills Insane Asylum which the city of Newtown CT purchased just a few yrs ago. Several people have gone into the tunnels and reported their findings long before the shooting at the school in 12/2012.</p>
<p>Gee- do ya think they might have connected the Sandy Hook School to the satanic tunnels under the Fairfield Hills Mental Institution which is right down the block???? Satanists love to hide their crimes underground.</p>

From article:
“Tunnels welded shut Since Newtown took over the property in August, security has increased dramatically. ”</p>
<p>“The utility tunnels feel like long concrete coffins. You’re so far underground,” Bryant said. “It’s not real wide, but it’s long. It’s claustrophobic. You get a high-powered flashlight and the beam seems to end in darkness. And the echoes were awesome. When you stopped walking, you could still hear the echoes of your footsteps behind you.”&quot;</p>

FAIRFIELD HILLS INSANE ASYLUM NEAR SANDY HOOK SCHOOL</p>
<p>There are repeated stories and accounts by former patients who saw hideous cruel events in the underground tunnels under the insane asylum- which is right near Sandy Hook School.</p>
<p>“6.S. W. Bramblett August 20th, 2009 11:42 pm
I was a patient there from September 1972 until June 1976. (Age 14-17). I worked with Tunnel Maintenance Supervisor Jimmy Fowler mopping the tunnels every week. I know those tunnels like the back of my hand. I could tell you stories of the horrific treatment of patients there. I saw so many nominally mentally ill patients being subjected to electroshock therapy for no other reason than the staff figured the patient might be difficult to handle. I was in Greenwich House when Joe Gillotte decided to take a can of lighter fluid and set Ward 1-A’s linen closet on fire, destroying the building. “Code 99″ was announced over the loud speaker whenever someone acted out, and orderlies from all the other buildings would run to that Ward and wrestle the patient down, strangling them in choke-holds and punching them, tying him/her to a bed and jabbing them in the butt with an injection of Thorazine. I was there and I saw it all. I still have nightmares about the place… It was simply a warehouse for the insane and the vast majority of employees had no real training in the care of the mentally ill.”</p>

<p>&quot;Five Nebraska counties — three rural and two in the Omaha area — also filed lawsuits, as did South Sioux City. Douglas County, which includes Omaha, claimed in its January lawsuit that the epidemic has saddled officials &quot;with an enormous economic burden&quot; and led to more crime and children in foster care.
Nationally, more than 2,000 state, local and tribal governments have sued Purdue.&quot;</p>

            Well, I'll just add this post to the mix
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2555572">
             Remember Sandy Hook, Newtown? Connections with NXIVM, Cerberus/Dyncorp, the Lucis Trust, and United Nations Agenda 21. Yup, looks like they're all connected...

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Recently I posted about Stephen Feinberg (CEO of Cerberus) and then found out that his father just happened to be living in Newtown when the shooting happened. Then I came across an image of
             <strong>
              Gene Rosen
             </strong>
             with an odd painting of a child on his wall and the news that Rosen was a retired psychologist from a notorious state hospital. And a Harvard psychiatrist who specializes in trauma and belonged to the UN Baha'i Faith just happened to move to Newtown shortly before the shooting. Looking further I find
             <strong>
              Oxenberg
             </strong>
             links which takes us to NXIVM...

            , I have to give this the "Possible Disinfo" flair, since the main link that would make this pizzagate related is from The Millennium Report, which is a known disinfo purveyor. I am happy to remove the flair if you can find a more reliable source for the same information.

            waynemadsenreport stated years ago that Sandy Hook area was crawling with CIA &amp; Catholics.Read Dave McGowan's Programmed to kill and his book on Laurel Canyon to see just how prevalent mkultra is to find violent mentally ill people and train them to kill....also how it is used in our entertainment......There is a discussion group where the Laurel Canyon book can be read for free. It tells of a secret movie studio back in there where movies were made. The actors involved are all suspect as being under mind control..i.e. Marilyn Monroe as a presidential model.They were very high value. Brice Taylor's book, Thanks for the Memories is about how they are used.....Ronald Reagan used her .......her book names names and tells how they are used. Quite astounding.

                 P.s. as I'm reading this, and believe me it's excellent, I don't believe it's the actual book, perhaps more like a 221 page blog of Dave McGowens? Anyhow, just wanted to clarify that, though as I said, it's very good &amp; really informative.

            excellent post. MK ultra and electroshock therapy never ended
           </p>
           <p>
            now it's more effective because they understand the brain better and use both electroshock and magnetic waves to influence brain state.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Central California they still do electroshock on inmates as psychological treatment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure they do the same things to adolescents in mental institutions

            Sandy Hook was a huge hoax and the school was closed with asbestos prior to the so called drill shooting. Any mention of it on YouTube or social media gets banned and removed.

             Yes, there were indications at the time that the original Sandy Hook had been closed. I remember looking at the photos. Thanks for the You Tube link. They are desperate to put this stuff down memory hole.

             Wisconsin is guilty in this corruption.  Batton air has tunnels to the hospital, forgot which ones.
supposedly the breweries/cheese factories  are connected
