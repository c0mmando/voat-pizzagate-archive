            They most definitely have an internal database, which is queried based on the information you specify in the search form. It is very weird that this information is not more readily available for public use. The process of obtaining this information is unnecessarily time consuming and difficult. At face value, you would think they would want additional outside research on such a large and emotionally stirring issue. As

             Hey man, this is my exchange with someone else, about getting some stats.
            </p>

             As of today, for the date range 11/29/15 - 11/29/16, there are 303 children missing in Virginia, that were first reported missing during that one-year time period.
            </p>
            <p>
             Compared with 25 from last year, between 11/29/14-11/29/15
            </p>
            <p>
             Yesterday as I was working on that time frame, the Virginia number climbed from 293 to 308. Today it is at 303 for that time period so that is a slight improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
             The researcher from the YouTube video might have gotten his data by linking to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's website (www.missingkids.com) through the Virginia State Police website. That is a different data set than I used. I think it lists all adults and children missing in Virginia, whether reported this year or in prior years. When he said so many were reported missing this year, I decided to just check this year against prior years, and it is unbelievably different.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             I think The guy in the video, said he specifically called somewhere, because he couldn't find them. And at one point in the video he goes month by month but starting with May or something, So he went through 2015 into 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said, He nor I looked hard enough, because obviously found them... I actually went to the page you linked, first...But didn't notice the search by stay on the side. In my defense, I was on my phone. I'll look into this more thoroughly but I just did 1-1-2014 - 11/29/2016 And it only said there is 338 total cases...
            </p>
            <p>
             338 total missing, They only show 9 at a time, but out of the first 36 missing kids, 27 DID NOT have pictures..
            </p>
            <p>
             New york, same time period... 88 missing. First 36 all had pictures.
            </p>
            <p>
             Illinois between the same dates, 93 missing. First 36 all had pictures.

            I think The guy in the video, said he specifically called somewhere, because he couldn't find them. And at one point in the video he goes month by month but starting with May or something, So he went through 2015 into 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, He nor I looked hard enough, because obviously found them... I actually went to the page you linked, first...But didn't notice the search by stay on the side.  In my defense, I was on my phone. I'll look into this more thoroughly but I just did 1-1-2014 - 11/29/2016   And it only said there is 338 total cases...
           </p>
           <p>
            338 total missing, They only show 9 at a time, but out of the
            <strong>
             first 36 missing kids, 27 DID NOT have pictures..
            </strong>
           </p>

            New york, same time period... 88 missing.

             I don't know how you got only 338 cases. I did it just now and got 2012 cases since January 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I think the thing about the first 36 having pictures is a problem with that search sidebar. More pictures come up if you view from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you replace the VA with whatever state you want data for, you can view all the missing kids from a single state on one page, here:

               Neither did I. I searched from 1/1/2014 - 11/30/2016.
Same as you. I think you must have left a different parameter on that limited the search because that's a number I've gotten consistently.
              </p>
              <p>
               EDIT: It went up to 2023 cases but it's still right around what I said.

                 And I thought you were talking about the whole country too because you never mentioned Virginia. That's why I was insisting that it made no sense. If you're talking about Virginia fine but I can't read your mind.

                   You mention more than just Virginia and that's why it wasn't clear to me but sure, I'll take the blame for misunderstanding. Arguing about whether I should have known what you meant doesn't help us move forward. The number seemed super wrong because I thought you were reporting a different number. So in conclusion, both of our numbers are correct but we were talking about a different things. Confusion clarified and hopefully no one else will be confused either.

            ... What? You know The National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children is most likely involved, right? There have been multiple threads detailing why and how. That being said,  No one said they don't have a database for themselves.... As to why wouldn't The NCMEC, that's linked to all of this, not have a public database... That is your question?

            That is a really good idea! We can not depend on NCMEC and its board to care beyond its own self interest.

            Since NCMEC and ICMEC receives operating grants from DOJ, Here is a complaint hotline to make online report  of  waste, fraud, abuse, misconduct, or whistleblower reprisal relating to a Department of Justice (DOJ) employee, program, contract, or grant.
           </p>

            It may be the case that no one has has ever complained about NCMEC or ICMEC  waste and misuse because of all the supposed wonderful things they do. 
I am preparing a complaint. I am including in the complaint NCMEC lack of compiled nationwide statistics and numbers of missing children. I am also including that their present database is archaic and impossible for the average person to  search and compile numbers of the missing per their age, date they went missing, their age when they went missing, location taken from, identifying marks, lack of pictures or information in regards to reported sightings or remarks of witnesses( such as suspect perpetrator sketches, and or witness identified vehicle information, etc)
They also have other programs like SMART there are student id' with tracking chips connected to phone app....why are there more missing now than ever before?
           </p>
           <p>
            It has become all to easy for these abductors to take people, which is crazy considering the surveillance and tracking we all are under. 
We have face recognition on most new cell phone models; and almost every 16 year old has a phone, how is it that 183 of 264 missing in missouri are ages 14-16 years old, and they can not  be located?  The only way this can be explained is that cyber security innocent images division of the FBI,(whose seal btw is a Black widow spider) ICE and Interpol knows they are missing and is complicit in making sure they are never heard from again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the link of FBi innocent image division of cyber security task force seal with the Black widow. (If you know the deep symbolism of that, then its like wtf....on a division of the fbi seal)  I came across this division in a NCMEC pdf in regards to the agencies it works with The head of the division is Nicholas Savage.

            Here is a slideshow of how they are catching so many pedophiles,  working in conjunction with agencies in the UK ...one example they give for an arrest has evidence that could be considered paltry in comparison to Podesta and the rest of these worms.

            The number of kids missing in Virginia from 9/1/2016 - 11/30/2016 = 228
228/297 = 77%
           </p>
           <p>
            The number of kids missing in Virginia from 9/1/2015 - 11/30/2015 = 15
15/30 = 50%
           </p>
           <p>
            The number of kids missing in Virginia from 9/1/2014 - 11/30/2015 = 3
3/12 = 25%
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's too hard to say whether there's really an uptick in the number reported missing in the last few months. The numbers for the state of Virginia are quite high though.

            thats 297 vs 2 which means they thought just driving 30 min into va would be enough to NOT draw attention in their very location, slightly clever

            Call the National center for missing and exploited kids... It is not available online. The person who got these stats had to call. He was also told that they have a 93-97% successful recovery rate.  When he asked how they got that number, no one could answer... HE asked ,Who he should talk to, to get an answer to this number... No one knew.

            As OP says, the majority of the missing in Virgina are from three counties bordering DC.  Another detail:  HUNDREDS of these missing kids don't even have a picture submitted.  All the other kids from missing states had pictures.  Well a few didn't have pictures, for each state... But not dozens, let alone hundreds, like Virginia.

            I did not call NCMEC's myself, to verify these stats myself,

             this is where I first heard these states

            If someone finds out these stats are incorrect, PLEASE let me know.

           <p>
            EDit: Whoops, Did not see that OP linked to the video as well...
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Someone replied saying that stats are available online for all states.  The close I could find to substantiating that claim,  is this
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/missingkids/servlet/PubCaseSearchServlet?act=usMapSearch&amp;missState=VA&amp;searchLang=en_US&amp;casedata=latest">

           </p>
           <p>
            It has 399  missing persons from virgina, But is not specific to 2015-2016.  The 399 people on that list, have gone missing anywhere between 1970-2016.   The stats the OP is referring to, are from 2015-2016 alone. So the claim is that 392 people have gone missing in 2015-2016 alone...
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone can point me to an actual list, for the states and dates in question. That would be much appreciated.

              That contains 399 missing persons, But that is not from 2015-2016 alone. Some of the cases go back as far as 1970.. I'm confident more than 399 people have gone missing in virgina, since 1970.  Am I missing something?

               This is why I am making a complaint to DOJ waste/fraud/misuse of funds...they receive DOJ grants and their database is inaccurate outdated not being updated, it provides nothing to help identify anything its more like a funerary and its search parameters are limited. The least they could do is provide a decent database.

                I Think an out of date, inaccurate database is intentional.  If it was up to date, accurate, and included specific details, there would be a lot more people asking questions.  Again, They claimed to have 93-97% recovery rate. So It'd be interesting to hear them try to defend it.  I know they won't...But we'll see.

            I noticed discrepancies in the numbers between the State Police  reported  missing Juveniles and NCMEC. 
Here is one example. Missouri State police reports 388 active missing Juveniles.
            <a href="https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/CJ51/Search?page=1&amp;county=&amp;personType=J">
             https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/CJ51/Search?page=1&amp;county=&amp;personType=J
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            NCMEC states 61.
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/Search/MO">
             http://www.missingkids.com/Search/MO
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Why such a huge discrepancy? The Virginia State Police numbers and NCMEC numbers are now about the same. 
From what I understand is the State Clearinghouse works in conjunction with NCMEC which is in fact a corporation with its own Board of Directors who receives Fed grants from Department of Justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't checked other states to see if its the case elsewhere but I certainly noticed this when I checked. The reason why I was checking MO is because NCMEC associated FALET (Family Advocacy Law Enforcement Training operates at
401 manscen loop
Suite 1721 thurman hall 
Ft leonard wood MissourI
           </p>
           <p>
            This is divergent from the majority of NCMEC/DOJ  associated organizations which operate in and around Alexandria-Fairfax Virginia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The states with some of the  highest numbers have NCMEC operating offices there.

            The Finders, a child abuse ring, is known to operate in northern Virginia. Documents relating to the Finders went around not too long ago, and it's clearly been covered up. Can we get some autism on this?

             I was listening to Ted Gunderson the other night and he said when things got too hot for them in they relocated to Wichita Kansas, but by the numbers it looks like they went back to DC area. Also Ted Gunderson tried to take the files up to his superiors four times and was always denied.

             I have looked into The Finders quite a bit  over the years.  This group has very deep ties and roots to the Intel and federal LE community.  The original investigation into the two men arrested with a group of school children from Florida was swept under the rug.  This was after the WaPo article 20 years ago on The Finders.  Shortly after all the media attention the group went dark.  I used to have names and some old locations associated with their "leadership" which I will try to dig up.  For the most part The Finders  went dark for or more likely have morphed into something different and more sinister.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am 100% in agreement with you that this should be looked into some more because I too believe there is definitely something there. 
I could devote an entire website on The Finders alone that's how much shit there is.  One common theme you will start to notice once you look into The Finders is how deeply intertwined this group is with the CIA and the MIC.  Again, definitely relevant and a string that should be pulled on.

             We can't entirely discount the illegal migrant influx, and their potential role in this. MS-13 has seen a resurgence in NoVA in the past few years, and they're well known for human trafficking - particularly in children and sex. Could there be a connection to these gangs and the criminal elite?
            </p>
            <p>
             I do remember that while looking at bargain home deals in Herndon, VA in 2008, that many had been lived in by MS-13. You could always tell, because there was Satanic graffiti all over the damn place. Obama seems to have a vested interest in not keeping these people in jail. Wonder why?

               The name derives from "Mara Salvatrucha 13". The origin of the name is debated, but it appears to mean "group of Salvadoran rebels". The 13 signifies their allegiance to the Mexican mafia.

              Yea we have been thinking about cps as well. In a lot of these lower socioeconomic areas there are higher rates of kids in cps.. Another variable for the equation.  Thanks for everything you all are doing and we all have to stick together.  I started a Blog website to put all of this pic and other circumstantial evidence together in packages that make sense and flow well.  Share the link if you see fit and I appreciate it.  The second post will be going up tonight.

                 No problem. I just wanted to cover our bases because if our claims can't stand up to other explanations, we won't convince anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I haven't found anything to explain why Virginia has such a high percentage of missing children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Population-wise, using estimates from 2013
                </p>
                <p>
                 VA population: 8,185,867
                </p>
                <p>
                 US Population: 316,500,000
                </p>
                <p>
                 8185867/316500000 = 2.586%
                </p>
                <p>
                 But based on the numbers I got yesterday, adding up all missing children from all missing states = 3889
                </p>
                <p>
                 From VA alone there was a total of 398.
398/3889 = 10.23%
                </p>
                <p>
                 So about 4 times the percentage that would be proportional to the VA population. That seems odd but I'm trying to think about other possible explanations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another thing that is interesting, more kids are missing in 2016 from Virginia than from any other state.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Total Kids missing between 1/1/2016 – 12/1/2016 = 1563
                </p>
                <p>
                 CA Population of US = 12.142% 
2016 Missing Population = 154/1563 = 9.853%
Difference = -2.289%
                </p>
                <p>
                 TX Population = 8.376%
2016 Missing Population = 140/1563 = 8.957%
Difference = +.581%
                </p>
                <p>
                 FL Population = 6.193%
2016 Missing Population = 163/1563 = 10.429%
Difference = +4.236
                </p>
                <p>
                 NY Population = 6.224% 
2016 Missing Population = 62/1563 = 3.967%
Difference = -2.257
                </p>
                <p>
                 VA Population = 2.586% = 
2016 Missing Population = 285/1563 = 18.234%
Difference = +15.648
                </p>
                <p>
                 The other states are within 5% of their population percentages but Virginias is off by more than 3 times that. Of course, there's no reason that the number NEEDS to be proportional to the population but I don't have a plausible explanation for this discrepancy.

                  You are awesome.  Yea we were getting about 4x the average also.  Cool if I post this on twitter and Gab??  I'm gonna look into Cps and see what I can find out.  I'm in Virginia and am familiar with how this place works.  Even Nova and the beach are good old boy networks so we will see....I keep you posted.  Thanks again.

             I was just going to say that. I did the same search almost. The date thing kept saying I wasn't entering the date correctly so I picked random dates of Oct 2-Nov 28 and came up with 183 missing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now most are teens and I would assume quite a few runaways. But even that seems a bit crazy considering how many would be running away in the same area, unless they're getting lured into something maybe?

            That's something I've been wondering. If there are really so many victims, where are they now? Where are the parents, teachers, and friends that should have noticed they are gone? Even if they killed everyone who knew anything and completely erased their bodies, wouldn't there still be people talking about them?

             Actually stealing children would be possible but would be more of a hassle when there are simpler options. Remember, children = product to these guys.

              It just sounds weird to me for a lot of those reasons.  The logistics behind kidnapping and disposing of that many kids is mind-boggling. Not impossible, but it's hard to imagine a way to do it that would be practical.

             Hundreds of the kids listed as missing in Virgina, Don't even have a picture submitted... That factor is not normal, and can not be seen in any of the other states.  That's not an answer to your question, but just some relevant information.   They also claim to have   93-97% success rate, but can not give any information to back that up.

              The majority of the children posted by Virginia Missing Children's Clearinghouse don't have pictures.
It may be more of a problem with that source specifically.

               It is... But I don't think it's a technical glitch.  I bet they do not have pictures to post.  Or maybe it is just a technical glitch. All i know is If that was one of my kids, I'd be pissed if they weren't even showing a picture.  I guess we will have to see if they update it. I'm guessing they don't.

                I don't think the lack of a picture from that source is a glitch, I was saying in my other comment that the thing about only the first 36 having a picture is probably a technical glitch. Since most of the missing pictures are from the same source I meant that that source is probably particularly unreliable about putting up pictures. Not saying I wouldn't be a pissed parent too but I'm pointing out that it seems to be related to that source in particular.

                 Dude. The only "Glitch" is the state that has the alleged child kidnapping problem.  It wasn't 36 kids that didn't have a picture... It was 27 out of the first 36. I didn't look past 36.

                   No problem..I probably made it confusing. I typed that in  rush. But to clarify,  All the states I checked, had pictures for every kid, except for Virgina was missing 27 out of the first 36.  I'm sure the pattern continues further, but I only had time to check the first 36.

                    Ok fair enough. The only other thing that I was trying to say is if you are interested in seeing the pictures of all the kids in VA or whatever other state, you can view them all on one page (but not restricted by date).

             In 2015, there were over 400,000 kids reported missing to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They alone have helped identify over 12,000 individual victims in child pornography, I'm sure the FBI has many, many more on file. There's unfortunately a lot of people in the world, and they go missing often. The parents are out there probably still holding out hope a little like Elizabeth Smart's parents, just hoping another missing kid will walk in the door one day. They probably get treated like any other parent with a kid that vanishes, they probably have no idea.

             They get told by the cops that they are looking as hard as they can, that lots of kids disappear and finding them can be almost impossible. Then they get talked to by counselors and shrinks who convince them to try to move on and find some peace with it, and got put on zombie pills. Or the parents sold their kids. That happens too.

              Yup, that is exactly what happened to me. Told to move on. That was 21 years ago and I was starting LionsGate. Yes that LIonsGate with a lawyer from Vancouver named John Hardy(specialized in litigation and mining companies. My son was threatened to be hurt if he talked to me. I tried to find out what was going on but all police, Children's Aid and human rights organizations stopped me from ever getting a concrete answer. I was at the time a fairly successful actor. Believe me or not I don't care but I find it interesting that Frank is so thick in this. He claims to have started LionsGate. False. It was myself and Hardy  In March or April of 1996 I was told to 'forget about your kids or you're dead" by Hardy. What followed was just insane. I was tracked, followed , harassed, death threatened, even having safety box break ins. All paperwork on Lions Gate stolen as well as screenplays, treatments. I was poison to the industry after that. John  Hardy founded Versatile Systems in Vancouver and now is chief executive at Equus Total Return. As far as I can tell, he is not linked to LionsGate in any way now however I did get a print out of the formation of it from the registry's office in Victoria Canada. Word to the wise, I have never been a coward or easily frightened but these people are beyond your worst nightmares. I am still alive (thank God) but   they have lots of resources at their disposal as in alphabet spy agencies, mercenaries etc etc. Dark Agenda barely covers it. In closing I may add that I have seen my children as recently as a couple years ago(for 5 days). They are adults now. My ex wife turned out to be a call girl prostitute and was involved in a phony orphanage in Cambodia, most likely used for trafficking. She figured prominently in my situation. She has D.I.D. and ...well you figure it out. Ritual abuse programming is NOT a joke. I know I have rambled, I have a tendency to do this when spewing out details, very muddy waters
