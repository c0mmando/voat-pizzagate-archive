Liz Cronin expanded on this conspiracy theory to speculate &quot;The Storm&quot; included a crackdown on elite pedos as well.  Infowars once again proved that there are no limits to the shilling for President Trump, even if it means championing a conspiracy theory called &quot;The New Pizzagate.&quot;</p>

<p>The few days following the 01/12/18 Hawaii incident, a few interesting posts appeared on 4 chan.  Two particular posts were definitely eye-openers, resulting in a barrage of comments of belief, disbelief, and calling the OP a LARPer.  
</p>
<p>The first one appeared on 01/13/18 and reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Hickman AFB Fusion Analyst here.  The false alert was not a mistake.  It was ordered.  We were informed it was to be a drill, but then all information was put out that the threat was real.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Immediate contact was made to the White House and requests were made for retaliation.  I think there was a push to have the White House approve an attack on foreign vessels off the coast.  When the White House replied, \'Negative\' and demanded further information, my superiors called Governor David Ige where he ordered us to contact media outlets of there being a false alarm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of the government aides was present and speaking with who looked to be a federal investigator.  I overheard them state that this \'demonstrated weakness in the Administration and a refusal to protect his people.\'..&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/iXC4r">http://archive.is/iXC4r</a></p>
<p>Not knowing what  &quot;Fusion Analyst&quot; was  here is a general definition - An Air Force fusion analyst determines the value and implications of intelligence we receive from target network communications.  They gauge the impact of the information and distribute their findings to high-level decision makers so timely action can be taken to ensure the safety of airmen in our country.</p>

<p>The second 4chan post occurred on 01/15/18 which included an 01/13/18 report from &quot;Source RV/Intelligence Alert&quot; (I am unfamiliar with &quot;RV/Intelligence&quot; which may also be part of &quot;Operation Disclosure&quot;) and reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday, January 12, an anomaly was detected off the coast of Hawaii which held off the RV release.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Today, January 13, the cabal attempted to nuke the Hawaiian Islands and put the blame on North Korea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(Sources have confirmed today that the false alarm today was a cover story.  The attack was real.  The media had their \'North Korea attacks the Hawaiian Island\'s\' story preemptively ready.  The cabal panicked when the attack failed.  A cover story was shortly made up and the attack was branded as a false alarm.  The Emergency Management System does not lie.  Someone pressing the \'wrong button\' simply does not happen.  This was another cabal attempt to derail the transition process by fabricating a war).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Missile launches were detected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii.  The launches originated from the same anomaly detected yesterday, January 12.  The missiles were immediately intercepted and destroyed.  The anomaly was revealed to be a nuclear stealth submarine.  The Alliance believes the sub originated from another D.U.M.B. (Deep Underground Military Base) located somewhere in the Pacific.&quot;</p>

<p>In closing, there is certainly enough evidence whose surface has not even been scratched with this post, to confidently conclude that there was much more to the &quot;I Pushed the Wrong Button&quot; crap that has been fed to us by the MSM.</p>',

            Yeah. That ‘wrong button’ story seems to have been disproved. Wow. What challenging situation. That could have gone wrong in so many ways:
1. Hawaii bombed with no response
Or 2. Hawaii bombed with WWIII/IV started.
Or 3. Hawaii not bombed with clumsy stupid response and deaths
Or 4. Hawaii close call and POTUS blames for inaction followed by bloody deep state coup
Or 5. Cabal plan foiled, no bomb, no response, with clumsy obvious cover up exposing deep starters for a spanking.
5 is my favorite.

            I mentioned this elsewhere...maybe the "inbound alert" was used to create the chaos needed to extract high value targets from Hawaii?  Like the ATL airport and other cover operations.  Or so we believe.

The media had their 'North Korea attacks the Hawaiian Island's' story preemptively ready. The cabal panicked when the attack failed. A cover story was shortly made up and the attack was branded as a false alarm. The Emergency Management System does not lie. Someone pressing the 'wrong button' simply does not happen. This was another cabal attempt to derail the transition process by fabricating a war)."

            If it's true what Fusion Analyst said about it being a drill that went live in an attempt to force "retaliation" but the WH didn't fall for it, then it would seem Trump is fully aware of that tired tactic used so often by the shadow/deep state to force the action it wants.  Encouraging if legit.

             They said, however, that North Korea had not yet offered any proof that it had mastered all technical hurdles, including development of a re-entry vehicle needed to deliver a heavy nuclear warhead reliably atop an ICBM, but it was likely that it soon would.

             If I'm reading this right, Q just said the head floor of the CIA has been cleared or maybe DCI is completely neutralized.     FBI being silently purged (?).  no clue about SD

              SD is State Dept. The 7th floor is basically the "C Suite" i.e. mucky mucks. Same people who scrubbed the inveztigation of our ambassador who was screwing kids in Belgium, and gave Dyncorp a slap on the wrist.

              I doubt Trump would disable our nukes. CIA doesn't have access to them anyway.

              I don't know why not, as long as you frame it in terms of Pizzagate. Maybe describe it as a graphical reference library of the globabl elite? Or do a link post to the Pizzagate page they have listed? You never know when something like this is going to jog people's brains and help them make new connections.

             The concurrent "false alarm" in Japan is the best indicator that the idea that there was a REAL launch, shot down or stopped in some way, is the better explanation for our own "false" alarm.

             Thank you, and yes, I did.  Was contemplating adding it but reached the point that enough was enough.  Also interesting that the Clintons and Abedin were in HI on the 13th, the day after the "false alarm."

             The info about the nuclear stealth sub (if true) that was intercepted, I take that to mean it was destroyed.  Reading between the lines from the report it was one of ours with a 9-11-type assignment and if it had been successful, blame it on NK?

Mil Falcon couldn't mop up a teaspoon of trash bag juice in a 10 story building without contaminating the whole building.

              Q is a waste of time. While Q is filling the airwaves with lies and distracting the truth movement his "boss's administration" is busy dismantling Net Neutrality which ultimately result in internet providers throttling the internet and censoring "inappropriate" content. One of these days that might lead to everybody needing an iinternet I.D. for "national security" and the word "anon" will dry up like a rain drop in the sunshine.

              You people have turned this sub into a click bait tabloid and demoralized it's participants. Trump already said basically that HIllary has "had enough" and that he will not go after her. She is too well insulated and D.C. is protecting her. While you are busy dragging people into the theatre of amusement that is DC bullshit crensch is busy limiting the scope of investigation to such narrow parameters the dots could never get connected.

               Q anon should be regarded as any anonymous source. If it is boloney, it will pass. The exposed pedophilia of elites will not. Pizzagate has never had credibility. It’s been debunked, remember? Yet we are still here, getting bigger. Q anon could be proved a larp today, and I won’t even blink.
