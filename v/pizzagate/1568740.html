<p>The challenge now is to determine the ties between the Abedin Family and the Moonie Cult,  (Unification Church) via a property document/title search.    
</p>
<p>Here’s how we’ve discovered a circumstantial link… </p>
<p>A Google search of \'Unification Church, Washington DC\' (The Moonies original cult church) and Google Earth takes you to 2 addresses: - <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">https://www.google.com/earth/</a></p>
<ol>
<li>\'Family Federation for World\' at 3224 16th NW Washington.  
</li>
</ol>
<p>Zoom in however and you\'ll find, the building is signed, \'Creative Minds\' and searching its website it lists the alternate address, 3700 North Capitol St NW, Washington. (Corner location address).</p>

<p>Golnar ABEDIN happens to be connected to a UK based, \'UN\' ABEDIN, by the name of Minhaz ABEDIN.  <a href="https://twitter.com/minhazma_?lang=en">https://twitter.com/minhazma_?lang=en</a>  (link est. per Golnar Abedin\'s LinkedIn page).  He’s 18 years old and right in the thick of things at the UN. </p>
<p>Which begs the question/enquiry,,,,</p>
<p>Is Golnar Abedin related to Hillary Clinton\'s, Huma Abedin, who has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and was of course vice chair of Hillary Clinton\'s 2016 campaign for President of the United States and deputy chief of staff to her as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013? </p>
<p>The other address for the \'Unification Church\' in Washington DC takes us next door to the FREEMASONS (Scottish Rite of Freemasonry), and to </p>

<p>No longer the \'Unification Church\', (though Google still recognises it as such), it links to a webpage for the \'Family Federation for World Peace and Unification USA\'.

<p>One of Mrs Moon\'s front groups, (another with a long and interchangeable name(s), \'World FWP(I)\' is behind the \'New Hope\' and \'Hope\' Academies/Institutes (schools and orphanages) around the world (Haiti, Solomon Islands, PNG, Gambia etc) including the \'academy\' in Washington DC.  <a href="http://imgur.com/sfYPCeN">http://imgur.com/sfYPCeN</a>. <br />

<p>It\'s important to reiterate the fact that New Hope Academy (Moonie Cult) in Washington is linked to James Alefantis through the purchase/transfer of the property known as \'Pegasus Museum\', next to Trolley Park.  See previous Voat posts. </p>
<p>It would be super great if someone could run a property search and establish who owns the two \'Unification Church\' properties, as listed above with their multiple addresses (corner locations) and names.  Will it reveal a Saudi connection through the Abedin family, or maybe even an Alefantis connection?</p>

            The likely ONLY connection to the Unification Church &amp; Alefantis is the property transaction - sold to &amp; bought by Alefantis; I believe other than that there is zero connection and a lot of time will be spent chasing the matter of some sort of "connection." Without going into detail, I can assert with full confidence that that church (although called a "cult" - NOT "occult," they're actually more of a sect) would have nothing to do with the occult, homosexuality, and certainly not pedophilia. They're misguided and wrong in their theology, but by all accounts they are straight as an arrow and strict moralists. (But, all leads should be checked regardless; this is just a caution that researchers might guard against going down a rabbit hole and spending too much precious time and attention. Btw, I am fervently on the side of exposing Pizzagate!) God Bless!

            Agree completely. It seems as if their brilliance would have led them to much more profound answers. I always think to myself why is it that our governments of Russia and US are threatening nukes and building military might when we "share a space station" so let me get this straight, we are able to solve the many challenges of gravity and physics etc. "go to the moon." We even go to space allegedly in each other's rockets where "the next frontier" is supposed to be. We see the planet from outer space together then our leaders can not come up with better plans than "mutual destruction of all mankind" They also allegedly do not believe in God but they are desperately trying to prevent their own demise and as hard as they have been trying with the billions they get and advanced technologies they still top out max around 90 to 100 years old.. really?
Lucifer as described was known as the angel that had musical instruments I believe that is one of the things he turned into evil when thrown out of Heaven to earth. Corrupt God's beautiful music.

            Hey thanks for the reply. I have thought about it but am nervous as well as hoping people will begin to see this truth. This battle is spiritual ultimately I know this and you and many others do as well. It is very hard for people to see that all of these cults, false religions, secret societies, Intellectualism, false gods, etc. are in essence satanism or more pointedly Luceferian. I know people feel judged if they hear that so I am hesitant because it is not from judgement of which I or others speak. It is only because for of grace in my own life that I understood that Anything other than the simple but amazing concept of Jesus sacrifice for me and us all could we reach directly to God be forgiven. That was the blood sacrifice, the last, all others and religions since are a form of satanism. Meaning the attempt by Lucifer to deceive, lie, control, and ultimately worship him as the Christ. Many will be fooled I am trying to help wake them up please help.

            No it's not about liberals or demoscrats or republicans or libertarians.  It's about the infiltration of satanism everywhere.  It's people wanting to do their will, at all costs, no matter what happens to others.

            Totally agree.  It's difficult sometimes with the alt left or alt right to not call th other names because it is just so frustrating to see people engaging in the evil and not knowing it.

            You are exactly right. This is the battle that first began when Lucifer was thrown out of Heaven. he knows the truth and has been trying since then to get all to worship him. Father of lies. He will use anything to do get there. The most glaring reprehensible is the Vatican system born of the Roman Empire who were the executioners of Jesus then used his redemption to twist their own lies into another religious law system, the very essence of what Jesus spoke against. 
This has continued into all forms of false teaching, religion, Cults, spiritual awakenings, mysticism, AI, cloning, etc. It is the same Lucifer (Satan) using lies and deception to convince/blind people from the truth and freedom. There is but one God he gave His one and only son Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for all who ask and believe in Him that they would be forgiven and have eternal life. The final blood sacrifice! He said as He died, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do. " and "It is finished."
John 3:16
I don't say these things knowing some might be uncomfortable. But it is truth and the only way through this evil.

            I've been reading this about the rise of the Unification Church and Rev Moon's Gnostic sex-cult.  It's very good, but long.  It starts with HG Wells and Bertrand Russell, two of the worst people of the 20th century, and how their philosophies shaped the world today.  Then it goes into the shaping of a world religion and the various attempts by the intelligence services to achieve this:

             Curious why Bertrand Russell is considered the worst. Wasn't the guy a brilliant mathematician philosopher and one of the first proponents of nuclear disarmament? Also Wells? Huxley was far worse, isnt it?

              By some, Russell is considered the worst person of the last century.  He created a philosophy that was pushed by the Royal Institute in London that promoted materialism and eradicated the spiritual.  He is responsible (or more responsible than anyone else) for creating a throw-away society that has lost all touch with it's humanity.  Godot saw it and lost his mind.  Some that knew him say he thought Russell was the devil.

            I have been both contributing and following your posts especially regarding the recent connections between the moonies cult and ties directly to both the Bush's, Clinton's, CIA, Catholic Charities, now the Abedin's(Muslim Brotherhood &amp; Saudi Arabia), Thelmaic (Podesta's favorite), secret societies,Vatican.
I understand the need for people to want to simply this by saying what about pizzagate. 
I hope everyone can begin to understand what is going on all groups involved just transfer their names titles even false religious doctrine to build in the same thing we see over and over satanism. This is expressed at its worst by pedophelia, beastiality and all other horrifying things we have been seeing. The worst is blood sacrifice. That is the apex of satanic worship to sacrifice a child for this. Now we can see how over and over the groups who are most involved are children's charities or charities themselves. The epitome of lies and deceit. 
Even if you do not believe in Satanism they do they have their own leaders and write about this openly to mock those of us who do not want to see. "Hiding in plain sight" "Do what thou whilst" by A. Crowley (self-identified as the beast, 666) Connected to B. Pierce/Bush and know popularized as seen on Obama's t-shirt.
            <br/>
            It is known that these people not only are found in the deep web horror shows, but the heights of power. They are desperately trying to prevent their demise by finding the fountain of youth and a super race. Their endless quest to stay young, look young, stay alive drives them at all costs. The use of young blood, organ transplants, (Rockefeller is top of heart transplant list at 101 years. How is that possible with protocols?) 
If it were really possible to prevent death don't you think they would have figured this out by now? If they who know the top secrets in the world actually believed in their own religious doctrine why would they be so paranoid about their physical demise? If some of these new age reincarnation, or mystics believe they see into the future past, there is no hell, no standing before God why are they so desperate to prevent it?
We can track down all these leads all day and need to but if you are unwilling to see the deep darkness that are at the root we cannot overcome. 
This is satanism it is evil, opposite of who God really is. We are not in judgement once we turn back to the simple truth that there was one blood sacrifice, the only one ever needed, no one is deserving or perfect nor can be but can be forgiven. I am not a preacher I have not even known about this for all that long. We have to understand this, all of these people mock him his Name is JESUS. He was the sacrifice just ask him to show you.

            Don't know if you know about it but it might be worth checking out the Whitehouse visiter logs for anyone you come across in your Abedin reseach.
            <a href="http://white-house-logs.insidegov.com/">
             http://white-house-logs.insidegov.com/
            </a>
            . The logs show all federal buildings relating to the Whitehouse in DC and who the person visited, how many in the party and how long. It's sure thrown up a few intersting things for me in the Soros/Epstien/Clinton connections.

            I am glad to see that the Parents are taking notice and have registered their complaints.  It proves that people are becoming more informed and taking action.  Let's keep our eyes and ears open and then make our fears known until we make a difference.

            Yes, very brave and has a very high IQ. I think it is one of the reasons Dr. Mark kept her alive and then wanted her to become the Grande Madame. She was also a very beautiful and vivacious young woman.

            Please take 3 minutes to watch a small portion of this Fiona Barnett 'Candy girl' video starting at 41:33 up to 44:13. If you pause the video at 43:32, you can clearly see a very similar post on the front entrance of the Church which reads "To the people of the United States of America in honour of Australian-American friendship in war and peace."

            Fiona is the victim of SRA and MK Ultra programming, part of an Australian pedophile ring which has associations to the US military and Satanist elites. In this 'Candy girl'  video, she describes her ordeal in very gruesome details. There is also this document

            which includes her abuse drawings.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like the US Satanists have been funding and building Satanist Churches all over the world.
