I started my own sub a couple of weeks ago so that myself and others can post about Q without being accused of being larpers and shills. But, many people continue to be uninformed and attack Q followers here. So I want to say a few things even tho it will probably be deleted. </p>
<p>IF Q turns out to be a LARP, what Q has accomplished has been positive! Q gave tips and asked questions. That made WE THE PEOPLE work to find the answers. Q has helped bring millions of people together to wake up and research. Even people from other countries! People are working together to figure out the answers. People are coming together in a coordinated effort to spread the word thru memes and Infographs with planned times and hashtags so we can have the most effect. It’s lit a fire under people’s butts and gave people hope again. People are more patriotic than I’ve seen in years. </p>
<p>Most of the people that say Q is a LARP havent followed along this whole time and watched this unfold in front of your eyes. Some people are set in their ways and won’t budge and open their mind to the idea that this could be real, because we are used to being lied to and getting our hopes up. But if we want change, sometimes we have to take chances. Step outside the box. Following the crowd and attacking Q followers when you haven’t looked far enough into all of this is just going to keep you in the same place and merely a spectator, instead of joining a movement that is finally standing up and working together and saying enough is enough! We want change! If you want change, you have to work for it. Just like us pizzagaters have always had people attack us and say pizzagate isn’t real, that’s what’s what many of us Q followers are dealing with. But just like pizzagate, we have evidence to back up what we say.</p>
<p>What many of you don’t realize, is that Q believes in pedogate. Q has helped wake so many more people to the deep state, the banker families, the Illuminati, the New World Order, the corruption and the sick disgusting things these people do. Pizzagate memes and Infographs are spread a in a much more organized and coordinated effort and mixed with hashtags that many people follow. When we see our trending hashtag become shadowbanned and suddenly disappear from trending, we hijack other trending hashtags. Like, the other day was Betty White’s birthday. We highjacked her hashtag! Betty White followers got redpilled that day. That’s for sure! LOL. We highjacked NationalPopcornDay that was trending. We all work together to reach the most people and have the greatest affect. </p>
<p>We all know that the news lies to us. How do we reach the normies? Social Media! Instead of going on social media and trying to spread the word about only pizzagate, what we Q followers do is expand beyond pizzagate and open people’s eyes to the evil satanic elite. Pizzagate looks much more like a conspiracy to normies if they don’t learn all of the other things these sick people do. There are new boards, forums and subs that are filled with collected evidence to back up all the corruption that is happening. We share memes and Infographs that show evidence and there are organized archives ready for people to dig into to learn more. </p>
<p>That’s one thing I don’t like about this sub. Limiting posts strictly to pizzagate doesn’t open people’s minds to the people who are performing these sick acts enough. Many times I don’t even post here anymore because we are limited in what we can post or they are removed. Sometimes to get a point across, you have to cross lines and expand beyond just pizzagate. When people open their eyes to how deep the rabbit hole really goes, then “pizzagate” becomes much more believable to the normies. So to me, Q is like pizzagate on steroids. </p>
<p>This has become an amazing movement. Many of you don’t trust Trump. I do. You can accuse him of many things but he is without a doubt making huge changes. It amazes me when I see some of you act like nothing is happening. When there is deep state coup against our president and he is met with resistance right and left, of course things can’t get done fast enough. But behind the scenes, A LOT is happening. It’s hard to get that across to people who aren’t following along and seeing this happening in real time. </p>
<p>Q is an unconventional way for Trump to reach we the people, with plausible deniability. Trump is much more aware of corruption than he lets on publicly because he has to stay in role and play his cards right. Through Q, we know that Trump is aware of 9/11, pizzagate, the Vegas shooting, and much much more. We have been warned of things that were going to happen. Q has been correct time and time again before we ever find out anything on the news. </p>
<p>I know shills are going to attack this post. But for those of you who are truly here because you care and want change, then I would encourage you to open your mind and look into it before you knock it. Even IF Q turned out to be a LARP. The research and evidence that we’ve learned and share are REAL. One more thing to consider is, if Q wasn’t real, why is it being attacked so bad? If Trump was one of them, why is the majority of the media and the deep state so against him? That alone speaks volumes. </p>

            Thank you for this post. I'm not 100% convinced that Q is real, mostly because I don't want to get my hopes up. One thing is certain, Q is more entertaining than anything on TV!
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd just like to point out one fact where you are blatantly wrong:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             there is deep state coup against our president
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's not called a "deep state" it's called a "secret society"!!! /s

            None of the so-called 'proofs' of Q prove anything other than high level intel Q is privy too. Hence certain 'predictions' coming true. 
But answer me this.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Q is a psy-op, which I believe it is and was from the start, then what assurance do we have the reason they know about these events in advance isn't actually because they're being made privy to the plans? How do you know these events are not being staged in direct correlation with Q's postings
            <em>
             as part of the psy-op
            </em>
            ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Simple answer is: you don't. Nobody does -- except those behind Q's keyboard.

            The claim that Q is a LARP is akin to those who claim Pizzagate is faked and debunked w/o actually looking into it. Your analogy is good. I have followed QAnon, and there are many more confirmations than the ones you list. The DOITQ twitter pic was a great example.

            Great post..I think the swamp is really being drained, but not in a way most people would recognize...unprecedented in ancient and modern history, as far as I know. Appreciate this happening under President Trump.....am liberal too.

            I don't doubt Q is connected to Trump in someway
           </p>
           <p>
            I've always felt it was Stephen Miller and one or two other LARPing propagandists and working together
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole thing is so over the top quoting bible verses, calling Trump a savior, etc. This is the way Hitler worked and to me it's all a bit unsettling.

            I am really unsure about Q, but I will keep an open mind on this, just as I will on Trump. One thing I am sure about though, Heavy Breathing is back in comet ping pong on the 3rd of February. The first time back since all this kicked off?

              No been following Q, its a total larp, if you actually did your own research instead of listening to a possible AI or disinfo shill, then you would know too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trumps surrounded by Israel and Goldman sacchs. So if Q is an actual person, and not an AI, odds are its one of those slimy creatures.

            Great post! I just sent an email to my closest normie Trump-supporting friends explaining about the Q phenomenon and urging them to start following Dr. Corsi's decodings of Q so they could have an idea of what is really going on behind the scenes, but only one person replied and said she would read it all later. Didn't have time to look at it, but at least she was nice. I imagine the next time I see the others they'll be running away from me as far and as fast as they can. : ) Must think I finally went over the edge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because my family and I have learned so much and have such a more hopeful, energetic outlook because of "Q", I thought I should share that with my friends. I left them with this thought: if Q accurately outlined the contents of the FISA memo on 12/22, then that is all the verification needed of the authenticity of Q. I know there are many more corroborations, but that would be especially YUGE.

             I know what you mean! Nobody in my real life is interested in this stuff. That’s why I love talking to my online friends here. 🙂 Not the jerks. But the ones that are awake to the real world.

            Q yesterday posted a fake Podesta E-mail... It was a spoof e-mail, proven to be a hoax months ago... It was an intelligently worded e-mail that is ultimately made to troll pizzagate researchers.... Q's credibility has been shot until this is explained.

            With any big bust, it takes years of investigating
           </p>
           <p>
            We are looking at the biggest web of corruption we have ever seen
           </p>
           <p>
            As much as I would like to see arrests yesterday, I want to make sure the case is solid, very solid
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you need a judicial system that is not part of the  corrupted web
           </p>
           <p>
            This takes time, and when your dealing with public figures, you have to be careful and secret
           </p>
           <p>
            Already things are being lost, MSM has upped their game, the bullshit is flying and we know why
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone here should know there's more than Pizzagate going on with these public people
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the IRS that finally put Capone in jail
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever it takes to get these people behind bars, stripped of the bullshit facade they have presented, stripped of the money they have made, to never be able to get their hands on children again
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm all for it
           </p>
           <p>
            We were given a choice...Trunp or Clinton
           </p>
           <p>
            I voted Trump, and will stand by my vote
           </p>
           <p>
            Q is giving us behind the scene info, letting us know whats going on through cryptic sentences
           </p>
           <p>
            Q tells me Keep the faith, we are working on it
           </p>
           <p>
            It's why I voted for Trump in the first place
           </p>
           <p>
            How does one take all these people down without taking the country down with it?
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to have faith and take a stand somewhere, isn't that why we are here?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Q any more believable then Pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            How many years do we go back with Pizzagate to get the big picture?
           </p>
           <p>
            How long as Q been posting?
           </p>

            1: "LOCK: 15-10-5" in no way "confirms [15] marker" and is a stretch. Seeing what you want to see.
           </p>
           <p>
            2: "Predicted" the bombing in hindsight after the fact. Could have easily said "bomb attack incoming" or something without giving away any details. POTUS nowhere near a NYC bus terminal. What about the direct claims here against Schiff taking 7.8mm for leaks, isn't that something to stand behind and tout as evidence? Why can't he make direct claims like that for his supposed predictions listed here?
           </p>
           <p>
            3: "Fox Three" is terminology for air-to-air munitions fired from fighter jets/etc. It's a major stretch to go back and claim this is about an ICBM. Could have mentioned 1000 more specific details or even the part of the world this might take place in, instead you're claiming jet fighter radio terms are codewords for nuclear missile false flag attempts. Streeeeetch.
           </p>
           <p>
            4: Not enough information to go off of, these photos could be from any time or date over the last couple decades, really. Interesting but he could also just hold up a fucking AF1 napkin or something too, you know?
           </p>
           <p>
            5: Give me a fucking break. Quotes one of the world's most recited prayers and nearly a month later the leader of that religion also mentions that prayer - WOW what are the odds!
           </p>
           <p>
            6: Did
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Jack">
             @Jack
            </a>
            go somewhere, did he disappear or leave Twitter or anything as indicated by "Goodbye"? Being in the news does not equate to "Goodbye
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Jack">
             @Jack
            </a>
            " even if it's bad news. I'll admit this is recent so maybe still developing, but again an extremely tenuous connection that is unconvincing at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            7: So he mentions a term in widespread usage through our military and apparently this means he predicted a tweet about a fucking TV show that was probably in the TV guide for a month anyway? Just absurd, and ultimately meaningless. If this is what Q is revealing then fuck him, I can buy a TV guide myself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, what does this have to do with PG, why is it in here every day? I'm sure there's dedicated Q and CBTS subs, boards, etc. Is it because it's designed to soak up all the PG interest and ultimately discredit it all together as one big larp just like this disinfo is designed to do?

              The network which controls this false narrative which in turns keeps the black pop under control is being dismantled. False local and national black leaders will be exposed next as shills for the D party. Follow the money. Maxine W has a $4mm home and cash assets in excess of $6mm. How is that possible? One example.

             So I can see how both the Southern Poverty "Law" Center would get the idea Q has confirmed the "Pizzagate conspiracy". I'm sure they're spending a fortune on lawyers trying to figure out how to protect their assets now, too. ;-)

             The hilarious part is if the Q LARP was real, it's basically a coup.  They claim to be fighting a Deep State coup, but all their actions the Q fans applaud are illegal and deeply UnAmerican.  If these were orders actually giving to US Soliders they would be duty bound to refuse them.

              You make some interesting points. Though I'm not convinced either that Trump is a tyrant destroying the rule of law or connected in any way to Russia. I watched the Russia narrative develop out of leaked emails and I watched the collusion that took place between the scrambling campaign that created it and the kike media that pushed it.

              were real insights and real leaks, not like this empty Q stuff. We'll see where things go- but I try to remain optimistic.

            Did Q post the current Lord's prayer or the new version? It looks like he posted the old one but it doesn't actually look like it changed. It looked like they were going to change it from 'lead us not into temptation' to 'fall into temptation'. If this was going to confirm future with past, shouldn't Q have posted the new version in order to prove something?

             Q said when the board was being compromised. He didn’t repost all the previous things he said. He informed us and made a new board but he didn’t repost everything. A lot of what he had already posted had came to pass and was already proved.

              The screenshot you provided is the original posting though....
             </p>
             <p>
              It's weird that Q says, what lords prayer version did i post? (the old one). 
Why is this relevant? (The luciferian pope doesn't like the current version that Q posted)
             </p>
             <p>
              So how does this prove anything? It looks like he said the standard prayer that everyone knows, the pope says I'd like to change that, now everyone is saying this proves something? It seems like everyone simply assumed that Q posted the new version that only the pope would know, but he didn't. I said the standard lords prayer that day, does that mean I'm in league with the pope too and I knew it was going to change soon?

                If he posted the normal prayer and then the next day it changed, that might be something.

               <p>
                But he did the normal prayer, not the new prayer, and then weeks later it changes. That seems way more coincidence than proof... Looks like AI doing pattern recognition and it was able to spot a pattern.

            Well done

            !
           </p>
           <p>
            I couldn't agree more... those who immediately denounce Q are very similar to those who immediately denounced George W. (not Bush - he deserves to be denounced).
           </p>
           <p>
            Following it closely, it is obvious to me that Q is legit. Could some posts/channels get compromised? Sure. Were some rumors of direct/external communications bubbling up? Yes. Did Q address these issues by shifting channels and shooting down those false claims? Yes. He/She/They did.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people saying "Ohhhh, but, but, Q said there'd be an attack and there wasn't! He told us to be prepared, and for what?! He's a LARP!" obviously have no clue how complex and significant this all is in its scope. Many people still do not grasp the sheer magnitude of what's going on behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Similar to your point re: Why Q and Q's followers are being attacked so viciously? It's obviously 1 part shill and 1 part ignorance/disbelief. To those who doubt Q, I ask you, why? What is the purpose of this all being faked? Some elaborate practical joke from someone who has access to photos on AF1/Camp David - from someone who has the ability to predict the contents of Tweets before they get posted from the POTUS/Military? - from someone who was directly referenced by Assange on multiple occasions and even made an "appearance" in two chapters of the PDF from Wolff's leaked book.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is too much intel/predictive hints to chalk this up to a LARP. And there is too much at stake to consider this to be an elaborate hoax. And I honestly don't see the point of either. It's not some "GOTCHA!" prank being perpetrated by TPTB. That wouldn't make any sense, as they would be shedding way too much light on a number of subjects/investigations that portray them in a very negative light.
           </p>
           <p>
            To those who claim Q is a larp or fake, I confidently claim that you are either a shill being paid to do so or* you are simply in denial because the full scope of this massive, decades long, multi-headed conspiracy is really fucking hard to cope with.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless of course you've been researching it for decades and have been waiting a long time for this day to come.

            any shitbag can surmise the overall spiral of fear created by the assholes, enough so that predicating which cities have false flags isn't that fucking hard. all of this is predictable to those that have been involved since trump's bid to run.

            Amazing good sir.  I have been using your posts as a primary reply and red pill for people.  This post will be the same way.  The big picture is tough for people.  You have to find a hook.  When they get hooked on one topic then we go to another and another.  It takes time.

            Q is joined at the hip w/ the president. There is no doubt about that. He's predicted what the pres will tweet a dozen times at least.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even just recently, yesterday, Q mentioned 'deep state' wanting illegals to "flood" into the country. Trump afterwards tweets that the dems want illegals "pouring" into the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q posted a pic of Iwo Jima monument (and talked about planting the US flag in NKorea) and then Trump used the word "monumental" in a tweet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q was asked by anons to have the pres use the phrase "wonderful day" in a tweet. On Thanksgiving Trump tweeted the words "wonderful" and "day" separated by only a few words.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q began to call Hillary a "puppet" and said her strings had been now cut. Approx a week later Trump tweeted, not once, but twice, mockingly, "Clinton Puppets." He capitalized the first words, C and P.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q had been saying for approx a week or ten days, "We have a very special place for George Soros, very special." (He used the initials GS.) Immediately after that, Trump returns from Camp David and tweets "Just back from Camp David, a very special place." Trump was wearing a purple tie during a talk at the same time, Vets I believe. (Purple Revolution.)
           </p>
           <p>
            POTUS uses the wrong word in a tweet. "Consensual." I thought how silly and stupid, he will be slammed by opponents. Then I saw that Q had just mentioned this, and Q said to watch the pres twitter feed. I clicked on the twitter feed and Trump had removed the tweet. "Not available." I clicked again and up popped the corrected tweet, now w/ the correct word "Consequential." There's a big fat Q in the middle of the word. Also, just before this, when Q said to watch the twitter feed, Q also misspelled the word "when" as "win." Q said to look for something. When POTUS corrected the misplaced word "consensual" (he also just so happened to be finishing the second part of the tweet), the pres finished quoting someone named "Goodwin." Thus the wrongly spelled "win" by Q was solved. (This all went down quickly and I apologize if it sounds confusing.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on and on. The pres making a huge circle w/ a slash thru the bottom like a Q as he stepped off the plane. Very out of character, this was quite exaggerated. Pres calling the 'establishment' sick and evil, just like Q does almost every post. The incredible pic on AF1 w/ the small group, including POTUS, w/ their thumbs up, if you connect them it stunningly makes a perfect Q. (Took me a while to accept that one.)
           </p>
           <p>
            What else? Assange posting the music video about passports and flying across borders the same night the navy "inadvertently" tweets out "Julian Assange." Wikileaks releasing the full PDF of the Wolff book then deleting it. The PDF had two chapter headlines w/ Q's instead of O's.

            Much more but I gotta stop. Took me a long time to accept this stuff. That's my two cents. Sorry if any typos.

             Yes! Or like Q doing the missing i and then Trump also avoided the letter i right after by putting FRLENDS instead of FRIENDS.

              Forgot about that one. That's what I'm saying, it's just overwhelming. The thing is, it's Scavino (and possibly others) who are doing Trump's tweets now. The grammar is always perfect, unlike some twitter mistakes by Trump in the past.
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact, some (tweets) have been so complicated in their punctuation challenges (and meticulously perfected) that it seems they were done on purpose just to show off (or give a heads up that from now on there would be no accidents or screw-ups in the tweets).
             </p>
             <p>
              So now, if you see a mistake, you know it's on purpose, there is meaning behind it. (That's why I was shocked when I saw Trump use the word "consensual," then I snapped, oh, something's going on.)
             </p>
             <p>
              That one you mention was hilarious cause I knew Trump was up to something when I saw "FRLENDS." Lol. And I believe they were talking about Iridium if I remember correctly. There were other missing "I's" like in missile I think. Hard to keep up unless you write it all down, some actually do just that. Not me, that heavy lifting is for others lol.

            The problem with Q is, we cant be sure he is not a larp. All tweet predictions he made have no proof other than screenshots but people are skeptic about them because the timestamp can be tampered with. You guys should archive all Q's posts as soon as he makes em so they are comparable to the predictions he makes. I dont know what to think of Q. It smells like a LARP but he mentioned PG, Scalisa and some topics the elites dont want to be talked about. I avoid talking about Q because i think there is a possibility of him being a larp but nobody can say he is 100% a glow in the dark cia nigger because of previously mentioned topics he sheds light to. It is more probable that he is not a larp, that is my opinion.

            , and I don't think you're a shill. Q gives a lot of people hope that change is coming and on the surface that seems like it could only be good, right?  I sincerely hope that high level arrests are on the way, and that the whole swamp will be drained for good. However, I am still skeptical. The swamp won't go down without a fight and I don't think they're as stupid as Q let's on. I fear Q is a psyop to give us hope and keep us from leaving our keyboards. To keep us from rallying or fighting back in more material ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been shown rather conclusively that Q has insider information about future false flags and future Trump tweets. That doesn't prove Q is not working for the enemy. It's possible that Trump is one of them, even though we all hope he is keeping his promise to drain the swamp. I hope you're right about Q and my skepticism is overly cautious. I really do.

             this is pretty much how i feel about Q &amp; trump. also, if you follow other things that trump is doing, he really is doing some seriously bad shit. we need to pay attention to that too. he just opened up Utah's NATIONAL MONUMENTS to oil &amp; gas drilling &amp; mining. this is a serious fuck up. i will remain skeptical of Q &amp; trump. i do retain some optimism, but that's my nature, but i think it's a mistake to jump on the band wagon just yet.

             On the other hand, any sincere person worried about child trafficking has to wonder if NO ONE with any power cares... So when figures emerge that clearly so care, that name Epstein, that make arrests... Well "overly cautious skepticism"

              Your skepticism of my skepticism sounds fair to me.  Let me first clarify that by "fighting back in more material ways," I didn't mean to condone violence.  The "fighting" I had in mind was petitioning, peacefully protesting, and educating the masses on the crimes that the ruling class are committing in broad daylight to the most vulnerable of people.  The reason I am skeptical is because I don't trust Trump.  Presidents have made promises for a long time and as they come and go the situation doesn't seem to be getting any better.  Trump has certainly broken the mold in a lot of ways, but his term isn't even halfway over.  I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch.

              The reason this is a natural response for me is because my entire worldview was turned on its head.  I grew up in America, and I was lied to, indoctrinated, and manipulated subconsciously in ways that I'm still struggling to understand.  Like many others, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to tell what is real.  The longer Trump has been in office the more he has gained my trust.  When he was sworn in I saw him as an elite exactly like Hillary, but I've since seen him stick his neck out for ordinary Americans.  I really do want him to be a good guy.  I try to keep up with Q because it is exciting to watch.  It feels like history is being made before my very eyes.  I want so badly for all of the criminals and monsters in government to be swept into cells in one fell swoop.  I just hope I'm not being played again.

             <p>
              This is painfully obvious.  A war was waged with Trump from day one (of his candidacy, well before he became POTUS).  If the enemy weren't so adept in controlled opposition, this would be tremendous evidence for Trump's benevolence.  They have used "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" to subvert and destroy one opponent after the other.  A war has been waged, but I really hope this war isn't another banker's war.  I hope this is a war with the bankers.

              I hope my disjointed rant helps you understand the source of my skepticism which you dub "overly cautious".  I'm not being cautious because I want to flame Q or Trump, but because I'm afraid of being burned.  I'm afraid of getting my hopes up and having them crushed again.  That may seem link a poor reason for skepticism, but I don't think that keeping my mind open to any possibility is a bad thing.  The hyperbolic and messianic aspects of both Trump and Q are legitimately concerning to me.  Any idea that is above skepticism is dogmatic and dangerous, no matter how righteous it may seem.  Finally, if you remain unconvinced of my skepticism, perhaps you might listen to this video that talks about some of the potential problems with Q more intelligently than I can.

               I apologize, I was being presumptuous. I am a quite a bit quick on the trigger due to the intense shilling environment. I do realize a lot of people can have trouble knowing if they should trust Trump.

                  The halfhearted style of the video screams
                  <em>
                   Shill
                  </em>
                  . Some points from the video:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sounds "prefab." Q explains at the beginning that MI generals and admirals thought through the corruption in the US and and the world, then  asked Trump to run, so yes, it
                  <em>
                   is
                  </em>
                  prefab.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Title of vid: Reference to the Wizard of Oz, a child's movie, tries to make Q seem childish from the getgo.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Reference to Q's Language, saying it sounds like the language of a person not accomplished in English or an AI?. Absolute nonsense. Q explains clearly that for legal reasons his messages are questions. To me, the language and Socratic style are in fact eloquent, unique, or even poetic. I am not religious but a quarter or more of the US population
                  <em>
                   is
                  </em>
                  and the Biblical references Q uses are some of the best in a work of fiction that has a wealth of good advice among the hallucinatory bits. Q made "grammar mistakes"? Oh my. A busy person or group makes a grammar mistake that are in some cases messages in themselves. Mr cowboy hat made some grammar errors as well, but I assume he is a native speaker.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Q talks big, but nothing is happening? Utter nonsense. Let's see, a coup in SA related to a psyop in Vegas. Already, dozens of politicians on both sides of the aisle have decided not to run in the next election for fear of being busted. Hillary and McCain are NOT wearing boots? Indictments have NOT been made? Pelosi and McCain have not prepared for indictment by appearing disoriented when they face military tribunals, soon? Come on, you can do better than that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Use of the words "Russia" and "dossier". Sounds just like Dem talking points. Sounds "corporate: Trump isn't a politician; he IS corporate.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Q sounds ''messianic": You think the messages sound messianic? That is part of the reason Trump was chosen to run. He and the group around him, are trying to save the US, and the world from "corrupt operators," so Q might sound a tad "messianic".
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Constant reference to Benjamin Fulford, who is completely unknown to most readers. Fulford is brilliant at times, and ridiculous at others. Why harp on Fulford, who comes across as a brilliant buffoon at times and a CIA disinformation operative at others.

                  Your little video is entirely unconvincing and sounds like a CIA production.

                     Yes, I do. There is a proliferation of YouTube pundits riding the Q wave. I don't watch them much. Try to stick to the original source and decide for myself.

                     Sure. It's possible that video is a CIA concoction. Perhaps I'm a fool for doubting Q at all and not giving him my unwaivering support. I agree the grammar mistakes don't seem like a legitimate criticism to me. I didn't catch the words "Russian" and "dossier" but that is a shilling red flag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Q is very active in posting lots of cryptic messages. Consequently, it has taken a lot of people a lot of studying of his work to make sense of it. If he is a psyop, it makes sense to distract researchers from certain targets and occupy as much of their time as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I hope that dude is a shill. That would provide additional evidence that Q is real. Thanks for your input

            Most of the "people" that say Q is a LARP are bots and shills. It's important to understand this to avoid wasting energy and being sucked into pointless disputes and confusions. It is hard.

              Bit I'm not "simply accusing skeptics"-- I am stating what I believe to be the case in general based on a number of factors. Why did you assume I wasn't?  If you have an opinion about bots on the internet, then feel free to share.

               I'm talking about all the other people in this thread who are crying shill without even apparently knowing what the word means. It's pathetic and it's the only real defense of Q that I've encountered here, people just taking offense that Q could be questioned, aside from this OP and his list of items (which I responded to separately).

             Agree, and the Q psyop people just screwed up and posted a known fake Email on his 8-chan account before deleting it. Plus the Shills are so obviously all over this one. Lots of new members pushing it like their pay cheque depended on it. To establish a disinfo agent they always throw a few pieces of new real info in the mix.

               I've was looking for that Collective Soul email in wikileaks a year ago. The screenshot was my first clue that mainstream bands are all satanic. So the email is not real?

             You have to look at this through a realistic lens though... think about the scope of what is being claimed. It's decades of corruption, thousands implicated, huge amounts of money/black market activity, collusion at the highest levels of the government... and people expect this to be a "case closed" situation like we're investigating someone for insider trading on the NASDAQ.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those of you who think this is "all talk, no action"... look at the Trump/Russia investigation. This has been going on for almost as long as we've had access to the leaked email accounts. And look how long this is taking. Mind you, the Russian investigation has been publicly presented to us as a dead-to-rights guaranteed case of guilt since day 1. It's almost never been reported as a possible case of collusion, but rather, collusion that occurred and simply hasn't been proven yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, on one hand you've got an investigation into Russia that's resulted in next to nothing (other than multiple cases of collusion that implicate the left/prior admin) and that's okay! And on the other hand, you've got a grassroots/nearly invisible behind the scenes effort to shut down an unimaginably large and powerful corrupt shadow government that still holds incredible levels of influence - and that is supposed to magically be completely "case closed" immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please think about this rationally with respect to how large the scope is vs. other cases that have drug on for far longer, with infinitely smaller scopes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last thing we want is for there to be 200-300 arrests just to move quickly, and then sacrifice the full scope of the investigation by showing cards too quickly.

              This corruption has been going on for over a hundred years now. I don't expect it wiped out in a day but I expect visible progress if the swamp draining is actually real. And if it is, Trump really only has three bankable years left to do it. Right now it's just supposed insiders stringing us along with puzzles, which is what every president does. "we're getting it done, be patient" but it never happens. just lots and lots of political theater in the public eye. I don't believe Trump is going to do anything anymore. I gave him a year and we're in the same spot except for some arrests and a couple crises said to be averted. I would love to be proven wrong, but I doubt it.

              Donald Trump's National Security Advisor has pleaded guilty to a felony and is a cooperating witness for the Special Counsel.   He lasted less than 2 months.  That's a pretty tremendous scandal.  The terms of his deal means the other crimes he committed are being kept quiet for now.  You only have seen what the special prosecutor has chosen to make public.  So far we have 2 guilty pleas, 2 cooperating witnesses and 2 people indicted on 12 counts each.

              The Watergate burglars were arrested on June 17, 1972.  Nixon was reelected a few months later. and didn't leave office until August 1974.

                Indeed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Axios is reporting tonight that Trump and Session put pressure on FBI Director Wray to fire McCabe.  Wray said he would resign if McCabe were removed.
               </p>
               <p>
                My take on the Q LARP is that it is very much part of this Team Trump attack on the rule of Law.   So it may end up being that Q is close to Trump, but it would still be a LARP because it's all fake.   The point of the LARP is provide support for a desperate measure from Trump a la the Saturday Night Massacre.  This is a replay of some of the fake news they pushed during the campaign.

                 So the FISA warrant memo is being over-hyped? Seems like a lot of effort and attention is being drummed up around it. If this is a coordinated LARP, it's beginning to hint back to the PG leaks... it's crossing over directly with research that others have done... the entire picture is coming into view.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yet, I'm still seeing very little clarity on this "shadow" Russia looming over Trump.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For me to believe that all of
                 <strong>
                  THIS
                 </strong>
                 is a LARP, fake and coordinated is getting increasingly difficult to fathom.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And yet you tell me that there are no unanswered questions re: 9/11... nothing more to see re: Seth Rich... nothing re: the multiple leaked emails... nothing re: Clinton's email server.... nothing re: the Awan's.... nothing re: DNC/HFA... nothing re: Uranium One... nothing re: Podesta... nothing re: Abedin... no involvement w/ the Saudi's... etc.
                </p>

                 Oh, and, McCabe is clean as a whistle, Comey was fired unfairly, and Trump is attacking the rule of law/obstructing justice? What? How?
                 <strong>
                  You really think that this entire effort is a LARP to craft a smokescreen around Russian collusion?
                 </strong>

                <p>
                 <em>
                  That would take one fuck of a stable genius to pull that off!

                <p>
                 Even if you spend the evening responding to this in detail, you've got to admit the "official narrative" is officially far-fetched as fuck. You would be claiming that this 4-D Chess match is
                 <strong>
                  all
                 </strong>
                 fake to cover tracks re:Russian activity in order to hijack our election.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If so, you have jumped the shark at this point in time.

                  You've just thrown together about a dozen narratives, mostly unrelated in a truly Gorgeous GISH Gallop to make it look SOMETHING is going on.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  One I'll pick out is Seth Rich.  The Russian hacking/spearfishing/election interference campaign went waaaaaay, waaaaaay, beyond the DNC emails.   The Seth Rich truthers tend to ignore this fact.   They try to pin the whole thing on a kid who excited about being offered a job with the Clinton Campaign.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The same folks who went after Podesta, Colin Powell, election officials, are now going after the Olympic committee.  These folks were a known threat in computer forensic world for years.  The Seth Rich "narrative" has always been stupid.

                is my girl! All she’s been doing is asking you a legitimate question that others have been wanting to know as well.

                 She didn't ask the right questions. She went on a smear campaign and continues it to this day - I've had plenty a chat with you, when I feel ready to do so on certain topics - we argue you and I, but, I always respect your contributions despite the semantics.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You also ask the right questions, or at least, say the right things a lot of the time. Why on earth would I respond to someone who consistently parrots an ad hominem attack against me? (these being the times when I block you temporarily, srayzie)

                  Lol wow this is classic ! I didn't ask the right questions ? There are no " right " questions to ask , your own words say you confess to drinking blood so........that goes against everything we are about here! You can hide in the dark and drink your blood but you can't act like you hate pizzagate activities and be drinking blood at the same time .. SORRY THE TWO DONT MIX .

            My personal fav was Q pointing out the location on the asia trip video to check out. Turns out AF1 buzzed NK - brilliant - no wonder fat kimmy fired a few after that!

            I am still a skeptic, but:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Q is an unconventional way for Trump to reach we the people, with plausible deniability.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The Q persona would likely be the ONLY way leaks of this kind could come out of the WH without pointing back to the source.  That is the crux of Q's dilemma when it comes to my skepticism - that plausible deniability is required.  President Trump could just as easily recruit memers to "prepare the public" in a public process now. It would force the press to explain it too.

            Excellent Srayzie!  God's work.  Keep in mind that "this" (social media, Voat, etc.) are a form of battlefield.  We are on one side (truth) and others are on the other side (shill, evil, DS).
           </p>
           <p>
            We don't get too many Voaters in the middle who say - "wait a second, this doesn't make sense...what about this fact and that fact" to counter the narrative.  What we get from asshats like
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/flaxom">
             @flaxom
            </a>
            who vomit walls of text with hypothetical arguments which lead to nowhere.  Never any fact.  Then they forum shift/slide.  Then attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is very obvious who the shills are.  Even normies do not behave that way.  Only shills do.  The Hitler Youth Homos, the Racine is Corrupt crew, and the random bottom feeders like
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/flaxon">
             @flaxon
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as Q being real, I HIGHLY suggest everyone start at the beginning of the Q feeds and read backward.  Look through the lens of hindsight.  Things make more and more sense each day.

            <p>
             You're the one telling people, without providing any evidence, that they're supposed to buy into some fucking bogus narrative that's CLEARLY DESIGNED AS DISINFO. So you're the one shilling, and slinging your tired insults at me only proves it. You could convince me that Q was real like I've asked but instead you deflect, insult, and keep on shilling your psyop like a little faggot.

               I bit my tongue for fucking three months watching this Q bullshit grow more and more, and finding it more and more ridiculous every day. So now I'm called a shill by a bunch of retards who can't into critical thinking and are falling for the most obvious larpy bullshit I've seen in years. Sorry if you find my arguments to be nasty but they're not getting nicer as I get called a fucking shill over and over by people unable to defend their assertions.

              Spend some time with the links at the bottom.  Then come back with an argument that involves more than ad hominem attacks backed up by nothing other than "fucking bogus", "designed as disinfo", "tired insults".
             </p>
             <p>
              You do realize - or maybe you don't - that you are using every "trick" in the book to float your argument.  I have a better idea - why don't you pick one of the more specific Q posts and show evidence which disputes it?

               You're asking me to prove a negative. I'll just say that any specific prediction Q has made has fallen flat, which is what I said in a previous post. I've also refuted each of those links at the bottom of the linked post, with very little effort. Feel free to argue with me about it there if you want.
              </p>
              <p>
               We all want the things Q is talking about to be real, and I suspect much of it is. But Q conveniently leaves out a lot of critical facets and also leaves the bulk of the messaging up to interpretation, which only strikes me as intentional misdirection.

                   I don't see why we should really be arguing about this. You seem personally offended that I don't buy into the Q thing, even though I've given you a lot of chances to convince me. We are on the same side even if we disagree about this, so I feel kinda bad going so hard on you about it.

                     Seems worth noting that about 60% of the original post there is about completely unrelated stuff to the pope or catholicism or anything. He goes on about Bin Laden and gun control and then drops the prayer at the end exactly as you would traditionally do with that prayer to ask for protection and blessings. Then nearly a month later the pope mentions the same prayer... and that's it? The pope didn't mention Bin Laden or gun control at all, and apparently the purpose of him even mentioning the prayer isn't important enough to even put into this graphic. So there's apparently no connection there at all unless I'm missing something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The second Q post in the image doesn't seem to have any meaning. He's referencing the prayer, but only by asking why it was mentioned. Is there something to the version that was posted that makes that relevant? That also seems like it would be important to include in the graphic, and if there's no significance there either then what does any of that possibly prove? The implication is that Q knows the pope is connected to the pedophile elite and... wants to reword a prayer?

             Stay skeptical.  If the US were to turn into a dictatorship, how would it happen?  Through Obama + Hillary cronyism, or through an Obama feint + "God Emperor" savior that the people welcome and cheer?  How do we know we're not being played now?

              Upvoted. We should always strive for the truth. There are 2 possibilities:

               [1] Q is unreal

              <li>
               [2] Q is real

              </a>
              's seven proofs of Q indicate that [2] holds. But then there are again 2 possibilities:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               [2.1] Trump is good
              </li>
              <li>
               [2.2] Trump is evil
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              IMO Trump certainly seems to be good, but he
              <em>
               could
              </em>
              be playing. I would not know under what conditions I would 100% be convinced that he is genuine.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is much at stake. Always stay vigilant.

               I agree, andrevandelft. It's possible that Trump is part of a third cabal we haven't seen yet.

               Like most people, Trump is neither completely good nor completely evil. What is useful is to know what his shortcomings are so that alternative plans can be developed.

               There are more than 2 possibilities. 
Q could be a shill of the deep state trying to lead you to a false conclusion of 2.2 or to laugh at all of us and make us look really dumb. 
Q could be AI like Quinn Michaels said, being run by the deep state like Quinn Michael said
Q could be predicting Trump's tweets or manipulating them 
Q could be working for Twitter
Q could be employing psych ops psychic spies
Q could be conducting a mind control program on pizza gate researchers
Q could be dropping bombs of bullshit to get you to all believe he's [2] real while you forget about the 90% of stuff that doesn't come true that Q predicts.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to George Webb it's possible that the hawaii missile alarm going off was an early alert backup alarm for the deep state to alert each other and test their communications system if one person got compromised. If Q predicted this was going to happen, it could be Bannon running the alarm system.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you follow George Webb it's clear Bannon is involved in the deep state and Webb has said Bannon could be Q. You can also go on ICwatch.wikileaks.org and search for the number of people who have Q clearance or higher, there are tens of thousands of them. Q does not have to be just Trump or not Trump.

                You elaborate on possibility [1]. I still think that is possible. Maybe I was unclear when I wrote:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">
                  @Vindicator
                 </a>
                 's seven proofs of Q indicate that [2] holds.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                With "indicate" I did not mean "prove". But I find [2] likely. Namely, if [1] then I would expect that Trump would have spoken out about that by now.

                 Stereotypes are real, that's why. It is very safe to assume we are all males. I know you are larping as a woman for attention if anything.

                  People here know me. Why would I LARP as a woman? I think it’s good for people to know that women are capable too. I don’t even know you so it really doesn’t even matter somthink what you want.

               I'm not sure that counts as a response. Also, I'd add, waiting for proof is for chumps and is one of the powers that shouldn't be's main strategies. Just keep things from being proven 100% and it's enough to keep nearly everyone from acting.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not that this applies here, but waiting for proof is for chumps. You'll never get it.

                It's impossible for me to disprove fake theories and pictures, cause they're fucking fake. There's no truth to counter it with because it's all goddamn fiction.

                   I have made no claims, could easily be false. You are the one claiming to know definitively. But you won't back it up, so...that's fine. I knew you wouldn't.

             Wrong. Q has stated that the boards were compromised. He made his own board. He said he is not communicating with others and it’s a lie.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the board that only Q can post on...

             When people go
             <a href="https://qcodefag.github.io/">
              here
             </a>
             they are seeing Q posts from all boards. Some are supposedly Q commenting to posters. I do not believe those. I believe only what Q posts on his own board. What you are seeing on the other boards are posts made to discredit Q.

                Well can I know from personal experience?  Nope.  It could maybe be fake?  If fake it is still fake and being done by the Whitehouse.  The pics and other predictive stuff Q has done to prove it up has linked to the Whitehouse definitively.

                Definitely is not a stoned college dropout doing all this for the lulz.  That said why leak?  I think there is a few reasons.  One reason is to make a meme army, KEK army or qanon army.  That is how we are used now.  We are a tool.  Talk about efficiency!  Zero cost (nearly).  Gaining trust from a tight group of people and giving them a purpose in the world.

                At the same time Trump has a way to (with plausible deniability) communicate sensitive shit to the world.  Also he has a way to threaten, insult, tip off, and deliver bad info to his enemies.  This is the fun part.  He gets to make "fly George fly" Comments  and make fun of comedy and such.
               </p>
               <p>
                Overall I believe because it is smart as fuck.  What a smart move.  Fucking beautiful.  Honestly I hope we never find out the truth.  I hope Q never reveals himself to us but I hope the Q program and the KEK army continues.  I hope it becomes a "deep state of the people"  always lurking in the background waiting to tear the ragged assholes out of scum like the Clintons and Soros and etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                I hope we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.  :)

               Show screen grab. Also, no way to verify cross platform. The 8ch stuff seems like bull to me. 8ch has under 100pph. For any effective dispersal of information he'd stick to cuckchan. They would  fall for Larps for more easily as well.

            I too have been with you in this journey which began pre-election with the leaked podesta emails. I THOUGHT I had been red pilled before, but this past 15-16 months has been eye opening on steroids and I can barely keep up  with all the info/intel. I have gone back and forth on the legitimacy of "Q" but it appears more and more that Q IS real and has been right. For example, to me the whole thing about the Saudi princes seemed to be a "HUH" moment, but then look at what was uncovered!
