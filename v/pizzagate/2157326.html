Airports are often used by human traffickers to hold “slave auctions,” where women and children are sold into prostitution.

             Picture a private charter flight pulling into a private hangar. The main door is closed. Women and children are brought out, and the buyers bid. Then they get into windowless vans and drive away.

            <p>
             The hardest part is setting up a secure site to fly into, especially from overseas. The incentive to hold the auction at the airport is that it reduces the logistical hassles for whoever takes care of that part. The plane touches down, the "goods" change hands, their part is done.

             The local entry-level lodge is the Sahib Shriners. They are very active, supporting the children's hospital in Tampa, running an annual circus, putting out a newsletter.
             <a href="http://sahibshrine.org/">
              Their website

            <p>
             I'm sure there are other things you could do, but joining the Sahib Shriners seems like one interesting possibility.

               Human traffickers often use a Sudanese phrase “use a slave to catch slaves,” meaning traffickers send “broken-in girls” to recruit younger girls into the sex trade.  Sex traffickers are often girls themselves, raping them, and teaching them sex acts.

              An estimated 30,000 victims of sex trafficking die each year from abuse, disease, torture, and neglect.  80% of those sold into sexual slavery are under 24, and some are as young as six-years-old.

               Human traffickers are increasingly trafficking pregnant women for their newborns. Babies are sold on the black market, where the profit is divided between the traffickers, doctors, lawyers, border officials, and other. The mother is usually paid less than what is promised her, citing the cost of travel and creating false documents. A mother might receive as little as a few hundred dollars for her baby.

              Women are trafficked to the U.S. largely to work in the sex industry (including strip clubs, peep and touch shows, massage parlors that offer sexual services, and prostitution). They are also trafficked to work in sweatshops, domestic servitude, and agricultural work.

              Sex traffickers use a variety of ways to “condition” their victims, including subjecting them to starvation, rape, gang rape, physical abuse, beating, confinement, threats of violence toward the victim and victim’s family, forced drug use, and shame.

              Victims of human trafficking suffer devastating physical and psychological harm. However, due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available services, and the frequency with which traffickers move victims, human trafficking victims and their perpetrators are difficult to catch.

             <p>
              In approximately 54% of human trafficking cases, the recruiter is a stranger, and in 46% of the cases, the recruiters know the victim. Fifty-two percent of human trafficking recruiters are men, 42% are women, and 6% are both men and women.

             In 1940, the year Charles Edward Merrill founded the firm we now know as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., he was 54 years old and had already lived an extraordinarily productive and visible life. A poor boy from the backwaters of Florida, Merrill was forced to leave college by lack of funds. But he schemed his way to Wall Street and made himself wealthy by the time he was 31.
