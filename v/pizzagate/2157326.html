Airports are often used by human traffickers to hold “slave auctions,” where women and children are sold into prostitution.

             Picture a private charter flight pulling into a private hangar. The main door is closed. Women and children are brought out, and the buyers bid. Then they get into windowless vans and drive away.
            </p>
            <p>
             The hardest part is setting up a secure site to fly into, especially from overseas. The incentive to hold the auction at the airport is that it reduces the logistical hassles for whoever takes care of that part. The plane touches down, the "goods" change hands, their part is done.

             The local entry-level lodge is the Sahib Shriners. They are very active, supporting the children's hospital in Tampa, running an annual circus, putting out a newsletter.
             <a href="http://sahibshrine.org/">
              Their website
             </a>
             says they have 1,300 members.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure there are other things you could do, but joining the Sahib Shriners seems like one interesting possibility.

             20 Fast Facts about Human Trafficking:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Approximately 75-80% of human trafficking is for sex.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There are more human slaves in the world today than ever before in history.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There are an estimated 27 million adults and 13 million children around the world who are victims of human trafficking.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Human trafficking not only involves sex and labor, but people are also trafficked for organ harvesting.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Human traffickers often use a Sudanese phrase “use a slave to catch slaves,” meaning traffickers send “broken-in girls” to recruit younger girls into the sex trade.  Sex traffickers are often girls themselves, raping them, and teaching them sex acts.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              An estimated 30,000 victims of sex trafficking die each year from abuse, disease, torture, and neglect.  80% of those sold into sexual slavery are under 24, and some are as young as six-years-old.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The end of the Cold War has resulted in the growth of regional conflicts and the decline of borders. Many rebel groups turn to human trafficking to fund military actions and garner soldiers.

               Human traffickers are increasingly trafficking pregnant women for their newborns. Babies are sold on the black market, where the profit is divided between the traffickers, doctors, lawyers, border officials, and other. The mother is usually paid less than what is promised her, citing the cost of travel and creating false documents. A mother might receive as little as a few hundred dollars for her baby.

              Global warming and severe natural disasters have left millions homeless and impoverished, which has created desperate people easily exploited by human trafficking.

              Women are trafficked to the U.S. largely to work in the sex industry (including strip clubs, peep and touch shows, massage parlors that offer sexual services, and prostitution). They are also trafficked to work in sweatshops, domestic servitude, and agricultural work.

              Sex traffickers use a variety of ways to “condition” their victims, including subjecting them to starvation, rape, gang rape, physical abuse, beating, confinement, threats of violence toward the victim and victim’s family, forced drug use, and shame.

               Family members will often sell children and other family members into slavery; the younger the victim, the more money the trafficker receives.

            <li>
             <p>
              Victims of human trafficking suffer devastating physical and psychological harm. However, due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available services, and the frequency with which traffickers move victims, human trafficking victims and their perpetrators are difficult to catch.

            <li>
             <p>
              In approximately 54% of human trafficking cases, the recruiter is a stranger, and in 46% of the cases, the recruiters know the victim. Fifty-two percent of human trafficking recruiters are men, 42% are women, and 6% are both men and women.

               Human traffickers often work with corrupt government officials to obtain travel documents and seize passports.

              Airports are often used by human traffickers to hold “slave auctions,” where women and children are sold into prostitution.

            <li>

              Due to globalization, every continent of the world has been involved in human trafficking, including a country as small as Iceland.

            <p>
             In 1940, the year Charles Edward Merrill founded the firm we now know as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., he was 54 years old and had already lived an extraordinarily productive and visible life. A poor boy from the backwaters of Florida, Merrill was forced to leave college by lack of funds. But he schemed his way to Wall Street and made himself wealthy by the time he was 31.

I find very little information on the internet about that except in your link.  I learned that from one of the links you included about the ancestors of the Bushes.  I presume they are trying to keep that under wraps. You are really on a roll.
