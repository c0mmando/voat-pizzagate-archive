<p>&quot;Obama Trading Cards Fetching Pretty Penny.  The New York Times (3/4, Doty, 1.18M) reports that as Obama and Clinton “duke it out in Texas and Ohio on Tuesday, Mr. Obama has trounced his Democratic rival in another arena: trading cards.  Presidential trading cards, released by the Topps Company on Feb. 6 and featuring the candidates’ likenesses and autographs, are fetching high prices on eBay this week.  An Obama card, one of 15 made by Topps, sold for $3,122, and a Clinton card, one of 18, sold for $1,325.  Bids for a card featuring an embedded autograph by” Sen. John McCain “were holding steady at $1,200 in an auction on Monday evening.  The cards are a bonus tucked into packs of Topps Baseball Series 1 for 2008. …  The cards are not actually signed by the candidates. Instead, they display signatures cut from items already autographed by the candidates, like baseballs by Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, or books by Mrs. Clinton.”</p>',

            for me it's nothing here...especially because its not private discussion and come from NY Times we can almost be sure its not a code for something else that what it is...

             I just happened to be reading FBi Anon AMA's and he mentioned CARDS too - perhaps they weren't literal cards and its an acronym for something?

              FBIAnon said Child Abduction Rapid Deployment
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               If foul play is suspected, police agencies can call in additional assets, such as an FBI Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) Team, or Team Adam. The latter is a NCMEC program that offers rapid, on-site assistance to law-enforcement officials in serious cases of missing children, according to the NCMEC website.
