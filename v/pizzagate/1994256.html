<p>Russian adoptions in the U.S. were banned by the Russian govt. in 2013 because of concerns over numerous cases of documented abuse and deaths of Russian orphans in the U.S. and because the European Adoption Consultants agency in Strongsville, OH, which was one of three U.S. agencies specifically banned from conducting Russian adoptions in 2008, was raided by the FBI on Feb.14, 2017, as part of a criminal probe into child trafficking.</p>
<p>Widespread headlines throughout conservative/independent media is making various claims that Natalia is an &quot;Obama plant,&quot; a Deep State operative, a &quot;honey pot&quot; trying to entrap Donald Trump, Jr., etc., based mostly on the fact that <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/07/well-lookie-russian-lawyer-veselnitskaya-pictured-obama-ambassador-russia-8-days-trump-jr-mtg/">a picture</a> has surfaced of her sitting at a hearing on Russia behind Obama\'s Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul at a foreign affairs meeting eight days after meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. in the Trump tower. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/07/well-lookie-russian-lawyer-veselnitskaya-pictured-obama-ambassador-russia-8-days-trump-jr-mtg/">Gateway Pundi</a>t claims she &quot;was given a privileged seat in the front row.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on pictures of anti-Trump rallies on Natalia\'s FB profile page, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-07-12/was-trump-jr-meeting-deep-state-setup-fisa-wiretaps-russian-atty-hates-president-lin">Jack Posobiec claims</a> she is anti-Trump and anti-Putin.</p>
<p>However, I still maintain <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1991932">my theory</a> that Natalia used her organization and other activities to create the impression that she is anti-Trump and anti-Putin in order to gain entrance into liberal elite circles and use her influence to lobby for changes to the Magnistsky Act. A Daily Beast reporter <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-dirty-game-in-the-us-congress">was onto her ac</a>t last year, and was suspicious that her organization was a front and part of a scheme and that she was not to be trusted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;disadvantaged Russian children are being dangled as bait, with a wink-and-a-nudge promise to have the Russian law (Magnitsky Act) rescinded if the American law is taken off the books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Bill Browder, the American businessman, who was the leading force behind the passage of the Magnitsky Act, is not buying Natalia\'s act either, no doubt because she was heavily involved in the prosecution of his case in Russia. </p>
<p>Josh Rogin of the Washington Post, r<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/10/senate-panel-to-hear-testimony-from-businessman-targeted-by-trump-dossier-firm/http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/10/senate-panel-to-hear-testimony-from-businessman-targeted-by-trump-dossier-firm/">eports today</a> that Bill Browder told him he believes Natalia is working on behalf of the Russian govt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Browder told me the he will testify that the fact Veselnitskaya was trying to convince Trump campaign officials and family members to change U.S. policy on Russia clearly shows she was acting as an agent of the Russian government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same fact that has kept me from jumping on the &quot;Natalia Veselintskaya Is a Deep-State, Soros Agent&quot; bandwagon. How can someone who wants to overturn the Maginstsky Act be apparently on such friendly terms with huge pro-Magnitsky Act lawmakers like John McCain and Michael McFaul?</p>
<p>Speaking of Michael McFaul, he tweeted today that he did not invite Natalia and her anti-Magnitsky allies to the Russian hearing at which this picture was taken. He tweets:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/885146485049835522">https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/885146485049835522</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I\'ve been told that COngressman Rohrabacher invited her to the hearing. Someone should confirm with his office. He also is anti-sanctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CNN investigative reporter Michael Weiss also tweeted confirmation that Natalia is an anti-Magintsky Act agent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was in DC to promote an anti-Magnitsky film and to troll the US government, including Amb. McFaul. Stupidity like this can\'t be faked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/885137283334246401">https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/885137283334246401</a></p>
<p>The liberal elite have disavowed any affiliation with her, and the pro-Trump people claim she is Soros-paid operative and set Donald Trump, Jr up to give the Obama Administration the rationale to spy on the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>I, for my part, see nothing in the continuing developments that change my theory that Natalia Veselnitskaya is a pro-Putin ally who is using a crusade to restart Russian adoptions in the U.S as a false front to gain access into liberal elite circles and use her influence to modify the Magnitsky Act. Pretending to be anti-Trump and cultivating relationships with never-Trumpers certainly aids her in that objective. </p>
<p>She may also have as her aim, though I\'m not able to prove it yet, using her organization to ferret out pedos and traffickers who want to restart the Russian adoption program. </p>
<p>Just my opinion, but Bill Browder, Michael McFaul and CNN today have all beautifully confirmed the <em>Daily Beast\'s</em> contention that Natalia V. is a pro-Putin troll and not to be trusted by the liberal elite. Whether this means she is actually working for the best interests of Putin (and Trump, by extension) I just can\'t say, but I wouldn\'t be surprised in the least if in the end we find out that Natalia is actually our ally in the war against child trafficking.</p>',

            You're off in the ozone my friend.  I would be very wary of any theories floating around in with concern to Browder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just doing a search for all of last year, I don't see any articles connecting him to Clinton.  I think he politically is much closer to someone like John McCain.  Obama and Clinton did not push for the Magnitsky Act.  Congress was far out ahead of them.  Obama and Clinton knew it would complicate dealings with Russia to say the least.   The American Interest Magazine has covered Browder a lot and they are at least Center-Right, I think his politics may be around the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her uranium deal?   Nonsense.  You're aware of the CFIUS board and how it acts?  I wonder if you're aware of how badly written that book and the initial articles on this were. You can research this yourself, but the truth is that deal posed no threat to national security, was approved by CFIUS and Clinton never was involved in it in any way, shape or form.    It's also took place AFTER Giustra sold the company.  The uranium story told by Schweitzer was completely wrong and funded by Steve Bannon.

             It's still a possibility she gave him valuable information about Clinton's collusion with corrupt Russian officials,

           <p>
            This is a virtual impossibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            A.  If Russian officials were working with Clinton, they would no longer be Russian officials.  See Oleg Erovinkin
           </p>
           <p>
            B.  Putin personally hates Clinton.  Clinton knows this.  Any approach by a Russian government official would smell like a set up from miles away.  It would be like hearing that the Clinton team was taking documents from Roger Stone because they believed that fake story that Trump fired him.
           </p>
           <p>
            C.  This would occupy most of Trump's twitter feed in 2016 if they had this info.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's your take on Putin by the way?

            "The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump’s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under “extraordinary circumstances” before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president’s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.
           </p>
           <p>
            This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa. "

            Do you understand the spy terms of a cutout and a dangle?
           </p>
           <p>
            She was both a cutout and a dangle.  She was not there with a basketful of priceless Faberge eggs from the Hermitage.  She was there with a little bauble to judge Team Trump's reaction, to see how thirsty they were and to provide some plausible deniability.  She doesn't work for the government after all.  Putin was not going on a blind date.  He wanted to know if Team Trump was going to get into bed with him before he got dressed for the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the beginning.   Later on they bring out the big guns like Kislyak and Gorkov.  This is where it starts and it later includes Kushner asking Kislyak if he could use Russian communication tools so Team Trump can speak to him in secret.
