<p>The article names members of the Arizona Mafia in a list, which is similar to the list I reported on a few days ago.
According to the Arizona Capitol Times, “At least 25 Arizonans, mostly from within her gubernatorial administration, followed [Janet] Napolitano to Washington D.C., and served within the massive U.S. Department of Homeland Security that she has overseen for the past four-and-a-half years. Many have moved on to bigger and better things.”
By “bigger and better things,” the author meant that many of the 25 individuals gained senior positions within agencies of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Usually those positions were at or near the top of the agency organizational chart, such as “Chief of Staff” or “Chief Administrator” positions. </p>

            Scottsdale was always a Satanic center since I was a kid. Phoenix too. This video came out yesterday, ...https://mobile.wnd.com/2018/08/okeefe-catches-antifa-teaching-activists…   Now this Andrew Zee might come across as a low level player, but I am not even sure if that is indeed his real name. Definitely PG related because he drops Tom Steyer in conversation.

              Before google cracked down on it's own Raison d'être,  there were multiple sites about the satanic highways with message boards.  From 1880 to 2016, the Social Security Administration has recorded 347 babies born with the first name Zed in the United States. That would be Zee in American.

               Offering disenfranchised kids fame, money, and/or power is an enticement. Of course, once in, they can never get out. As in never.

            <p>
             I think it's being covered up by character assassination via ad hominem attacks. All arrows point to something being horribly wrong. And the fact that Arizona is so compromised and involved in human trafficking just adds to it being a cover up. Remember that the hair dye was black. That meant it wasn't Mexican children being brought into the US. It was US kids or European children being taken out of the country.

            Big-Time Gangsters Set up McCain's Family Fortune The Buchanan-hating Bronfman family are the "godfathers" behind the organized crime empire in Arizona that spawned the political career of "reformer" John McCain.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1976 a crusading Phoenix reporter, Don Bolles, was murdered by a car-bomb after writing a series of stories exposing the organized crime connections of well-known figures in Arizona, including one Jim Hensley. (Cindy's Father)
           </p>
           <p>
            Five years later "Honest John" McCain arrived in Arizona as the new husband of Hensley's daughter, Cindy. "From the moment McCain landed in Phoenix," according to Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity, "the Hensleys were key sponsors of his political career."
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is, the people ultimately behind the Hensley fortune are even more interesting and controversial
           </p>
           <p>
            While it is well-known McCain's father-in-law is owner of the biggest Anheuser-Busch beer distributor in Arizona—one of the largest beer distributors in the nation—the media has had nothing to say about the origins of the Hensley fortune that financed McCain's rise to power.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Hensley fortune, in fact, is a regional offshoot of the big time bootlegging and rackets empire of the Bronfman dynasty of Canada, founded by Sam Bronfman, an early partner of Meyer Lansky, longtime "chairman of the board" of the international crime syndicate. (The Bronfmans cover all bases. Sam's son, Edgar, today—at least publicly—supports George W. Bush.)

           <p>
            If it's Democrats, they are getting help.  Remember they are all in this together.  The Bronfmans and McCains, especially Cindy's father plays a big part in what happens in Az.

             The bootlegging reference made me think of Trump's tweet ... the one about Al Capone.

              They also say that “there is a schism between the EDNY and Main Justice [Democrats] over whether to indict a clearly guilty Emiliano Salinas for his large role in the Bronfman-Raniere crime organization.“ Salinas is the son of a former president of Mexico

                 Even replies. Yes, some of these are written with a psy-op's practiced eye. I don't even bother to answer them. Such pros. And they send them to boards like this to disrupt flow, create dissonance, and cause fights. Anything to keep us from talking about the truth and that is: There is a global elite cabal that are pedophiles. PedoWood is part of it, burning in hell is not enough.

                  Well since the pope said there is no hell we will have to settle for lock up.  To bad the days of ball and chains are gone.

              With the other players like Clare, they had some small charges at the start as well, then we find it mushroomed into a RICO Case.  Many more charges added.  Possibly this is what may happen to Salinas.  I am hoping.  There are many that are making money from Salinas' drug trafficking.  Republicans and Democrats. in DC and across the country.  Governors, Mayors they are all getting a piece of the pie for letting him operate in their cities.  Beyond Despicable.

               But the problem is in doing that, they set themselves up for blackmail. They can never be effective again -- not with that hanging over their head. So it's not just some pocket change. They really are screwing with everyone's lives.

                It's impossible to get out once you get started.  It's the money and what it buys.  But they are causing severe heartache for many families and horrible deaths.  They need to be kept away from the human race.  Locking up is the only way.  For a long time.  They have made life a Living He77 for many.  Now it's their turn.

              Yeah I know about Salinas.  Bronfman is in control of Canada and he is head of the Jewish Mafia which was called the Purple Gang when his father started out bootlegging liquor in Canada  If you read the whole section in the link I sent your eyes will pop out, like mind did.  Also remember that in Tucson the last name of the mayor is Rothschild.  I am racking my brain now for I can't remember who the bf of Salinas is.  He is married to a sex symbol woman but they are real boyfriends.  Darn!  OOH, just looked it up.  Alenjandro Betancourt his biz partner.  Salinas pretty much in control in Mexico.  One of Nieto's kids is involved too and so is a child of Fox.  They are all guilty as HE77.

              As it says in the article Mexicans will not be enticed by NXIVM when they find out Salinas was gay.  They are not as open about that as we are here.  This will be one of the biggest trials ever. If it comes to pass.

                   I think it is not only the most up to date, but reliable. Sometimes I don't know what to believe. I don't trust a lot of the sites.

                        A lot of them I don't recognize actually, but there are certain ones like jack parsons, etc.  and jdp and polly peterson they have been going to town this week.  Yep, down voating should be our mission this weekend.  We should make sure others know.

                         I didn't recognize any of them. I guess there are shills devoted to the pizzagate subverse. Those are the ones that I'm familiar with.

                          There are quite a few.  But it's important right now to notice the present ones, the obvious ones.  Down voat their posts AND comments.  You can go into their comment history, hit context and you will see the comment and you down voat.  You can do a whole bunch that way.  I discovered that the shills do that too.  Right back at em. Returning the favor, in a way.

             The 9/11 attack was the impetus to create this powerful, new, Cabinet level agency with which to subvert American democracy from within.

             It's part of the swamp and needs a good cleaning. I'm getting so sick of reading about all the dirty dealings going on. If we had a goddamn media, they'd be reporting on things like this. We'd actually see stories like this on the front page instead of fantasies based on a fictitious source, or ones based on how many diet sodas our POTUS drinks.
