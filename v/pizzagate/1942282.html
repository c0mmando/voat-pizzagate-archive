<p>I encourage you guy go and show some support, so he knows we support his team having the balls to do what most others wouldn\'t.</p>
<p>Yesterday, his team put together over 150 bulletins with facts and important questions that need to be answered. As much as i\'ve looked into the SCR case, even I found new info here, so I highly suggest you look over them all and share with whoever you can.</p>
<p>1) Where are the phone records for Seth Rich? They are a vital piece in this investigation. who was he talking to from 1:30 am to 4:19am??</p>
<p>2) Seth Rich supposedly went to Lou\'s City Car that Night, sitting in his normal spot, drinking his normal beer.. </p>
<p>3) Joe Capone, the Bar Owner of Lou\'s City Bar claims that he offered Seth a ride home, or a cab that night, and Seth Rich refused.</p>
<p>4) Joe Capone made these statements in a September 2016 Crime Watch TV Interview.. <a href="https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/09/30/exclusive-murdered-dnc-staffers-family-friends-set-record-straight/">https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/09/30/exclusive-murdered-dnc-staffers-family-friends-set-record-straight/</a></p>
<p>5) Joe Capone in an Interview with George Webb claims that he wasn\'t at Lou\'s City Bar that night, and was in fact on vacation with family.</p>
<p>6) That\'s conflicting stories from the Bar Owner Joe Capone about where he was that night.. Why hasn\'t this been questions by Police?</p>
<p>7) According to Joe Capone and Lou\'s City Bar staff, Police never asked for Video that night of Seth Rich in the bar.. It\'s SOP..</p>
<p>8) According to the bar, the video of that night July 9th was recorded over and no longer exists.. </p>
<p>9) It\'s Standard Operating Procedure for Law Enforcement to go back to the last known scene and ask for video, this never happened.</p>
<p>10) Joe Capone, the Owner of Lou\'s City Bar is now featured in a New Campaign Ad for Washington D.C. Mayer Muriel Bowser.. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtpgliI8ilw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtpgliI8ilw</a></p>
<p>11) Seth Rich Supposedly walked almost 2 miles home at 2AM in a City Like Washington D.C. Here\'s the rout.. you tell us, would you? <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCj92OsVYAAJ09w.jpg:large">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCj92OsVYAAJ09w.jpg:large</a></p>
<p>12) In this so called route he may have taken... 580 camera\'s exist.. Not one has been recovered or discovered that shows him that night..</p>
<p>13) Would you walk 2 miles at 2 am in a city like Washington DC with $2,000 cash in your wallet? </p>
<p>14) Over 90% of the staff at Lou\'s City Bar has since changed over since that night.. </p>
<p>15) Lou\'s City Bar was hosting the UFC 200 PPV that night featuring the return of Brock Lesnar.. The Bar would have been packed out!</p>
<p>16) No one finds it odd that not one person from a packed bar has came forward in 11 months and said &quot;Hey I saw that guy at Lou\'s that nite&quot;</p>
<p>17) Here\'s the Twitter Advertisement from Lou\'s City Bar for Saturday Night July 9th.. Not one person besides staff saw Seth Rich.. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkCa92WsAIA6B9.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkCa92WsAIA6B9.jpg</a></p>
<p>18) According to Seth\'s Father Joel, he would make 5 phone calls that night after 1am... 2 of those calls would go to Joel Rich.. </p>
<p>19) Seth Rich would call a friend that night, the call would last 12 minutes according to Joel Rich, he wouldn\'t name that person..</p>
<p>20) According to Joel Rich, Seth Rich would call another friend, that call would last less than a minute, again, we weren\'t told who it was</p>
<p>21) According to Joel Rich, Seth Rich would call his Girlfriend Kelsey Mulka at 2:05 AM and that call would last 89 minutes, then drop..</p>
<p>22) A few minutes later, Seth Rich would call back, and that call would last another 43 minutes, before he would end the call the next round</p>
<p>23) Let\'s do a little math. 2:05 and then 90 minutes..That\'s 3:35 AM.. Five minute break in calls, another 43 minutes...Do the math folk :)</p>
<p>24) That would mean according to Joel Rich, Seth would end the call with Kelsey Mulka at 4:23 AM... Police were on the seen at 4:19 AM.. hmm</p>
<p>25) According to a neighbor Mike Mueller on multiple interviews, who also goes by Mark.. Police &quot;Walked him by me&quot; in reference to Seth..</p>
<p>26) First off, if you\'ve ever been around a murder seen, no one is allowed near it do to tampering of evidence.. Another Red Flag..</p>
<p>27) According to the Police report, four of the six responding officers were wearing body cams.. </p>
<p>28) According to EMS, Seth Rich was setting up and talking per multiple reports.. </p>
<p>29) In a January Interview.. Seth Rich\'s Father Joel told the Newspaper, &quot;His Girlfriend went to bed thinking nothing was wrong&quot; </p>
<p>30) In Multiple TV Interviews, Seth Rich\'s Father has stated that his Girlfriend Kelsey Mulka heard a scuffle on the other end of the phone.</p>
<p>31) So which is it, Is there a scuffle, or was everything fine? We now have conflicting reports here with the girlfriend and Father.</p>
<p>32) We know that Joe Capone, the owner of Lou\'s City Car is a person of Interest.. He\'s given conflicting stories now.</p>
<p>33) So let\'s put Kelsey Mulka the Girlfriend, and Joe Capone, The Bar Owner down as Persons of Interest, shall we? </p>
<p>34) Seth Rich died just 300 steps from his Front Door. What lured him out that night into the middle of an Intersection? #HisNameWasSethRich</p>
<p>35) According to EMT\'s and Responders Seth Rich was so confused that he gave his old address when asked what his address was.. </p>
<p>36) I don\'t think anyone\'s asked this before, but with a Gunshot victim, why are we asking his Address? Shouldn\'t we be saving him???</p>
<p>37) What if Seth Rich didn\'t live off Flagler, he did in fact live at 1222 Euclid, only a few minutes walk from the Bars he loves </p>
<p>38) If I\'ve been shot, don\'t ask me questions, save me.. I\'m so confused by the asking of where he lived when he\'s laying in the street shot</p>
<p>39) Seth Rich had $2000 Cash, A Rolex, A Jewish Chai Pendant, Credit Cards, Cell Phone, and nothing was taking off of his body.</p>
<p>40) Does anyone think people that are willing to pull the trigger and shoot someone from behind are worried about Police response time?</p>
<p>41) The theory of a botched robbery with nothing missing, makes absolutely zero sense. No LEO we asked believe this theory of Metro DC PD.</p>
<p>42) Police told the family that there was a video camera on the corner from a little Convenient store. Shows a grainy image on the video.</p>
<p>43) The Camera Captured a grainy image of their son collapsing and the feet or legs of two other people — possibly his killers. </p>
<p>44) Officials with D.C. police declined an interview request. </p>
<p>45) A police spokesman would not confirm the existence of a video or reveal what Rich may have said after he was shot</p>
<p>46)  The Police spokesman continued saying that that information could compromise an ongoing investigation..... </p>
<p>47) Now how could the video of the Killers hurt the Investigation??? Wouldn\'t you want the public looking for these monsters for Justice?</p>
<p>48) How would showing what he said on the body cams hurt an on going investigation? If he mentioned who the killers were? Why hold that?</p>
<p>49) Unless he mentioned the type of people that you aren\'t supposed to talk about in corrupt Washington D.C... </p>
<p>50) Why is Liz Lyons, the Communications Officer for Metro DC Police playing the role of Judge, Jury, and Executioner on Body Cams?</p>
<p>51) Shouldn\'t what happens to evidence in a case be up to a Judge, District Attorney, Not the Communications Officer of Metro PD? </p>
<p>52) Liz Lyons refused to answer questions, and even says that if she feels they aren\'t relevant, she tosses body cams in 90 days.. </p>
<p>53) Liz Lyons literally made up her position within the Washington Metro DC Police Department.. Who is she connected to? Who empowers her???</p>
<p>54) Seth Rich was an American Hero. He uncovered not only the corruption found in Wikileaks, but polling and voter fraud. </p>
<p>55) When Hillary Clinton mentions you on the Campaign trail just 48 hours after your death.. You can bet your ass she\'s involved. </p>
<p>56) Seth Rich started his Political Career working for the polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, where he was mentored by Andrew Therriault
57) Andrew Therriault a PhD Data Scientist Director for the DNC, also got Seth Rich his job at the DNC, called him his protege. </p>
<p>58)  Therriault quickly stated &quot;He wanted to learn more from a techincal standpoint, but that wasn\'t his background. (Hacking the DNC)</p>
<p>59) Andrew Therriault was asked multiple questions by multiple reporters. He continued to push the non hacking narrative and shit it down.</p>
<p>60) Andrew Therriault would make a grave mistake on April 27th, 2017. He would make this tweet, and revive the Rich Investigation. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkfDgFXsAQNz-p.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkfDgFXsAQNz-p.jpg</a></p>
<p>61) Now why would the former mentor, colleague of Seth Rich make a Tweet insulting him, and mentioning him? </p>
<p>62) Furthermore, if that Tweet was harmless, why would he delete it, and then start blocking people from his Twitter account? </p>
<p>63) Andrew Therriault would again make threats as Hillary Clinton a few weeks ago would attack the DNC for not backing her in Election...</p>
<p>64) Here\'s a barage of Tweets that Andrew Therriault would release attacking Hillary Clinton for attacking the DNC. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkhU3KXkAAS_jQ.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkhU3KXkAAS_jQ.jpg</a></p>
<p>65) In June a Cybersecurity firm known as CrowdStrike would conclude that Russians had hacked the DNC...</p>',

           24) That would mean according to Joel Rich, Seth would end the call with Kelsey Mulka at 4:23 AM... Police were on the seen at 4:19 AM.. hmm
          </p>
          <p>
           25) According to a neighbor Mike Mueller on multiple interviews, who also goes by Mark.. Police "Walked him by me" in reference to Seth..
          </p>
          <p>
           26) First off, if you've ever been around a murder seen, no one is allowed near it do to tampering of evidence.. Another Red Flag..
          </p>
          <p>
           27) According to the Police report, four of the six responding officers were wearing body cams..
          </p>
          <p>
           28) According to EMS, Seth Rich was setting up and talking per multiple reports..
          </p>
          <p>
           29) In a January Interview.. Seth Rich's Father Joel told the Newspaper, "His Girlfriend went to bed thinking nothing was wrong"
          </p>
          <p>
           30) In Multiple TV Interviews, Seth Rich's Father has stated that his Girlfriend Kelsey Mulka heard a scuffle on the other end of the phone.
          </p>
          <p>
           31) So which is it, Is there a scuffle, or was everything fine? We now have conflicting reports here with the girlfriend and Father.
          </p>
          <p>
           32) We know that Joe Capone, the owner of Lou's City Car is a person of Interest.. He's given conflicting stories now.
          </p>
          <p>
           33) So let's put Kelsey Mulka the Girlfriend, and Joe Capone, The Bar Owner down as Persons of Interest, shall we?
          </p>
          <p>
           34) Seth Rich died just 300 steps from his Front Door. What lured him out that night into the middle of an Intersection? #HisNameWasSethRich
          </p>
          <p>
           35) According to EMT's and Responders Seth Rich was so confused that he gave his old address when asked what his address was..
          </p>
          <p>
           36) I don't think anyone's asked this before, but with a Gunshot victim, why are we asking his Address? Shouldn't we be saving him???
          </p>
          <p>
           37) What if Seth Rich didn't live off Flagler, he did in fact live at 1222 Euclid, only a few minutes walk from the Bars he loves
          </p>
          <p>
           38) If I've been shot, don't ask me questions, save me.. I'm so confused by the asking of where he lived when he's laying in the street shot
          </p>
          <p>
           39) Seth Rich had $2000 Cash, A Rolex, A Jewish Chai Pendant, Credit Cards, Cell Phone, and nothing was taking off of his body.
          </p>
          <p>
           40) Does anyone think people that are willing to pull the trigger and shoot someone from behind are worried about Police response time?
          </p>
          <p>
           41) The theory of a botched robbery with nothing missing, makes absolutely zero sense. No LEO we asked believe this theory of Metro DC PD.
          </p>
          <p>
           42) Police told the family that there was a video camera on the corner from a little Convenient store. Shows a grainy image on the video.
          </p>
          <p>
           43) The Camera Captured a grainy image of their son collapsing and the feet or legs of two other people — possibly his killers.
          </p>
          <p>
           44) Officials with D.C. police declined an interview request.
          </p>
          <p>
           45) A police spokesman would not confirm the existence of a video or reveal what Rich may have said after he was shot
          </p>
          <p>
           46)  The Police spokesman continued saying that that information could compromise an ongoing investigation.....
          </p>
          <p>
           47) Now how could the video of the Killers hurt the Investigation??? Wouldn't you want the public looking for these monsters for Justice?
          </p>
          <p>
           48) How would showing what he said on the body cams hurt an on going investigation? If he mentioned who the killers were? Why hold that?
          </p>
          <p>
           49) Unless he mentioned the type of people that you aren't supposed to talk about in corrupt Washington D.C...
          </p>
          <p>
           50) Why is Liz Lyons, the Communications Officer for Metro DC Police playing the role of Judge, Jury, and Executioner on Body Cams?
          </p>
          <p>
           51) Shouldn't what happens to evidence in a case be up to a Judge, District Attorney, Not the Communications Officer of Metro PD?
          </p>
          <p>
           52) Liz Lyons refused to answer questions, and even says that if she feels they aren't relevant, she tosses body cams in 90 days..
          </p>
          <p>
           53) Liz Lyons literally made up her position within the Washington Metro DC Police Department.. Who is she connected to? Who empowers her???
          </p>
          <p>
           54) Seth Rich was an American Hero. He uncovered not only the corruption found in Wikileaks, but polling and voter fraud.
          </p>
          <p>
           55) When Hillary Clinton mentions you on the Campaign trail just 48 hours after your death.. You can bet your ass she's involved.
          </p>
          <p>
           56) Seth Rich started his Political Career working for the polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, where he was mentored by Andrew Therriault
57) Andrew Therriault a PhD Data Scientist Director for the DNC, also got Seth Rich his job at the DNC, called him his protege.
          </p>
          <p>
           58)  Therriault quickly stated "He wanted to learn more from a techincal standpoint, but that wasn't his background. (Hacking the DNC)
          </p>
          <p>
           59) Andrew Therriault was asked multiple questions by multiple reporters. He continued to push the non hacking narrative and shit it down.
          </p>
          <p>
           60) Andrew Therriault would make a grave mistake on April 27th, 2017. He would make this tweet, and revive the Rich Investigation.
           <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkfDgFXsAQNz-p.jpg">
            https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkfDgFXsAQNz-p.jpg
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           61) Now why would the former mentor, colleague of Seth Rich make a Tweet insulting him, and mentioning him?
          </p>
          <p>
           62) Furthermore, if that Tweet was harmless, why would he delete it, and then start blocking people from his Twitter account?
          </p>
          <p>
           63) Andrew Therriault would again make threats as Hillary Clinton a few weeks ago would attack the DNC for not backing her in Election...
          </p>
          <p>
           64) Here's a barage of Tweets that Andrew Therriault would release attacking Hillary Clinton for attacking the DNC.
           <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkhU3KXkAAS_jQ.jpg">
            https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCkhU3KXkAAS_jQ.jpg
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           65) In June a Cybersecurity firm known as CrowdStrike would conclude that Russians had hacked the DNC...

            Great factual post, thanks OP.  Personally, my thinking now is that Seth is alive and well and we weren't meant to question it. If we were meant to do so, it was to frame Hillary et al, alongside the voter / election fraud.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Seth had died, the Jewish community certainly wouldn't have left all of these questions unanswered about one of their own. Therein, I believe, lies our answer.  Was he 'rescued' ?

            If Seth is alive and in witness protection - to avoid another addition to the Clinton Body Count? - perhaps he is the source/witness to another investigation - hopefully into Hillary.  But you would think they would have made some progress by now.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBIAnon said - and I've trawled thru to find the source, unsuccessfully - in answer to why there had been no arrests - that the rot extended so far and there were too many top players involved that it was too big to trigger - or something similar

Just to add a few questions...
           </p>
           <p>
            Robert "Bob" Creamer is a felon and longtime Democratic operative from Chicago. His wife is congresswoman Jan Shankowsky. Creamer is friends of Podesta, Clinton's, &amp; Obama. He is credited for writing the structure of some parts of Obamacare except he was in prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was caught on camera in an undercover sting last summer paying rioters to go to Trump rallies and incite violence including against police. This violence led to death and prevention of rally in Chicago. The rioters were trained in Alinsky tactics. See HRC thesis. His front business was Democracy Now. On camera he was also caught accepting money from foreign governments, coordinating with HRC campaign directly, being the go between of PACS...while simutaneously meeting at the Whitehouse with Obama privately.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:Did not realize you were adding part 2&amp;3. This will bring in Scott Foval who you mentioned in part 3 as tweeting about Seth Rich. Foval worked with Creamer in hiring paid agitators (rioters) as mentioned above. He was also caught on camera in this undercover sting. The fact it is in his tweets &amp; he mentions Seth Rich is haunting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bob Creamer was at the Whitehouse hundreds of times.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exposure was so grave he immediately resigned but the FBI did not even open a case. Obama had him in the front row of the rest of his speeches. His wife Jan Shankowsky is embroiled in corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            I bring this up now because on record when Bartender Joe Capone goes to the Whitehouse 4 days before Seth Rich death guess who was also there Robert "Bob" Creamer!
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a question that must be answered.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as the relationship of Dr. Sava (Seth Rich doctor) who was part of the yellow house organ harvesting in Kosovo with HRC in the 90's.

              Same meeting time and location same day. Joe Capone took a few photographs from inside the Whitehouse and posted it to Facebook this has been captured. This places him in the East Wing of the Whitehouse in an identifiable room. The disinfo agents that tried to proclaim he was part of a tour are liars. It shows in the records his location and party number....small and in East Wing....research this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bob Creamer there at the same day and time and a personal friend of Podesta &amp; Obama &amp; HRC.
             </p>
             <p>
              Joe Capone is interviewed by George Webb and lies States he was out of town 7 hours away. He was at an out of town location 7 hours from last time he reported seeing Seth Rich alive. Like he left &amp; drove and drove 7 hours to another location so he could say " I was out of town" Why would he lie to George about the night before?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would the FBI not be crawling all over him and his Whitehouse visit by the way? They would be and we all know it!
