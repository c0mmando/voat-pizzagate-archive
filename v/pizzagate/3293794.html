             At the top of the organisation chart is Brain Kenner, Deputy Mayor.. One week ago it was reported that he is leaving his government  position for Amazon :

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A spokeswoman for Amazon confirmed that Kenner will begin at the company next month. In a statement, Brian Huseman, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, linked Kenner’s hiring to the company’s HQ2 plans. “Our new headquarters presents an opportunity for us to build a foundation for regional collaboration and engagement,” Huseman said. “We will rely on Brian Kenner’s expertise in the region and in economic development to help us do that.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Before being tapped as Bowser’s economic development chief, Kenner worked as chief of staff for two previous D.C. deputy mayors: Victor Hoskins, under Mayor Vince Gray, and Valerie Santos, under Mayor Adrian Fenty. (Hoskins now serves as director of economic development for Arlington County, future home to Amazon HQ2.) Kenner’s office oversees the disposition of public property, efforts to diversify the District’s economy, and tax deals.

             <p>
              Edit: Excuse the profanity but things are absolutely fucking insane. Just found out that a woman in Maryland killed two of her adopted children and stuffed their body parts in a freezer. She had adopted from the D.C. area where Adoptions Together works with government agencies. The founder of Adoptions Together, Janice Goldwater, even commented on the case. They don't even check in on the kids so the 'mother' was getting paid adoption subsidies for the girls which were then sitting in a freezer as frozen body parts. Luckily, one adopted girl survived after being beaten bloody with a shoe and starved for three days.

              I already said I am on a phone and can't post links. I advise you to look up the celeb donations at LooktoTheStars.com and use a search engine for the charities/ Atlantic Council.

              i dont want to come across bitchy, but all the info gathered will remain useless if not this conclusion is drawn: not only for the gargantuous corruption unearthed here on v / PG relating to those foundations but to prevent a fullblown digital feudal system  robo tax is important, thus a flat tax on consumption solves three big problems in one go - no more tax empt foundations charities (see gates monsanto etc etc) is sth most people can easily agree on - thus fighting against the willfull implemented unrest in many societies
