<p>Examples:</p>
<p>The pool is great for children </p>
<p>If you have a lot of small children and daytrips are costly, go to Kaliko because children pay only at the age of 7. The only part that is not so great is the rocky beach, but the pool is great for kids, plus they have a playground.</p>
<p>The reason why I say it is family paradise because I feel it is more geared for children. There are a lot of games for them to play, the food option is more kid friendly, and the pool is very shallow I think is is about 2-4 feet deep. Another reason why I say it is family paradise, there are only families with their children there. Not to many adults without kids. When I say there are a lot of children there its like a day care. It is fun for the grown ups tho, no worries there.</p>
<p>Ideal for kids, a great large pool, shallow enough in spots for small children.</p>
<p>I great place to rest, especially for those wanting a quiet place or those with children. </p>
<p>One night we took some of the children we sponsor to Kalico for swimming and dinner. The children really enjoy the afternoon of swimming and all of us enjoyed the delicious buffet.</p>
<p>Our children had a ball trying to enjoying everything-clean beach, warm ocean, swing, pool and also delicious food. Special ice cream at the end of the day </p>
<p>We felt very welcomed and our children had a blast in the pool</p>
<p>. But primarily thye have hands down the nicest pool at any beach in Haiti with multiple levels and depths, </p>
<p>l Love the the pool has sizes for kids. </p>
<p>Our kids loved the pool, </p>
<p>The ocean is beautiful and the pool is good for any kids to swim. </p>
<p>The pool was also great very big and had plenty of room for their guest!! I recommend getting the lobster and crab on the beach, </p>
<p>We loved the pool! It\'s so big and just perfect depth for all ages!</p>
<p>I like food ...very tasty ..I give it a fiveeeeeee..our young people had a great time on the pool...</p>
<p>Pool and beach ;)</p>
<p>Large pool areas, beach activities</p>
<p>but the pool was big enough for there to be lots of guests able to have fun in the water.</p>
<p>It goes on and on. All coincidence? Find more and archive, I probably missed a lot.</p>

             review
            </a>
            of a restaurant in Port-au-Prince Haiti caught my attention at first.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Soft murders of conversation and the occasional giggle or shriek from one of the two babies, in the room.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Given the context of this quote within the review, it's likely innocent enough, and the user's other reviews don't contain such loaded words. But it was a momentary shock to see 'murders' 'shriek' and 'babies' in the same sentence. After researching all this sickness, it has changed my impression of people using language like that in such a casual way.

            I was thinking about this place today. The reviews could be harmless BUT how were all those children in one room. Someone at the hotel was involved in some part of the operation and I think that is worth looking into. Thanks for researching reviews!

            Considering their need to respond to every review, it would be interesting to see their response from a one star asking why there were 17 people staying in one room.

            I'm gonna be honest, I'm not that impressed by this one. Could some pedos be hiding in the reviews? Certainly (ie "special ice cream" is a little out of place, hotel responds in less than gracious ways to critique, shall we say).
           </p>
           <p>
            But overall, it's a hotel. They're going to have pools and food. If you see someone ageing their kids and telling you about how they'll be in that pool for sure, archive the crap out of it. But let's not bundle the wheat with the chaff and try to call it french bread.

            The way they rip the bad reviews is very interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people claim the beach is great, others claim it is all rocks and deep with violent waves.
           </p>
           <p>
            How can 17 kids be in ONE ROOM an not set an alarm to staff? It is also mentioned in one of the reviews that the food is catered to 'Missionaries'. Like Silsby?
           </p>
           <p>
            When was this hotel built or last bought? We need to cross reference that with Clinton Foundation Money spent in Haiti. I think this could be a good lead.
           </p>
          </p>

              Our team of 17 stayed here overnight on our way from Gonaives to Port-au-Prince. After a week out working in the hot, dry country side of Haiti, the Kaliko Beach Club was a great place to recuperate before heading to the airport and a long day of travel.

               Gotcha. the article linked by OP says:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                "We found 33 girls, 20 of them minors, locked up in one room,” said Danton Léger, the Port-au-Prince government commissioner, adding that in another room, 12 traffickers, including eight men were detained. In the room occupied by the traffickers, the police seized bags of drugs, alcohol, a certain amount of money in Gourdes and US dollars, a computer whose hard disk contains videos of child pornography...
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               The wording is slightly ambiguous as to whether it was 20 or 33 locked up in one room, but I think he meant all 33.
