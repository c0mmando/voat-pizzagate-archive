            Race Against Evil: The Secret Missions of the Interpol Agent Who Tracked the World's Most Sinister Criminals by David Race Bannon
           </p>
           <p>
            but all confirmed the existence of Team Archangel - "this most horrific atrocity," child sex trafficking - interviews served to increase my own horror at the sheer volume of children abused in sex trafficking—and to begin to understand in part the immense frustration of men like Defferre that ultimately led to a Team Archangel. -
           </p>
           <p>
            David Race Bannon is the author of "Race Against Evil". The book details his work as an Interpol assassin and the history and structure of Interpol. This New World Order police force has total immunity and is under no jurisdictional limits. Armed with the mission to fight child pornography, they have been allowed to operate with absolutely no controls by any government

            I just donated. Please donate! This is one of the best ways to expose the heinous crimes. Fund the good guys to take down the bad guys. If you only have a dollar to spare many $1 bills add up and it brings us closer to saving our children and society as a whole. Blessings to all.

            There are concrete reasons to be suspicious of Craig Sawyer, the new “savior” for many here.  Sawyer is rumored to be a Freemason, which I haven’t yet been able to confirm or refute.  However, his website’s logo contains a

           <p>
            "Sawyer first served with SEAL Team One through Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and, after some time as a SEAL Sniper Instructor, he 
served with DEVGRU, which was previously known as Seal Team 6."

             Jones just said today he had donated 10k and is going to donate another 90 now.  Nothing to see here, except we should be grateful he is putting his money where his mouth is ... and so should all of us.  I can forgo a couple Starbucks and hope this veteran that served our country as a Navy Seal will do the work we cannot.  Watch some of his videos.  He is authentic.  Emotionally distraught over the mistreatment of children.
