            Also wasn't Weinstein doing an anti vax movie?
Did a movie win Jay Z about Kalif Browder and was doing one about Trayvon Martin.  I think harv may have been getting a bit woke and they are now using his past against him. Jim Carey speaking against vaccines, Mel Gibson and his rant against the Hollywood power structure, Kanye they lied to us speech.  These people have a way of getting their folks back into line.

            So many roads and all lead back to this sick world! Could it have been Weinsteins accusers finally having enough clout to be heard (say a certain intern?!) Was it a certain life insurance policy that made the hard time pillowy soft for a certain "dick"?  Did it land in the hands of law enforcement from a certain heeb turned pilot and blackmailing extraordinaire? Was it even so far back on a certain laptop that ended up in the bottom of a river in PA only to resurface later proving perhaps that dead men indeed DO TELL TALES? Well we can all hope and pray that one of these many senarios could be the one as looking back there were many missed (albeit probibly intentional!) opportunities to let the truth come to light.

            Rowan Farrow said he spent 10 months working on the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NY Times spent months working on their story.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what was happening back then that might have inspired this.  Two media giants were forced out at Fox News.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jul 21, 2016
Embattled Fox News CEO Roger Ailes resigned from the network Thursday in the wake of sexual harassment accusations by former anchor Gretchen Carlson and other female employees.
21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch will become the Chairman and acting CEO of Fox News and Fox Business Network in the wake of Ailes' departure.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            A few months later in April of this year.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Bill O’Reilly Is Forced Out at Fox News
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. O’Reilly forged an often controversial on-air persona over his two-decade career at Fox. He was forced out on Wednesday in the wake of several sexual harassment allegations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bill O’Reilly’s reign as the top-rated host in cable news came to an abrupt and embarrassing end on Wednesday as Fox News forced him out after the disclosure of a series of sexual harassment allegations against him and an internal investigation that turned up even more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. O’Reilly and his employers came under intense pressure after an article by The New York Times on April 1 revealed how Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, had repeatedly stood by him even as he and the company reached settlements with five women who had complained about sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior by him. The agreements totaled about $13 million.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            NY Magazine tried to do the Weinstein story in 2015, but couldn't nail it down because they didn't have people going on the record.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the NY Times authors said after the Times made a big splash with the O'Reilly story and some stories on harassment in Silicon Valley, they recognized this is not confined to one industry and decide to do a push for these stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be interesting to see what put Farrow on the story, but my bet is that when women saw Ailes go down, they realized a true media titan could be taken out and started talking amongst themselves and strategizing about how to make this happen.  Farrow and the Times had different parts of the same story.  Most of the women who talked to the Times did not talk to the New Yorker.  By going to different outlets, they increased the impact of the story.

            I think there is an cabal in Hollywood- obviously. But the multitude of players are pawns to the cabal and maybe they do want to speak out and this gives many the opportunity to do so. When one of theirs is wounded they consume him.

             When Narcissists turn on each other its spectacular. Previously they will exchange Narcissistic Supply (attention, accolades etc, even shared victimization) but when things start to breakdown it gets explosive.

             Wow... that shit is deep. Well said. That is exactly what happens. Aside from the broken up networks/rings/larger scale investigations that have come to light over decades, all of the individual cases that we've seen could all be sacrificial lambs. Or, goats in these cases:

             <li>
              Hastert, but not his cohorts?

              Weinstein... he may be the straw that breaks the camel's back... because EVERYONE knew, and they're all admitting it... INCLUDING the mainstream media itself:

             It sounds like the former victims realize it is now time to come out... time to strike. Now. Bring the evidence, bring the stories, bring the details, fuck this shit, end it. We have your backs.

             Hmmmm... that would be one hell of a "life insurance" policy... along with the politicians, international leaders, diplomats, high level NGO, etc...
            </p>
            <p>
             But so far we've heard nothing re: the apparent CPP files being hacked/DL'ed/provided to LE... we've heard nothing about Weiner's faptop... we've heard nothing re: any of the data dumps/acquisitions to-date. All rumor for all we know. All hearsay and online chatter.
            </p>
            <p>
             My hope? These early reports of the CPP Server/Weiner Faptop™ were 100% legit and it has all been heavily secured/researched/investigated and linked not only to Hollywood, and PG related leads, but all the way out to the data transfers being looked into the Awan/DNC/Spy Ring case.
            </p>
            <p>
             That would be the apex. The entire network. Gone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine the look on anyone's face you've ever attempted to quietly explain this to on the morning that CNN reports this.

              I agree. And every media outlet is going have some explaining to do soon,  its plastered all over there social media tonight.  I almost forgot Alefantis is a producer to. Either way whoever is guilty will recieve their fate eventually, the truth always wins.

            Might be because they got SERVED 535 legal documents in every district in the country that WeThePeople have them cornered and if they delete, destroy, lie about anything they are not only accomplices but accessery after the fact..
