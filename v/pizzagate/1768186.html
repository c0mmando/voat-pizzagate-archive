<p>The link between genetic engineering and child abuse isn\'t easy to show, but I do my best using three different points of view: A possible motive (follow the money), a peculiar decoration and John\'s own interest in the topic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Organ harvesting is valuable business, child abuse in the level of billionaires would not leave that out. One of the valuable organs is baby tissue, steam cells that can be used to produce any tissue. Via genetic engineering (see Podesta\'s interest) and using still unborn children (see Dr.Phil\'s interview on a victim who claims she was given to the system right after birth) the pedos are reaching towards two possible goals: Children with desired looks, skin color etc, and the most valuable organs for their business. Currently I\'m studying this on a level of motivation only. I\'ve started from:</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For me the possible motive is the most important lead. A simple question in mind: If I\'d be a billionaire pedo, how would I benefit the most both sexually and financially? How would I get a child the most easiest and safest way with all the characteristics I prefer? I\'d tune the baby before birth. I\'d handpick the mother and the foster parent, most likely persons already under my thumb. Before or after abuse I\'d sell the organs and stem cells.</p>
<p>For those who think I\'m reaching: Human trafficking is the 3rd most profitable form of crime globally including labor, prostitution and organ trade. Why not genetic engineering too. The need in labor is for strong children. The need in prostitution is for beautiful children. The need in harvesting is for healthy tissue and stem cells. Engineering enables these, it should not be left out of our investigations.</p>',

            Wow. I read how they would keep babies alive after late term abortions so they could take their organs. That KILLS me. I'm sure they don't even give the baby anything for pain before they cut into the body. They feel pain after 20 weeks. Maybe sooner! It takes a special kind of sick breed to be a doctor or nurse that can do such a horrible thing. No amount of money is worth hurting babies. How could they go home to their families after performing these procedures? How do they sleep at night? It's so hard for my brain to process this.

            Donald Marshall claims to be a former illuminati insider. He talks about cloning and microchipheads and also how queen Elisabeth II was found guilty in a missing children's case in 2013. 
I have no idea how legit this information is, I haven't had enough time to read all of this yet, but maybe someone will find it interesting.

             "On February 25, 2013 six international judges found Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Phillip, guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic-run Kamloops Residential School in British Columbia. The children left for a picnic with the Royal couple on Oct. 10, 1964, and their grieving parents haven't seen them since.
            </p>
            <p>
             The order to arrest the Queen was issued by the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels, after nearly a year of litigation. This prosecution concerned 50,000 missing native Canadian children and included a 1964 kidnapping case that implicated the Queen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The four month long trial found Pope Joseph Ratzinger, Queen Elizabeth and forty other global elites guilty of crimes against humanity. The guilty verdict may have even influenced the surprising resignation of the Pope, which was announced later that same week."

             That is BS.  The Queen is Sovereign.

            I think you are on the right track.This is the cognitive jump people have to make. These people pick children for many reasons and I believe it will be proven grow their own children for specific parts.
