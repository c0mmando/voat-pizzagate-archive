<p>Did Kate Spade kill herself because of things she knew Andy Spade was doing? Was she killed by Spade et al because she found out of his weirdo ass? Look at these pictures.

            With all her ''globalism'' and ''charitable children's work'' in Haiti, I wouldn't feel overly sympathetic about Kate just yet. I don't want to trash her, but she could very well have been aware of what was going on. Did you read entylawyer's take on Bourdain's death? Evidently, it was supposed to be a murder/suicide, so people are being told who goes/who stays/and who wears disguises.

            Asia Speaks Out about Anthony's Death
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not sure what Spade's husband is trying to convey with the mask.  Is he speaking out too?  They may have had their differences but possibly he is trying to give a clue about her death.  We have to keep open minds.  Mouse Cartoon Character.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as Bourdain was speaking out maybe Andy is speaking out as well.  Yes, he has been acting like a Kook but we only know what we get from opinions.  I really don't believe he was in that apt.  He has been reported as living in his own apt. so did he just drop by to pick things up?  Idk.  This death as all the others always leave so many unanswered questions.   All we can do is speculate.

             If she sings, we might not hear about that for a while and it would be best to concentrate on other leads. If she is in on it, then all eyes are on her. Either way, the heat is on. This flame is hot, and we do not have to keep it lit anymore. Time to start another fire.

            This has been puzzling me... I could make the argument that maybe he wore the mask for privacy reason and he just grabbed it out of his daughters room or something and the creepiness is just an unfortunate coincidence... but... why wear a mask? He could have just put his hand in front of his face, (maybe not a scarf though? Insensitive maybe?), or looked away or whatever.. but he chose to cover his face in a way to make sure no one got a picture... so. Was it him? Was it David trying to help distract making people think it was him? Or someone else pretending to be him? Or was he covering up a facial wound of some type? Scratches maybe?

             Spade was wearing a mask of Bernard from the 1977 Disney movie The Rescuers. The plot of the movie involves retrieving the “Devil’s Eye” – the world’s largest diamond – from a place called the Devil’s Bayou. This is all rather appropriate considering the occult context of the suicide (read my article about Kate Spade’s death here).

              3D printing. Easy to do, but the machine costs a lot of money. I doubt any were ever made, even for Halloween in 1977. If they were, then that would be something only a very small group of collectors would fancy, now wouldn't It? This is a sign for the others to keep their mouths shut.

                Everything is laser scanned now. Better cabinet and countertop fabricators just come in with a digital camera and take pictures from all angles. They then feed those pics into a computer program that takes it to the laser guided wetsaw or hydro- jet. Similar with molds.They can take a milled or hand made object, laser scan it, and create the mold shape with the program. What used to take months of hard work is done in minutes or hours. Not everyone has access to these devices though, and that limits where he could have got the mask. It could be a really old Halloween mask for kids, but who would save that? Plastic items don't hold up so well after that many years.
