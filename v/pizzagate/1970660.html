            Is this the place that we were investigating about because Hillary was making a speech in Philly and I think someone connected with this place or she was making a statement about children locked up?  Some how something is ringing a bell, but it is kind of fuzzy.  Does anyone remember?  There are just so many investigations on here......

             These are not "investigations."  Investigations are what LE does with warrants, etc.  We don't have any subpoena power here.

             What is done here is armchair research intermixed with a few good souls who actually have their boots on the ground.

            Highlights
An attorney representing three victims of Isaac Outten, a counselor who was charged in December with sexually assaulting three girls, said the bankruptcy and acquisition could be a good thing if it allows Wordsworth to continue its work serving children.

            That West Philadelphia facility is where David Hess, 17, of Lebanon, Pa., died last Oct. 13 in a fight over an iPod. Hess’ death by suffocation was ruled a homicide in February, but charges have not been filed. His death capped a decade of allegations and charges of sexual and physical abuse at what was the city’s only residential treatment center for troubled youth, as chronicled by the Inquirer and Daily News in April.

            Public Health Management Corp. has agreed to acquire Wordsworth Academy Inc. – which operated a residential treatment facility where a teenager died last fall in a struggle with staffers – in a deal that will send the Philadelphia human-services agency through bankruptcy court, the two nonprofits announced Friday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Public Health Management Corp. (PHMC), based in Philadelphia, had already taken over the management of Wordsworth’s remaining programs under a contract that started Monday. Those programs include a school in Fort Washington, community behavioral-health services, and two community umbrella agencies that provide services for families and children in parts of West and Northwest Philadelphia under license from the city’s Department of Human Services.
