<p>There are a few reasons this story is especially important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Panama Papers and the Podesta Emails both provide independent, primary source, direct evidence that this story is true and worse than originally stated. You can see it for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treason is happening at the top levels of our government, where our politicians and lobbyists are willing to sell out American assets for pennies on the dollar and surprising number of them are all in on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media is representing all of this as no big deal, while shamelessly trying to sell a war between Russia and the US over fake news about hacking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It lends credibility to the idea that these people, in this social circle, are capable of running a vast, sophisticated criminal enterprise that talks in code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are able to trace the web of money launderers all in bed together through primary sources starting with these breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>Because their attention is being diverted to conflicts manufactured by the media. Everyone has forgotten about convicted felon, Bob Creamer, and massive election fraud proven by O’Keefe’s hidden cameras. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/R6F6cw.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/R6F6cw.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is all just the tip of the iceberg. It is important to note the pattern of scandals, how many there are and how widespread they are. That is why, when it becomes apparent that this social circle is also riddled with pedophiles, <a href="https://sli.mg/ddFwzS.jpg">https://sli.mg/ddFwzS.jpg</a>, people start to wonder about Pizzagate and if the Clintons are connected to any of the pedophile rings out of Chicago, Dallas, Franklin and Washington D.C. </p>
<p>J&amp;T Packing (John and Tony?) has virtually the same board of directors as the Clinton Foundation and has been operating out of an empty lot since 1994. The Clinton Foundation seems to be the epicenter of the new organized crime that has successfully infiltrated our government. The US has become a mafia state, run by criminals where law enforcement and the media are focused on eliminating competition.</p>
<h1>The Media is Involved</h1>
<p>Wikileaks made it clear how much collusion was occurring between Hillary and the media. <a href="https://sli.mg/8oS6mv.jpg">https://sli.mg/8oS6mv.jpg</a></p>
<p>Hillary was ‘astroturfing’ the Internet. <a href="https://archive.is/a01ce">https://archive.is/a01ce</a> <a href="https://archive.is/COvjL">https://archive.is/COvjL</a> </p>
<p>We no longer have to wonder what the new version of Operation Mockingbird looks like. JIDF. Correct the Record. Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. They explicitly instruct the media to represent issues a certain way, then have their Internet astroturfers give illegitimate exposure to bogus ideas. It is a system of “mass persuasion” that is a lot more sophisticated than people are willing to give it credit for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easier to fool people than to convince them they’ve been fooled. - Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that every conflict you are presented on the news is controlled on both sides in order to follow a script and keep you distracted from the criminals who are negatively impacting your lives and your children’s lives because they are traitors.</p>
<p>If Pizzagate was totally fake, then there would be no need to spend the amount of time and money being wielded against “fake news” the likes of which may have never been seen. Pizzagate has drawn the attention of all kinds of paid Internet shills. All day, everyday, they are trying to derail the narrative that reveals the wider web of slime and corruption.</p>
<p>Even the US Government has people who are specifically on the Internet trying to steer all of this conversation away from the President, himself, who has been to Comet Ping Pong, who is central to the Fisker/Gore/Obama Scandal and who was, seemingly, born in Kenya, if you check every news article before he ran for President.</p>
<p>It all ties together. It is all organized crime. The Clinton Foundation is the epicenter of political corruption and the media is trying very hard to keep you from recognizing that basic, provable fact.</p>
<p>If we are to believe the Washington Post and the New York Times, treason and other crimes have occurred on a massive scale. Why is it so hard to believe that human trafficking would be any different? Why would we expect anything else, when they are surrounded by known and convicted pedophiles and human traffickers?</p>
<p>The truth is that this all starts and ends with mining.</p>

<p>Frank Giustra is involved in mining companies.</p>
<p>Marc Rich, who was pardoned by Clinton, was also involved in mining with Glencore. <a href="https://archive.is/qgvD8">https://archive.is/qgvD8</a> </p>
<p>Hillary’s brother ended up on the board of VCS Mining.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is inevitable around mining companies. Whoever is managing these companies is also managing the networks that provide them with the slaves they need.</p>',

           This is all just the tip of the iceberg. It is important to note the pattern of scandals, how many there are and how widespread they are. That is why, when it becomes apparent that this social circle is also riddled with pedophiles,

           , people start to wonder about Pizzagate and if the Clintons are connected to any of the pedophile rings out of Chicago, Dallas, Franklin and Washington D.C.
          </p>
          <p>
           J&amp;T Packing (John and Tony?) has virtually the same board of directors as the Clinton Foundation and has been operating out of an empty lot since 1994. The Clinton Foundation seems to be the epicenter of the new organized crime that has successfully infiltrated our government. The US has become a mafia state, run by criminals where law enforcement and the media are focused on eliminating competition.

           We no longer have to wonder what the new version of Operation Mockingbird looks like. JIDF. Correct the Record. Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. They explicitly instruct the media to represent issues a certain way, then have their Internet astroturfers give illegitimate exposure to bogus ideas. It is a system of “mass persuasion” that is a lot more sophisticated than people are willing to give it credit for.

           It is possible that every conflict you are presented on the news is controlled on both sides in order to follow a script and keep you distracted from the criminals who are negatively impacting your lives and your children’s lives because they are traitors.

          <p>
           If Pizzagate was totally fake, then there would be no need to spend the amount of time and money being wielded against “fake news” the likes of which may have never been seen. Pizzagate has drawn the attention of all kinds of paid Internet shills. All day, everyday, they are trying to derail the narrative that reveals the wider web of slime and corruption.

           Even the US Government has people who are specifically on the Internet trying to steer all of this conversation away from the President, himself, who has been to Comet Ping Pong, who is central to the Fisker/Gore/Obama Scandal and who was, seemingly, born in Kenya, if you check every news article before he ran for President.
          </p>
          <p>
           It all ties together. It is all organized crime. The Clinton Foundation is the epicenter of political corruption and the media is trying very hard to keep you from recognizing that basic, provable fact.

           If we are to believe the Washington Post and the New York Times, treason and other crimes have occurred on a massive scale. Why is it so hard to believe that human trafficking would be any different? Why would we expect anything else, when they are surrounded by known and convicted pedophiles and human traffickers?

           The truth is that this all starts and ends with mining.

            In the street view, Research Dr. is conveniently absent, but from what I can see from Grand River Ave. there's a building there in the latest snapshot (November 2016), but not in the previous one (July 2015). They claimed to have moved in May 2016, so it's probably a new building that wasn't there when they took the close-up aerial shot.

            Yes and it's super important that you go down that rabbit hole so you understand the significance of it. Give yourself 30 minutes at least.  Pay attention to the Hawaii connection. And then search for that and read the original post about Hawaii and the Wi-Fi and Flintstone.

            Do you think it would be effective flood news channels with tips/emails about this stuff?  Lay it out for them.  Maybe if enough journalists see these dots and how they connect, they will at least report on the money laundering and treason issues.  Once that's accomplished, it may be easier for the public to fully grasp the evil depravity of these people and how they have been preying upon children

            Monica Petersen was looking into the Haiti mining of Hilary's brother being used for trafficking from the garment factory.  Monica is dead now, as we all know.  How more Americans aren't in a huge uproar is quite disturbing.  Washington and the media have dumbed down the people.  and sadly it seems that half of the people are too far gone to ever think for themselves again. Meanwhile children are being raped and murdered and we are being silenced

            It pisses me off that this whole time they have said Russia and Trump were connected somehow and it was them! I didn't know the biggest Russian bank uses the Podesta lobbying firm. This to me is huge. With the the sale of our uranium to Russia, that most people know about already, and the Podesta brothers being Russia's lobbyist should have been all over the news when Hillary was running for president. I wonder why the Republican Party didn't use that against her.
           </p>
           <p>
            On another note, it's weird to me how some of the MSM networks that just kisses Hillary's but, like NYT, stand up for her and lie for her and then you get articles that just destroy her from the same network.

             I think the coverage you are referring to shows that there are either still factions within the media or they maintain a moving target. Truth be told, they still pulled some punches. That way, when Media Matters chimes in, the whole thing appears to be debunked, at first glance, and most people won't bother to look much further than a couple of news articles.

             Yes.  I've noticed that with all of their shady companies, they use the acronym as well as full name as well as an acronym similar but off by one letter.  It's weird

             <p>
              Edit: I'm responding to your comment 4 days late, So I forgot the comments that came before you, were referencing my  referencing my JandT packing post.... Now THAT information, I can say I'm 100% certain about. I'm certain it's connected, and I'm certain is very fucking important....
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, I've thought to be 100% certain about things in the past (Not pedogate related) and have ended up being dead wrong.... But considering the accusations are toward 10 of this countries/worlds most evil cunts, fuck em. It's not like it's introducing new people that are potentially completely innocent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if J &amp;T packing isn't relevant (It is) we know the people involved are guilty as fuck in a hundred different ways.  So It'snot like someone innocent is going to be harassed.
             </p>
             <h1>
              But again, I think it 100% relevant, and huge.
             </h1>
             <p>
              I brought you some facts.  Some facts, and the circumstances around them.  I'm still not sure one way or the other, as to how relevant it is to pedogate.  I felt it was at the time, but I Haven't seen anyone do any follow up... So I dunno. Maybe they're smart and simply aren't sharing their findings publicly yet.  Or maybe they found something that dissolves all the suspicion that I had.
             </p>
             <p>
              If that were the case, I wish they would tell me... The last thing I want to do is point the finger at someone innocent( At least innocent as far as pizzagate)  I mean, I can say with 99% certainty that fire was not accidental.  That being said,  It could have been simple insurance fraud... But based on all of the sketch circumstances, one could reasonably assume it might be connected.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, if it was just insurance fraud... Then that's on them for choosing to burn the fucker hours after the election was called.  They should have known how that would be perceived.  I.E SKETCH AS FUCK.
             </p>
             <p>
              The timing was sketch as fuck, In addition to burning cars, boats, and "possibly planes".  In addition to all the false reporting and statements by the officals.  In addition to the owner of the building, sharing addresses with clinton foundation in 6 states. In addition to alefantis growing up there.(
              <em>
               I don't know if he grew up in lackawana specifically. But his parents had a cabin, on a lake, just outside buffalo. Beth steel location is on lake, just outside buffalo.
              </em>
              )
             </p>
             <p>
              To be honest, I haven't done much follow up on anything in those posts.  I was sitting on that information for awhile, but I didn't know what to do with it... Eventually someone else made a post about steel and mining, so I figured that'd be the best time for me post it, since the owner of the building has multiple companies ranging from mining, pipelines, steel, construction, and more. OH YEAH. DEMOLITION! And the demolition surrounding the fire was sketch as fuck as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              I didn't even want to deal with that shit anymore.  I have too many other leads that I know,  are connected to PedoGATe, FO SHO. 100% connected, no question.  Where as I can't say that about the posts we're talking about... But I felt there was enough suspicion surrounding those facts, to warrant more investigation... which I hope others have done.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if I was 80%  certain that all of that info, is NOT related to pizzagate... I would still have posted it.   The implications, if true, are extremely dire. (
              <em>
               Destroying an entire fucking building to cover your tractions?That's huge
              </em>
              ) So much so that it'd be irresponsible for me to not share it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Disclaimer: I'm just giving an example, if I had to gauge my certainty I would say 55% certain that it's related, so I think the chances of being related, are greater than not being related... Which is the least certain I've been about any of my research.  We were very spoiled in the beginning, There was so much that is just out in the open.  Just blatant as fuck.  It's like we didn't even have to do anything... Just keep following the evidence, which seemed to always lead to more.  I mean, there's still a lot information being found easily... I'm just saying, We can't dismiss things, just because it's not as obviously incriminating, as a lot of the information provided, thus far.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which was where a lot of the flak I received, came from.  People were asking my to make accusations, and provide concrete evidence... Like what the fuck? Did they think that's how research/investigation works?  Unless you can say with 100% certainty that it's connected, then don't say anything?  I mean, I guess you can't really blame them, for the reasons mentioned above.(we were spoiled in the beginning)

               I went back and looked for this thread because I think it is extremely important. Regardless it is and was huge news a giant facility burning to the ground hours after the election and I didn't even hear about it. Just on that note alone. I can't unfortunately follow up on anything right now. I  I actually try to figure out how to sticky this or make it more front and center. For fuck sake people are getting distracted with dumb things in my opinion. It annoys me that people refer to the kill room as the kill room. We haven't verified any killing went on in this room. For right now it is a fucking freezer. But we know who built it where it is  and the types of photos and comments culture that they find "entertaining and humorous."

                How do you feel about, the torture chamber email as well? I feel like that's dead too... Like, If you're talking about torture rooms legitimately, Whats the  point of using code for kid fucking? I dunno. There's so much information. Almost too much. Too many examples of things that seemed like nothing, that are now vital aspects... Too many things that seemed damning as hell, that are now nothing.
               </p>
               <p>
                As far as the killroom, I do not know what to make of it... I agree, we have no reason to believe any killing occurred, and my common sense tells me that if it were to actual be used for killing... YOU DON'T FUCKING LABEL IT THE KILL ROOM ON YOUR PUBLIC INSTAGRAM.  The building where the killroom is located, Is sketch as fuck though. With sketch as fuck circumstances, For example, the bulding permits they applied for, then quickly canceled... The fact that it's a random building in an ally, with no street access, by a fucking park, where street view shows a creepy guy on a roof looking at the kids, Fucking James Adding the building on google maps as a museum, and how now removed it.
               </p>
               <p>
                But my common sense of today, is not that of a year ago. Now my common sense tell mes, "You have no fucking clue what common sense is".  Lol. I mean,  based on all we've seen, I really don't know what common sense means anymore.   But yeah, there are so many other aspects, unrelated to Instagram at all, or even the emails, that in my opinion are more damning... But I think by the end of this, we'll be surprised to learn what was the most damning aspects of this. Fuck, it could be something inconspicuous that we've all seen 100 times, but it won't make sense till later.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kinda like... This whole research project. lol. Like This shit has just always been here? Shit be Cray cray.
               </p>
               <p>
                Stay healthy buddy. This shit is draining as it gets.... Well not really, I'm sure it'll get way worse... But you know what I mean lol.

            I posted this below, but it got buried.  Yesterday there was a thread mentioning June 21 and Dec 22 as important occult dates...so I searched the Podesta emails and found a curious one that is now kinda creepy considering J&amp;T Packing.....A UPS package from Tony Podesta to John Podesta on December 22, 2015 .....description of the package "tipsy elves"

            Posts like this are what keep me in awe of this forum and the people who contribute. This takes an incredible amount of time and organization and I appreciate the sacrifice of time and energy that goes into the research involved, particularly by individuals who aren't paid as journalists to do so.

            Thanks for placing a magnifying glass on this theme of corruption and the high crimes that they commit  - which are obviously indictable. This Thread should be placed on the pizzagate sub-wiki.

            Be careful about one of the documents that you listed regarding the Podestas having so many pedophile friends. I noticed Ashkok Mahbubani was cited as being convicted of drug trafficking. In another thread, this was discussed, but someone pointed out that the person convicted was actually a Filipino with the same name. The hearing was in a Federal district in FL, and the court transcript showed that this Mahbubani identified himself as being from the Philippines.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will search for the thread with the citations, otherwise your post is great.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I did notice, when researching the EKTA foundation, which the Mahbubani's run, there was a symbol of a small hand within a larger hand at the bottom of their website.

            To present it all in such a way that communicates it all to be fantastical?
           </p>
           <p>
            I do feel that there is an 'in your face, under your nose' aspect to a lot of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Especially when you can find news articles that basically spell out what is going on. Wild assumptions aside, Pizzagate does follow a path from person to person in such a way that seems to corroborate the notion that, at the very least, a nest of money launderers have been uncovered. I've heard drugs, guns, pedophilia... but the point is the code is a code that exists in several different lines of communication, the Podesta gmail account likely being the least of it, given James Alefantis' Instagram.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe to warn people? Maybe it is part of the ritual to advertise it? Confirmation bias; now you just see it everywhere?
           </p>
           <p>
            I suppose there are a lot of explanations. In a world where real news can get you killed, maybe presenting political criticism has a logical home in 'science fiction' stories, to avoid censorship, and there is more value to them than just a couple of hours of entertainment. Brave New World. 1984. Animal Farm. Anthem. Slaughterhouse Five. West World.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have certainly been warned.

            Everything is going to be okay if you would take a minute to peruse the real news articles in the post. That way, you can know what I am saying is true, where you will finally reach a relaxed state and start to do the right thing. Good luck.

            Saville reality in jersey island.
           </p>
           <p>
            The corps and npos involved in the Hersey island orphan school of mass bodies found, and saville was there in pictures, but he lied about it!! Look up how the building is tan by this odd board, and instead of creepy place torn down, they selectively rent to various Biz throughout years, related to corporations, non profits, sport groups that they are affiliated with!
           </p>
           <p>
            Has been a hostel, sport athlete center, vacation place and vacation bookings, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saville reality is the huge, luxury real estate in jersey island.Various homes are application only, to see or even know the price. Same female realtor. Saville is also
           </p>
           <p>
            in UK realty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jersey island does not register pedophiles to certain laws!
Both jersey and guerve island do not tax corporations. Both islands are near each other and are corporate tax havens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Florida FBI even opened a case on one of the providence corp subsidiaries, under same name providence. Its the investor end, and shell corps traced to Brazil and guerne island!
           </p>
           <p>
            Also a mafia guy in.providence, arrested from body found in warehouse in Rhode island, connects.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb also connects long island serial.murdered to all of this and prince/dignitary sex orgies in NYC. Not sure if ones know, but many in NYC do. They come, at least yearly, rent entire floors of hotels for these orgie parties. Many DJs, producers ate invited, as many prince/ dignitaries and their fans/ friends, ant to make their own music albums, like Paris Hilton did. These producers are white, black, Israeli and more, and travel to Germany a lot, and Belgium, and s Africa, the havens for these producers that cater to the elitescabs crowds.
           </p>
           <p>
            One, is the son of the sister of Susanne somers. That is, there are "jobs for ones in lower elite that are connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, article on how Jenna bush went to south american country under a Npo front, but was really there to initiate a bush signing of huge piece real estate by a factory and by a huge property owned by a huge Chinese firm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Public " forgot about bush daughters, after convenient party news. Paris Hilton is a DJ, going to Dif countries. Clinton foundation creates hotel contracts all over areas they destabilize. The Marriott will be second one in Haiti that is planned, and on their cf website.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is,you can find more UK connections through hotels and satanic churches, industries being built.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hence, why the one female killed in Haiti, was going to the Clinton foundation industrial park! A Chinese clothing factory is their already, coffee and fish corps, spread out. Pics on Clinton foundation website, show more elite scavs, EVEN the senator guy arrested for pedo when football coach is on website pic with bill ! Look at factory pic with Clinton's and bigwigs and factory workers. A lot of factory workers, do not look happy. Notice its all dirty slave job industries for the poor and ones who lost homes and jobs from the quakes, war zones, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ones do not realize, but from Bosnia and all areas destabilized, not all displaced are non educated. Many have degrees in various fields, even medical. They cannot practice when displaced from.country they are licensed with.

            It's the first time I see anything about J&amp;T Packing and I'm assuming it's because the original post about the company was deleted before I or others ever set eyes on it.   Since there's been a myriad of issues with extremely relevant posts/research being deleted by shills perhaps a group of researchers in this forum should be gathering, downloading them and storing them all in one safe place.

             Yes, someones are erasing posts. Someone's even hacked my pm. Have not even had are back from vout, with multiple posts AND emails to them. It violates their terms of use and privacy to hack ones account property, ( besides legal law).

             Notice there are low IQ type shulls, of this is false, to ones that act like investigating, then do posts like the ONE you see on this subverse by SOMEONE bashing the work of the subverse maker. Lookity look!!!

             Also, if share posts on Illuminati initians that are all over Fb, Fb locks account and requires proof of Id to get on. Trying to track, identify people! The id needed To use internet, is starting with Fb. Wynne owns part of Fb, invests.

            Random thought...Could access to a Boys Club and big high school drama class reduce the need to have a pizza franchise? Maybe that's why you switch it to a gold (mining/money laundry) selling business instead? I'm just clueless

            Indeed, lots of suspicious info there (and other places), about Esther Rantzen. Allegedly she's the head of a coven.

            And yes, Coleman has been worryingly MIA. He / they disappeared for a few months last year and came back with a post saying they'd been working deep within enemy lines in extremely dangerous territory, and we're about to reveal all.  That he's now gone dark again is very strange....

             That's the problem - no one cares.  The media doesn't care and law enforcement doesn't care.  There's so many questions but no one is asking them.  Take Megan Kelly for example.  She didn't ask any questions.  It was all poor James.  Think of all the great questions that could be asked.

            Very true.  I am a huge Gold Rush: Alaska (TV show) fan, and they tried a spin off called Jungle Gold, where 2 Americans went to Africa to try and mine gold.  Surprisingly, heavily armed Chinese companies are basically stealing gold in Africa.   The show only lasted 2 seasons because these guys were going to get killed if they kept trying to mine.

              Great question and I wondered the same thing myself....gold or oil would be my guess.   Oil more likely IMO because of the pipeline stuff George Webb is talking about (need to watch his Youtube if you aren't already).  Plus gold seems to usually be more prominent in rivers and streams in proximity to mountains, however; there were some impressive gold finds in the Western US plains back in the day.

            Frank Giustra is extra shady...Has a plane that takes Bill Clinton around WAY more than Jeff Epstein did, He also owned Lionsgate Film at one time and TONS of mining currently....VERY attached to a Vancouver Troubled Teen Boys Club type thing where he's really tied to an actor named Jimmy Crescenzo who teaches some type of drama class in a Vancouver school. Extra nice program super well funded (Giustra and friends) and tons of awards for Jimmy and an odd video called "The Secret of Boys Club" among others done by the students....

            Good work.  Another outrage that you may consider adding to your work, is the HRC State Dept meddling in Haiti's elections to install someone that would look the other way on the Clinton Foundation corruption.  Foreign gov't hacking elections is bad as long as it's the Russians (it's not the Russians).

            To be honest, I did not pay that much attention to those emails as they were coming out and did not realize the significance until George Webb spelled it out in one of his recent videos.

             Some leads. Boystown is all over USA, India world. 12 locations now, include Florida, Texas, near new mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein new mexico ranch is near the Boystown in new mexico!
            </p>
            <p>
             Retsch tissue and bone, donor center ( under a Dif name but on retsch website PDF file and I wrote it in another comment on Dif subverse, recently).
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, book, Let Haiti live, how us policies are destroying us oldest neighbor, by two Haitian victims. Boystown and much more is mentioned a lot. Boystown in south Florida is one of first routing spots for young boys. A DENTIST is used to check teeth of boys that look almost 18. If not a minor, male routed to krone and broward high security prison as deportees.
            </p>
            <p>
             Might find connections to Epstein with any of these leads, even dentist, court lawters . Another dentist in fl providence as arrested for sex abuse, kill kids. In news in last couple of years.
            </p>
            <p>
             The owner of the providence stock sale subsidiary in Florida, lives in west palm by Epstein. The main providence corp has the Obamacare contract for fed non emergency transport, Logisticare corp for eight years, and Obama just rewarded four more years contract to this shady fed violating corp. Oig reports of Logisticare in Nj and wisconsin and mass beneficiary complaints of gross fed violations, deaths, conditions worsen is ignored by Oig and dop.
            </p>
            <p>
             The providence that runs logisticare, also owns igneus corp. Important to look up that company. Board director on that providence, ALSO lives by Epstein in fl.
            </p>
            <p>
             Provide nice fl is on FBI investigation in Florida, shell corp, investment fraud, shell corps to Brazil and over corp no tax friendly island, guernes ..right by jersey island ..pedo/saville/queenE.
            </p>
            <p>
             Boystown sells IRA gold/ silver, and coins.
            </p>
            <p>
             Boystown uses group homes now, sponsor fans and two research hospitals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein, right by boystown in fl and new mexico homes! His attorney also might have connection to any above, as clients, stock.investments. Tracing the boystown gold silver IRA and coins to the firms that hold sticks and sells, might connect Epstein or his attorney.
            </p>
            <p>
             Attorney teaches at Harvard, runs dept. Harvard school f public health, shows mass resesrchnon dire affects of poverty, substandard medicine. Research is paid by govt, Univ donors, npos etc!/ If you call any researcher on staff, you would think they care of lives, but boy do not. I contacted them and that attorney before about some serious cases. Rude mofos, a social justice front, look me all of them.

             </p>
             <p>
              . Greenberg and Steinberg fams are very behind scenes like Wynne, but parallel to Rockefeller's in long histories. In israel to behind scene in Hollywood, NYC, Chicago, many corporations, esp financial.
             </p>
             <p>

               I tried searching up Epstein's family before, couldnt ever find anything on either of his parents- and on a semi-related note, on Robert Maxwell's Wikipedia page, there is no mention of Ghislaine Maxwell when it mentions his children. Just thought those two coincidences were a bit odd

            By the way, Uranium prices have really fallen so they probably overpaid for the deal.  Uranium is cheap and easily acquired. There's a global market for it.  The US faces no issues with its uranium stocks or supplies.

            You talk about crimes, but I see no evidence for the claims.  The sale of Uranium One involved no crimes and multiple federal agencies confirmed it posed no threat to US security.  You are using this for your claim of treason?

            Joule is an American company.  It is not controlled by Moscow or by Russian investors. And not a single word of that email concerns bribes.

            You seem to alleging lobbying crimes, but it's not clear at all the specifics.  The Panama Papers didn't reveal any crimes on behalf of the Podesta Group. Sberbank only became their client this year and they are publically registered as a lobbyist for Sberbank.  See here

                   Are you saying that the Clinton Foundation covering Chelsea's personal expenses do not fall into that category?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Clinton Foundation donations are donations to themselves... at least 85%. They give to their own charities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Charity Navigator does not consider the Clinton Foundation to be a charity, at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Charles Ortel, the investigator who uncovered the financial discrepancies at General Motors before its stock crashed, says the Clinton Foundation is “the largest unprosecuted charity fraud ever.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   $10 billion in aid funds were taken in the Haiti earthquake and at the Clinton's discretion to give out.  Can you tell me were that money went? Haitian reporters called Clinton disaster fund-raising “predatory humanitarianism.”

                     Why hasn’t Charity Navigator published a rating of the Clinton Foundation for the last few years?.................
For each charity, our rating system evaluates numerous financial and accounting metrics, including a comparison of how these metrics change from one year to the next.  In 2013, the Clinton Foundation merged with one of its affiliates, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). This merger made it difficult to compare financial information of the combined entities with financial information from the Clinton Foundation before the merger.  In situations like this with any charity, we will reevaluate if the charity provides consolidated financial data that will allow us to perform an accurate year-over-year comparison.

                     The Clinton Foundation never controlled 10 Billion dollars.  False.  That's adding up all reconstruction money from all parties.  And that is what was pledged.  It's unknown how many pledges were unfulfilled.

                     If you want to read the best of account of the failure of Haiti reconstruction which affects not just the Clinton Foundation, but also the Red Cross and UN and others read the book The Big Truck That Went By.  Here's a long form article by that author on what happened, what the Clinton did well and where the they failed.

                   Yeah...I think that was window-dressing. I think she did that 'auditing' stuff and conflict with Doug Band or whatever his name is, so that she and her parents can later claim their underlings were doing the nefarious deals behind their backs and they tried to stop it.

                    This could be true. I'm just wondering though with everything we know from George Webb about Eric Braverman perhaps not knowing and being shielded from the actual activities and the chain of command and maybe that's why he has now disappeared or went underground, or whatever because he figured it out? Could Chelsea have also been kept in the dark in some way?

                     Absolutely. These people are experts at 'plausible deniability' and isolated sleeper-cell tactics. Chelsea has probably been preserved spotless in case she has to run for the presidency to pardon both her parents. Hope those 4chan anons that have gone underground have hacked 'em all and gathered a mountain of incriminating stuff.

             Using your position as SOS to enrich yourself is absolutely 100% illegal.   And if the Clinton Foundation wasn't about buying influence, why has the funding dried up now that HRC is at the back of the bus?

               Yeah right. So for every business transaction they lined up for their buddies. Our govt "civil servants," in exchange for those millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars got them no finders fee? Is that what you would have us believe?

               That's crazy talk.   If you can't see that the Clinton's got rich by using their status, then you aren't really looking, because that is crystal clear and irrefutable.

                   AreWeSure, please look up RICO violations:

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When the ongoing FBI investigation wraps up they'll be using RICO to charge Hillary. And that's bad news because in a RICO case you don't have to show Quid Pro Quo explicitly. All the FBI needs is to show two violations, most likely financial harm to someone(Haitian earthquake victims) and criminal intent (deleting emails, destroying phones etc would show criminal intent. Deleting massive amounts of emails means Hillary knew what she did was a crime).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   She'll also be charged with Money Laundering through IHRC. Please watch Clinton Cash to get a better idea of how badly Hillary screwed over the Haitian people. It's unconscionable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Hillary will also be charged for using the Clinton Foundation to set up a private army to invade Libya. Private citizens can't set up armies and invade other countries. Sorry. I don't make the rules. And actually now that you mention it, there's very strong evidence that Hillary sent Qaddafi's stock of Sarin gas to Syria via Qatar and Turkey. I'm sure you'll be interested in reading the following since by your own admission you want to be sure:

                   Finally to wrap it up, George Webb does a great job laying out what the FBI case will look like. Here he is with the email of Hillary asking Sidney Blumenthal to set up a private army via gmail:

                   <p>
                    Your example of RICO predicate crimes are extremely vague.  Financial Harm?   What crime is financial harm?  Deleting emails is not evidence of criminal intent.  Good Lord, people delete emails all the time.  It can be evidence of intent, but it's not automatically so and in the case of her turning over her emails to the state department, the State Department has confirmed she was well within her rights to delete personal emails.  So deleting massive amounts of emails is zero evidence, I'm afraid.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    She created a private army to invade Libya?  I've read Seymour Hersh's article and I've read all the reasons it falls apart.  Such as the UN report that shows the chemical munitions being launched from Government controlled areas.  We disagree on this strong evidence.

                      Trying to determine truth is not a one for me and one for you kind of thing.    I'll have to look at the warm traffic thread again.  I didn't see that.

                      The Sarin gas at Ghouta contained hexamine.  Only Syria is known to use hexamine in their sarin recipe.  When they gave up their chemical weapons, they declared 80 tons of this stuff as a chemical precursor specifically for Sarin.  It makes sarin more stable and allows for more concentrated/more potent sarin.  Syria had very strong control over it's chemical weapons stocks.  That and the fact that the trajectories of the rockets trace back to government controlled areas leaves very little doubt, Assad's forces launched this Sarin attack.  Speaking of criminal intent, Syria continuing shelling the area for days before letting the chemical weapons inspectors in to inspect the area.

                       Ok AreWeSure that's just about 24 hours and you didn't respond. You didn't address the Porton Down testing. That means you have no interest in objectivity here. That's not good.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       All you have is spin. Remember this gem: "Deleting emails is not evidence of criminal intent".
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Remember my response? No? Here it is again: "You don't use bleach bit to remove emails about yoga and your daughters wedding:
                       <a href="https://www.bleachbit.org/">
                        https://www.bleachbit.org/
                       </a>
                       "
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       BleachBit is clear evidence of criminal intent. Full Stop. End of story. It's not debatable. You know it isn't even close so instead of admitting you were wrong you go to your Safe Space. That's pathetic.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Actually arrogant would be a better word. And arrogance is why you Leftists lost the election. We're talking about killing 1300 innocent men, women and children in cold blood. You don't sweep that shit under the rug. You don't pretend there's no evidence. You don't run to your Safe Space. There's strong evidence innocent PEOPLE DIED A FUCKING HORRIBLE DEATH. You should be ashamed of yourself AreWeSure.

                       "hexamine".....A chemical weapons lab in England tested the Sarin but you don't even mention it. An objective person would address their opponents argument. You ignored the argument and hoped I wouldn't notice. Sorry but you can't do that. You need to explain why the Porton Down testing was invalid.

            I like to listen to Jim Willie's interviews at the goldenjackass.com for his insights into issues related to gold and international banking.
           </p>
           <p>
            For years he has been saying the US government is run by satanists, which finally clicked into place when spirit cooking and pizzagate opened up. His primary expertise is in the role of gold in finance. To see these issues come back together from a separate source adds validity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because he has a prolific log of interviews I don't have a specific example to give at this point, but I am sure he has relevant information. I'll send him a note just to point him to this page.

"giustra site:.incakolanews.blogspot.com". The website owner is rather tempestuous so approach at own risk

            This to me is a really Key piece of the puzzle. Maybe the one that finishes the puzzle. This explains Why its going on in the first place. The pedophilia has always just been a byproduct of the more serious problem going on.

             Yes exactly. The raping of the resources. Through regime change leaves the collateral damage of displaced children women which they can now turn into a commodity. Well to wheel efficiency if you well.

              Pardon my analogy, but this occurred to me earlier today: Nobody gets the real de-value of aluminum because aluminum production is not about aluminum but the by-product of aluminum, Sodium Fluoride, which is poisonous. Therefore, the process is unrecognized for its true value; it is at least twice as valuable as what it is listed as. Value is all perception.

            "Hillary’s brother ended up on the board of VCS Mining."....George Webb has a theory about this and that is the mine given to Hillary's brother is really just a money laundering operation. There's no gold there. It's already been mined and the gold was taken out long ago. The mine exists so Middle Eastern funny money can pass through it and appear on the other side as revenue from gold mining.

             There's a garment factory that monica Petersen was suspicious of.  I think she thought they were trafficking through the garment factory to the mines in Haiti.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  But I think that is what she wrote to her friend about the clintons

              It has just been revealed that she used a private email address run on her own server, during her years at the State Department, and never had a ‘state.gov’ address as required for government official business. She ran all her professional emails through her own Internet domain, ‘clintonemails.com.’ When she left office her emails left with her. That included emails that would have dealt with her response to the Haiti earthquake. The Federal Records Act requires employees of executive branch agencies to keep all of their emails and make all of them available for permanent retention.
             </p>
             <p>
              She was Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013. In December, 2012 Hillary’s brother’s company got the lucrative gold mining contract. During her time in State, the State Department through its USAID disbursed $3.6 billion for Haitian “earthquake relief.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The plot gets uglier. While she was doling out billions in US taxpayer dollars to unspecified projects in Haiti, husband Bill Clinton was serving as UN Special Envoy for Haitian earthquake relief as co-chair with Jean-May Bellerive of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. At the same time, Bill was head of the Clinton Foundation, which claimed to have raised $36 million from “private contributors” for Haiti relief. However, the Clinton Foundation, at the time Hillary was Secretary of State, also accepted money from countries that Hillary Clinton dealt with while Secretary, including the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran, brazen conflicts of interest should Clinton become president. In one case the Clinton Foundation accepted a “gift” of $500,000 from the Algerian government to “benefit earthquake relief efforts in Haiti.” Hello?

            A man in the UK did a lot of research into organised crime in the UK government, and it is also related to mining, and also related to the US. The problem with this guy is that he cannot for the life of him explain properly what his evidence is, despite numerous web postings and a video of him handing evidence to the BBC (who unsurprisingly never reported on it). I believe he has discovered proof of crimes because he seems credible, but he is just unfortunately extremely bad at putting what he's found into words that an interested outsider can understand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you happen to know what the best way to find out about similar operations that have occurred with the UK government? There is sure to be a connection, and the more connections the more evidence, the more evidence, the more likely this will all come to full-beam light for the majority of citizens.
           </p>
           <p>
            This UK guy had found his evidence through company records and financial records I think. I just wouldn't know where to start, but you seem to have a good handle on looking into this stuff. I did find that the Clinton Foundation UK is registered to a London address that several UK politicians have businesses registered at - at least one of them is a convicted pedophile. Any pointers would be most welcome!

             Tednews on web and utube. Maas disinformation by agents. They act as if pedo abuse bad. They stare trauma cannot be healed. Bull crap, it can by various movement energy modalities, emdr and a lot more that release trauma from the cells, the way wild animals do, as released from.caproboty. " shake it off, " a process even done with a refuge in a Africa country. If not shake it off, are immediate prey to other wildlife and not group accepted. Ted talks is about put sh ones through mental routed and psychotropics. Psychotropics and over talk therapy, actually keep cementing the neuron synapses of trauma, firing up same areas in brain, retraumatize. Tedd talks is very UK based. From audsters with an agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aside, from USA, UK, and more; all over social platforms, any.psych that does false news, or sex abuse with children talks and reports; send comet pics of infants and key D's for by law they must mandate report if see those questionable photos. Mandate report laws require ones in professions required to even fill out a application and send to CP's and other child agencies, if not reside in USA. CP's 2026717793. Expose and pressure all the fraudsters. UK in psych mental psychotropics areas is in this.

             There is a independent film of the frauds in england public healthcare and welfare that came out, just last year, by a rich guy. It exposed, but did not help the ones violated. Its just like Obamacare and bush care. Many deaths, all ages, include infant mortalities, institution routings( look at board and stocks as its all about systemic routing for mti industry profits), or illegal blocked from all medical as rot at home. That movie exposes a lot, as does hufgington post in UK, of various advocates and victims that speak out. Oddly, has huffington post, bowed down to.public pressure to allow a welfare, public health care, advocacy forum, blogs and articles for UK!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, there is a blog on the web, parents were both illegally arrested and severely mental routed for reporting their young son was solicited for sex by a rich be ghbor. ( Norway or Sweden) the blogger, then did a huge blog on satanism in the arts of London, but meshed into PSYCHOLOGY for VICTIMS. ( Tedd talks and Orhers are using psych areas to indoctrinate victims and ones with mental disorders). Many are indoctrinated with satanism, and this blogger shows what's going on and the sick art work of violence, and psych and social agencies involved!! Mental drugs cause aggro violence, volatile to be trump ggered. They are chemicals that also have a electrical energy to them. Very easy to manipulate ones.

            </p>
            <p>
             Start in websites. Read thoroughly. 
Cameroon is def one.
Queen FAM, their land, corps have and work with.
Look on jersey island and guernsey that queen owns. Jersey pedo and bones is huge case, with saville. Both islands, near each other, between France and UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             Corps in fraud, connected to Obamacare are providence. Many providence subsidiaries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Providence owns worldwide igneus. Igneus is also in UK, USA, Australia, Saudi, mass more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Facebook, iniate Illuminati is huge to third world Africa, VOA UK, USA entities ( NY, ohio, London come up a lot. Who.is building, funding the mass satanic churches popping up.in UK, USA, Africa, and owns / Acquiring property.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your UK idea is smart. Always review websites very well....and search key phrases on web and wikileaks in full, not just podesta sta and Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whole slew of data being missed, by ignoring rest of WikiLeaks.
Hillary used Bills presidency to go into data on all people, govt staff, corps, worldwide to see who has crimes and violations. Goal of hers, build the mafia network organized with bill and Chelsea under cf.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't be fooled by Chelsea, some are. She was raised by Chelsea, and uses same type of geeky downplayed sex appeal to manipulate. Guarantee, Eric Braverman brought in was not to expose and fix foundation, but part of plan with her parents to move Clinton foundation out of Brock and others, for their later takeover moves in govt to corp worldwide, to give Clinton's bigger profit and control assets.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't even fall for gaymovements thibg, esp.if gay, etc. Its all a front to bring satanicviolent types into all power and industries and the masses. All is a front. Underestimating them and how expansive they are is not even safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             It does not start with Clinton's, bush and prior. Clinton's just reorganized it and Obama. Do not underestimate Obama in this. Study all he has done, Obama foundation, Obamacare.
            </p>
            <p>
             Igneus is used to transfer immigrant, immigrant felons, refugees into countries via jobs. In USA, through bill hr-5./Ones have no idea how fed violating, abusive, fraud bill, no show, strand for hours or all night PLUS intimidate and harm all ages of disabled, esp.ones that speak.up.of fed nemt transport frauds, exercising both their beneficiary rights and ADA rights togriwvance, and its title iv violations to intimidate ones who exercise their ada RTS to grievance.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "things that have happened to disabled or parents speaking out. A lot. Ones have no idea, how dangerous it is to speak out, including to state governors, state attorneys. Events..do happen, including kids killed in transport, even by simple oxygen not hooked up, and kid never checked for long hour trips. Its just like cps intimidations., and whistleblowers laws do not protect victims and their FAM advocates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at way laws are structured. Read all laws and corporate govt federal acquisition handbooks, contracts and more for each country. He brought that up in this subverse, of how another country, did charge one of the mafia players of unregistered political corps.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wynene and Podesta and multi corps involved in the federal indoctiin case of gross medical surgery at human illegal experiment level. What is missing from that? The same experiment done all over world, not just us a and in many hospitals PLUS where wynne and crew are getting the BONE paste.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oddly, Wynne's corps had approval to use the bone filler for arm surgeries, butnot the spine. Three died on table, in USA. They were not just doing in USA. Guarantee mexico and India. Many in Africa go to India and Germany for medical.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allepo and other Syria rat lines of poison. Look up the cases of chemical warfare in Syria, Iraq; for england review studies on it, also blaming Assad, pull up further entities named for your UK research.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, UK pulling out of union. Look up UK govt and corps that are tricking the UK people by adding loopholes and delaying . Obama went to UK to tell ones not to vote for brexit. Obama is a bold mofo, crime agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is bill Clinton called the top type politician by so many top turds? The criminal mafia plans plus his ACTING of charm. Do not be fooled, even George Webb is a bit fooled by bill and Chelsea, when they work in conjunction to Hillary and each play their acting role.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look on ALL Clinton tweets. You can find Maas govt , corp, npos, universities they work with, as they promote and share tweets. Chelsea has been extra active in plating that role esp after Hillary lost and corruption came out more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at charles sort as website. Heard ones archived it, but if you can, archive everything you can, anywhere. You can find UK aspects, and much more on his four year review.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keep watching George Webb on.utube. CCC gas, foreign affairs, engineer firms ( many even listed on ccc website).
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope that helps. Glad you want to add more of the pieces.

              Thanks so much for all this, that's so helpful! I have a feeling that the UK is some kind of hub, or seed for a lot of this stuff for some reason, that the UK possibly has more corrupted politicians and corrupted upper parts of society than perhaps anywhere else. I kind of suspect that countries that have kept their monarchy, even if just as a nominal head of state, are the worst and most rotten, and their people the most brainwashed by this entrenched idea of an inherent social hierarchy, that some people are just born better than others and therefore deserve riches and special attentions etc. So many Brits buy into that idea, not that they'd admit it necessarily, but it's like a stubborn weed that crawls through the subconscious of British society. Gives me chills! Anyway I will get researching with all this help you've given me and will report back later!

             Tavistock was mentioned by the op research that for more ifo on how the UK is connected maybe. What I do know is that their building was splattered with blood on 7/7 a fucked up way of hiding in plain sight, since they were likely involved in that falce flag production.
