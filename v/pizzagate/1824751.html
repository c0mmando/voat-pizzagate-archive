            Why was this deleted? I don't understand.  I guess maybe because there was not a statement as to how it is tied to Pizzagate? Yes, maybe.

             I was told rule number

             I did add a link in my comment below the title. When I was putting in the title I hit enter by mistake before I had included the link there. I really wish we could edit our titles like we can preview everything else. That's the second time I've done that. 
I was going to resubmit it and copy/paste all our comments into the post. In the middle of everything my computer restarted so I lost everything. It's frustrating, I've seen many other submissions with a lot less info in them left untouched. Which, btw, I've noticed others complain about. After the crash, I just didn't have it in me to redo it all. Maybe Sunday

              I totally understand.  Many times I have hit a wrong key, late at night or when my eyes are ready to cross.  Take your time, it would be great, but don't sweat it.

            "The bill, which now goes to the House for consideration, would increase the penalty for the crime of trafficking in persons to a Class A felony, punishable by up to 25 years in prison. It would require motel and hotel operators obtain a form of identification before renting a room and it bars hourly rentals. And it mandates that businesses such as
            <strong>
             <strong>
              farms
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , massage parlors, airports, emergency rooms and other public places post signs about human trafficking so victims know where to go to get help."
           </p>
           <p>
            Bold on farms is mine. This just stuck out to me due to all the pg references by JP, AJ and Luzzatto about farms. Also, CT lawmakers jumped on this pretty quickly since Bruce Bemer was arrested on 3/28/17 and this article is dated 4/4/17.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bemer, King and Trefzger have all pled not guilty. Bemer's next court date is 5/16/17. King's next court date is 5/17/17 and Trefzgers next date is 5/12/17.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most recent article 4/26/17 regarding Bemers most recent court appearance.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I can't help wonder if Aaron Hernandez's alleged prison lover, Kyle Kennedy, wasn't somehow connected or mixed up with Bemer. Kennedy's prison pen pal bio says he was into motorcycles and cars, building and racing both. Bemer has a motorcycle dealership in Springport, MA.

             I find this very enlightening.  Bemer's lawyer has connections to Bill Clinton.  I believe he or his brother were chairs on his campaign and that of Chris Dodd.

              The Hernandez story, so far, has only been reported by the Daily mail. He left 3 suicide notes in his cell. One was for Kennedy, to whom he also bequeathed a $50k watch. I wondered about the Kennedy connection to Bemer because of proximity.  Also, Hernandez was from Bristol, CT,  30 miles from Glastonbury.

              I don't have time for links right now, but a board member of Ability Beyond has ties to Legionnaires of Christ. Seems like a deep web to me.

               Sometimes I tend to take on too much, wanting to help the children.   I started researching Bemer and the Glastonbury case involving the race tracks, but after digging into it for almost 2 days on and off, I was overwhelmed.  I had to leave it and hoped others would pick up on it.  Maybe their head started to swim just like mine.  This is so deep and involved it needs many more to delve into the backgrounds of the characters, Bemer Scam, sex with underage boys, Bill Clinton, etc. Now we may possibly have an Aaron Hernandez suicide involved in this deep web of a rabbit hole.  If others are willing to help dig into this I will be glad to assist.  I can understand how difficult it is, for I have been part of quite a few investigations on here as have others.

                Yes I went into detail about the Hernandez death when it happened. It occurred on the day the patriots were at the whouse. Many of the players did not show up. Hernandez "allegedly hung himself with a sheet" Again would challenge this it is an impossible task for nearly any human but a 200 + pound man in solitary. Never. Then allegations came out of blood writings on the wall &amp; illuminati ritual sacrifice. As well as the scripture John 3:16 on his forehead. This was a message to many am sure.

                His attorney is the famed Casey Anthony attorney that was able to secure her not guilty verdict after the television trial of the death of her 3 year old child Cayley.

                For anyone that paid attention or knows the history this occurred in Florida and all signs pointed to guilt &amp; incest within the family. Law enforcement cover-up etc.

                Aaron Hernandez had just been acquitted the week before he died with the help of this attorney. Makes no sense that he killed himself. This attorney stated so and has asked for the remains for 2nd autopsy. Top medical examiners have volunteered.

                The info. About the lover came out late almost as if a smear but was tied to the above post. Something sinister is exploding beneath the surface

                 I totally agree with everything you have stated.  At the time of the Anthony trial I was waffling back and forth.  Now that I know the meaning of "pizza" I remember what the mother said the trunk smelled like, rotten or spoiled pizza.  Now, knowing the meaning in the pedo world, it made something click.  I have felt all along their was incest and abuse of both the daughter and the grand daughter. I have trust in Baez to handle this case with dignity and sensibility.  I don't really care if Hernandez had a male lover or not, that is his private life.  What concerns me is who did this?  I believe it is possibly connected to the Bemer arrest.  Possibly they were afraid that Hernandez would talk.  He (as mentioned) only lived about 30 miles from the race track that Bemer owned.  Yes if the truth ever comes to the surface, it certainly will explode.
