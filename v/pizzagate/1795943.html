            Look, I am not saying you are wrong, or even that I disagree, but, as I said, this was an attempt at aggregating what has been PROVEN, not speculation, and religion is nothing if not the epitome of speculation. I am very religious, but that simply does not apply in this article. If we were simply listing all that was relevant, which we have done many times, it would be a completely different article. That is like the many foaming at the mouth, calling us shills, when we write an article about a negative aspect of Trump, yet do not unnecessarily counter balance it with negative claims about Clinton, regardless of whether the article is even about Hillary Clinton, its sort of absurd. Now you can continue to restate how important it is and how relevant it is, and, again, I would agree, but that does not change the fact that this is about unequivocal facts, and not whether their religion had, or might have had a direct influence on their decisions and actions. Here is the link to an archive, but you should also search the archive for Comet, Pedogate, etc. Hope you find it relevant:

            You are missing the point of this article, as many often do when they don't see what they want to see. This was intended to focus solely on what can be verified. I am not implying that what you are saying is not true, as there is more than enough to show that connection, but it cannot be verifiably proven. What he discusses is incontrovertible fact. That was the point, as the article's title pretty clearly suggests. There are many over-arching compilations of the aggregate data from this case, many from The Last American Vagabond themselves, but this one was meant to be specific to what can be verified. If you want I can send you some links to the TLAV compilations, they do good work.
