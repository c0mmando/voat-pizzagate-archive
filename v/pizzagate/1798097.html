<p>The unprecedented case has proved problematic for German lawyers who discovered that <strong><strong>cannibalism is not illegal in Germany</strong></strong>.

Crucial to the case is a <strong><strong>gruesome videotape</strong></strong> made by Meiwes of the entire evening, during which Brandes apparently makes clear his consent&gt;</p>

<p>Many veterans will know the info in first half of the article by heart, but it\'s a serious focus on how people are covering this or are starting to---leading into the deeper shit at the end of the article. </p>

Everything is balanced in the universe (in order for anything to exist so must it's opposite). You can see it on the edges of what we can see, on the biggest edge, planets orbiting in balanced cycles, and if you look at the smallest edge of what we can see, you see electrons going around a nucleus. If you aspire to get rich, you will get poor, in this life or the next. When the pendulum on the clock moves to the left, in that moment it is already gathering momentum to go to the right. Such is the laws of God/The Universe. Everything is gravity. When the pendulum stops in the middle, time stops. You come back to your true nature. You see the timeless world. The eternal present moment. It is why time went slower when you were a child. Your left brain wasn't fully developped yet. Less mind block = more life. Therefore, your only hope is to open up your mind by doing your research on the truth and the life, so that you can live in the eternal present moment and be fuffilled. There is No Other Way.
Evolution is a lie made to destroy you.

The info you posted is interesting
the thing about mirror gazing
Is it not a position of both states? Rather than the assumption that we are all and all are we. It is both is it not? One for all and all for one superposition

I wouldn't recommend reading too much into esoteric stuff if you're not too prepared mentally, you need to be stable to really understand the essence

Depends on the way you look at it, there is a collective unconsciousness outside what people call "existence", which can't be comprehended by humans.

I have been exploring content in Bloodborne as it has something to do with this red floor in this specific area in the game which can only be found through a glitch. I think getting there is vital to a mystery because From Software is possibly connected to production of brainwashing material, game has esoteric mentions of "great ones" which can be interpreted as the government, i.e someone above you, with greater insight on things than you. There's something really off about that game and the only word I can explain it with is "primordial". As for Worldcorp, the subject was thrown into an acid bath a few days after that was filmed.
Worldcorp is a meme website but that video is real
They have no idea what they're messing with

              They shared some info with me  about techniques used againist children it is very interesting, hard to grasp though. I wouldve gotten more into asking questions but I have a bad toothache that seems to be getting the best of my concentration today.

             Where is the manual or the pdf? I will read it if I can find it. That's cool you went for the discord challenge. I guess they see when we all step all over their sites.  I wonder if they can even tell they are getting mainstream traffic now due to posting the questions from Quora-a lot of people upvoated those particular posts that had links to the Worldcorp vids and synt images.

             I could not agree more.

These articles keep me pumped and focused
