<p>And there\'s this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The psychologist Aparecida Alves said Sabrina sought her on the morning of her death. Sabrina wanted Alves to put her in touch with someone who could investigate allegations that J<strong>oão de Deus offered homes built under the &quot;My Home, My Life&quot; program to silence his victims.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;My Home, My Life&quot; is a federal government program established under Lula.</strong> It focuses on ensuring more Brazilians can buy their first house. For years, it\'s been alleged that the program was used for fraudulent means, including buying of votes.</p>
<p><strong>If Sabrina\'s suspicions were true, that would mean government officials were involved with João de Deus\' reign of horror.</strong></p>
<p>On the day of her death, Sabrina was still fighting to expose abuse and corruption.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The activist helped unmask John of God at the end of last year when she gathered dozens of victims of sexual abuse. <strong>She forwarded the reports to the Goiás Public Ministry and the Civil Police</strong>. Under pressure from people attached to the religious, imprisoned in Goiás, Bittencourt denounced the threats he suffered, which caused her to leave Brazil.</p>
<p>Accustomed to collecting the pain of violence in Goiânia, the psychologist Aparecida Alves was sought by Bittencourt in the morning of what would be the last Saturday of life of the militant. She asked for Alves\'s help to contact someone who could investigate cases in which <strong>the medium would have used homes from the &quot;Minha Casa Minha Vida&quot; program to silence victims</strong>. In the conversation to which ÉPOCA had access, <strong>Bittencourt wanted the list of owners of the houses in Itapaci, in the interior of Goiás</strong>. According to her, a witness would have said that the medium donated houses for its victims so that they did not denounce it.</p>

<p>I\'ll bet they did...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Nations Human Rights Committee agreed to investigate the allegations that Judge Sergio Moro had “violated Lula’s right to privacy, his right not to be detained arbitrarily and his presumption of innocence.”</p>
<p>Lula da Silva said in his request that the case was “highly political” and the result of “a series of arbitrary violations of rights,” including the illegal searching of his home, as well as his children’s homes and the Lula Institute. The attorneys also added that the judge abused his position and leaked confidential information to the press, disclosed recordings obtained illegally and used temporary detention of key suspects in order to reach an agreement that would affect Lula.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What began as an investigation into money laundering quickly turned into something much greater, uncovering a vast and intricate web of political and corporate racketeering. </p>
<p>On 14 January 2015, police agent Newton Ishii was waiting in Rio de Janeiro’s Galeão airport to meet the midnight flight from London. His mission was simple. A former executive of Brazil’s national oil company, Petrobras, was on the plane. Ishii was to arrest him as soon as he set foot in Brazil and take him for questioning by detectives.</p>
<p>No big deal, the veteran cop thought as he ticked off the hours in the shabby Terminal One lounge. This was just one of many anti-bribery operations he had worked on. Usually they made a few headlines, then faded away, leaving the perpetrators to carry on as if nothing had happened. <strong>There was a popular expression for this: acabou em pizza (to end up with pizza)</strong>, which suggested that there was no political row that could not be settled over a meal and a few beers...</p>
<p>Petrobras was also at the centre of Brazil’s politics. During the 2003-2010 presidency of the Workers’ Party leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as Lula), executive posts in Petrobras were offered to Lula’s political allies, to help build support in Congress. Petrobras’s commercial and strategic importance was such that the US National Security Agency made it a target for surveillance. As the Car Wash investigation was to prove, if you could unravel the secrets of this company, you would unravel the secrets of the state.</p>
<p>The web of corruption has been traced far beyond Brazil’s borders. Odebrecht had a department dedicated to bribes, known as the Division of Structured Operations, which laid out close to $800m in illicit pay-offs for more than 100 contracts in a dozen countries over 15 years. Dozens of foreign corporate suppliers (of engineering equipment, power lines, drilling rigs and so forth) also face regulatory and shareholder inquiries about the bribes they paid to secure contracts with Petrobras. <strong>Among them was Rolls-Royce, which posted hefty losses as a result of penalties imposed in January this year by Brazilian, UK and US authorities. The World Cup and Olympics have also been sucked into the mire with fraud investigations now focused on six out of the 12 stadiums used in 2014 and 2016.</strong></p>

             Why was the uprooting of two mango trees so important as to make it to #2 on this list? Why were they under "threat"? Moved from an industrial park to a housing complex?
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that this took place at Caracol makes it even more suspect as this is where Monica Peterson was investigating when she was suicided. Also, the placement of the "2" is strange because it is the only one out of the 4 items that is misplaced.
             <strong>
              I followed up on "mangos" as a code word throughout the rest of Wikileaks and could not find many other solid instances....but in this case, it is definitely code IMO...perhaps referring to mothers with children or groups of people.

              Also, the placement of the "2" is strange because it is the only one out of the 4 items that is misplaced. I followed up on "mangos" as a code word throughout the rest of Wikileaks and could not find many other solid instances....but in this case, it is definitely code IMO...perhaps referring to mothers with children or groups of people.

            <p>
             That's very interesting. Remember that the infamous George Webb said in his video series that the Clintons allgedly smuggled heroin from Pakistan, hidden in mangos? Which I didn't believe, since I don't trust Webb - imo he's Mossad.
            </p>
            <p>
             But 'mango' as a code word for human trafficking makes sense.

              Ever eaten a mango? There is a giant, fibrous seed in the middle that doesn't easily separate from the fruit. I doubt it would be possible to smuggle heroin inside one. Georg Webb is full of crap.

               So Clinton aide Cheryl Mills was James Alefantis contact person inside the WH. We should remember that, and save the info in the parent's parent for further reference.

                Haven't heard a peep about Mills in a looooong time. She was one of those Comey's FBI gave immunity to during the original Clinton email "investigation". She posed as Clinton's lawyer.

              , please see parent. Matthew Freud invited Bono to sing at his daughter's birthday party IIRC.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which makes sense when you take into account that he was a friend of Matthew's father, Sir Clement Freud, one of our usual suspects.

              One worker, a married woman in her mid-30s, claims Moyo pressured her to have sex with an older Tanzanian MP. When she refused, she was demoted and had her salary cut. Moyo said she “vehemently denies” the claims and says she is being smeared. She, in return, claims that other directors treated her “like their personal maid” and abused her in public. Workers say the abuse went on for years and bosses at the charity tried to cover up he allegations. Ex-staff says that nothing was done about their claims against the organization until after staff started complaining publicly on social media in November.
             </p>

              The organization, whose board includes high-profile figures such as

               David Cameron and Facebook chief Sheryl Sandberg
              </strong>
              , has since admitted that there was “mistreatment and inaction” by former managers.

             The fight against corruption and illegal gambling has once again hit Brazilian President Lula da Silva. This time, the target is his older brother,
             <strong>
              Genival Inácio da Silva, better known as 'Vavá'
             </strong>
             , charged with influence peddling in the executive branch and for prestige exploitation with the judiciary. Agents of the Federal Police searched his home yesterday, in the city of São Bernardo do Campo.
            </p>
            <p>
             Genival Inácio da Silva, known as Vavá, the Brazilian president's elder brother, acted as an intermediary in favor of the Portuguese businessman
             <strong>
              Emídio Mendes
             </strong>
             , getting him meetings in the presidential palace with direct advisors to Lula and then to the oil company
             <strong>
              Petrobrás
             </strong>
             . The complaint, published today in Veja magazine, contradicts previous statements by the president that the brother was never an intermediary between businessmen and the government.

If finalized, it will be one of the largest buildings in Brazil, being 35 floors and 119 meters high. The Riviera Residence Service is under construction since 2008, the place where was the Cine Indaia and Indaia Hotel in the city of Santos . The Cine Indaia and Hotel Indaia were very old and were demolished in 2007.

             Since the demolition of the old Cine Indaia, the site has been under construction for almost 10 years. In addition, the works have already stopped in some newscasts, showing the concern of the population regarding the outbreaks of dengue. With many problems the Portuguese group transferred the work in 2011 to incorporator Strasbourg , which in turn was able to continue the works for only one year.

             Hillary Clinton’s Anti-Corruption Partner Mired in Corruption Scandals

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Brazil’s Superior Election Court is also looking into charges that Rousseff brought in money for her 2010 and 2014 elections through an illegal scheme involving state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Rousseff chaired the company’s board of directors from 2003 to 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rousseff claims that she knew nothing of the illegal Petrobras graft scheme, but other politicians implicated in the plan say that’s not the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             One senator, a political ally of Rousseff who was arrested last year for trying to bribe Petrobras executives to keep quiet about his involvement, recently said that Rousseff "knew about everything" and "benefited from the scheme" she inherited from her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Prosecutors have already charged Lula for hiding his ownership of a beachfront penthouse apartment that was renovated by OAS, a construction company that saw three of its executives arrested last year for their role in the Petrobras bribery scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The construction company has given between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and has been a partner of former President Bill Clinton in the Haitian relief effort he leads.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Clinton Foundation has also made its presence known in Brazil. The 2013 Clinton Global Initiative conference was held in Rio de Janeiro, where Rousseff was featured as a speaker. The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Rousseff’s corruption scandals.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The sale of unskilled Haitian labor from sweatshops and sugarcane fields to traditional colonial powers is well documented. Less well known is the current dissipation of Haiti’s middle class toward the emerging powers in the United Nations’ so-called peacekeeping mission (MINUSTAH), especially Brazil.
            </p>
            <p>
             About 76,000 Haitians have migrated to Brazil since 2010. This exodus has reached a rate of about 75 Haitians per day and continues to accelerate. Ninety-three percent of the Haitian migrants are between 19 and 45 years old; seventy-seven percent are male. The demographics of this group alone should give one pause. Historically, young male migrants have been brutally exploited, especially for dangerous construction work, and treated as being expendable.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 3,700-mile trek would begin with travel to the Dominican Republic; from there, the Haitians would be put on a flight to Ecuador, where a visa was not required. After this, they were taken by bus into Peru, where a visa was also not needed before 2012. From Peru, they would enter Brazil, in the northwestern state of Acre. Since a visa was required in Brazil, they would then travel by bus or taxi to the nearest office of the Brazilian Federal Police, usually in the city of Brasileia, and apply there for a visa. Over 40,000 Haitians have been trafficked in this way, starting with only 37 individuals in 2010; increasing rapidly to 1,175 during 2011; and continuing to accelerate to more than 9,000 for the first half of 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             Simultaneously with the start of the illegal traffic of Haitians, powerful Brazilian interests began to clamor for a legal admission of large numbers of Haitians, with support from human rights groups. At a senate hearing in late December 2011, several powerful senators with interests in construction lobbied vigorously for a liberalization of Haitian immigration. Among them was Senator Jorge Viana, whose brother, Tião Viana, was the governor of Acre. ..
             <strong>
              Mr. Tião Viana is now alleged to have been involved in the Petrobras scandal, a convoluted scheme to launder about $3.8 billion that had been embezzled over a decade, from inflated construction contracts, for bribes and kickbacks.
             </strong>
             Ms. Rousseff is under threat of impeachment for her failure to stem the corruption.

             Housing ‘Godfather’ leaves £50m misery

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Armstrong Emery, 37, enjoyed a lifestyle that included a sports car, a luxury flat and the ownership of two football clubs. It stands in sharp contrast to the lives now facing his investors.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among them is Nerys Pearce, 33, who is confined to a wheelchair and lives in a bungalow in Ascot, Berkshire. She was paralysed in 2008 after a car pulled out in front of her motorbike. She invested £253,000 of her £1.2m settlement in EcoHouse, Armstrong Emery’s company, which was promising 20% returns.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company quickly raked in about £50m from up to 1,500 investors in Britain and abroad. The minimum investment was set at
             <strong>
              £23,000
             </strong>
             — the cost of building one “unit” of the social housing. But the scheme hit trouble last year and the money disappeared along with Armstrong Emery.
            </p>
            <p>
             Armstrong Emery, who was born in west London, cites his business heroes as Sir Richard Branson and the American billionaire Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he was living in Natal, northern Brazil, where the social housing developments were being built, he would travel in an armoured 4x4 accompanied by two other vehicles carrying armed bodyguards.
            </p>
            <p>
             Armstrong Emery then decided to put enough money into a Natal football club, Alecrim FC, to become its president.

             It takes a special kind of faith (or madness) to buy two clubs. But this is exactly what tycoon Anthony Armstrong Emery has done. The British born international property developer is the owner of Brazilian club, Alecrim FC and as of last month Italian outfit A.C. Monza Brianza 1912.

            <p>
             Tied in with his two clubs Armstrong Emery is launching innovative football academies which he says will give youngsters a rounded education, social skills and top quality coaching. He is planning to give trainees a better chance of making a career in the game rather than the current academies which he feels discard young hopefuls too quickly. Armstrong Emery invited League Two side
             <strong>
              AFC Wimbledon
             </strong>
             to Monza to re-create an Anglo-Italian cup game played in June 1976. Back then, Monza played the former Wimbledon, as part of the pre-season schedule.

             Thanks for the support.  I'm discovering a lot of stuff has been scrubbed from the internet, particularly when it comes to any US or UK companies involvement. I'm currently trying to go down a tricky rabbit hole.  Any help would be appreciated.
