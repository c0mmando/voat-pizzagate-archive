            Sorry. Can't help but be suspicious because of the book cover art.

            Most pizzagaters believe the appearance of Welch at Comet Ping Pong was a false flag for many good reasons. No one saw or heard him shoot a gun. HE WAS NEVER CHARGED WITH SHOOTING A FIRE-ARM inside the restaurant. The charge of assault with a dangerous weapon was written up in the original police report. The described incident was of Welch turning around (while holding a long gun aimed down) when an employee unexpectedly entered Comet from the rear door. He saw Welch holding the gun (not aimed at him) and turned and fled out the back door.  THAT'S IT. No one saw or heard Welch fire a shot at the closet containing the hard drive, which a pizzagate investigator claimed to have found CP and reported it just a few days before this incident. So many details do not fit the public narrative. All this was detailed in an earlier VOAT post.

             Huh? Suspicious of what? It's just a simple graphic design to draw readers in, dude. The book discusses the false flag in detail. I think you need to take a breather to be honest.

              Whether intended or not, the visual of guns and pizza reinforces the false narrative put out by fake news to criminalize and discredit pizzagate researchers. Visual imagery bypasses the logic system and gets stored in the brain. Since most people glance and do not read, they will store the image with the MSM programming, " a crazy pizzagate researcher shot up Comet Pizza". If you are seriouse about this, you need to change the cover.

               I'm open to cover design ideas! But the fact is, I'm very limited in the design elements I can use without having to pay royalties to some artist. You could even argue that normie-friendly elements will draw in exactly the type of reader we want -- not someone who already believes this stuff, but someone who discounts it but could be convinced if presented with the right evidence in the right way.
              </p>
              <p>
               I assure you I am serious and sort of resent your assumption that I'm some clown or newcomer who hasn't earned my cred yet -- I wrote a book-length series that has been read by 200,000+ people and converted countless minds to our side, including totally normie, conventional, anti-conspiracy theory types, with my work. And I began in November 2016 when this was all unfolding, in the very beginning, before the investigation even moved to Voat. The entire series is free on Aceloewgold.com, so instead of using this comments section to re-post the dozens of sources I use and dozens of points I hit upon, you can just go read it for yourself and give me actual feedback for the next edition of the book -- rather than assuming it sucks based on the cover design, and then demanding I re-post all my work here to prove that it doesn't.

                The book does not come up on the website you posted. This is a blind research site, so I have no way of confirming your creds. Hopefully you are sincere, however, I just go by the facts that are available. Nothing personal. If you post here, you will be tested. 
"I'm open to cover design ideas! But the fact is, I'm very limited in the design elements I can use without having to pay royalties to some artist."  There are tons of "meme" artists who are pizzagate motivated and work for free. Why not check some of them out? Or just create your own "meme" book cover from a meme generator. Good luck!

                 This is part one in the series:
                 <a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/">

                 </a>
                 . There are many other articles in the series there, mixed in with our other content. The book is assembled from the series, which I began when PG was still on 4Chan and continued as it developed, moved to Voat, etc etc. The book itself is on Amazon, which Voat doesn't appear to allow links to.

                 You don't gotta tell me how it works posting here, friend, hahhaa...I've had this account since late 2016 ;)
                </p>
                <p>
                 You mention meme artists...that did occur to me but IMO, Pizzgate memes are often quite cheesy (no pun intended), visually noisy and usually involve public domain pictures of children who I'd rather not contribute to making the unintended poster children of this conspiracy. I know I could work with an artist to come up with a design that didn't suffer from those problems, but based on the dozens of PG memes I've seen, I'm not convinced the end result would be less cheap looking than what I came up with on my own. Maybe that's just narcissism on my part, but I haven't been blown away by the artistry of PG memes, and I've been looking at PG memes since this thing broke in 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also don't want to use faces of public figures on the cover, as this could be lead to legal problems for me. I also think making the cover look like a meme, while definitely eye catching, would look a bit cheap and unprofessional as a book on a bookshelf. Online meme generators also compress images, which disqualifies them for a physical book cover because book cover images need to be very high resolution. Book covers require very particular formatting, positioning of elements, image settings, resolution, etc., making it so you can't really do much with programs that aren't designed specifically to create covers for a 6x9 inch paperback.

                 I really do appreciate the addition of concrete suggestions, though! Thank you.

                  I appreciate your comments. However, your current cover looks like a cheesy meme already and it conveys the WRONG idea. You do HARM along with whatever good is supposedly in your book (I haven't read it). Either switch to an equally cheesy ACCURATE image (there is plenty of copyright free clip art) OR ACT LIKE A PROFESSIONAL AND SHELL OUT FOR A DECENT ARTIST/GRAPHIC DESIGNER.

                   You're entitled to your opinion, and so am I. That's how this works. My respectfully disagreeing with you doesn't imply that I'm not acting like a professional, and there's nothing "inaccurate" about cover elements that are SYMBOLS to begin with. In literature and art, a symbol is something that represents something else without being literal. They've been used for book covers for works in all genres, for all of publishing history, since the invention of the printing press. Your interpretation of those symbols and what they mean AND the effect they will have on other people is totally, 100% subjective. Sorry, that's a fact.

                   I appreciate your input and have taken it into account, but being on a self-righteous high horse doesn't automatically make you correct.

                     Hahah yes, everyone judges books by their covers...which is really the purpose of a book cover, despite the old saying. But there's nothing "inaccurate" about design elements that don't convey factual information to begin with. I think guns are a pretty accurate symbol for Pizzagate in general anyway, regardless of what happened at Comet Ping Pong.

                      They are only a symbol of a false flag. They were meant to DISTRACT FROM /SHUT DOWN actual research, which has NOTHING to do with guns. It is all about CHILDREN. CNN would be proud to use your cover as a graphic for a pizzagate story. The contents that I read of your article is well done. Don't undermine it.

                        Thank you, that was my goal! I'm open to criticism for sure, but that's what I was going for. Not presenting it as "This book proves Pizzagate," which automatically turns off anyone who doesn't already believe it, but rather, "this book tells you a Pizzagate story you won't hear elsewhere," and then giving readers the evidence that has the best chance of converting skeptics.

                       Again, I definitely understand your opinion, but I disagree with it. Maybe let's see if some others chime in. If a ton of people agree with you I'd be more inclined to spend the time changing it and re-publishing the thing. But you have to understand I'm not going to do all that based on a single opinion -- others have told me they think the cover works well. Thanks for the kind words regarding it being well done -- I just don't think I'm undermining the content. But again, if others chime in and I see a pattern, I'll take a second look.

                        Thanks. I respect your hard work researching and writing. I am one of a few that did a lot of digging and documenting on the Welch topic, so I guess I am particularly sensitive to the implications. Hopefully, many will read the book and get "woke."
