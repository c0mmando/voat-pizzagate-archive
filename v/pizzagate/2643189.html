            This channel often produced mere clickbait, but it was still one of the few that I subscribed to and watched religiously. While often, they would regurgitate the same narrative, and include the usual suspects and questionable sources as guests (Crokin, Steele, etc.), they had 3 great things going: 1. decent production value, 2. occasional retractions (which I respect), and most importantly 3. they had strong coverage reporting pizza/pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really appreciate that combination. Others do something similar, but SGT did it consistently and without any internecine drama that distracts and detracts. Consider David Seaman, and Titus Frost.
           </p>
           <p>
            SGT was not terminatedfor being click bait. They were censored because they report on the scandal of elites torturing, sexually abusing and killing kids in Satanic rituals. They give their audience a healthy dose of sugar and puffed up clickbait episodes, and they basically advertise for homepothay and gold markets; but they have to pay to keep the lights on somehow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, this channel is gone for a serious reason, and if you were watching them, you can guess what it is: it’s the same thing we do here.

            STG has never been very analytical - always falling for the disinfo agents like Rebeka Roth, Chis Bollyin, and LARPERS like Q anon etc - but he has some good stuff there and an important audience. I am sure he will bounce back with a new channel soon.

            There’s a reason to leave YouTube. SGT wasn’t 100% accurate, but they took responsibility for their errors and opinions. Their guests were hit or miss, but they paid attention to comments and contributors.

             Yep. The thing I didn't like about SGT Report is that they rode popular trends whether those trends were accurate or not. SGT would ride clickbait trends to increase their views to make money. Accuracy was not their main goal.

            SGT Report is yet another Fake Truther Channel.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are so many of them out there, and it is no coincidence they are connected to each other and to larger controlled opposition outlets including the Hagmann Report and InfoWars.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are certain topics they will not touch, and they will never go into much detail or name any new names. They stay on the surface and only report what is already known. SGT is particularly sensationalist and prays on the uninformed to establish its false credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few others have also noticed this.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/DeathtoMasonsASAP">
             @DeathtoMasonsASAP
            </a>
            is correct again - SGT Report is compromised and has been compromised for a long time. There is a reason why SGT Report gets so many likes and subscribers and why DeathtoMasonsASAP gets so many downvotes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is still alarming if SGT Report was taken down however since Sean is controlled opposition.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are quite a few others here on Voat who are Fake Truthers also. There is a list and it is not short. There are also some Evil people here with Evil intentions.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are sure.

              Death to Masons knows a lot more than you do. He is only one example. There are many others who don't sell out for upvotes.

                We don't subscribe to channels, especially YouTube channels. We subscribe to Truth. Some channels have more Truth than other channels.
               </p>
               <p>
                We don't fawn over anyone. Jesus was 100% accurate, all the time.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have simply noticed that there are a select few voaters including Death to Masons that are more interested in the Truth than upvotes. Ironically Donald Trump is a Freemason but so few here will dare even talk about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is Trump one of the "good Freemasons"? Do you realize how ridiculous that sounds?
               </p>
               <p>
                There is a large group here is drinking the Trump kool-aid despite the obvious red flags including being forever indebted to the Rothschild family, being a Freemason, being close friends with the Clintons and Hollywood scum, having Roy Cohn as a mentor and working with the mafia to build flashy casinos to pray on the poor, being a television entertainer famous for firing everyone, creating a scam University to steal money from young business students, saying generally terrible things, making incestuous remarks about dating his daughter, filing bankruptcy multiple times, hiring and appointing more swamp creatures, not locking anyone up, and being infatuated with gold everything.
               </p>
               <p>
                What's not to Trust?
               </p>
               <p>
                Congratulations on making a few thousand bucks on manipulated currencies used by elites to hide trafficking. Hopefully you spend it to prepare for the worst.
               </p>
               <p>
                How many Molochs have you hunted down? How many Molochs has Trump hunted down?

                  We know something that no one else here knows. It is not intellectual superiority, it is actual life experience.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We have witnessed extreme crimes involving the most powerful people in the world.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  People we know and care about have been tortured and murdered.

                 <p>
                  Trump knows about it all. He could Save the World with a One-Word Tweet. Why is he hiding The Truth from The People?

                  This is not a game. This is not a hoax. This is not a LARP.

            YouTube has appeared to be a PedoApologist from the beginning.
           </p>
           <p>
            It'd be nice for someone ... one of you investigative journalist types ... put together a history of what percentage of exactly how much money YouTube has been raking in from these questionable sorts of channels. Just curious if it correlates with the major cheerleading YouTube ''coincidentally''' is engaged in.

            SGT is shit limited hangout. Said they had shocking pictures to reveal from Tony Podesta's house. They then proceeded to show tasteful nudes, and make a case that they were underage. It was art, it's like SGT would show pictures of naked angel cherubs and say they were infants and that was what we were ranting about. They did not show Podestas art where children were in their underwear, chained to walls, dead in the grass, hands behind their backs looking tired and scared.  They also had a man claiming China is doing all the organ harvesting but not the USA, ours is legit. They also allowed James Corbett to do limited hangouts about 9/11 and say a plane hit the pentagon. SGT is trash disinfo gatekeeper site.

            Youtube is swift becoming the strictly-choreographed visual malaise that is cable tv- how anyone is surprised by offbeat/fringe/indie channels being constantly relegated to the closet or outright banned on that website remains a mystery to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has been going on for some time and will only intensify to the point where not a single channel with edgy/controversial views will be tolerated on that platform in the coming future.

            He was just talking about being on the second strike a matter of days ago... the censorship effort is sky rocketing and all this means to me is his last fee videos have been hitting too many nails on the head or he wouldnt be on the ban radar.

            The censorship of SGT Report is a very disturbing development. I regarded it as one of the better alt.news sites with over 225,000 subscribers. Since its inception in 2007, it had produced over 1000 videos and had garnered over 47,000,000 views.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can only hope  that it has some good lawyers to mount a First Amendment challenge to the powers that be. Should SGT start fundraising for its legal defense, please make a contribution.

             SGT likely censored themselves, all videos back on a new channel in a day or two. They have no value as a channel for truth, unless you know how to seperrate the truth and lies, because they mix them together there.
