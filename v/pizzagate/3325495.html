<blockquote>
<p>Christine Maxwell is an Internet content pioneer, best known as the creator and co-founder of Magellan, one of the first professionally curated online search/reference guides to Internet content.[1][2] In 1992 she also created and then co-authored one of the first hard copy reference guides to the Internet: New Riders Official Internet Yellow Pages[3] and The McKinley Internet Yellow Pages;[4] both published by Macmillan Publishers in 1994 and 1995 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>After Magellan was acquired by Excite, (a competing search engine) in 1996,[5] she went on to co-found Chiliad</strong>:[6] a software company involved in the advance of on-demand, massively scalable, intelligent mining of structured and unstructured data through the use of natural language search technologies. <strong>The firm\'s software was behind the data search technology used by the FBI\'s counterterrorism data warehouse.</strong></p>
<p>Christine Maxwell is the daughter of Elisabeth Maxwell and Robert Maxwell. One of nine children, siblings include her twin sister Isabel Maxwell, brothers Kevin Maxwell and Ian Maxwell, and youngest sister Ghislaine Maxwell. ..<strong>In 1986 she married Roger Malina</strong> of Berkeley, California. </p>
<p>She is now Program Manager of Learning Technologies at The University of Texas at Dallas[9] and is involved in Special Projects for Information Resources.  <strong>Maxwell is a former Trustee of the Internet Society and The Santa Fe Institute</strong>. She presently serves on the boards of the International Center for Disability Resources on the Internet[12] and Leonardo/OLATS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roger Malina (born July 6, 1950) is an American physicist, astronomer, Executive Editor of Leonardo Publications at M.I.T Press and distinguished professor of arts and technology, and professor of physics at the University of Texas at Dallas. He is also a Directeur de Recherche of the C.N.R.S. at the Laboratoire d\'Astrophysique de Marseille. Malina serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). His specialty in astrophysics is space instrumentation. His current work focuses on connections between science and art.</p>
<p>.. He was Principal Investigator for the NASA Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite at the University of California, Berkeley.[2] He is former director of the Observatoire Astronomique de Marseille Provence (OAMP) and of the Laboratoire d\'Astrophysique de Marseille in Marseille, and member of its observational cosmology group, which performs on investigations on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.</p>
<p>..<strong>Roger Malina is the son of Frank Malina, research engineer in rocket propulsion, first director of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</strong>, kinetic artist and founder of Leonardo Journal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1935, while a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Malina persuaded Professor of Aeronautics Theodore von Kármán to allow him to pursue studies into rocketry and rocket propulsion. The formal goal was development of a sounding rocket.  Malina and five associates (including Jack Parsons[3]) became known at Caltech as the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; because of their dangerous experiments (and failures) when testing rocket motor designs.  Malina\'s group was forced to move their operations away from the main Caltech campus into the more remote Arroyo Seco. <strong>This site and the research Malina was conducting would later become the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Malina served as the second Director of JPL</strong></p>
<p>..In 1942, von Kármán, Malina and three other students started the <strong>Aerojet Corporation.</strong></p>
<p>By late 1945, Malina\'s rockets had outgrown the facility at Arroyo Seco, and his tests were moved to White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Here, the project\'s WAC Corporal sounding rocket was the first U.S. rocket to break the 50-mile altitude mark, becoming the first sounding rocket to reach space.</p>
<p><strong>He moved to France and joined the fledgling United Nations as secretariat of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) under Julian Huxley. In 1951, Malina became head of UNESCO\'s division of scientific research.</strong> Two years later, Malina left UNESCO to pursue an interest in kinetic art.[8][1] In 1952, at the height of the Red Scare, Malina was indicted for having failed to list his Communist Party membership on an old security questionnaire from Caltech. He was declared a fugitive, to be arrested if and when he returned to the United States.</p>

            In 1985, I interviewed for an IT job at Information on Demand, Inc. Owner: Robert Maxwell. CEO: Christina Maxwell. The interviewer told me that they did a lot of business with an organization in Maclean, Virginia and then revealed that it was the ClA.  At the time, Christina was a high school graduate. Her subsequent career was concentrated in internet search technology and data warehousing products for the Defense and Intellience communities, including the Air Force, Homeland Security and the FBI. She cofounded the Chiliad data mining company around 1998, according to her CV, which has not been updated since 2013 and chiliad.com is dark and now appears to be registered to a Chinese owner. Chiliad technology was used to build the FBI Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW).

            Interesting, for some reason I remember Aerojet Corp being a CIA front op. Not sure where I read this in the past, but I do know they have a location in Camden, Arkansas, funny enough near Little Rock.

              The tremendously destructive Woolsey Fire has been widely reported as beginning “near” the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL or Rocketdyne), but it appears that the fire began on the Rocketdyne property itself. ..Aerojet is also seeking to monetize some 5,600 acres of land, the bulk of which is in Sacramento, California, where the company announced the elimination or relocation of 1,100 jobs last year. Drake declined to estimate how much the land is worth.

             The Church of Scientology is also working with Silicon Valley which has developed weaponized electronics disguised as computers, smart phones, wireless frequencies, and other systems. Sorcery is the unnatural manipulation of unseen forces like sounds, chemical reactions, and vibrational geometries with the intent of manipulating bodily chemistry, thoughts, and physiology. Kabbalah and Hermeticism are common forms of witchcraft practiced by the secret societies. Electronics enhance their sorcery.

            <p>
             In 1967, Puthoff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University.[1][2][3] He then worked with, and invented, tunable lasers and electron beam devices, concerning which he holds patents, and he is co-author (with R. Pantell) of Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics (Wiley, 1969), published in English, French, Russian and Chinese. Puthoff published papers on polarizable vacuum (PV) and stochastic electrodynamics topics, which are examples of alternative approaches to general relativity and quantum mechanics.

            <p>
             <strong>
              Puthoff took an interest in the Church of Scientology
             </strong>
             in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top OT VII level by 1971.[3] Puthoff wrote up his "wins" for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved "remote viewing" abilities.[4] In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology's Celebrity magazine, stating that Scientology had given him "a feeling of absolute fearlessness".[5] Puthoff severed all connection with Scientology in the late 1970s.[6]

           <p>
            <strong>
             In the 1970s and '80s Puthoff directed a CIA/DIA-funded program at SRI International to investigate paranormal abilities,
            </strong>
            collaborating with Russell Targ in a study of the purported psychic abilities of
            <strong>
             Uri Geller
            </strong>
            [suspected Michael Jackson handler], Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Joseph McMoneagle and others, as part of the Stargate Project. Both Puthoff and Targ became convinced Geller and Swann had genuine psychic powers.[7] However, Geller employed sleight of hand tricks.

            Speaking of 'evolutionary dynamics' that reminds me of a technology-based post I still have to do which ties in Epstein and the Santa Fe Institute and the algorithms they are using to track, monitor and 'nudge' populations through the social media platforms... Gaarrrrr... not enough time for everything...
