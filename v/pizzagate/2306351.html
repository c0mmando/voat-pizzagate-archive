<blockquote>
<p>The US taxpayers were made to pay millions of dollars in financial settlements for hundreds of incidents of Congressperson abuse, including gross sexual harassment, against interns, staff and office employees, of both sexes.  This â€˜slush and shushâ€™ fund was hidden from the American people.  Many abused victims were paid-off and intimidated into silently watching the elected officials parade themselves as paragons of virtue and champions of their voters.  he data, published by Congressional Office of Compliance, covered a period starting in 1997 to November 2017.  In that period, 264 victims of abuse, some by a number of Congresspersons, came forward with their complaints.  The US Treasury secretly paid over $17 million dollars to the victims while the identities of the abusing Congresspersons are not identified and are protected under the 1995 statute. In other words, the members of the US Congress, including serial sexual abusers and uncontrolled bullies, have shielded themselves from public exposure, so they could continue preying on their employees with impunity and without any personal material loss or humiliating exposure to their families.  Thus protected, they could expect to be re-elected to abuse again and the taxpayers would pay their secret â€˜pay-offsâ€™!....</p>
