<p>OK - so far none of these Elite puppets have been proven in a court of law. But its already happened, so HOW is it so unbelievable that the MSM have to attack anyone who sniffs near this, or even suggests powerful politicians and brokers of influence might be involved in paedophile rings?</p>
<p>Those who doubt that, bear in mind that previous British Prime Minister Edward (Ted) Heath (now deceased) was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mike-veale-convinced-edward-heath-paedophile-wiltshire-police-child-sex-abuse-a7588101.html">confirmed as a paedophile by a Chief Constable</a>. A string of victims have come forward and describe Satanic rituals, and even ritual sacrifice, often on his private yacht - that Heath was a member of this <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4240690/Sir-Edward-Heath-accusers-claim-parents-ran-sex-cult.html">Satanic child abuse cult along with their parents</a> and others in power.</p>
<p>The wider agenda as exposed by <a href="https://youtu.be/gv_hfNn3-1s">Mike Cernovich on InfoWars</a> recently and many others over the years - is to find morally weak politicians, compromise them through paedophilia, and blackmail them into being compliant puppets of the Hidden Hand (New World Order, 7th Floor, The Network - whatever you want to call it). They then advance the agenda of the Elites behind the scenes regardless of the interests of the nation or wishes of its citizens. PM Heath was the traitor who lied the UK into the EU under false pretences, when he KNEW its ultimate objective was not a \'trading agreement\' (Common Market) - but ultimately a political union modelled on the Soviet Union</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7I9Iig2PJUA">https://youtu.be/7I9Iig2PJUA</a></p>
<p>So is it any coincidence that Heath - now exposed as a horrific serial paedophile and possible involved in Satanic Ritual Abuse and murder - was ALSO the Prime Minister who will be forever remembered as the traitor who knowingly lied and tricked the British public into the unelected, anti-democratic, corporatocratic dictatorship known as the EU?</p>
<p>NO. The world is run by paedophile puppets, through the unseen hand of even more monstrous entities in the shadows.</p>

            Obama's father figure (and some suspect father since he has the same facial features) Frank Marshall Davis was a published pedophile, communist, and pornographer.  Frank wrote the book Sex Rebel in which he recounts seducing a teenager named Ann and having a gang bang with Ann and his wife.  Obama's best friend from high school, "Ray" a.k.a. Keith said Frank used to take Obama to the local strip club for swingers nights. One of the strippers from the club also stars in some pornography that Frank made of Obama's mom.  When Obama was having writer's block and couldn't figure out how to write his autobiography, he enlisted weather underground terrorist, NAMBLA supporter, and babysitter of his daughters Bill Ayers to help out. Bill Ayers says he actually wrote the autobiography.  That's why Obama's writing contains nautical references from Ayers' time in the merchant marines and scores identically to Ayers' own writing on the Flesch-Kinkaid readability test.  And people wonder why Obama is hiding out in French Polynesia at the moment.

             Good points - yes its so endemic if you have knowledge. Look at normal people: you'd never find an instagram like Alefantis, never mind a whole series of friends with the same shit. OBVIOUS. You'd never find a history of pedo activity in family, friends and associates as these top politicians. OBVIOUS. 
Smoke smoke smoke - of course theres a fucking fire.

            Just because your uncle lives there doesn't mean he is privy to the inner workings of the government.  He is just another sheep on the ground, and that was a "sheep on the ground" report.

            David Icke elaborates on Ted Heath and the elite pedo underworld. It now out in the open. Let's pause and wonder, we have many qualified senators in DC, yet they manage to find Dennis, a pedo-wrestling coach and make him the speaker of the house. Dennis' circle of 'friend' - Tony, Skippy and Mr.Ping Pong - who actually runs the blackmail part of the show, as well as being a satanic pedo cannibal himself. All this is connected via network of secret societies which at the top are all satanic/pedophilic in nature.

            Let's stop calling them elite they are not 
Let's not say we are ruled by them, 6 billion plus people have chosen to give up power.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just realizing that the language we use to describe these people subconsciously binds us. How we use words are power.

            Pedophile means child love or affinity for...
So you see they use the "virtuous" pedophile excuse. Or the "I only love but don't touch" excuse.  Child abuser, molester , rapist is what must be used.  Lebron James is elite, Tesla is elite, these people are genetically flawed psychopaths.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who reads this, please look into NLP, conversational hypnosis or hypnotic language patterns. They are used everyday by ad men and politicians. These weasel phrases are also being used by child abusers. Let's get informed!

             I get the language points. I do. But trying to get a message across i use the vernacular. And elites doesn't mean to me 'special'. In my head it means a superclass who act above the law and are totally corrupted and evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             The argument is the same with left right politics. Its a bogus paradigm, but people understand it, so i still use left / right

             The wider agenda as exposed by Mike Cernovich on InfoWarsYouTube recently and many others over the years

            WE THE PIZZAGATERS exposed the wider agenda! WE THE PIZZAGATERS exposed pedophilia going on throughout the US and the world. If anyone deserves credit for exposing this, it's:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             (1) ANDREW BREITBART; 
(2) JULIAN ASSANGE; 
and (3) the UNKNOWN HACKER AND FEEDER OF INFO TO JULIAN ASSANGE (no, it wasn't Russia)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Stop this blithering and moaning. There are laws on the books that are being shredded, BUT we have one thing that these idiots don't have going for them, and that's that the general public is REPULSED BY THESE CRIMINALS! What you're leaving out is that they're mostly doing it for their own pleasure and to make money ... oh, and to follow some ritualistic religion that isn't a religion at all. They can think they're aliens with superhuman reptilian powers, but they're just a bunch of scum that got together. That's all this is is scumbags getting together and sticking together through secret oaths to destroy the US and all other countries for the mission of creating a NWO.
           </p>
           <p>
            WE have the power! Just like I had the power to unsubscribe from that traitor Cernovch. He can think he's some big manipulator, but when when someone comes out with statements so outrageous and so wrong, he can go to hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that we know, we have to be smarter about who we elect, and what laws are passed. Never support legislation that can be used down the line to obscure or cover up these criminals. There is a pedo ring in Washington, and what's GOING ON IN THE US IS WHAT WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON! When those Cannibal Elites are in jail is when we can help around the world. Each of us needs to fix what is wrong in our own countries or nothing will ever get accomplished.

             Yes, these people think that they are above everyone, but they have been doing to this for centuries and centuries.  They have an agenda and it's far more powerful than one can imagine.  This goes far beyond the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             The general public does not know or does not want to know about this.  It just seems like a lot of people are on this train but when I look around and listen to people, they are not!  Not at all.  We need a huge portion of the world's population to understand what is going on here.  Rather, people have their faces buried in the cellphones, video games and tv's totally oblivious to what is going on around them believing everything that is being fed to them by msm and the rest of the garbage on tv.  People still watch soap operas for God's sake and shows like Survivor or Keeping up the the fkg Kardashians.  That is where most people are at, at least from what I see.
And from what I see on Voat recently is that many are not getting along.  Nothing but pointing fingers at this one or that one and complaining about who did what.  It is very disheartening and I am losing my interest in going on this site as much as I have, because of all the in-fighting.

              Don't get disheartened. The in-fighting is good. That's what a democracy is about. A democracy tolerates and is healthy because of arguing and working things out. Fascist governments don't have that. Besides, this is too important to not question an odd stance or disinfo. I believe that some have gotten the brunt of people's frustrations, but then again, we don't know if these are shills.  I know who I trust, who I used to trust, and who I trust now. I communicate my thoughts and if people agree, fine. If they don't, that's also fine. The only thing I don't want to see happen is for people to give up, but fighting to arrive at a truth? It's not all bad.

                Yeah, I get you. I was riding high in April when Cernovch and Jones shot me down before I reached May. Never saw that coming. I did more thinking on this and I'm sure some names are gonna come out. Why else would they be floating that staffers were drugged and compromised? Yeah, if somebody's with an underage kid, they're getting kicked to the curb.

             1 - Its quite clear that I gave Mike Cernovich's link because its recent, topical, discussed on here ad nauseam, and because its about pedo-control politics. I added the caveat 'and many others over the years' - because people in the alternative media have been exposing it far longer than PizzaGate has been around - and certainly fair longer than 'we the PizzaGaters' - however massive our impact.  I am not interested - in a short OP about the Pedophocracy - in playing games of 'he's a shill, she's a shill'.
            </p>
            <p>
             2 - "Credit" - my post wasn't about credit or some league table of PizzaGate heroes. I was using an example most people would be familiar with for the sake of elaborating a point. And neither was my post meant to be exhaustive or cover all angles, so "What you're leaving out is that they're mostly doing it for their own pleasure and to make money" - thats the point, they were chosen because they ARE CORRUPTIBLE and of course that corruption (addiction to vices, power, money) is exactly why they were chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
             2 - "Stop this blithering and moaning" - I GUARANTEE you that you wouldn't have the balls to say this if we were face-to-face. And if by some miracle you did, you would instantly regret it. Rule of thumb: if you wouldn't say something in person, reconsider the wisdom of saying it on a forum, or at least consider how it comes across.
            </p>
            <p>
             Apart from that, the rest of it i thoroughly agree with :-)

              Thanks for the explanation. Yes, people have been exposing things in the media, but nobody ... NOBODY has written about the connections Pizzagaters have found. NOBODY. As to your second point, I get that you can't cover all bases. Now as to this third ... hmmmm .... To begin with, my first reaction in most situations is not to boil over and pound someone in the face. There are a limited number of scenarios I would do that ... the molesting of a child is one where I would physically try to stop the abuse if I could. Even if I couldn't, I'd risk bodily harm. So your saying this is odd ... for me, not for you. We're ALL saying things about groups of elites and people that could crush us. It wouldn't take any effort at all. So if I thought that were a reason not to say something, I wouldn't be here. I'd be covering my own ass. I can't speak for you, so won't try.
             </p>
             <p>
              I appreciate your post and the fact you're speaking out. It's what we all should do. It's in the disagreeing that greater truth is found. Thanks.

             I fully agree but feel I must mention that although majorly represented in this forum by Americans, the 'us' of which you speak as in support of this cause are represented by citizens of other countries, all equally angered at what's happening within their country too.  The 'pizzagate' issue may well have been born in the US but the problem it circumvents is global.  We are all in support of the overriding issue of highlighting the elitist ritualistic (including satanic) abuse of our children.  This is not just a US problem.

              Thanks for the good words, but you missed the point I was making. I was saying that the citizens of each country are responsible FOR CLEANING UP THEIR COUNTRY! If you're American, clean the hell up America! Then you're free to help someone else. Americans have NO authority to be telling the French what they should be doing. The FRENCH NEED to be telling themselves &amp; their government what to do.. The same with the British, Germans, etc., etc., down the line. I was also speaking about Americans diluting their efforts by funding yahoos headed out around the world to film what's going on in Mumbai or wherever. Is there a problem in Mumbai or wherever? Probably, YES! But, again, Americans don't have the authority to police Mumbai! But in cleaning up the disgusting pedo traffic going on in the US, you'll be helping Mumbai since many of the trafficking victims are most likely headed here! So the point is: CLEAN UP YOUR OWN GODDAMNED COUNTRY! That's what's incumbent on us all. The US has a tremendous problem right now because of the elite pedos letting in MS-13 and changing our legislation to legalizing teenage prostitution. There's no way to record the trafficking taking place now, and the victims are free to be shipped around with no tracking by authorities. Anyway, that's the point. Everyone clean up your own country. We all have countries to save from these monsters so do it at home ... then you can reach out and help others.

                It's because they don't want to run the country. The first step is admitting that WE abdicated power. Every time we said we're too busy to get involved, or that fighting something is too much trouble, WE gave away our freedom because we didn't want to keep control. WE let things get this bad. WE let corporations run things and put mom and pop stores out of business. WE gave excuses like better pricing and convenience, but Walmart would have never destroyed the environment and become the monster it became without the slaves condoning and prostituting themselves at the elite's altar.
               </p>
               <p>
                If this really is a pedophile elite situation, and this elite cabal is using human trafficking as a way to blackmail, raise money, and entertain themselves, it is inherent upon us to put them out of business. No whining (okay maybe a little), no complaining (okay, maybe a little of that, too), but we don't give in on this issue. Whoever is involved needs to be weeded out and jailed. These people are a collective and do things for their common good, so if you leave one, they'll start insidiously looking for others of their ilk.

               I hear you, and agree to an extent.  However,  although I'm 
 UK based I commit to helping research where I can as I feel that eventual exposure of one will inevitably precede exposure of more, or even all.  It is a fact that since joining Voat much of my research has involved US based information and of course, I'm able to also insert relevant UK data where it fits thus contributing to the global issue.  I just don't think this can be solved by only looking in our 'own backyard'.  It has to be collective and collaborative, because the connections are unavoidable.  If there are few loose threads on this side of the pond then it may help to find some to tug at in the other.  All to the collective good, I say.

              Have no idea. I let the first few mistakes slide, but this one? NO! I don't care if he broke the Susan Rice story! It was probably given to him  because: (1) no one will prosecute her or Obama; (2) it adds legitimacy to Cernovich which he then blows by denying/debunking pizzagate? Oh, hell, no! NO!

               The Susan Rice story is not the real story. That is a distraction. It was an intentional trap and he fell for it. The real story is FBI #2 Andrew McCabe who is blocking the entire pizzagate, pedogate, HRC server, Awan Spy Ring Server. 
Next is the #TheHammer story which should be trending. This is the NSA whistleblower who came to R-Devin Nunes
in person on the whitehouse grounds with an attourney. He had blown the whistle on a supercomputer that spies on all of us 24/7 two years ago and was deposed by the FBI.
              </p>
              <p>
               James Comey knew all about it as did everyone else. DTrump told the truth about the tapping. The unmasking might have been asked for by Rice and Brennan &amp; Clapper have been illegally spying for Obamas term, but McCabe of the FBI is the story.

               Yes! That is almost certainly the case. It looks like they're pushing him to be the spokesperson so that his ties to Epstein can then be exposed and he'll bring down the entire movement.

                Cernovich is a believer in 'any publicity is good publicity.'  Whichever way the wind blows. (Or whichever way fame and fortune blows.)

            Agreed. Those who have the money (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, etc) run the show. Funny how people can't understand that money rules everything.

             That's what most people believe. But we have numbers. There are a lot more of US than THEM.  We need to take back our power. Remember "the power of the people"? When enough of us are awoke, there's nothing we can't do. We gave over our power to authority, but they have abused it. It's time to take it back! I think there will be a tipping point in the near future when we say, enough is enough, and stand up to the big, bad wolf. Right now, with all the campaigns against us, they're scared. And they should be.

              In part, the reason having the numbers wins is because we also collectively have more money.

              Yes! We do have the numbers, and I believe we can use that to our advantage, provided we can get people to wake up. Prior to Pizzagate, I never realized how "asleep" I was...I heard news stories about this stuff, but it never sunk in. I think that's the problem now...it's out there, but people are so brainwashed that they just gloss over it and don't notice anything, even when it's right in their faces.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think having numbers on our side is the best way to pressure Trump into acting. He's got enough info to take out high-ranking people, he's just got to act on it. The more people wake up and demand action, the quicker he will move, I think.

                The only thing that worries me is this, if it is to be believed (I don't believe anything right off the bat anymore):

                The anon says if Trump waits too long, his window of opportunity will pass. That worries me. Personally, I've upped my redpilling game since it came out. If it's true, we need to up our numbers as high as possible as quickly as we can.

            The life blood of these people is the cooperation that is given them by the people at large which in effect condones their sick behavior. Voting and paying taxes is nothing less than condoning their actions and paying for a front row seat. I know that many will balk at the suggestion to quit paying Caesar's Tribute for fear of prosecution but nothing less will ever succeed. I've watched the FEDERAL government degenerate to such an extent that D.C. epitomizes what the Arab world calls "The GREAT SATAN." When the so-called government is failing the people at every instance and on every issue which would include at the very least protecting our children, something dramatic must be done.

            We silent majority members will never be heard until we stop financing our own demise and worse, the demise  of our children at the hands of these ghouls. If you are funding the FEDERAL GOVT (owned and operated by the FEDERAL RESERVE) and don't feel like an absolute fool then you're too stupid to resist their evil and are no good for our posterity.

            I agree with you.  Whilst we little people can't bring these criminals to justice, we can continue to shine on a light on them and their actions.
