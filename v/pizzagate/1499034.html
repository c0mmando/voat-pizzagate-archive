            There is totally a link between Khaballism and Satanism, but sadly it is not just limited to the Jewish faith. There is, in fact, a bunch of evidence that shows that nearly every religion on the planet has been infested and infected by the Luciferian "Mystery Religion". For instance, you may know that Christmas is a Pagan holiday and that Dec 25th was in fact the birthday of Nimrod, King of Babylon. When Nimrod died his wife Semiramis placed him near a dead evergreen tree and his blood soaked into the roots and made the tree anew (this is where Xmas trees likely come from). There are a ton more examples and this hole goes deep.  Occult types reference the Kabbalah in their own works quite heavily. It seems that the mystery religion uses Hebrew as its language of choice for the alpha-numeric symbols in many of their magic rituals that you can find in books by Elphias Levi, Crowley, Helena Blavatsky, etc... . Sadly, these facts will be lost on over 75% of people here who are looking at this investigation thru an entirely different lens. I think the truth of the scope of this issue is simply too horrifying for people to believe. This is literally a spiritual war being waged now and it all started back when Cain killed Abel. The Luciferian Mystery religion has propigated thru the ages under many names and forms but their patterns of behavior or symbolism remain the same if you have eyes to see. Every religion is affected: Christian, Jewish, etc. Truth really is stranger than fiction.

             I posted information that mod Phobos_mothership didn't approve of.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is what he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             " Post links and reliable sources backing up your claims and support the fact that this is related to pizzagate, and I will stop deleting these posts. But since you probably can't, I probably won't."
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             So then I posted this and factually sourced ever single claim.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop

            </p>
            <p>
             Then he used this excuse instead.
            </p>
            <p>
             " This is not a Satanism investigation subverse. Read the rules"
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "That is not what I said. I said prove a direct link between ANY of this bullshit and PIZZAGATE. THIS IS NOT A SATANIST INVESTIGATING SUB."
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             So at first he said he was censoring me because I wasn't sourcing my claims, and then after I source everything he says that Pizza isn't about Satanism, which we all know is bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's deleting other people's comments as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             " my bad, comment was deleted in error as I was deleting the post (its been a crazy day, if you look at the modlog for removals)"
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989">

            <p>
             And this next comment explains his mentality.
            </p>
            <p>
             " the burden of proof is on you, shillfuck"

             This is the mods attempting to control the narrative. They're the gatekeepers.  Funny how his first excuse was that it was wasn't sourced, then he says Satanism has nothing to do with child sacrifice and pedophila.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is fucking disgusting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw, I'm fairly certain that he's the other mod KingKong.
            </p>
            <p>
             I going to start running the mod's comments through a speech analysis program to identify patterns and figure out which mods are using alts to pose as different mods.
            </p>
            <p>
             This subverse is compromised and I'm going to expose everything. I won't give up.
