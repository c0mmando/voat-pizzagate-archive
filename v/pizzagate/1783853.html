<p>This is related to Pedogate because high level people in our Local, State, and Federal Government are committing horrific crimes against children OR are complicit in the abuse so that they can rise higher in politics.    Ed Murray started in the 80\'s to promote the gay agenda in Seattle and Portland and has been accused of Child Sexual Abuse for decades.      Classic tactics like saying the victims are not credible and painting them to be nutjobs were used and Ed Murray rose to be the god damn mayor of one of the largest cities in America.

           <p>
            Seattle's homosexual mayor, Ed Murray, who is accused of molesting three teenage boys in the 80's, is now being sued by one of his victims.
           </p>

            Murray is running for e-election this year and denies everything, but there are two other victims who have surfaced producing similar details to the accuser in the lawsuit: details about Murray’s 1980s Capitol Hill apartment, Murray’s phone number at the time, and a description of the mayor’s genitals: both D.H. and Anderson describe Murray as having an unusual bump or mole on his penis and bright red pubic hair.

            A 1992 study published in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, sex researchers K. Freud and R. I. Watson found that homosexual males are three times more likely than straight men to engage in pedophilia and that the average pedophile victimizes between 20 and 150 boys before being arrested.

            Here is my original post, entitled "Seattle's Homosexual Mayor Accused of Molesting Three Teenage Boys". I linked to the Seattle Times article on the lawsuit and more:
           </p>
           <p>
            Seattle's homosexual mayor, Ed Murray, who is accused of molesting three teenage boys in the 80's, is now being sued by one of his victims.

            Of course he is, that actually makes a lot of sense. Taxpayer money went to painting crosswalks rainbows in that city, couple years ago. Then the whole transgender push, then the Sanctuary City chest puffing... yeah, to find out he's a pedo is not exactly a big ol' shock to the system. Of course.

             Ya,  whats your point?     This happened back in the 80's.   Statute of limitations for criminal trial is long gone.  Just like Cosby and most other child rapists.    Civil trial has no statute.

             The point of my post is that the mayor of Seattle is an alleged pedophile.   The MSM is not covering it at all and it needs to be.   To move up the political food chain you have to have some kind of blackmail that can be held above you to keep you in line and vote the way the puppet masters want them to vote.  Ed Murray is a prime example of that -  we need to have his name be in every household in America and his lawsuit be covered in the same way Bill Cosby and other perverts are being covered.
