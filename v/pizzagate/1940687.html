<p>At this point, it\'s either Russia hacked the emails or SR leaked the emails. If President Trump successfully navigates out of the Russia narrative, well then the question must be asked, who is responsible for the leaked emails? Which opens the door into a SR investigation. Why did they kill the whistleblower? Why did the media cover it up? Why did Comey cover it up? Who ordered the hit? Did Hillary know? Did Obama know? Bernie? What was in those emails that was so important? Is this why she had a private server in her basement? Why is Podesta speaking in food-related code language?</p>

&quot;My dear friend, Steve Scalise, took a bullet for all of us.

            The American people should demand the moving of Scalise to a different hospital and different doctor. One of Trump's own choosing. If the people don't back Trump, nothing will change. He needs your help guys. Give it to him.

            I believe there was a false flag element to the shooting but my theory differs than yours.
           </p>
           <p>
            I applaud your imagination but I find your theory unlikely, mostly because Trump IS part of the Deep State. He is a sick man, every time I point out his connections to Epstein it gets hidden by the mods.

            "While Donald Trump deals with the aftermath of lewd comments he made about women back in 2005, the public still has not gotten any real answers about at least another potentially problematic aspect of Trump’s history: his past friendship with billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein."

            I know a lot of us had major hope for Trump but he just isn't bringing down the house of cards.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is a very useful distraction, they are milking it for all it's worth. Do you really think they would let a ROGUE POTUS in now days? It's just not going to happen, Trump is no JFK.

            Pizzagate is not a partisan issue, if people are on here saying crap like "lefty libtards" they are part of the problem.

              This is the part most people miss. Those that can't see clearly or did not follow the FBI Vault that explained it all. Trump is a covert double agent. His father was early on. His Uncle John Trump was an MIT engineer who examined Teslas work upon his death. Do the research. How do everyone think he knows this information. He was recruited by white hats. Follow along

            Trump won't do a damn thing to save Scalise. Trump is a coward and a moron. He is not the hero we need. Trump is never going to drain the swamp the swamp will drain Trump and he will resign in disgrace possibly before the end of this year. Trump could have saved Scalise if he had taken him out of the death hospital and back to the White House where they have the best medical facility in the country in the basement with the best doctors. Trump doesn't have the courage to do this. Sad!

Thank God the WHOLE WORLD is watching Scalise otherwise they would have killed him off like they did with poor Seth Rich.  Shame RICH did not get this coverage on the MSM he might have been alive today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Heard that Dr. Savas girlfriend worked for Podesta, not sure how true.

             Exactly. I think the supposed kill list is fakery planted afterwards/made up to make people think it was about more than scalise. Pretty lame attempt actually. Like a bad spy movie written by high schoolers.

             Dem Rep. Steny Hoyer sends P!ZZA to Scalise's office after shooting.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Hoyer was a defense attorney for pedophile Raymond (Rocky) Latham in 1979...Latham was a serial offender.
first arrested for a sex offense in Florida in 1942..Later in Columbus, Ohio, he was convicted of 14 counts of sodomy against minors and served time in the Ohio prison system from 1953 to 1962...He also served eight months in jail in Howard County on sex offenses after a 1974 conviction
           </p>
           <p>
            "He was arrested in December 1977 on charges of sex offenses involving boys in Prince George's County. In September 1979, on the advice of Steny Hoyer, his attorney at the time, he agreed to plead guilty to second- and third-degree sex offenses involving two boys."
           </p>
           <p>
            "With a history of molesting and an example of revolving door justice, "Latham had served 16 months of a 16-year sentence at the Maryland Correctional Institute in Jessup when he was paroled on Sept. 17 of last year. Between then and May of this year
            <em>
             1983
            </em>
            , when he was arrested, he molested 10 boys in Prince George's and Montgomery counties, police charge."
           </p>
           <p>
            The article continues describing more offenses, his association with NAMBLA..."Latham strongly believes that there is nothing wrong with sex between men and boys."...
           </p>
           <p>
            "He gives the impression "that in every other way, he is a positive citizen," says his former attorney Hoyer, now a U.S. representative.
Police call Latham a "pied piper" who befriends boys from poor and broken homes and treats them to pizza and ice skating, new clothes and trips to amusement parks."

           </p>
           <p>
            Hoyer was also part of: FBI's "Innocent Images" undercover task force for Maryland law-enforcement officials, who were hosted by Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, at the Show Place Arena in Upper Marlboro Thursday, August 30, 2000
           </p>
           <p>
            "The 3-year-old "Innocent Images" task force is one of the FBI's most successful: 653 arrests, 653 indictments or charges filed, 598 convictions (a success rate of 91.6 percent), and 988 searches executed.
The program's success indicates not only the agents' ability but also "the explosive growth of trading child porn on the Web," Mr. Hoyer said."

              Hoyer isn't Latham, he defended Latham...and since then he's been involved in hosting a showcase event for FBI's undercover task force internet CP/predator sting operation.  So while I haven't seen to indicate that he should be jailed, one does have to question why did he send a pizza to Scalise's office after the shooting?  'Oh hey, sorry your boss was shot...here, enjoy a pizza as you wait to see if he's going to die.'  (Plus the connotations of Pizza in pedo rings...)  'He was interested in protecting kids from predators?  Wow who knew...hope there's enough slices for everyone in the office!'

             All that needs to be said is it takes one to know one. That is how these guys stay in power. They are at the very top and control who actually gets arrested and how much time they will serve if any. How else would an a club about man-boy sex NAMBLA ever stay in operation. Protection.

            Pizzagate needed investigating before 2016 after all.

             Remind me again why the cia/nsa would leak the emails? How does that work exactly.. To distract from what.. When you consider that child trafficking and sacrifice is the number one secret tool of manipulation and energy source of these sickos why would they risk exposure of these networks which all this clearly is doing. Its created a massive worldwide investigation.. 
One possible reason I can think of is ..expose the dark cabals worst secrets to the world so that then we get a fake kind of disclosure of alien good guys in the near future who then offer us a solution which is basically subservience to a enlightened group of beings who offer a new era of global peace and good will which is really the nwo one world system but everyone accepts it.
BTW I'm not buying it. Just an idea.

            Somebody knowledgeable needs to be with Scalise 24-7. If they can't get away with killing him they might drug and torture him into submitting to their pressure to back off any new laws or investigations of child trafficking and sexual abuse.

            This sounds crazy but it actually rings true. This is why I believe Trump showed up stealth to the hospital with his own doctor. It seems he shocked Dr. Sava.

            Sen. Flake is the senator that was allegedly named as a high ranking pedophile told to General Flynn. General Flynn refused to tell VP Pence the info because it was his "best friend" That is the real reason of the "firing" of General Flynn.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact he took a call from Obama is sickening since he cries fake tears and spins his days trashing Trump &amp; those like Scalise.

               im beginng to think so too, im thinking its about getting people behind the republican party and plug some people back to the matrix. get troops for trump so they can take all the "regressives" down. people dont realize that the conspiracy crowd is a demographic that is being targeted by the msm now.
