<p>I have to agree with this commentator. This story also rocked my world and shifted my reality. </p>
<p>A quick summary:</p>
<p>There are thousands of children being held in cages in the US. Their crime: born to parents who decided to illegally cross the border. The parents are sent back home but the US separates them from their children and keeps them in detention camps where they are &quot;treated like dogs&quot;. The children are escorted to the bathroom, hands tied behind their backs. </p>
<p>&quot;This story is a test. The NSA and CIA watch and monitor everything. They are monitoring the public\'s reaction to this story. This is when thousands of people need to be on the street with signs - this is the test! If we let this happen, if we do nothing, if don\'t scream STOP RIGHT NOW!, ten years from now it might be YOU.&quot;</p>
<p>It only takes them 8 hours to flip a WalMart from a functioning store to one of these detention centers. Nothing\'s bolted down in a WalMart. So they can easily convert them into detention centers. This is even on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn\'t about the left and the right. It\'s to see if American\'s will finally get outraged.&quot; </p>
<p>He argues that boycotting WalMart would get them to change their actions. I have to disagree. I think WalMart has likely always been a government operation with this use as the intention all along. It does not rely on your dollar to stay afloat.</p>',

            When Sam Walton died the pentacle or inverted pentagram was adopted instead the dash in the Wal-Mart logo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some history on the Walmart property:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1978 a worker of Dr Compton's found an alter on the property. Dr Compton's neighbour was Sam Walton.  In the center of the alter was ‘the skull of a cow, and then all around it these rocks had been painted.'  There had been  a series of animal mutilations in Bentonville.  A few weeks later another alter was found on the property.  On it was a plastic human skull, some candles, a large knife and more of the peculiar symbols, someone had left a message scrawled in painted white letters: “Zyto's wrath is upon you.”  The symbols were found to be of the Theban alphabet, the “magical ciphers” used by modern witches.  In ‘all. four cows and a horse have been killed this year in an apparently ritualistic fashion that involved cutting out their eyes, tongues and reproductive organs.  Dr. Compton was making arrangements to sell the property to his next‐door neighbor, Sam Walton. It was not just the altars that bothered him, Dr. Compton said. ... there had been other strange goings‐on, like the gunfire the neighbors had been hearing around midnight.

            On Walmart tunnels:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            From someone living about a Walmart tunnel:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I live about three store lengths away from the shutdown Midland, TX Walmart and I first reported a suspected tunnel to the DEA in Jan 2012 but they never looked. I was then shot from 2 3/4 inches above the floor inside my home two weeks later by somebody who was obviously standing underground. After I fall to the ground I find my phone lines dead so I knew they tried to murder me. I crawled out of my home to save my life. A few minutes later two people dressed like police showed up to my home without being dispatched and disabled my front security cameras and before the night was over a group of people "dressed like police" who I believe to be police were caught on camera sneaking into my home to steal evidence and stage the crime scene. The police reports show that no police had been dispatched to my home or were at my home for another three days. In spite of this incredible evidence, the press won't report this story and no arrest have been made in this capital attempted murder.

            Is Walmart sex-trafficking:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Walmart is a massive Child Sex Trafficking Front that works with DHS. FEMA, CIA and numerous other unconstitutional "federal agencies" to transport and kidnap children and adults and ship them around the country.
             <br/>
             Walmart always has missing children posters as you walk into the store, I have often wondered if those are sales flyers for people in the know"

            Phil Schneider talks about Walmart underground tunnels:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Phil Schneider worked in the DUMBs (Deep Underground Military Bases). He was “suicided”. Schneider said that the underground tunnel network is extensive. This network to the NWO airport of Denver, Colorado. These underground tunnels don’t just connect to military bases and installations; they also connect to the rich houses of the elite (Kelley talks about the underground tunnels connecting to houses and the Getty Museum)

            I'd say part of the reason there isn't enough eyes on this amongst the "awakened" folks is mental overload.

            On my end, an intel sharing op bore some massive fruit yesterday, been investigating two pedowood cases (still haven't ID'd one of the culprits for the O'Rourke case and a wikileaks thread gave me a horrifying conclusion regarding the Barsi case), and I may have recently found an asian counterpart to pedowood.

              I don't know. White people in the US are now in the minority, and I don't want to assume white people are really that prejudiced as a whole. This story probably tugs at any AWAKE person who sees it (and believes even a portion of it!) unless they are swayed by CNN's propaganda ("it's for their own good, the US is really benevolent and just doing their best to serve the innocent").
             </p>
             <p>
              The true reason(s) that no one is down there raising awareness, protesting and marching, are far more chilling than simple racial bias. Although to be fair, anyone watching MSM for their news or entertainment are being PROGRAMMED CONSTANTLY to see brown and black people as dangerous. So I guess my argument is, "forgive them for they know not what they do"...
             </p>
             <p>
              Besides the programming, the reasons for the lack of an uprising are far more chilling. We've been flourided, sprayed from above, we're swimming in a soup of 5-G and all kinds of cancer-causing chaotic energy fields, none of us have enough money to live, we are fed GMOs and told there is no reason to hope for a good future. Hillary can steal and election, the FBI can help her, and she won't get in trouble. That plan fails so we hear about it being Russia's fault, without proof, whilst the powers that be KNOWINGLY mess with a nuclear power.
             </p>
             <p>
              It seems everything is bend on destruction right now. And if what we've learned from Pizzagate is true (and it is) the reason for this is that the world is run by a handful of families who actually legitimately worship satan, and do this all for him.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think people are numbed down, dumbed down, programmed with deception, and very sick both physically and energetically.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also we get so much thrown at us we can't appropriately react to any of it.
             </p>

              One reason i came down so hard on the psyop run by Craig Sawyer was that i noticed the very day this WalMart story broke and started going viral, was the very day the AZ camp claimed they found a dead baby skull. Like a play written by Soros, the news of a skull captured everyone, for a whole week, until Sawyer decided "oh, nevermind". THAT was the energy, the people, the awareness, the resources we needed at that very moment to respond to WalMart. That was when I saw how dangerous he is, working for the CIA no doubt.

               I believe the number of ",unaccompanied" minors crossing the border is highly exaggerated ( possibly to deceive Americans) I believe that most minors are accompanied by a parent, uncle or aunts grandparent I think it's untrue that 1 000's of minors cross alone.

               I’ve been leery of Sawyer from the start mainly because I don’t trust YT Idols. We have to remember to not run with a story, keep researching but in the back of our minds also realize that what we are working on could be a psyop. I got downvoated just for suggesting that we take things slow and look at all the evidence and step back a moment. I fully agree with your comment.

             He speaks of photographs that were available online right after the story broke, showing the conditions inside. He says that soon after, the pictures were removed and the web was littered with pictures of other facilities, and cleaned up, even photo-shopped images are now coming up in a Google image search. He surmises that mainstream media is covering the story: to whitewash it, and because originally it supported their anti-Trump mandate (until we found out that policies leading to this detention camp lies in Obama's lap).

            This is a real problem but after doing a little research, I found different sides to the story. " HHS can place unaccompanied children in an appropriate setting while a sponsor is identified who can care for the child while their immigration case proceeds. It helps protect the border but also prevents vulnerable kids to fall into the hands of traffickers, officials said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The lack of parental protection, and the hazardous journey they take, make unaccompanied alien children vulnerable to human trafficking, exploitation and abuse,” the HHS official said.

            I'm sure you all know there is a battle for the truth from the news sources. Each side being political in telling their particular slant on each story. We need to be careful and not assume one source is right and all others are wrong. This information war is mind boggling.

               Sorry, I meant in the detention camp(s). Did you watch the video? This isn't the only one. That's why Trump tweeted that this policy goes back to the Obama era. There are 10,000 kids in these camps at this time.

                Okay, so you're not saying any one child would have been held for four years.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have to say that if the conditions reported by news media inside Casa Padre are typical, I'd rather have the kids taken care of there than handed over to CPS and the corrupt foster system where their chances of being sexually abused skyrocket.
               </p>
               <p>
                What is the alternative if the parents who brought them here are in jail for breaking the law?  The kids obviously can't go to jail with their parents.  Congress needs to change the law and allow immediate deportation for parents and kids who cross the border illegally so they're not caught up in our long legal process.  But so far Congress won't take action.

                 Have you watched the video? I know it's long but it would make this back and forth easier. I said that the four years was not in regard to this location, the guy in the video is talking about multiple similar facilities. He did not say no one was being held 4 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The parents are not being jailed, they are being deported, back to their country. This is no justification for the U.S. To separate them from their children and keep the children here, no matter what conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Independent article I linked you, that was used as a reference in the video, says that these kids only get two hours of outdoor free time per day, where they are allowed outside. They rest of e time they are locked up inside the WalMart. This is just like jail.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This situation can't be made right by comparing it with child care services, in my opinion. Your argument relies on he assumption more trafficking and pedophilia exists in CPS than we would see at this WalMart. I would have to see proof of this, it doesn't sound accurate. The fact that a U.S. Congressman was disallowed from entering when he came leads me to believe what is going on inside (unless they are prepared for cameras) is not good, certainly no better than CPS.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My alternative, not that it changes this story or the need for us to react, would be to send the families back to their homeland INTACT.

                  I have not read anywhere a news report that says parents are being deported while their children remain in a detention center in the U.S.  If this is true, of course it is abominable!  Do you have a link to a news report or govt. document/report that supports this allegation?

                    That's weird.  I just tried again, and I saw it for a split second before it disappeared.  I'll have to look into my settings.  In any event, I did rewatch using the save by derram, and it hasn't changed from what I saw before--some guy passionately sharing his beliefs but not backing up anything he says.

                   <p>
                    I guess you and I are just different.  I generally don't believe something just because someone says it's true unless they're in a position to know that it's true.  So, for instance, why can't this YouTuber take the time to find the video for us that he says shows children being escorted to the toilet with their hands behind their backs?  Why does he keep showing old photos from the Obama admin. and saying that's what's going on now?  Maybe it is, but he's not showing anything to support it.  The photos that the Texas facility provided for the news stories don't show cages or even kids sleeping on floors.  He calls the photos fake, but many news reporters have actually visited the facility and they're not saying the photos are fake.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you can find something to support the allegation that parents are being deported while their kids are still being held in U.S. detention centers, that would be a bombshell.
                   </p>

                    Sorry to be argumentative, Trendy, but facts are important in this work.  It's the only thing that can give credibility to our cause.  I'll sign off here and wish you a good evening.

            Hillary sat on the Board of Walmart
            <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-dcfs-george-sheldon-met-20170503-story.html">
             http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-dcfs-george-sheldon-met-20170503-story.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In six years as a member of the Wal-Mart board of directors, between 1986 and 1992, Hillary Clinton remained silent as the world's largest retailer waged a major campaign against labor unions seeking to represent store workers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton has been endorsed for president by more than a dozen unions, according to her campaign Web site, which omits any reference to her role at Wal-Mart in its detailed biography of her.
           </p>
           <p>
            A former board member told ABCNews.com that he had no recollection of Clinton defending unions during more than 20 board meetings held in private.
           </p>
           <p>
            The tapes show Clinton in the role of a loyal company woman. "I'm always proud of Wal-Mart and what we do and the way we do it better than anybody else," she said at a June 1990 stockholders meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton would not agree to be interviewed on the subject but now says she no longer shares Wal-Mart's values and believes unions "have been essential to our nation's success."
           </p>
           <p>
            Sen. Clinton has recently sought to distance herself from Wal-Mart.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a campaign speech last year in New Hampshire, Sen. Clinton said, "Now I know that Wal-Mart's policies do not reflect the best way of doing business and the values that I think are important in America."
           </p>
           <p>
            Her Senate campaign returned a $5,000 contribution from a Wal-Mart Political Action Committee, although ABCNews.com discovered another $20,000 in contributions from Wal-Mart executives and lobbyists.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the New York Times, Sen. Clinton "maintains close ties to Wal-Mart executives through the Democratic Party and the tightly knit Arkansas business community." The May 20, 2007 article also reported that her husband, former President Clinton, "speaks frequently to Wal-Mart's current chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr." and held a private dinner at the Clinton's New York home in July 2006 for him.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a written statement, Clinton spokesperson Wolfson said, "As President, she will fight alongside labor to promote the economic growth of America's middle class." He said Clinton strongly believes Wal-Mart workers should be able to unionize and bargain collectively.
           </p>
           <p>
            He did not directly respond when asked why she did not quit the board over the company's anti-union efforts. "Wal-Mart was Arkansas's largest employer when Sam Walton asked Sen. Clinton to join the board," he said. "As the first woman to join Wal-Mart's board, she worked hard to make it a better corporate citizen."
           </p>
           <p>
            In its statement, Wal-Mart described Sen. Clinton as "a valuable contributor" who "pushed us to be a better company."
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, I am sure the Clintons have nothing to do with these shuttered Walmarts.  Hmm.  Southwest Key donates to the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now this was a Complete Surprise.

             I have the same question. I thought it was Obama's administration that kept children in cages in detention centers without their parents. It's difficult to get the truth from media these days. If this is true, we need to protest the inhumane treatment of these children.

            I remember, maybe a year or two ago after one of the major hurricanes, I saw a really weird local news story from the area concerning a Walmart
           </p>
           <p>
            the anchor was interviewing a bearded man who had decided he did not want to go to the Walmart rescue center - when the bearded man got a chance to speak he started saying, "They're holding people in there and killing them. I'm not a crazy homeless person, I am a local police officer--"
           </p>
           <p>
            then they cut the feed abruptly mid-sentence and continued on nervously w some other live reporter - I'll see if I can find a link to the video...

            wtf I remember being called crazy for warning folks that the cult was planning on using walmart facilities as neighborhood fema camps... lo and behold... should become evident to most that we are in the early stages of a wicked social transition at the least. this would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.

            "CNN investigates" was one of the first things I saw. Surely this won't be used as an attempt to garner even more support for keeping illegal invaders at a time when everyone knows they all need to fucking go back.

             One could reply "what else is new" to literally any one of the submissions to this sub. There does have to be a breaking point though, where we see a clear plan of action to make our voices heard. This seems to be it for me, and I guess i'm not alone.
