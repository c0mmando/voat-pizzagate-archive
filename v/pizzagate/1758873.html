             and read 
the several threads prior to submitting.   It was not made clear on the threads when the broadcast aired.  One of the completely inaccurate posts is on the "HOT"  list .  Before proclaiming the  bombshell news that pizzagate is out in the open per the NBC Today Show, one better check additional sources for accuracy.
As far as everybody knowing everything already, I knew nothing because the threads were vague.  More info was needed.  So there you have it.

             Anyway, how 'bout changing that "Yeah, we know it.." to "Yeah, I know it."  Lots of cockiness and smart-ass attitudes on voat.  It's rather humerous.
