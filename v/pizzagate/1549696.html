<p>I had the idea to look at the sex offender registry near the White House (2-mile radius). I went looking around, and found Dr. Robert Paul Dickey. Convicted of CP possession in December 2013. No indication that he had images of his patients, who he saw in his office, which he operated from his home. </p>

<p>So, he\'s deceased as of 9/12/16, traffic accident. He was cycling when a car that was stopped at a red light went forward on green and hit him. Can\'t find any further info on the driver.</p>

<p>If you go look, he is still listed on the registry even though he\'s deceased. However, if you click on his name to get details, you might get a 404 page, but the link worked once for me.</p>

            See attached document. Physician I actually know is listed- M. Ryan. I have no investigative skills, and hesitant to even put this here. But now that it is seen by others....  I have zero evidence. Zero.

              The doctor (M Ryan) listed on the document above, which I provided,  indicates treatment w the abused children by these hideous people, I suppose to keep them well for further abuse. See his name on the document. I know him personally. I have no evidence that this is true, but was absolutely shocked to come upon his name and his address (which is true) here when reading about Pizzagate. It doesn't provide any evidence, but he is a real person, at this address, I've know him years. The only comment I can provide is he appears rather exponentially more wealthy than one would expect- even for a physician, does a lot of travel for the salary and has a very large family he provides for essentially alone just from conversations than one would expect, even as a physician. Several of us actually wondered about that before my seeing his name on this list. The other one thing we have discussed, is why he keeps his grandchildren essentially full time and his own different children do not 😳
