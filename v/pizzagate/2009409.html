            Wow.  Another fine examination of the facts and circumstances, well organized and extremely well written.  Thank you for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your call for further focus on potential connections between the players is spot on.  One thing I find difficult to believe is that Jordan Smith just out of the blue began advocating relentlessly for what in the beginning would have been an apparent lost cause.  There was a reason she took up the crusade.  It really seems there must have been some connection somewhere, likely to the Kellers or VERY LIKELY to someone in their circle who had a personal interest in the exoneration.  Did Smith have a relationship with a relative or friend of the Kellers?  Possibly the disgraced deputy?  I will be looking into these and other possibilities.

            How did all these crazy crimes happen without leaving any physical evidence whatsoever?

           <p>
            How did the kids routinely fly to Mexico and get back home in time and nobody knew anything?  No kids talked about being on the first plane flight?  They just kept that to themselves?

             "all these crazy crimes" is the propaganda narrative - NOT the facts in the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Kellers were only charged with 1 count of aggravated sexual assault on a child - their DEFENSE attorneys cynically introduced satanic abuse rumors into the court proceedings NOT the prosecutions.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Kellers were never charged with satanic acts.

             You aren't very bright. What if the kids talked? Who would they tell? Who would the people they told, tell? What would the police do about it if those people told them? Would the news report it? You need to quit, because you embaress yourself every time you comment.

               Incorrect - this was ONLY in the news when the Kellers decided to flee to Las Vegas after a warrant was issued for their arrest.   They had to be apprehended in Las Vegas and brought back for trial in handcuffs, which understandably did make the news at that point.
              </p>
              <p>
               the DEFENSE team of the Kellers introduced the topic of SRA into their trial - they were never charged with any type of ritual abuse.

             You need to read the entire police report - then comment.   The investigation and questioning especially of one boy regarding the plane travel is in there.  He had very specific descriptions of who was on the plane, where they sat, etc.   However, the Kellers were never charged with tranpsporting children or even trafficking children, so it is actually a moot point and a sort of diversion.   The police report is a long read, but pretty fascinating.

             BTW - I was waiting for you to show up!  I was partially inspired to write both parts because of your defense of such base and obvious propaganda.

              This is actually very common and has been proven in experiments.  Please read
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/11/us/studies-reveal-suggestibility-of-very-young-as-witnesses.html?pagewanted=all&amp;mcubz=1">
               the research on interviews with children
              </a>
              and how suggestible they are.  We know a lot more about this sort of stuff since the 1990's.  Adults are susceptible to this as well.  In this cases, you have the adults not willing to take no for an answer and asking and suggesting over and over again, until the kid comes up with something that fits.  The adults are usually completely unaware of what they are doing.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Certain techniques often used by investigators with young children increase the likelihood of false reports, the findings show. One is persistent, repeated questioning over periods of several weeks. When sexual abuse is suspected, children are typically asked the same questions by case workers, police investigators and lawyers, as well as parents, before they testify in court.
              </p>
              <p>
               But that repetition may lead some young children to concoct stories, according to results of a study by Dr. Ceci and colleagues reported last month at a meeting on emotional memory at the University of Chicago.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the study of children from 4 to 6, parents helped researchers make a list of two events that had occurred in each child's life and eight that had not. In weekly sessions, the researchers reviewed the list with the child, asking for each event, "Has this ever happened to you?"
              </p>
              <p>
               One 4-year-old boy, for example, answered truthfully, "No, I've never been to the hospital," the first time he was asked if he had ever gone to the hospital because his finger had got caught in a mousetrap.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the next week, in response to the same question, he volunteered, "Yes. I cried." And by the 11th week of questioning, he was offering an elaborate tale about his brother's pushing him into the mousetrap, near where his father was getting firewood.
              </p>
              <p>
               Such accounts were common. By the 11th week, 56 percent of children reported at least one false event as true, and some children reported all the false events as true, Dr. Ceci said.
              </p>
              <p>
               "The more often you ask young children to think about something, the easier it becomes for them to make something up that they think is a memory," he said.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is more, the accounts of those false memories are often quite believable. Dr. Ceci has shown videotapes of children recounting both true and false "memories" to more than 1,000 professionals who specialize in cases of child abuse, including lawyers, social workers and psychiatrists.
               <br/>
               "The experts are correct about whether the child's account is accurate about one-third of the time," Dr. Ceci said. "That's worse than chance."
              </p>

What about Deputy Perry's CONFESSION? TO THE CRIME?
Did you know Fran's brother was in jail nearby at the exact same time for the same type of charges of sexual assault on a little girl?  What a coincidence!  You would know that if you read the police report, or my article.

            We are very close to breaking this open to the masses. The elites are truly scared now.

            It is said that the final line of defense for shills, propaganda, and cover ups is the "Witch Hunt" narrative. The 2nd to last line of defense being the "Antisemitism" narrative, which was the basis for that attempted "evidence planting" false flag on us,

            Keep pushing brothers. But be aware that we must be very careful in the disclosure process of pedogate. White hat sources say that pedogate is the pin that can collapse the whole satanist power structure, but also potentially the most dangerous part of disclosure of what's been going on. The white hats want to avoid a "Reign of Terror" scenario in which enraged masses turn to bloodlust and kill lots of innocent people in their outrage.

              That's also why I've been saying we need to crack down on certain shills pushing the "blame the jews" narrative.

              That's the exact line of thinking that will bring out this "Reign of Terror" scenario.

               My exact feelings.  I have seen quite a few comments about how they can't wait to use their glocks, and gave an old shoot out, etc. This is not what this country needs.  We will need plenty of heeling.

                What we need is for our court systems and our D.A.s to do their job, as well as the media.  Then there would be no need for anyone to be in the street and angry.

                 So true.  The courts and judges have been bought and seems like they should be the ones in jail.

                  I hate hearing the racists and vigilantes talk too.  I have always fought to keep that stuff off this subforum, but KevDude loves his racism, so no go.
