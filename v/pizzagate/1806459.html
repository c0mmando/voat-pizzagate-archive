Im a close personal friend of krista for over 17 yrs The article made me sick. This isnt her and she wouldnt leave her kids no matter what. Krista is a kind dedicated spunky mother and friend all of is that know her, know she would not walk.out quietly and disappear. My heart breaks for her kids, they are being lead to believe their mother left because of some bulls**t mental disorder story one person out there knows where she is and.i hope hes caught out!.</p>

<p>IMO it\'s been 2 weeks and according to original article she did not leave in her own car and her phone is turned off. So this FB page is all concerned friends that want to help and really the family doesn\'t have an organizer. There is a lot of confusion and anger. so sad for her family</p>

The family does not want help according to the Facebook page. It says: Look at her picture, have you seen her? If you have let us know, if you have not, please do not say anything.
 WOW! They have to know something they are not saying.</p>

I had seen conflicting reports as to the date of Krista\'s disappearance, so I went to the Plover Police Department\'s official FB page and found the post below from 6 hours ago. While I do not see any new information, in the interest of accuracy, I thought I\'d post it here. I would like to point out, however, it does not say anything about Krista suffering from mental illness of any kind.</p>

<p>So according to this statement, as well as the article los posted earlier this evening, Krista was not reported missing for a full week after she was last seen. Not only was she not seen for one week, but according to Krista\'s missing persons poster, &quot;her cell phone has been turned off since the day she went missing.&quot; So apparently, no one saw Krista or communicated with her for a full week before LE was contacted. Doesn\'t make sense ... ??</p>

            Let's be honest, the Clintons are paying people who pay people who pay people who pay people etc etc to clean up the people who are investigating them.  Look at Podesta's tweet referring to family yesterday.  There are so many levels that I believe the best way to get them is from the bottom up.
           </p>
           <p>
            So let's say I start investigating Podesta, waiting outside his house and following his every movement.  I need 3 levels behind me and another level ahead of me.  When I get hit, the people who did it need to be captured (live is best) or dead and then figuring out who the level above them is.

            This still isn't believable. You're trying very hard though. Did they go missing in Arkansaw or Arkansas? It says two men but one could be a woman this story makes no sense.

            usa politics today was one of the outlets spreading disinformation about the Atlanta attorney who was shot. Definitely not a trustworthy site. Evidence:

            Not a way to declare the whole site as unreliable - not everything is bullshit there. Please see my comment under

            EDIT: By a very quick preview, the OP linked article is one of those not to be trusted as such. Other source is needed.

            Any idea why she would use her maiden name or former married name but not her current husband's name?

            More than 20 investigators searching missing Plover woman's home??
           </p>
           <p>
            More than 20 investigators remain at the home of Krista Sypher, the 44-year-old Plover woman who was last seen March 13. The Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigations is assisting Plover police in the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sypher was last seen March 13 but was reported missing by her husband March 20.

             I get the feeling you are from out of country? Arkansas and Wisconsin are like different planets. No connection here whatsoever. It would appear to be a typical case of familial homicide, hence the police searches.

              Her husband did not report her missing for 1 week. He might have known she was on a case.  She also sometimes used two other former last names.  Also there are 20 investigators swarming the house.  I also think it is odd that Trump visits Kenosha at this same time.  See the comment about Racine.  Plover is 3 hr drive from Kenosha and near Racine.  Just Sayin'.

            Great post. At least someone WAS investigating something. Gowdy may be all bark and no bite, but at least this is a lead worth following. It is rumored that even Gowdy and Rand Paul have been compromised through Brownstone operations, so we will see if Trey is willing to go the distance even if it means he is exposed.

            Wisconsin is the key to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Specifically Racine, Wisconsin. There is an epidemic of trafficking and criminal corruption involving officials, secret societies and business leaders that they are attempting to cover up with a game of musical chairs. The pedo crimes, trafficking, satanic murders, and system of corruption in Paul Ryan's district is unfathomable. The last corrupt mayor was arrested on pedo crimes, the current corrupt mayor is "resigning" along with his cousin the corrupt city administrator, after the corrupt District Attorney resigned amidst criminal activities and a cover-up, and many others before them at city and county levels. Racine is truly a cesspool, and they are desperate to keep it hidden. Look into the high profile pedo cases and satanic murders in Racine. Then see how Racine is connected to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Agenda 2030, and global network of secret societies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI and DOJ are corrupt and complicit to criminal corruption. They know about Racine, Wisconsin. They stonewalled the investigations because they know it all leads to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Global Corporations, mafia, gangs, and Secret Societies that control all aspects of banking, insurance, government, media and other sectors through blackmail, extortion, fraud, embezzlement, racketeering, bid rigging, retaliation, death threats, murder, kidnapping, trafficking, and other criminal activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is very real. We need to pressure Donald Trump to announce a public investigation into Racine, Wisconsin. We believe that Trump may be compromised either through videos showing him involved in heinous criminal acts as reported by Robert David Steele, or compromised by threats to his family, and if so, we need to appeal directly to the entire world so that everyone knows America is corrupt and compromised at the top. We already know Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Kadzik, Loretta Lynch, and others who swore to uphold the law are instead abusing the law under the color of law, and that same rigged system has trickled down to the state and local levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Put the spotlight on Wisconsin and Paul Ryan's district of Racine, Wisconsin. We will bring everything into the light.

             Is this a fiasco or a big joke or what? Is this a satire?  I don't think so.   Although I know that they have been trying to waste our time as of late.  I looked up the time from Plover to Kenosha and it is 3 hrs driving time (Trump was just there ) very close to Racine as well.  Could this be connected?  I think she might have been an agent.  Possibly there is another missing person somewhere that also went to Arkansas.  Her husband of course knew her job so he did not worry but after 1 wk. he had to report.  Yeah, Racine is a Hell Hole.

             I'm confused. What do these missing people in Wisconsin have to do with the investigators going to Arkansas to search Bill Clinton's presidential library? You seem to understand it. What is the connection here?

            I really don't think I would take a job in Government if you have morals.
Unless you are slime, you might end up lost.
I never thought I would see a time as this...who needs to watch t.v. when real life is so bizarre?

              Darkmath is a shill. I just caught him using a link out of context to prove a lie. When I showed him his mistake he changed his strategy to attacking what a sane person would do. First the video was a joke, second he used a lie prove his claim, then he attacked the charectar of the report. That is a shill if I ever saw one. Now I find you fought him defending podesta? These shills are pure evil.

                I saw your posts yesterday. I am glad you continue to push through. I totally agree with you about dark math and equinelvr. They oaccasionaly mix a bit of truth to stay credible, that way they are more effective. One thing I know, the truth attracts shills like flies to honey. Where ever they are attacking you know you are getting close to the truth!

                  So when your fabrications are exposed you then resort to personal attacks? Tell me again how much you care about children? You are a liar and you take sources out of context to prove your lies. Tell me again how ET Williams said he "heard" about comey. Your game is getting exposed. You use sources taken out of context. You verify nothing and you are simply here to push a disinformation narrative when all else fails you resort to bad words and personal attacks.

                       This is your rational for believing something you read on the Interwebs. Is it true? Yes! I read it 6 or 7 sites on the Interwebs.

                        Stop trying to influence the people on voat with your lies and links taken out of context. Remember how you linked a YouTube that took statements purposely out of context? Your attacks will not distract from the fact that you use lies to spread disinformation and create false leads. Every time you message me I will repost your own words. You are a liar and a shill who is trying to subvert investigations.

                            You just throw anything at the wall hoping it sticks. I guess that's how manipulative shills work. Why do you disregard the other sources and only link the one with the satire claim? That's misleading but that is how you operate right ? You can't pick and choose evidence to prove a point. You did the same with the  ET Williams video. Your goal is only to discredit and to create false leads, and division.
                            <br/>
                            There are multiple sites running with that story some more credible than others. you are here to push a narrative: that there is no credible evidence. That is clear. So keep spamming the same thing over and over again hoping to voaters think there is nothing here. Your little circle of influence grows smaller and smaller. You have been caught lieing and misleading not just by me.

                             Yes. If the last story about Trey Gowdy exhuming Vince Foster's body was proven bullshit then if the next story about Trey Gowdy shows up on sketchy fake news sites then you only need one reference to discredit the entire story.

                              Debunk all the sources, go for it. I know I can't. can you? Instead you rely on posting a half truth to create a blanket statement. Worse you state it as an absolute. As we all know there are very few absolute statements out there that are true. You are a dangerous manipulator of evidence. Especially because there are children out there who have no voice. I stand by that. I contend that your labeling anyone who disagrees with you as a basement dweller is  a shill tactic. We all know how damaging a conspiracy theorist label is. Your new spin is basement dweller.  I am appalled that you have no concern that you use misleading half truths with absolute statements.  Keep it up. The charade becomes more and more apparent with every half truth you post. Your days of misleading people are ending.

                                    Then don't peddle in half truths. Keep spamming links to debunk sources that have nothing to do with the sources you are trying to debunk. Keep claiming half truths as absolutes. I don't know what you consider the truth. Half truths are lies and shills are liars. If the shoe fits....

             Evidently her husband new she was on a case, but when he had not heard from her after 1 wk. he knew something might be wrong.  That's when he reported it.  I wonder if Trump's trip to Kenosha  (3 hr 14 min drive from Plover)had anything to do which this.  Also it is near Racine.  Killing two birds with one stone?  Just thought it was odd he made that trip right in the middle of this. Could be nothing. Just Sayin'.
