<h1>Discrepancy in numbers</h1>
<p>According to the blog by earthquake victim Molly Hightower, who was a volunteer for Friends of the Orphans, the charity runs an orphanage in Kenscoff, St. Helene, that houses <strong>450 children</strong>. The number 450 can be confirmed through various other sources pre-earthquake.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Kenscoff: The program started with the orphanage called St. Helene which is high in the mountains in Kenscoff. <strong>There are about 450 children living there at the moment</strong>, and they receive education up to 9th grade before being able to earn scholarships for secondary school in the city. It is the site of Kay Christine, the special needs home Gena runs. <a href="https://archive.is/0qKdd#selection-537.0-520.5">https://archive.is/0qKdd#selection-537.0-520.5</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eaUehMa.png">http://i.imgur.com/eaUehMa.png</a> </p>

<h1>Missing numbers match Laura Silsby\'s original plan</h1>
<p>So this means 100 children are missing. Well guess what? Laura Silsby\'s documented plan, titled &quot;Haiti Orphan Rescue Mission&quot;, specified the exact same digits with the mission to <a href="https://i.imgbox.com/k87iMAnu.png">&quot;gather 100 orphans from the streets and collapsed orphanages&quot;</a>. Coincidence? </p>
<p>Remember: this is the same orphanage that ignored the statement made by Laura Silsby\'s lawyer, <a href="https://archive.fo/2LyI6">wanted child-trafficker Jorge Puello</a>, that the child-trafficker claims to have received children from. This orphanage happens to be connected with <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1588812">Bill Clinton, frequent passenger of the Lolita Express</a>, and also <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1529598">James Alefantis, alleged child-trafficker</a>. And apparently we\'re crazy to ask for an investigation.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<h1>Aftermath</h1>
<p>The update was made between the 13th and 18th, meaning the transaction with child-trafficker Laura Silsby would have to have been premeditated, because Laura Silsby was caught in her initial attempt on the 26th. Everything went according to plan, until a concerned citizen reported to a police officer of suspicious activity. The following day, she went to Ouanaminthe to discuss with pastor Sainvil of plan B, and resorted to taking children from parents instead. </p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>He said he first met Silsby on Jan. 27 in the town of Ouanaminthe on the Haiti-Dominican border and agreed to help her collect children for a 150-bed orphanage the Americans were establishing near the beach resort of Cabarete in the Dominican Republic. <a href="https://archive.is/cahQo#selection-1223.0-1223.252">https://archive.is/cahQo#selection-1223.0-1223.252</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;She asked for kids at each of the orphanages, and at the end of the day when no one would give her any, she cried. Why would you cry after you see these kids are being taken care of?&quot; Pickett told AP. <a href="https://archive.is/zK0rz#selection-1195.0-1195.201">https://archive.is/zK0rz#selection-1195.0-1195.201</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Was she crying out of guilt, or was she crying because she had screwed up her plan? Hopefully we\'ll find out.</p>

          <p>
           The update was made between the 13th and 18th, meaning the transaction with child-trafficker Laura Silsby would have to have been premeditated, because Laura Silsby was caught in her initial attempt on the 26th. Everything went according to plan, until a concerned citizen reported to a police officer of suspicious activity. The following day, she went to Ouanaminthe to discuss with pastor Sainvil of plan B, and resorted to taking children from parents instead.

            He said he first met Silsby on Jan. 27 in the town of Ouanaminthe on the Haiti-Dominican border and agreed to help her collect children for a 150-bed orphanage the Americans were establishing near the beach resort of Cabarete in the Dominican Republic.

            "She asked for kids at each of the orphanages, and at the end of the day when no one would give her any, she cried. Why would you cry after you see these kids are being taken care of?" Pickett told AP.

           Was she crying out of guilt, or was she crying because she had screwed up her plan? Hopefully we'll find out.

            There are many articles about a girl named  Nakia Venant who recently committed suicide live on FB by hanging herself in the bathroom of her foster parents home while they slept. This occurred in FL and Nakia was Haitian. There is no full story on why she was in foster care that I can find. She was only 14. I don't know if it has any links to PG but since the agency in FL has not released any background info it seems worth looking into.

            So Silsby seems to have had a heads-up about the coming earthquake. All in all what are the reasons for thinking the earth quake was geo-engineered?

             Excellent link at bottom. Thank you. There are always innocent people involved in the evil doings of these people to give an illusion of "being above board". Whether they are military, volunteers, or workers within a NGO, they really are clueless about the true nature of what they are doing. I'd like to do an interview w these people now and also would like to know how Silsby became the de facto "leader". What made them all point to her and say that she was in charge? Was she a predator at a church, knowing the earthquake was about to happen, who then rounded up volunteers afterwards? Sort of like creating an insurgency team without the team knowing they were being chosen? Where was she actually going to take those kids in DR. She couldn't give the actual place and address so she lied about the hotel and got busted. Although the run down, out is service hotel may have actually been the drop location bc of the simple fact it was defunct. 
Obviously she was clearly confident her handlers would get her out.

            Hi OP. Good research again.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was looking into the Haiti orphanage yesterday after reading your post about Silsby.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked into the DR embassy and found some interesting actors.
Thought you might like a look if you havent already.

           <p>
            Until now Trump keeps his word. Not all his people are in so i for one keep my hope and faith. I said pre election i gave him 6 weeks to give indication this is on his agenda. And still 5,5 to go on that. At a group this big and powerfull he only gets one chance, so he has to be sure it will succeed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even a indication he is on it in the next couple of weeks can still mean first action over months. It has no need to roll-up on cell (like Comet) if they have 66 (just a low estimate from me) that kind of places. If those cases are happening, must be hell for investigators, knowing there is abuse somewhere but for the sake of saving more children they can not yet act.

            EVERYONE needs to watch "Where is Johnny" documentary. Laura Silsby is nothing but a brainwashed individual who was abused when she was younger, and was most likely taken from her family at a young age. She has now become someone who works for them, clearly. Note the connections of her behavior and the people who kidnap the kids.

             Please post FACTUAL information only. Absolutely NO WHERE in either of these two documentaries is Laura Silsby discussed. She has NOTHING to do with Johnny Gosch and the Franklin Scandal so I have no idea where you are getting that "she was also brainwashed and abused when she was younger and taken from her family at a young age". Come on.

               45 minutes in to the John Gosch interview, when they start talking about branding, and the Colorado house, anyone who says Paul Bonnassi was making that all up is bloody idiot. These two documentaries completely prove to me everything about Pizza Gate as being absolutely true. Besides the fact you have the whole BBC cover up of Jimmy Savil.

            In Molly Hightower's blog, in November 2009 she says this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Devastation (sic) when I went to the hospital to discover my Jolene girl had been transferred to an unknown orphanage the evening before. I don't know where she is, but I'm trying to find her to force her caregivers to bring her in for physical therapy. She was so close to walking on her own, and they left her orthopedic shoe behind. They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra). Annabelle is the only one still there.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I don't know if that's a normal thing that happens, with kids being transferred to other, unknown, orphanages, but it seems suspicious that Molly couldn't find out where they had been taken to - you'd think what with knowing how much child trafficking goes on in Haiti even before the earthquake, there would be strict rules about where kids could be taken, and by whom, if the organisation is a legitimate one?

             Idk, there has to be a lot of chaos following an earthquake. For any random charity, it's possible that kids would be lost track of or there wouldn't be enough organization for proper documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, it's also widely recognized that the same chaos makes trafficking incredibly easy. So, we still need to treat it as suspicious to some degree when kids are shuffled around unexpectedly or miscounted.

            What record keeping is required by these NGOs to track the children that they handle? I would think that they are required by law to record the names of children they take, from where, and where they are placed, with contact information. I wonder if there is a path involving requesting these records for questionable NGOs.

              True, but an FOIA process may make sense...maybe not for a Haitian-based org but for some with questionable histories in the US or countries where such requests can be made. Just a thought.

             For me, that question (that is also the answer) proves again that this global mafia movement is much larger, powerful and open than we/i could ever imagine.
            </p>
            <p>
             By this knowledge (the history of her HAS to be in the organisation, i am convinced about that) all other board members are at first suspect in my book until cleared clean.
            </p>
            <p>
             If i was working in such a organisation and learned about her history it would be clear for me, she or me are leaving. And if she leaves, we have to investigate who knew and did not reported her history in the organisation on the people who has to know.

            , your original write up of Laura Silsby is top notch and something I still use when informing people about PG. Do you think you could update your original piece with the latest information about her?

            This sick, twisted woman. I remember reading an interview from her neighbors who said they were shocked she worked with kids because she wasn't the type of person who cares about kids. This psychopath only cares about  what those kids can do for her.

             The neighbors POV, I thought, was extremely telling. We all have friends/family who you would peg as someone who is involved in helping children or would be in a situation to go into an area like this and feel the need to help. She is not that person.
