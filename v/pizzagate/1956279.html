            Problem with the word Jew is that it refers to a specific group of people and also a religion. A Jew may not even believe in the Jewish faith, but are still called Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I have some questions about the Jewish faith.
Is the Talmud like the Koran to people of the Jewish faith? Or just to Orthodox Jews?
In the last few years, found out about the oral removal of a boys foreskin as part of the Jewish religion. It is still being performed in our own country in NY hospitals by Rabbis.
I've also come across information about other passages in the Talmud.
Here's an example:
Does Talmud Teach Pedophilia, Incest, Bestiality
            <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/does_talmud_condone_pedophilia.html">
             https://www.henrymakow.com/does_talmud_condone_pedophilia.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If this stuff is in the Talmud, Jews should own up to it and disown it. Just like I think Muslims should disown the Koran's child marriages and murders of innocent people.

             The Talmud is observed by about 20% of the entire religion.  Within that portion, about 5% observe the extreme religious practice as you mentioned.  So about 70,000 adherents to that "practice", or fewer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gross, yes.  Illegal?  Mmmm...grey area.  Lot's of religious practices should be evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             If that were the case, they should be focused on FGM in the Muslim world.  Hell of a lot more of that going on....
            </p>
            <p>
             But then again, the shills are Jewish - not only do they acuse everyone of being a Jew, but only a Jew would be able to understand the intricacies and details of the subject matter.  Just as if you were to debate something you are a subject matter expert on.

            People get so caught up in the details (especially the shills), they never bother to ask themselves simple questions like:
           </p>
           <p>
            If you were about to put your name on the loan application for $10MM to buy a piece of property from an entity embroiled in a child sex scandal, wouldn't you ensure every "i" is dotted and every "t" is crossed?
           </p>
           <p>
            So either Jane and Bernie (yes Bernie - no fucking way would I ever let my spouse sign a note like that without my being all in) are complete and totally incompetent or there is some leverage over their heads which coerced them to buy said property.  I.E.: An "arranged" sale.

            Thanks RighthandWanker.  What you don't realize, as a known shill and anti-Semite, is that you just threw a nice brick on our side of the scales of justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Trump is a child raping satanist like the rest of them." Prima facie evidence - you are anti-Jew, anti-Trump, and pro-pedo.  Those three traits identify you as a shill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the fact that you are actually able to type the stuff you do, I'll make the leap and assume you were probably sexually assaulted as a child and just became part of the pedoperpetuation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say "seek help", but you are already beyond help.  Do all of us a favor - fill a nice glass of cold water, take a few swigs, hold a big gulp in your mouth, and apply the business end of a .45 ACP between your lips and pull the trigger.  The hydrostatic shock will pop your melon like you had a lit M80 for a pineal gland.  It's quick.  Go have some fun.

           <p>
            Thank you for this post.  I think we will hear a lot more about this as the investigation into Komrade Sanders.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the good Sanders supporters here, sorry, your boy wasn't exempt.  This is in no way an indictment of his involvement in pedo activities.  But this is another piece of "evidence", like his rape fantasies of young girls, etc.  So, don't get your hopes up.  The more evil pedo won the DNC nomination.  He never had a chance.
           </p>
           <p>
            And for the last statement, thank you.  The anti-Jew stuff is the work of about 5-10 shills.  It is a tactic they use to try and divert and cause a divide among the ranks.  One guy loses his mind not being able to understand why we are here, yet he is here to tell us we are crazy.  The rest of the morons just cite scripture and religious crap written into sandstone thousands of years ago as the basis of their argument.  Meanwhile, the bulk of us are dealing with daily, real-life findings which qualify as evidence and would make any zealous prosecutor's head spin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bottom line is they think its a Jewish plot, because there a lot of Jewish names involved in Pizzagate - therefore it's the great Zionist plot.  Using the same "shill logic", almost everyone involved in Pizzagate are Caucasian, there is a much stronger case to be made that pedo is a Caucasian problem.  Of course this isn't the case, but you can see that their "argument" is flawed out of the gate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, I never really though about the fact that if it wasn't for Jews like Breitbart, Pollock, Drudge, Levin, Savage and others in the conservative media, Trump would not have one.  He's all we have and we have no choice but to go all in with Trump at this point.  This is the last chance to save America.

             That's the entire point.  They post so much bullshit about something scrawled into a piece of rock 3000 years ago, that the uninitiated would think this is Stormfront or NA or something.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I were President, I'd put a fucking sticky calling their bullshit out right at the top of VOAT.  This is a known tactic.  They add nothing intellectual to the discussion.  All the shills do is post and repost unoriginal thought with no compelling argument, in hopes that the sheep will blindly believe their version of ancient history, rather than look at the front page of the fucking newspapers..
            </p>
            <p>
             The big lie my friend.  It is so in our faces that it is even tough for us to believe.

            Just to clarify, there are "fake jews" called Kzarian jews, not to be confused with genuine jewish people such as yourself. The Kzarians have no real jewish DNA. And the Kzarians pretend to be whatever suits their dark motives at the time, these days they are Catholic/Christian to the public but the Kzarians are always true to lucifer. There's some good videos on youtube about them, but basically these days they are the banking and other elite.

            Torah Jews would not return to Israel unless the Messiah sets up kingdom there.  Rothschilds forced it via holocaust in WWII.  Rothschilds and many zionists are Sabatean/Franken pedosatanists intent on setting up NWO workd religion in Jerusalem.  Ordinary Jews got caught up in it and are living there.  Nearly all Israelis have no idea or abhor what Rothschilds game plan is.  The Core NWO Zionist pedosatanists are Propagandizing Zionism and a lot of unaware decent folks wind up going along/supporting it

            The blood of Christ is on ALL of our hands. That was the entire point of his death (i.e. his SACRIFICE) that you anti-semites seem to miss. "For just as through the disobedience of the one man [Adam] the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man [Jesus] the many will be made righteous." Romans 5:19 (read the whole chapter if you need more explanation.) so before you start casting blame on one group of people, you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror, into your wicked heart, and into the Bible.

             ! Romans was today's reading at Catholic mass.
             <br/>
             "For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift in the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many."

            I don't know why anybody would be surprised
Show me an abortion fanatic I'll show you
a vicious pedophile.
That's what abortion is for. To psyche us 
into not becoming enraged at the atrocities
committed against children on any level.
Its also how they justify what they do in their pea brains and on a cosmic level.
We all know what really happens in these abortions.
If we accept this atrocity how are we
going to complain about that atrocity
before God?

            Look at this article on Bernie Sanders and his obsession with underage sex.
            <a href="https://downtrend.com/71superb/bernie-sanders-has-an-unnatural-obsession-with-underage-sex">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a look at these quotes from Bernie "In Vermont, at a state beach, a mother is reprimanded by Authority for allowing her 6 month old daughter to go about without her diapers on. Now, if children go around naked, they are liable to see each others sexual organs, and maybe even touch them. Terrible thing! If we [raise] children up like this it will probably ruin the whole pornography business, not to mention the large segment of the general economy which makes its money by playing on peoples sexual frustrations."
           </p>
           <p>
            "How much guilt, nervousness have you imbued in your daughter with regard to sex? If she is 16, 3 years beyond puberty and the time which nature set forth for childbearing, and spent a night out with her boyfriend, what is your reaction? Do you take her to a psychiatrist because she is “maladjusted,” or a “prostitute,” or are you happy that she has found someone with whom she can share love? Are you concerned about HER happiness, or about your “reputation” in the community."

            Think of it like food. I like Hamburgers, I like Curry, I like Tacos, I even like fusions of them, but I still need to maintain a malleability of sorts so I can always separate them and not only have some shitty tasting stew.

             Same here.  I'm areligious.  I'm not a fan of any organized religion, though I appreciate its purpose and role in the world.

             I prefer to identify as "spiritual".  There is a God.  He is more powerful than I.  And I must ask for him to help me be a better human.  Plain and simple.  No more.  No less.

             It does seem religion is the core of most things vile, in the old days people were forced to convert to the dominate religion or be killed, so while i say i hate religions, i can't say i hate all adherents.

            Just like not all Catholics are Pedos, not all Jews are bad. However, there are very Evil Catholics and there are very Evil Jews.

            Bernie is a dimwitted Evil Nazi, it seriously would not surprise me if he is a Evil Pedo.

            PS Pizzagate is one conspiracy that should unite everyone of every nationality, race and creed. This is one conspiracy (unlike 9-11)that plagues every corner of the earth irrespective of their background.

            Bernie is a corrupt as they come.. Hes in with the Hillary camp.. He was caught out at a rally when he didnt know the mic was on.. Basically his wife said "they know you stepped down" or words to that effect.
The crowd was angry when he announced losing the primaries.. But he didnt lose.. He bowed out.. My memories a bit hazy but I'm sure hes controlled puppet.

              Yes, and Nick Rockefeller (Luciferian Jewish family) trusted Russo, as he could not imagine a successful Jew like Russo caring about the (goyim) "peasants".  IIRC, Nick asked Aaron the question "Why do you care about the peasants?"

            Thank You, My point is, just because people are involved in a real estate deal, does not link them to the priests that are guilty of child sex abuse at the church.  There may be priests there involved in the Haitian abuses, so they are the ones we should be researching NOT BERNIE.

             Stop defending pedophiles.... Bernie and his wife KNEW they were dealing with an institution that was ripe with pedophilia and chose to do business with them.
            </p>

             Jews have no conscience.. all they care about is MONEY, which is why they have no guilt about trafficking children, women, organs, and weapons..

             edit to add: I'm jewish and really do not appreciate all the anti-jew conspiracy theory nonsense on voat. If it weren't for jews like drudge and breitbart there would be no president trump.

           <p>
            I love it when jews expose jews...didnt know Drudge was a jew and had didnt know this info on Bernie sanders...gotta keep one step ahead of us OP!
           </p>
           <p>
            Could you make a thread on the Jewish connections of Donald Trump AKA Drumpf or Hilary Rodham Clinton or Bill Clinton AKA William Jefferson Blythe III or even George Bush?
           </p>
           <p>
            We all know Donald Trumps children married Jews and Hilary Clintons child is married to a Jew and even Clintons grandmother married (((Rosenberg))) which means at the minimum Hilary was taught in the teachings of the Talmud growing up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks OP!
           </p>

            P.S....can you BELIEVE that other presidential candidate Jill Stein was a JEW!!!...I couldnt believe it myself!...what are the FUCKING ODDS??!!!!

             Then comes the book of Arthur Kostler - the 13th Tribe exposing so called Jews as not of semitic origin and Arthur dies under mysterious circumstances! 
Zionism is a political movement. Example - one of the most outspoken anti zionist anti talmud proppnents is Henry Makow while one of the biggest Zionist shills is Fake Jones (Alex the Elmer Fudd)

             It's low hanging fruit - black kids aren't in high demand.  But they are plentiful.  They will do until something better is available.  And they are easily available for purchase through a wide variety of NGOs and adoption agencies.  Kinda like cheap weed.

            You may be Jewish, and like most Jews, you may not be part of some big secret conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, let's not pretend there isn't Zionist and Talmudic supremacist groups out there that are holding the interests of Israel and Jews up above everyone else, even to the point of conspiring to damage other nations and peoples in their own interests.  This is true even if you're offended by it and do not appreciate it.  Sure, it's ridiculous to act like all Jews are in on this.  But it's also not particularly inaccurate to call it the Jewish conspiracy, since it seems to center around a number of pro-Jewish groups and Jewish individuals, for the sake of advancing the power and resources of Jewish peoples, and denigrating non-Jewish peoples.

              Yes, that is what I said, and I've never talked to anyone who says that all Jews are in on this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since it is obvious that not all Jews are in on this, I'm not going to call it the more specific "Zionist, Talmudic-fundimentalist, pro-Ashkenazi, anti-Goyim, Jewish-supremacist, Israeli hegemony tactics by a number of Jewish financiers and media moguls and politicians, enabled by traditional Hebrew cultural enclaves and influence within others' host nations" Conspiracy, even though that's what it is and you might feel more comfortable with a more detailed label.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the end, it is a set of tactics pushed by people who all happen to be Jewish, against people and cultures which aren't Jewish, for the purpose of enriching and empowering Jews and the Jewish nation at non-Jews expense.  It is not inaccurate to call it a Jewish conspiracy, and everyone knows what is meant by that.  We're not talking about you, Moshe.

               The repetitive comments here of hate speech against Jews certainly seems like an organized 
campaign here -- and it is certainly overall anti-Jewish.
              </p>
              <p>
               It isn't necessarily obvious that this hate speech isn't directed at all Jews because it certainly
seems to be the case.  When you are accusing "Zionists" then say so.
If you're debating against the "Talmud" and its religious teachings, then say so, specifically.
These are all different issues -- just as the political and foreign policy of Israel's leaders is different, especially
in regard to Palestinians/Gaza.
              </p>
              <p>
               It would be quite sad if anyone in other countries actually thought that the things that Trump
says are supported by all of us here. 
Or if anyone thought that Americans actually support the wars of aggression that our government
has been guilty of.
              </p>
              <p>
               You will often see that I am criticizing the Catholic Church, but this is the hierarchy of the Catholic Church,
not its members.  Sometimes I will actually call out the members for not standing against the anti-homosexual
teachings of the RCC, but I try to make clear who I am criticizing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Imo, when you are a bit more specific it will aid debate with others.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are surrounded by conspiracy -- how many of our Founders were Jews?
Yet, we had immediate betrayal of the nation in the Constitution which actually
created an Elite patriarchy and re-distributed the wealth of the nation to them.
              </p>
              <p>
               No matter how we add up the millions Stalin killed, or the millions that Hitler killed ...
we know that the "invaders" here killed ever more ... in complete genocide of 112 million
native people here and in death and oppression of the Africans brought here to increase
the wealth of Elites here in the system of Slavery.  Again, our Founders protected and 
saved that system of Slavery for Elites.
              </p>
              <p>
               Everything that the CIA has done involves conspiracy -- and we are still suffering the consequences
of those secret actions today.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Catholic Church had armies which ran the Crusades and the Inquisition ... 
and issued Papal Edicts which instructed that the natives here and Africans here ...
should be "enslaved or killed."
How vast was that conspiracy?

               <p>
                I'm not going to specify the dozen or so related issues that all fall under the umbrella of some Jews, doing what they do specifically for Jews, against the nations of non-Jews, enabled by the greater community of Jewish culture in those host nations, in such a way that I must avoid saying "Jew".  I'm not bothered if it hurts your feelings.  We all know what is being spoken about in regards to the Jewish conspiracy.  If that doesn't apply to you, then we're not talking about you, Chaim.

                 However, let me make clear that I certainly do not support the right wing control of Israel which
has long suppressed the desire of the people there for peace -- and given at least two attempts
at it, both have ended in assassinations to end them.

                <p>
                 Nor AIPAC and its efforts to own our politicians here.

             I'm not jewish but  I think you are right.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews shouldn't take this personally.
            </p>
            <p>
             None of my Jewish friends are involved in  Zionist groups  - but then again - none of my  German friends are in the  SS either.    However, that doesn't mean they aren't out there and influential  (not as influential as Russia of course.  I don't mean to get in the way of  that diatribe).
            </p>
            <p>
             To creditcardclown =  just for the record = people who still read the Bible practically revere the Jewish people  because Jesus was a Jew    so don't be too discouraged.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are still some segments who believe that most Jewish people are really great.   :-)
            </p>
            <p>
             And, if you don't own one yet, get one and read it (they have Bibles at the dollar store now. not kidding)  because, since you are Jewish, it is a  whos- who of the history of your people.

              Open your mind to recognize that you negate yourself. If Jews shouldn't take it personally when you use the collective term to assign blame for the complaint that does not apply to the collective, then you shouldn't use the collective term in the first place.

              That is the intent. It is a shill tactic. Zionist are the problem, the average Jew is just a nobody like us. But they want to get us riled up to sound anti semetic. Transprent tactic.

              Agreed.  Either laziness or bias based on environment or life experience is my guess. It is a turn off for good folks on this board. Most Jews in Israel aren't even zionists and are terrified with Rothschilds NWO plan over there (i.e. One world religion/economic/political system).

               True -- 
While there is every effort being made to move nations to the right -- including the continuing effort in the US
and in Israel -- we are both liberal nations being run by right wing assassinators -- from Dulles, LBJ, CIA, Bush
to Netanyahu and his gang.
              </p>
              <p>
               When Israelis could, we would see their constant rise in peace movements against their right wing -- 
but the peace efforts of Begin/Sadat/Carter and late with Rabin were very quickly brought to an end
through assassination by the right wing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Same here in the US where JFK's efforts for peace were quickly ended by assassination by those representing 
Elites/corporations/right wing.
              </p>
              <p>
               We see our corrupted government moving throughout the world to move the right wing into place -- 
making the world unsafe for families/children.
              </p>
              <p>
               Moving right wing religious into place in the US has long been one way of doing it --
the fakery of the "Silent Majority" and its support for Fundamentalist religions was another.
Plus our corrupted government has been busy for a long time in trying to create a more violent Islam.

There was no "Devil" no "Satan" and no "Hell"  -- which are all inventions of organized

               Remember, it is the Elites/officials who control governments and religions, not the people.
Though the fight continues on for the people to gain control.

               Okay fine, I didn't realise that's what those brackets meant. I do think they make y'all look a bit crazy though. I'm not looking for a moral victory, just sick of the equinelvr posts saying such and such is a Jew when it's clearly an Irish surname etc.

                 Well it is when an Irish surname that originates from Gaelic and dates back centuries is described as a typical Jewish surname. Seriously, I had this exact argument with equineluvr a few months back. Although Ireland has a small Jewish community, there are no homegrown surnames. In fact, the Jews are one of the few groups not to have occupied Ireland at some point!

            Jane is being investigated for a deal regarding the Burlington Roman Catholic  Diocese property.  We know that.  There was a Post on here  yesterday convicting both of them before the investigation has even begun.  You have been a member for 1 1/2 hrs. so I am sorry I will have to wait until I see what other comments are in your history before I take your word.  You say you have done limited history and for THAT you want to ruin someone's reputation with something so heinous as raping children.  Shame on you.  Just because someone at the church is connected to Haiti you are charging Bernie with pedophilia?  I am sorry that is  guilt  by association.  Sorry that just does not cut it.  I think that possibly there is a Witch Hunt of sorts going on since yesterday.  I also am really surprised by some of the members that have just fallen in line so quickly.  BREAKING NEWS: As I am typing this I hear on my local news that the person who is complaining about this whole College/Church mess is a Vermont Trump Suporter.

             IF Bernie is a part of the pedophile cabal, it will be a bitter pill to swallow for many, many people. Not a witch hunt, but critical thinking suggests there's a lot more going on with Bernie than meets the eye.

              Oh fuck, gimme a FUCKING BREAK.  Yeah Bernie has a real hankering for little kids and has so much time on his hands to engage in nefarious activity, as he tours around the country trying to get people to understand the importance of passing sensible healthcare legislation, minimum wage legislation, fighting against big Pharma, the science deniers.... such a pity that you can't see who's on your side. What a goddamn disappointment this thread is.

             ". She lied on loan documents to obtain a loan and then used that loan to buy property. The property was bought from the Catholic Church in Vermont and this Church just so happens to be in debt for a sexual abuse scandal."
            </p>
            <p>
             Why was Bernie's wife stretching so far to buy this property?  Was she using her position to help the church out of a tight spot?     Was she reaching for her own glory as to create a legacy as being the person who expanded the school to the extent of prestige as that particular piece of property would have brought?

             You are correct that we do not have all the answers to this - but as you can see, there are only a limited number of possibilities here.
            </p>
            <p>
             It will not take much more investigation to find out if she is, in fact, Catholic herself.   If she is, that pushes the ball further down the court.

              Recall same thing happened when Ted Turner promised Harvard a lot of money and then the
market turned and he had to renege.

              And it is the Catholic Church and its priests which are accused of sexual abuse of children (not Bernie) which has been going on since day #1 of the church as the Italians tell us .....
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Sexual abuse scandals[edit]
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Angell has been criticized for his management of sexual abuse allegations during his tenure in the Diocese of Providence, which experienced the longest legal battle over such allegations in the nation and later announced a $13.5 million settlement in 36 different lawsuits in 2002.[13][19][20] In 1989 he promised to "take care of it" when a Providence priest was accused of misconduct with boys while working at a Haitian orphanage; Demers was later brought back to work in the diocese.[21] He testified in a 1990 lawsuit that he did not take allegations against another priest, Rev. William O'Connell, seriously.[21] O'Connell was later convicted and served a short sentence before moving to New Jersey, where he committed more crimes and died in prison.[21]
              </p>
              <p>
               During his tenure in Burlington, records show Angell allowed six accused priests to remain in active ministry within Vermont.[21] He refused to identify them publicly, but then gave their names to the State Attorney General and placed them under suspension.[21] At a news conference in March 2005, Angell described the sexual abuse scandals as the most difficult challenge he faced during his time as bishop.[22] He said, "People have been so shocked by all of this and it's a wonderful compliment to us really, in the sense that they expect so much more of us than anyone else and we shouldn't fail them. It's been very difficult and difficult for these priests too [who] have been in trouble. The victims first and foremost have my concern. After that I think of the priests how because of one, one little lapse or something, something terrible happened. I can't help but feel sorry for them. I decry what they did."[22]

              We do know that Bernie is a Hillary shill, bought and paid for 100%. So we do have to dig deeper. Hillary riggs primaries against Bernie and Bernie endorces Hillary? It's a racket!

               There is no evidence for Bernie being a Hillary supporter --

               Quite to the contrary and more likely that he was threatened if he didn't support Hillary.

              I have been a member over 6 mos. and have constantly railed against msm.  I quoted them because no matter what you quote on here lately someone has a beef about it.  Throwing It Out There? That is just my point.  The evidence is nil. You don't get to just start connecting things just because you are a Trump lover, do not agree with the politics, etc.  These are heinous charges.  What we print here we should be responsible for.  There are new people coming on here everyday checking us out.  We must be careful , that is all I am saying.

               Stupid details, like the fact that Jew Bernie is a creep, phony politician who used to write pornography, and the fact that he and his wife did crooked business with the pedos at the catholic church.. because Pedos do business with other Pedos.
              </p>
              <p>
               And Pedos defend other pedos, which is what you most likely are.. Joo creep

               He's been there long enough that an accidental presidency would simply have been the cherry on top. He wouldn't be a lifer if he had principles, or at least he would've been a hell of a lot louder.

              You know what, I don't agree with Trump either.  I did not vote for him but he is the President.  It is just disgusting that people are charging someone with such a heinous crime because of Jew hatred or politics.  I cannot find anything that links Bernie to child sex abuse.  I am really disappointed in the people on here.  I have tried to be respectful of people since there are a lot of Trump supporters on here, but let me tell you, it has not been returned.  The College/Church accusations are being pushed by a Trump Vermont atty.  I have never commented about Trump and the rape charges, because, darn it, I just don't think there is enough proof out there.  So, I am sorry child rape is the most hated crime in this country, as it should be, but people are ready to tar an feather Bernie because of a real estate investigation that happened to have abusive priests at the church. HELLO!  What church has not had abusive priests?

                There is no point arguing with IDF / Mossad / Israel / Zionist shills like carmencita,  Blacksmith21 and DarkMath.. don't waste your time. .their only job is to argue and defend the Baby Killing state of IsraHell and its agents around the world.

                Shut up.  I never get into those fights.  Your problem is with him being a Democratic Socialist, and yes many on that post did make hateful Jewish remarks.   It seems to me, that many on that post were doing exactly that.  Ready to brand someone a pedo just because they do not agree with his politics.  That is Un American as I see it.  You do not convict someone with flimsy evidence.  It smacks of vigilantism.  The Let's Hang Him Mentality.

                 Good for you Carmencita! These ppl can not see the forest for the trees and are doing a MAJOR dis-service to this investigations. A bunch of morons!! Bernie and Jane have given their lives as public servants and barely have two pots to piss in in the way of money-to accuse them in this way is absurd and unforgivable. Sure, this is a place for research, but NOT EVERYONE IS A PEDOPHILE!!!

                  After what I saw when I went to the Convention in Philly I will be forever changed.  The delegates for Bernie told me how horribly they were treated.  Also, Bernie and Jane were able to buy the second house only because Jane's parents passed away.  When they sold the home they inherited, they were able to buy a nice family beach home.  No this was not one of those Hampton Home.  Just something nice after working over 30 in DC.

                 Well, i guess according to your logic, it is ok to do business with pedophiles, (and the Sanders KNEW about the pedophilia scandals and lawsuits) and yet, they chose do to business with them.. because of course.. the JEWS don't care about ethics.. they just care about PROFITS and MONEY.

            "A May 2009 report by psychotherapist Richard Sipe, who has been a professional witness in 57 lawsuits,[7] found that there were extensive problems in the sexual behavior of 102 Vermont clergy "whose records were available" between 1950-2002. Sipe claimed that 23 of these priests were sexually involved with children under the age of 13 years, 15 were reported for involvement with married women and 19 priests who had sexual relationships with adult men. He asserted that out of this group, 49 priests can be said to have had a homosexual orientation."

              He's never made mention of the unsolved murder of Seth Rich, his supporter. Now, he's under investigation by the FBI for bank fraud / laundering from a Catholic Church with ties to sexual abuse of Haitian orphans. He introduced human trafficking laws that gave money to NGOs signed by Bill Clinton before he left office. He's friends with Allen Ginsberg. He wrote fantasy fiction about underage gang rape.

               What you're saying is complete exaggeration as there is no evidence that Bernie Sanders
has ever sexually abused a child.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bernie Sanders has attacked the banking industry in his campaigns so it is not unusual that
there would be a return attack, especially by pedophiles like Hillary, Podesta and their Media Matters
organization which does it dirty work for it -- Media Matters.
              </p>
              <p>
               How many others voted for those same human trafficking laws which gave money to NGO's?
And how many of those members of the Senate/Congress are you accusing of sexually abusing children?
              </p>
              <p>
               And this is McCarthy-Era thinking ...
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                He's friends with Allen Ginsberg&gt;
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               guilt by association ... with no actual evidence....
              </p>
              <p>
               Sadly, today, we have to look at suspicion with every individual who rises to political power --
but that means ALL of them and it also means having at least some actual evidence that the
person has done something other than having done business with the Catholic Church who are
the actual abusers of children ....
              </p>
              <p>
               Much like the pedophiles Hillary, Podesta, Alefantis and others, including their worker bee
David Brock/Media Matters who does their dirty work for them.

                 Hi LA --
                </p>
                <p>
                 Well, it's just my personal opinion but we are all learning about all of this together
and there is a lot to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                 From what I see we have CIA/Congress/government and our military involved in 
MKULTRA and child trafficking over decades ... and we have to keep open minds 
about how many this operation may have touched.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do recall recently reading something about how these things proceeded on a more
casual basis and an invitation -- but you may be killed if you didn't participate and tried to walk out 
after having seen it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There were a lot of threads up here about "The Farm" and it turns out that Allen Dulles actually would
regularly go to a place he called "The Farm" either on CIA property or very near it (as I recall) and it's
a place where the CIA used to train pedophiles.  I have to look for that link, but I believe it is also in 
"The Devil's Disciple" which I am still reading right now -- with many interruptions.
But Dulles used to continue to go there to work even after JFK fired him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also recall that for a very long time those who supported Clinton rejected notions that
he was a sexual assaulter of women, or that he and Hillary were involved in murders.
                </p>
                <p>
                 :)

                  I think one of the hardest parts when this all comes into the mainstream is to determine what happens to the adult victims? If a politician was forced to commit horrible atrocities against their will, but then also helped early on to expose it, despite being blackmailed, what happens to them?

                   You should take a look at MKULTRA/Monarch -- though Richard Helms had the Monarch records destroyed when he retired from the CIA - but do think that some of the records still exist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Difficult to answer your question about any adult victim....while there is an amazing amount of info that survivors have given us there is still a lot unknown, I imagine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Children seem to be killed fairly quickly because their bodies are so damaged.
Ironically, we also see this same kind of situation with women appearing in porn because the sexual violence is so brutal that their bodies are too damaged to go on past two or three months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If you're a politician who is of some value to them over long term I doubt that they let you leave alive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I was also thinking today about how pedophiles are often murdered by other prisoners and I doubt any of us would spill any tears over that .... but it might also be a case where those people might have supplied some names of higher up's involved in organized human trafficking.

            Pretty sure the DNC/Deep State are muddying the waters so when they go down, he goes down too.

It's classic projection; blame others of what they are guilty of doing.

             You guys have been saying for months now that the "deep state" is going down.
            </p>
            <p>
             What you fail to realize is that this is all a bullshit psy-op.  There is no "war" between Trump and the "deep state."  Trump is dirty as hell, and all these MULTIPLE psy-ops all benefit TRUMP..

              As long as they do something to clean up, or carpet bomb (not picky) the Southeast Corridor I don't care if it benefits lizard monsters from pluto. Politics is politics, the song remains the same. Just depends on how clearly you can hear it from your location.

            This "crypto Jewish Angell" (READ: Angel) family are PLAYERS.  Priest Kenneth Angell's younger brother David, who created and produced the TV show "Frasier" (more evidence that they are JEWISH), was a phony "victim" of the huge insurance FRAUD case and false flag known as the 09/11 "attacks."

            "His younger brother David Angell, the Emmy Award-winning creator and producer of Frasier, and his wife Lynn died during the September 11 attacks aboard American Airlines Flight 11."
