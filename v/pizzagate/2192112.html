            I think the Weinstein case could potentially go a long way to exposing Pedophiles in power and showing the legitimacy of PizzaGate. I have a vision of it going very little further and a few names get sexual harassment charges as a result. Distraction or not, these stories cannot be ignored - although if it was intended as a distraction it may backfire horribly!

            HW is NOT a distraction! It s the tip of the iceberg and the way the DOJ can get in an investigate and get these pervs on record.

            The other issues are there and I'm not not reading other news. I've posted on the LV shooter, posted in #pizzagate, but it doesn't fit in the parameters of this subverse so I posted in #pizzagatewhatever.
