<p>Boom! First glimpse time, and this is undoubtedly is only the tip of the iceberg. A <s>whore </s>party gal named Beck Dorey-Stein has written a tell-all about her time <s>on her back ... on her knees ...</s> working as The Kenyan\'s stenographer. Her job? To record everything he said. Not sure how she got all that done and still find time to carry on an affair with a senior staffer, but what do you expect from a skank who got her job \'\'serendipitously\'\' from Craigslist? Are they sure they don\'t mean Backpages? Not that Craigslist is that much better ... </p>
<p>Other than her describing herself as a complete douche, she leaks the party culture that went on. No wonder the press hates our POTUS so much! No more \'\'SUMMER CAMP ON STEROIDS\'\'!!! That was her description, not mine. There are tons of things in this article including the popping of drugs of choice, the women dubbing themselves \'\'THE VAGIANTS\'\', the steamy affair with a senior staffer, and a mention of the supersecret schoolm Sidwell Friends School - \'the Harvard of Washington\'s private schools\'. It\'s the school The Kenyan\'s <s>adopted ...</s> biological daughters attended and Ms. Becky had a semester-long tutoring job there. Methinks that her behavior at that school perhaps led to her being hired for the stenographer\'s position. It sounds like she was pretty prolific in The Vagiant department, but then that\'s me. You read the article and see what you think: </p>

<h1>EXCLUSIVE: \'It was like summer camp on steroids.\' White House stenographer lifts lid on President Obama\'s Air Force One and reveals how \'Xanax and Ambien\' on long flights made \'awkward hookups with colleagues funny and bizarre\'</h1>
<ul>
<li>Former White House stenographer Beck Dorey-Stein tells how traveling with President Obama and his press pool was like \'summer camp on steroids\' </li>
<li>In her upcoming memoir, From Corner of the Oval, Dorey-Stein lifts the lid on her travels on Air Force Once and her affair with a staffer</li>
<li>Everyone took their drug of choice on long flights: Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made \'awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,\' she writes</li>
<li>She broke protocol when she got involved in a hot and heavy sexual relationship with one of Obama\'s senior staffers in hotel rooms</li>
</ul>
<p>Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\'s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House staffer.  ...</p>
<p>Beck knew she wasn\'t a good fit for a job at a Washington think tank, PR firm, or nonprofit after her semester-long tutoring job at Sidwell Friends School - \'the Harvard of Washington\'s private schools\' - ended in 2011.</p>
<p>The selective Quaker school in Washington has educated a lengthy roster of notable alumni from Teddy Roosevelt\'s son, Richard Nixon\'s daughter,  Al Gore\'s son, Chelsea Clinton, and the Obama girls, Malia and Sasha, as well as the children of members of Congress. ...</p>
<p>Beck intended to only live in D.C. for the duration of the job – three months...\'because who wants to live in DC? – A one trick political pony town,\' she writes. </p>
<p>\'My job in the spring of 2011 was to help those hormonally-charged stressballs chill the f**k out\', Beck writes while casting an eye to what looked like \'human Ken dolls in a short-sleeved button-down\'.</p>
<p>Sitting across from one of them at the school one day flirting and thinking he was a teacher, the man told her he was working although he did not seem to be doing anything.</p>
<p>He was a Secret Service agent watching Malia.</p>
<p>In her new job assignment, Beck was advised by the hiring agency to stay away from the Secret Service agents as well as \'stay with your boyfriend\'.    
</p>
<p>She knew this was going to be her big break and felt confident leaving her boyfriend, Sam, back in Washington working for a PR firm writing speeches for gubernatorial candidates.</p>
<p>He always encouraged her and supported her taking the job that would separate them.</p>
<p>But Beck broke protocol of the job when she got involved in a hot and heavy secret sexual relationship with one of Obama\'s senior staffers in hotel rooms - and fell in love. </p>
<p>Left with a broken heart and feeling duplicitous with too many nights at a bar getting drunk, she says the stolen thrill was worth the heartache although it cost her the relationship with her boyfriend in D.C.    
</p>
<p>Boarding Air Force One for the first time with an overstuffed duffel because she didn\'t know what not to pack, she thought she saw actor Jim Carrey sitting near the front of the plane.</p>
<p>He turned out to be the man she fell hopelessly in love with, Jason Wolf - the man she left her hotel room door ajar for in foreign cities. ... </p>
<p>Obama\'s traveling staff was almost all women and dubbed \'the Vagiants\'.</p>
<p>This wasn\'t the case when he first took office in 2009 when there were few female senior staffers. Now it was the choice of the women to give themselves that name.</p>
<p>\'Prudish? I would especially love it if the men in the West Wing nicknamed themselves the 10-Inch Senior Staffs\', she writes.</p>
<p>Beck was one of three stenographers rotating on the travel schedule.</p>
<h1>On international trips, media chipped in and chartered a private plane dubbed the \'party plane.\' ...</h1>
<p>Traveling on to Cambodia, Beck walked out with the press and left recording equipment attached in the room where the president had met with the Japanese prime minister.</p>
<p>This could have been interpreted as a spy tactic with a recorder still running. But any disaster was avoided by Wolf, who quickly removed the equipment.  
</p>
<p>Wolf never talked about his serious relationship with his girlfriend Brooke back home in LA whose father was a famous producer.</p>
<p>Beck would leave her hotel room door open for him so he could sneak in at night.   
</p>
<p>They carried on across the globe while Beck tried to keep her boyfriend Sam out of her mind.</p>
<p>She describes experiencing \'the best sleepover party ever\' where everyone took their drug of choice on long flights – Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made any \'awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,\' she writes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, yup, yup! First of all they give the job of recording The Kenyan to a skank. Next she JUST HAPPENS to hookup with the son of a HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER? </p>
<p>It\'s all a gigantic coincidence ... I\'m sure.</p>
<h1>========</h1>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>Does everyone know what the term, \'VAGIANT\' means? I was going to include it, and will now: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vagiant">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vagiant</a></p>
<p>vagiantsex
n. A vagina that is legendary in both girth and depth, usually covered with a monstrous amount of pubes.
&quot;I was doin\' this gal last night and she didn\'t even notice. I think I have discovered a vagiant.&quot;</p>
<h1>cave#ballroom#room-for-two#penis-hangar#hugina</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>But there\'s another even more frightening aspect to the term. It was something brought up by <a href="https://voat.co/user/Blacksmith21">@Blacksmith21</a>. He\'s had personal experience with Ambien. His comments from below: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can speak from personal experience Ambien is fucked up. Especially the XR/CR version. We used to use them while deploying. Very easily, someone could double dose another on Ambien, do what they want to them, and have no recollection of the previous night\'s activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will become pertinent in a moment because VAGIANT is also a movie that was released in 2015. Here\'s the link and the storyline: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5313844/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5313844/</a></p>
<h1>During hypnosis, a therapist is having her way with her patient. While he is unconscious, vivid dreams appear until he is suddenly awakened.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>So one of the side effects, and one attested to by Blacksmith21, is BLACKING OUT and not remembering what happened. VAGIANT the movie is about a patient who is unconscious and being raped, but not remembering. He\'s only experiencing dreams until awakened. </p>
<p>Another coincidence? Trailer for movie: </p>

            Now here's a memoir written by a girl who seems not to be able to keep he pants on, but it might just be the first glimpse behind that veiled curtain of illusion. It allows a peek at what was really going on in and the culture that The Kenyan embraced and nurtured while destroying America.

            She describes experiencing 'the best sleepover party ever' where everyone took their drug of choice on long flights – Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made any 'awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,' she writes.

           Yup, yup, yup! First of all they give the job of recording The Kenyan to a skank. Next she JUST HAPPENS to hookup with the son of a HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER?

           It's all a gigantic coincidence ... I'm sure.

           EDIT:
          </p>
          <p>
           Does everyone know what the term, 'VAGIANT' means? I was going to include it, and will now:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vagiant">

           <p>
            vagiantsex
n. A vagina that is legendary in both girth and depth, usually covered with a monstrous amount of pubes.
"I was doin' this gal last night and she didn't even notice. I think I have discovered a vagiant."
           </p>
           <h1>
            cave#ballroom#room-for-two#penis-hangar#hugina
           </h1>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           But there's another even more frightening aspect to the term. It was something brought up by
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Blacksmith21">
            @Blacksmith21
           </a>
           . He's had personal experience with Ambien. His comments from below:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            I can speak from personal experience Ambien is fucked up. Especially the XR/CR version. We used to use them while deploying. Very easily, someone could double dose another on Ambien, do what they want to them, and have no recollection of the previous night's activities.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           This will become pertinent in a moment because VAGIANT is also a movie that was released in 2015. Here's the link and the storyline:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5313844/">
             https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5313844/
            </a>
           </p>
           <h1>
            During hypnosis, a therapist is having her way with her patient. While he is unconscious, vivid dreams appear until he is suddenly awakened.
           </h1>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So one of the side effects, and one attested to by Blacksmith21, is BLACKING OUT and not remembering what happened. VAGIANT the movie is about a patient who is unconscious and being raped, but not remembering. He's only experiencing dreams until awakened.
          </p>
          <p>
           Another coincidence? Trailer for movie:

             Yup, no scandals, but only because the press never picked up on any of this stuff. But they did the same thing with Bush and those boys who used to visit the WH at night.

            You need a link to the Wikileak email or a thread including a link to it, and you are implying it was an Obama admin email. It was not. It was a Stratfor email. Please correct that per Rule 2.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I should probably point out that this girl's tell-all is probably another "flooding fake" disinfo campaign designed to bury the Kenyan's true nastiness by fabricating a controlled smear from an easily dismissed, "tainted" source. You may want to state that, so we don't have to put the disinfo warning flair on it.

             I never claimed it was his email. I said this submission fit in with the email drop where people were asking for how thin to slice pizza:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It's connected to the world of pizzagate by the emails that emerged. What with memos asking how thinly they wanted the pizza sliced for sharing and the like, a memoir written by a girl who seems not to be able to keep he pants on might just be the first glimpse behind that veiled curtain of illusion. It allows a peek at what was really going on in and the culture that The Kenyan embraced and nurtured while destroying America.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             A two-year-old could understand that, but then we're talking about Esoteric.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would I put that this is disinfo? You and I and the other pizzagaters know it's more, but this is a peek into that world. How is it disinfo? How do you know it's disinfo? All we know is she wrote a book, had her pants around her ankles for most of the time, and somehow managed to record what The Kenyan was saying. I don't see how this buries anything. In fact, it makes me anxious to know the dirtier secrets.

              Smears and revelations from questionable characters who stand to profit from their tell-all interviews and books don't harm the person they are attacking. They have the opposite effect. They make the target look like the victim. Setting up such attacks to front-run revelations of real crimes and corrupt behavior is a standard disinfo tactic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you for clarifying the email connection, but I am still not clear on how this woman or her book connects to the emails. Is there something in the book that is similar to the content of the emails? The pizza email was hearsay from Stratfor guys, not a leak of Obama admin insiders. The book is hearsay from a morally questionable profiteer. The only connection I'm seeing is a very very tenuous "there MIGHT be something in the book that sheds light on those pizza parties." That really isn't "directly related to child sex abuse by the elite".
             </p>
             <p>
              However, were you to frame this as possible evidence of a disinfo campaign to cover up and discredit any forthcoming testimony that IS pizzagate-related, that would fall under Rule 1.
             </p>
             <p>
              You get where I'm going with this?
             </p>
             <p>
              I will leave this up for a few more hours in case you want to edit it more to make that case, since it took me so long to reply to your edit. As is, this doesn't satisfy Rule 1.

               An email is hearsay? Since when? If Joe Blow tells someone Jane Blow that he saw an email and then Jane tells someone else that JOE TOLD THEM THAT HE SAW AN EMAIL, if that  person repeats what Jane said, it's hearsay. Joe's statement isn't. The person who witnesses/receives an email can testify to what they saw/received. That is not hearsay it's direct evidence. Whether they're believed is another matter. But if a third person can't testify to what Joe said when they heard from someone what he said. So this skank can testify or write about what she saw and witnessed on the plane. She can testify or write about the person she alleges to have had the affair with. That is he right to do. It is not hearsay, it is her assertion/statement as to what happened. Now the other person is free to admit or deny it, UNLESS it's in a court of law. If the matter were brought into a court of law, both parties would have to offer proof of their assertions. Usually, this is beyond what they stated and relies on dna evidence, hotel bills, photos, emails, whatever. But sometimes it does come down to two people's statements, the defendant and plaintiff. That's just for starters.

                The people at Stratfor were discussing something they did not have direct knowledge of. They were not part of the Obama Administration and did not actually attend the event they reference. At least, no evidence has ever been put forward that they did. They are discussing something they heard about; possibly joking about it.

                And, you still have spelled out no specific connection between what this woman is claiming and what Wikileaks revealed. This is all just a big maybe. So, I will unfortunately have to remove the thread now.

             <p>
              Ambien is in a class of drugs known as sedative-hypnotics. This non-benzodiazepine “z-drug” has the same medical effectiveness as benzodiazepines like Xanax without the same hazardous and habit-forming properties those drugs are known for.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other signs of an Ambien addiction include:
             </p>
             <p>
              Refilling prescriptions unusually often
   Repeatedly taking larger doses than prescribed
   Experiencing cravings for Ambien
   Engaging in dangerous situations without any memory of them later
   Spending large amounts of money on the drug
   Isolating oneself from family and friends
             </p>
             <p>
              Most Ambien addictions begin with a simple case of short-term insomnia. Some users underestimate the addictive potential of Ambien because it’s prescribed by a doctor and they only use it to help them sleep.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ambien becomes less and less effective after taking it for more than a couple weeks. At this point, some users can’t stop taking the drug because their insomnia is even worse — they are incapable of sleeping without Ambien.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before long I needed to take a pill every night. If I tried to fall asleep naturally, I would have what’s called “rebound insomnia,” meaning I would be up all night as a result of taking the drug the night before.

              I can speak from personal experience Ambien is fucked up.  Especially the XR/CR version.  We used to use them while deploying.  Very easily, someone could double dose another on Ambien, do what they want to them, and have no recollection of the previous night's activities.

               When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different. When he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him.”

               I saw an interesting connection theory to Ambien and Kate Spade And Anthony Bourdain...Ok so here goes...They saw the "horrific" ambien tweeting that Rosanne did and decided to quit cold turkey as to not take chances tweeting something horrific themselves and well you know the ending so no need for spoiler alert. NOW THIS IS JUST A THEORY I READ but in my opinion an interesting one to say the least. KS was about to divorce so she need not have those dare I say "Ambient moments" and AB was about to start a new season and already had a tendency to "tell it like he sees it"  and may have been warned by CNN already....just saying..

                 Yeah the doorknob thing keeps coming up too. I honestly dont think he offed himself but it COULD make a guy that was a blue belt in JJ trained by the best I am told unable to defend himself. A perfect storm for murder if you will. They must have brought their best along. Or drugged him ...maybe WITH AMBIEN haha! Sorry I dont mean to make light of  very dark situation.

                  That's more than a one-man hit job, unless you are planning on shooting him.  I'd be curious what the toxicology shows, but that can be faked as well.  I'm pretty sure the DS has some pretty nasty ways of incapacitating someone.  Dr. Gottleib stuff...

                   Yes expecting to get the truth from the media is like asking a cheating girlfriend caught in the act ...There is already a script written and even if there is a last minute change in the script (re ENTY BI and his saying there were supposed to be two) then they will have a back up plan. Its disgusting and sadly up to us "tin foil hat nutters" to figure out the real story. We will never fully know though.
