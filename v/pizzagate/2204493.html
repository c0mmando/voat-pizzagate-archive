<p>That first encounter of champagne and small talk would end in a much less elegant fashion hours later in a hotel room, where Weinstein stood before Brock naked and solicited a massage. She said she locked herself in a bathroom to escape him.</p>
<p>Still shaken by that night in 1998, Brock believes the events were set in motion by men connected to Weinstein.</p>',
