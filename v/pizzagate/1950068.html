             Indeed...especially since I heard the episode on the Opperman Report radio show where he interviewed the guy who runs the illegalnews blog and how he was the first to publish what he discovered to be a sick a Donut shop in Portland, Oregon, Voodoo Donuts, now I don't care about Haitian mythology (I care more that the Clintons stole all the money to rebuild the country and NOTHING has been done there in 7 years), but the fact they only have 2 kind of donuts and they're shaped like dicks and such and a twitter post by one of the owner said it was hilarious to see "homophobic teenagers eat a cock &amp; ball donut, which is basically a chocolate donut in the form of a penis with white cream inside. having fun eating it etc.". I agree there's a degree of irony here that's funny, because they're idiots if they don't actually notice what the hell they are eating, it's a lot more obvious than pizza, which in of itself is either round or square when it is baked, even CPPP doesn't have dick-shaped pizza slices or such over-the-top nothing-subtle-about-it like The Voodoo Donuts Shop.
            </p>
            <p>
             And now they're combining "memes" on a twitter ad about those horrors and what lies behind them. If it was just a store making questionable shaped dessert and was for adults only and nothing else I wouldn't care, like I don't care about adults only stripper bars where contact means you're out with a black eye in a matter of seconds.

            I already identified the pedo ring at their Austin location.  Guess nobody from there is interested in stopping childrape.

             Well, find some Austin board...I noticed that Americans from "middle-america" use that forum called Topixx a lot, that would be a way to tell the people in Austin/around it. I doubt it's only Austin though, I hear that in Texas it's a kind of Dallas/San Antonio/Austin axis when it comes to child trafficking. I forgot where I heard that though unfortunately, it was a credible source since I basically do not listen to unreliable sources, I hope you guys learned your lesson (some of you anyway) with David Seamans,who's a failed journalist because he's a slightly mentally ill guy trying to make a buck any way he could so he could keep high upper middle class apartment.

             Schizophrenia kicks in at around 20 year old for males...it's only a downward spiral after that if you don't take any medication.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, like I suggested, use middle-america's forums and such to show the info purely as a kind of PSA, this place is our place to organize, the best way we can; with all the proof links in one post, don't get caught in the trap of having to reply 20 times to make your point. I think Topixx has area forums. I gave out the info in one forum (not Topixx though, lol, I don't frequent that place, I just know of it) I have mods in, a regular style forum, not a place like this or reddit or a *chan. I've been there since 2004...I have some clout, at first I talked about PG early on just a few days before elections when I felt sick to my stomach for about 2 weeks in the mod only forums and enough of them are aware enough, it's not a conspiracy forum, but let's say that it's full of truly enlightened people and the people in DC all said they'd spread the word.

             Apparently CPPP is losing some business, not making as much money as they used t...financial ruination is the best way to ruin these people because cops are not our friends, most of the time.
