            The microcredit - human (organ) trafficking angle is important but 1) Podesta Group is run by Tony 2) $90.000 job is peanuts because 3) Podesta Group is ranked 3rd most powerful lobbyists and represents criminals much worse than 'terrorists' for many, many times that amount.
           </p>
           <p>
            But yeah, microcredit by Yunus cs.was a get-poor-quick scheme ran by evil elites to harvest desperates.

             Run by Tony, but started by both of them. It's also obvious via wikileaks that they were in regular contact about Podesta Group business. In fact, after the leak, Podesta Group had to
             <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/podesta-group-admits-undisclosed-foreign-government-advocacy/">
              file an amendment to their lobbying disclosure
             </a>
             to acknowledge that a lobbyist (Tony) was in communication with a government official (John). (Which also acknowledged the authenticity of the emails, suckers!)
             <br/>
             I agree, accuracy is very important, and Tony runs the lobbyist group. But John is totally implicated in whatever the Podesta Group does, imo.

            Wait for this...George Soros has ties to the Bangladesh Bank, 'BRAC' Bank. Soros is even quoted on Brac’s website. Direct quote taken from BRAC’s webpage three months ago reads:

           <p>
            “The billion dollars in microloans that BRAC extends each year to poor people is just the beginning of the story of this remarkable organization”. 
George Soros, chairman of the Open Society Institute.
