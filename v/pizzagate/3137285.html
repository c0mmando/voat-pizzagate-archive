            2 things. . . Acosta when he made the sweetheart deal.. may have only had that option to get Epstein into court.  There was no real way to make most of the charges stick due to law jurisdictions and rules and blah-blah's and a whole load of bullshit put in place to benefit rich criminals.  IE.. no conviction, aquittement and impossiblity to get tried AGAIN for the same crimes. (again.. Ricjh criminals putting backdoors and loopholes in place to assure they dont go to prison..)
2nd thing.. Trump has been against human trafficking since the start.  With Acosta's well known role in the 'deal', is it compatible that he would get into Trump's cabinet?  Keeping enemies closer?  Or hiding your hand until it's time to testify... (how do you get evidence accepted?) 
So hard to be sure what's happening anymore..

             Yep. This is why I am tracking it closely. It makes no sense. Check out this recent piece by Imperator Rex (who was forced off Twitter for debunking the Russian collusion farce over a year ago and has since been proven right):
            </p>
            <p>
             He notes the long-standing pattern of the MSM trying (and failing) to tie Trump to criminals:
             <a href="https://quodverum.com/2019/03/75/endgame-potus-trump-s-vindication-nears.html">
              https://quodverum.com/2019/03/75/endgame-potus-trump-s-vindication-nears.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's video of Trump testifying before Congress in 1993 about the mob:
             <a href="https://twitter.com/JFNYC1/status/1113423492077301761">
              https://twitter.com/JFNYC1/status/1113423492077301761
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             You'd think with all of these claims, they would have been able to make at least
             <em>
              one
             </em>
             criminal claim stick over the years. In my opinion, it basically leaves two possibilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Trump isn't a criminal and has been trying to drain the swamp for decades.
             </li>
             <li>
              Trump is a criminal who has been working for decades as an FBI informant
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The problem with the second possibility is that during the 2016 Presidential campaign, the FBI and DOJ were controlled by very bad folks who literally committed treason to weaponize the intelligence apparatus against him. If they
             <em>
              had
             </em>
             criminal dirt on him, they would not have needed to risk hanging by the neck until dead to cobble together the FISA fiasco. It's not logical.

              Quote : "Substantial amounts of imported heroin were sold to the Gambino Mafia family in New York, which allegedly arranged for nationwide distribution, according to a complaint filed in the case in Philadelphia. Some of the heroin was passed to buyers in pizza parlors.
Arrests were made in Baltimore; Buffalo, N.Y.; Miami; Newark, N.J.; New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco; and Rockford, Ill. In Italy, arrests were being made in Palermo, Bologna and Florence.
One of those arrested in the police roundup was Giuseppe Gambino, a nephew of Carlo Gambino, the late reputed head of the Gambino crime family.

              The only thorn in that idea.. is DId Trump find a find to give Mueller and Rodenstein a better deal and turn them against 'The Cabal'.. Rodenstein knew Cohn back from the McCarthy WITCH HUNT (sound familiar?)   If so everything is a psyop that the Clintons/Rothschild's didnt see coming..and the only real question after that is.. Will Trump give back the presidency or will he start a Borgiastic Dynasty that wont make the same greedy mistakes that the last couple of Dynasties made..
             </p>
             <p>
              Roger Clinton abnd Hillary Clinton knew the Gambino's very well..  I've always thrown a jaundiced eye over the idea that..  the Pizzagate distribution system (ie use parlours to distribute product) seem so similiar to the PIzza Connection case of New York in the 80's..(yes Rudy was in the thick of that making his name, grinding his teeth.. on RICO laws..)

               Yep, this is indeed the question. Power can corrupt anyone who wields it too long and without sufficient scrutiny and we must keep an eagle eye out to make sure that doesn't happen. We are the media, now.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did you by chance watch the videos by Steve Piesczenik about how Trump got into power? Where he comes straight out and says that a group of whitehats in the military and alphabet agencies would not allow the corrupt Clinton to take the reins of government even if Trump lost the election?
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump did not win the presidency on his own. He had help from the inside pulling off that miracle against the MSM and Clinton cabal. I highly doubt those folks would allow him to overthrow the Constitution. Nor would his supporters, who are united in their love of our founding principles. It would destroy the brand he is so proud of forever and leave his kids a legacy of shame.
              </p>
              <p>
               No, I think logically, he wants the glory of being right up there with George Washington on Mt. Rushmore. That's what fits his life story. He can't achieve that as a tyrant.

            I am wondering why the Dems would not want to just sweep this under a rug?  Why are they going to grill Acosta when it might  bring to the forefront a case that involves a former Dem. President?  I would love to see the squirming of Acosta as he tries to wriggle out of this, since he probably made a Sweetheart Deal for Epstein.  I would think he didn't have much of a choice actually.  He would be found on the same Florida beach as Whisenant maybe.

               U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ordered Wednesday that the U.S. Justice Department and the victims' attorneys decide by May 10 how they want to proceed with the case involving victims of 66-year-old Jeffrey Epstein.
