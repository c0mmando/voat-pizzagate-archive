Link to Alex Jones Debate with a Guy AT the incident at Comet Pizza, He is very angry.</p>
<p>I have been loosely following #Pizzagate only catching here an there from Voat, Twitter an Youtube.I was watching this on Alex Jones an it\'s good to hear the other side of the debate. I am still on the fence. Leaning more it\'s real. At least on the Elites having these types of rings. </p>
<p>What do you think of this guy argument. It literally all we are going to hear through out this entire thing. I personally think it isn\'t a argument. based on 60 mins on being at this place. Side note, Why would you bring the kids if you going to be reporting on something that may be tide to Pedophile. I would NEVER do that. Myself. Sure.</p>
<p>Never eaten there before, This is his first time there. So happens a Guy goes nuts there, Than goes onto AJshow. Pretty amazed how that turns out, also he only touched up on his main point 30 mins prior to showing up onto the show. The part about Alex Jones posting #pizzagate .  He talks as if posting ANYTHING about #pizzagate is derogatory. How? He seems so bent on painting Alex. Tell me what you think. Very Curious. Thanks for the read.</p>',

            Did Sharif Silmi have a gun on AJ? How the fuck can he say anything about innuendo without saying anything about the instagram pictures? The whole thing looked scripted. As much as he kept stressing that everyone was nice and normal at CPP was really odd.

             The guy did come off as Scripted. Atleast from my perspective. He came on without an argument. He has no empirical facts other than his 60 min sitdown inside the place.

            He didn't hear the shot? He was in the building and he didn't hear the shot? If it was an AR or a shotgun I'm pretty sure you would hear it from anywhere inside.

            Those wanting to investigate pedogate are getting blitzed hard. We need to be stronger than them. We will weather this PR storm. They are planning on us slinking away in fear and shame. History will prove the shame on them. Alex Jones just got caught unprepared and shit his pants. This lawyer nailed him with a weak argument. Jones could have undercut the lawyers whole argument by merely stating we are scrutinizing the 49th most powerful man in Washington, not some line cook or server. Jones is now backtracking hard on pizzagate. His lawyers probably scared the shit of him. Too bad.

            I'm of similar conclusion. I mean, I'm willing to admit that there is a chance that nothing is taking place at Comet Ping Pong. BUT, how can this guy make this assessment after visiting for one hour on one day? Has he been to any private parties there? What if these weird events are only once a month, or once every few months and very late at night? What if these events happen at times when no other regular employees are there? I don't know. Maybe nothing ever happens there, but you can't make that assessment after going during the day one time. Also, like you mentioned, wtf is he doing taking his kids there if he's never been there before? I mean, I'd at least scope the place out a few times during the day, and a few times at night to see what kind of stuff happens with the allegations of what's going on. Maybe he had friends that vouched for the place, I dunno. It does seem a bit off, but so does this whole thing. Everything about pizzagate is just very strange. Just my immediate reaction anyway, and my brain isn't quite working at full speed. Pretty tired. All of that said, what happened yesterday should not have happened, real or faked. Violence is not the answer. Nothing good will come from it.

             Very good input. I didn't think about maybe a friend gave him a heads up on it.

            Alex Jones has lost credibility ages ago. He's either sold out some time around 2008-2009, or has been a turncoat "plant" from the very beginning. He invites way too many EXTREMELY SKETCHY people on his show and treats them like they are legit. My personal favorites are when he brings "former CIA agents" on, the level of disinfo in each of those instances is so bad, it's laughable! Please look into a well-documented links between Infowars and Stratfor/Zionist mafia.
