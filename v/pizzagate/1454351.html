            Learn to think like the enemy.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Be extremely subtle even to the point of formlessness. Be extremely mysterious even to the point of soundlessness. Thereby you can be the director of the opponent's fate.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment — that which they cannot anticipate.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected .”

            Any high schoolers here? We should get some pamphlets distributed to schools with some of the basics. Seems like anybody 18 or younger is a survivor of the predator class, doesn't it? (Although its probably lots older.) Make high schoolers angry and curious. Get these pamphlets banned in schools and they'll be all over them.
           </p>

            Churches would be excellent to turn around, although I'd be careful who you talk to there. The moloch and 666 spirit cooking grossness and FBIanon saying Hillary is the antichrist got me onto the bandwagon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spam emails with strong memes are another idea I've had. Sadly, except for the church thing, I lack the technical expertise to put that into practice.

            If the body count starts piling up we could start a Rapture/Martyr/Canary board. Post pics of the people from Brietbart to Foster who've gone into body bags trying to get the word out and describe what they've tried to uncover. Journalists dying should be the canary in the coal mine that something isn't right.

            At first we need something strong to share, if we want people to get attention. An easily understandable picture that is disgusting enough to get attention and at the same time is 100% true. No speculation on it, no bullshit-crazy connections (aliens, satanism, whatever is too over the top; even if some stuff seems 'plausible', it's too much for someone to keep looking into it). See it this way: Would you have looked deeper into it, if someone told you about satanist rituals combined with child molesting and eating babies? I wouldn't have. I would think that's utter bullshit and I am still not convinced that satanism plays a part in this. We have to keep this in mind. Even if you're convinced, that's nothing to tell someone who hears the first time of this, that's how we lose credibility and the important part (saving children) will be ridiculed also.
           </p>
           <p>
            The image/flyer/message/whatever must consist of the following key elements if we want the peoples attention:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             It must be true and WITH source. NO speculations on it.
            </li>
            <li>
             It must be SHORT, but EXPRESSIVE/convincing/meaningful. (Like a good headline)
            </li>
            <li>
             It must lead/link to more information, but not towards too much at once. (Otherwise this would be overwhelming)
            </li>
            <li>
             It must be multilingual (pictures) + in the english language.
            </li>
            <li>
             It must be easy and fast to spread.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Number 5 is especially important. To produce a change, spreading this information MUST HAPPEN FAST! You know what happens if it's happening slowly? Some people will know and some time later their interest in the subject will die off (since they feel powerless to do anything and we humans tend to ignore stuff we can't change). Then the next wave of people might hear of it, but soon they'll be in the same situation as the first wave. This will continue for some time until most of us started to ignore it. That's why it has to happen FAST and at the SAME TIME. The information must be spread fast and widely at the same time, to get enough attention, for something to happen.

            I think we should continue gathering information and building a case before we start spreading the message far and wide.
            <br/>
            If you look at Wikipedia or Snopes they both claim that Pizzagate is a debunked conspiracy theory.  If people hear about Pizzagate and look it up they will dismiss it as conspiracy nonsense and never give it a second look.

            The long game can be more effective with such abysmal subject matter sometimes. For instance, you can challenge someone's perception of Child Protective Services on day/week one, and come back day/week two to leverage that challenge. Since pizzagate is essentially all circumstantial evidence, a person can dismiss it logically to save themselves from the horror. So establish a trust, illustrate the pattern of power and abuse, and then by the third exchange a person may be willing to speculate objectively.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think objectivity can be stressed enough.

             Sure you can fool most of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time.
Witch-HUNT, mass hysteria are not new.

             I really suggest you people study an old book called "Madness of Crowds" shit its not like what your doing is new, this shit is old, I'm talking 1,000's of years, but in all recorded witch-hunts they always come back to haunt the people who originate them.

             Child Services is FUCKING EVIL in every state in the USA, why don't you just find people who were in the system. The problem is you will not, because when they come forward you belittle them and insult them.
It's like the devil himself from 4chan deep child-porn has come to voat/v to fuck the sheep

              As for Scalia, I have read from two different sources (don't remember blogs, etc.) that an FBIAnon stated that BHO was mad at Scalia for being moving force for impeaching Clinton.  He always wanted to get back at him.  In Jan 2016 a pedo was arrested and FBI found his laptop filled with inordinate amounts of pedo pics, phone numbers, names, etc.  Supposedly, Scalia was involved in pedo ring with his secret group, Federalist Society and St. Huberis. Also, supposedly hunting children at Cibolo ranch that is owned by elite guy. Forgot his name.  Anyway all he info was sent to BHO and he finally had goods on Scalia and was taking him down. He called him to White House day he was leaving and gave him a Manila folder with pics, all the goods on him.  He told him he will vote on Citizens United that was coming bf the court later in summer.  He knew Scalia was against it and could tip court.  Scalia directly got on plane for Texas Cibiolo ranch for meeting with all his buddies. They believe the story goes that Scalia told all his elite, powerhouse friends that BHO had the goods on him and threatened to take him down and it will all come out about his involvement in everything pedo.  His friends fearing for all of this bad news coming out and bringing attention to them suffocated Scalia in his sleep.  BHO was furious he he found out that they took out one of their own to protect the secret society and all its pedo stuff. They say he was so mad he refused to go to funeral because he had been "one upped" by them and that Citizens United would be remanded to the lower court ruling bc Scalia was gone and could no longer break the tie. There is YouTube video about the guy that was initially arrested for pedo. Supposedly, the guy was so out in open about it and it was bc Scalia was protecting him through ct judges.  This could all be lies, who knows what to believe, but this is a theory floating around out of here.

            Yes I have been thinking just of this, thinking of how we may lose steam if we don't act more. Google searches starting to trend down, but still up in some places like Netherlands and Spain. The Daily Show if it happens will pump them up and we should be ready. I love this idea. I've been spamming alt media forums because there is a deafening silence while they all congratulate themselves for being on the fake news list put out by people who don't identify themselves. I will brainstorm some ads, have already been thinking of it.

             You've discredited it by adding the McCann stuff. The goal is to get the CPP/Podestas/HRC arrested. You can easily research those e-fits and the case to know why. Also, this is Portugal's jurisdiction, not USA. It will do nothing to add to the case. Only cause people to get lost in a foreign murder that will never be "solved" because it was already solved and the Max Clifford Production is the narrative. Don't understand my words, those names? Then you don't know enough to even cite the McCann case. Remove it please.

              I didnt make this, stop telling me to fix it. Also, if the Podestas are involved, then it's as relevant as anything else on that entire image. Nice try though.

             <p>
              What we know is that some creative troll on 4chan last July 2016, spent days talking jive about the FBI, Clinton Foundation. That the USA was involved in sex-slavery. Yes its all true, but no credible instance this person is FBI.

                Haven't U ppl figured this story out? I think most ppl in UK know, the parents sold their daughter to the elite a long time ago. The cops are fucked,  if they push forward they have to arrest the parents, at best the podesta get a slap on the hand.
This is NOT the best story, that's the problem with this 'investigation', if you wanted to get Podesta in Jail, you would research his involvement in the recent Turkish Failed Coup. Clinton Foundation got a lot of money with the promise of engineering a coup in Turkey and Podesta was the major player.
This Cann story is just bullshit, so that ppl feel sorry for the Podesta's and what they went through.
Think about Plan A,B,C; Had Hillary won PODESTA would now be a KING.

                Cann wasn't stolen, she was SOLD, most ppl in UK/spain accept this, perhaps the alt-tards at 4chan/reddit were the last to know

                Study EPSTEIN sex island, what did he get a slap on the wrist, even if it could be PROVEN that PODESTA were there, it is assumed that the parents SOLD the girl to Freud, and FREUD is dead now, so the cops can't even prosecute the bad-guy, Podesta's could just say "We didn't know".

                Idiots have  hard on to destroy Podesta, read his emails and do what fbiANON told you focus on the Clinton Foundation, I'm sure that HILLARY was selling children to the SAUDI's to fuck. It's there, but nobody is looking, everybody is fixated on bullshit like jimmy-comet or Portugal

                 Agree with you, but there is also the possibility that she died in the apt and was moved in the car after death based on the what the dogs found. I have tried explaining this and many at 8ch also have this knowledge but it was a shill mob that initially posted the efit over there and was immediately supported by dozens of shrill harpies claiming the case was solved and spred it. They posted numerous threads simultaneously, all identical, I counted at least seven. None had a source or included any text with real info. Just all caps screaming THEY MURDERED HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SPREAD IT!!!!!!!!!!. No matter what I or others familiar with the case wrote we were ignored and the shrieking continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It was a raid. Their agenda was to plant this and then push it and they did that and continue to do so. We had several threads over the next few days that were all McCann, the facts/sensible people versus the shrill shills. Anything we said we were called kikes, shills, pedos.  Unfortunately it spread like wildfire and won't go away.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I spent many months immersed in that case and I see people I respect on twitter pushing the three e-fits alongside with pics of both Podestas and Weiner with crazy captions.  And I will call it out when I see it. But I'm tired of posting reams of facts from the case and I'm getting snarky. You try if you have the energy, I'm going to focus on other things.
