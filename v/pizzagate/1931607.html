<blockquote>
<p>New investigations have revealed pedophile rings operating out of multiple UK children’s care homes with half-hearted investigations and thwarted prosecutions spanning the last 30 years. The UK has been plagued with child care home abuse scandals with multiple coverup accusations made against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, lost evidence, even <strong>suspicions that peodphile ring whistleblowers had been murdered.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wondering if we are in the same identical trajectory with the UK Pedogate? How can anyone deny that pizzagate is real when this JUST happened in the UK in all of the same, identical ways, and connections between ALL of these people in one way or another through politics, the Rothchilds, Freud, Madeline McCann and over to John Podesta inside the presidential campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remarkable similarities between Jimmy Savile and John Podesta’s political capital cannot be ignored. Accusations against Jimmy Savile began in at least 1970, but were dismissed as ludicrous-exactly the reaction to the idea that John Podesta could be similarly inclined. And yet, 30 years later, the NHS releases this stunning report detailing Savile’s easy ability to abuse without impunity-precisely due to his connections and protection of being a political “insider”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, nice link to amazing VOAT research: FBI Anonymous on 4chan, which actually makes me sad that Anon, so far has only been half right. Where were all the arrests we were told would happen?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People had already began dialoguing online with “FBI Anon” on 4chan by this time. Among other things, the AMAs (Ask Me Anything) predicted a series of pedophile-related arrests taking place after the Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2017. They described a wave of arrests, first dealing with low level arrests, moving on to mid-level arrests and ending in highest-level arrests. It would be impossible to prove that this was a dialogue with a real “FBI insider”. True or not, this seemed to fuel a new wave of investigation, as researchers turned to older Wikileaks, cross referencing old materials with new leads and publishing even more information online.`</p>
