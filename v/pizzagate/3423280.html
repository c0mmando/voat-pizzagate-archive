<h1 id="md-excerpts">Excerpts:</h1>
<p>Last February, shortly after Peter O’Rourke became chief of staff for the Department of Veterans Affairs, he received an email from Bruce Moskowitz with his input on a new mental health initiative for the VA. “Received,” O’Rourke replied. “I will begin a project plan and develop a timeline for action.” </p>
<p>O’Rourke treated the email as an order, but Moskowitz is not his boss. In fact, he is not even a government official. Moskowitz is a Palm Beach doctor who helps wealthy people obtain high-service “concierge” medical care. </p>
<p>More to the point, he is one-third of an informal council that is exerting sweeping influence on the VA from Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, Florida. <strong>The troika is led by Ike Perlmutter, the reclusive chairman of Marvel Entertainment,</strong> who is a longtime acquaintance of President Trump’s. The third member is a lawyer named Marc Sherman. None of them has ever served in the U.S. military or government. </p>
<p>Yet from a thousand miles away, they have leaned on VA officials and steered policies affecting millions of Americans. They have remained hidden except to a few VA insiders, who have come to call them “the Mar-a-Lago Crowd.” …</p>
<p>… The event also turned into a promotional opportunity for Perlmutter’s company. <strong>Executives from Marvel and its parent company, Disney, joined Johnson &amp; Johnson as sponsors of the Veterans Day event</strong> at the stock exchange. Shulkin rang the closing bell standing near a preening and flexing Captain America, with Spider-Man waving from the trading pit, and Marvel swag was distributed to some of the attendees. “Generally the VA secretary or defense secretary don’t shill for companies,” the leader of a veterans advocacy group said. </p>
<p>…. Moskowitz and Sherman helped Perlmutter convene a council of health care executives on the day of the Trump-Perlmutter photograph, Dec. 28, 2016. … A new name surfaced in that meeting: David Shulkin, who’d led the VA’s health care division since 2015. Perlmutter then recommended Shulkin to Trump, according to a person familiar with his thinking. (Shulkin did not respond to requests for comment.) </p>
<p>…..Perlmutter also facilitated a series of conference calls with senior executives from Apple. VA officials were excited about working with the company, but it wasn’t immediately obvious what they had to collaborate on.</p>
<p><strong>As it turned out, Moskowitz wanted Apple and the VA to develop an app for veterans to find nearby medical services. Who did he bring in to advise them on the project? His son, Aaron, who had built a similar app.</strong> The proposal made Apple and VA officials uncomfortable, according to two people familiar with the matter, but Moskowitz’s clout kept it alive for months. The VA finally killed the project because Moskowitz was the only one who supported it.</p>
<p>...Moskowitz had more success pushing a different pet cause. He has spent years trying to start a national registry for medical devices, allowing patients to be notified of product recalls. <strong>Moskowitz set up the Biomedical Research and Education Foundation to encourage medical institutions to keep track of devices for their patients to address what he views as a dangerous hole in oversight across the medical profession. At one point, the foundation built a registry to collect data from doctors and patients. Moskowitz chaired the board, and Perlmutter’s wife was also a member. Moskowitz’s son earned $60,000 a year as the executive director, according to tax disclosures.</strong> </p>

<p>Some of the things they were asking of Apple :</p>

<p>We will need their assistance to have a patient centric program for preventive medicine that can also tract progress </p>

<p>And </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a technology solution for tracking medication compliance, prevention of over utilization of controlled substances and prevention of medication errors. </p>

<p>A lot of tracking .. where exactly is all that data going?</p>

            Here's a thought, it occurred to me as I was reading about JP Morgan having life insurance policies on their current and former employees.

            Given the corruption of the elite cabal, monetizing everything conceivable and then some.  Working towards a one world scenario where there is a guaranteed base income to everyone, free this, free that, free happiness, etc.  But sustainable. What if Globalist bankers are working on calculating how to value each and every person under a financial plan which includes the banks taking out life insurance on every mouth breather! (so they can get that investment back!)  It would be as if they are loaning your life to you  0_o

             Perelman has owned several yachts, C2 is his latest....C2 stands for Claudia Cohen, Perelman’s ex- wife who died of cancer...The yacht is often visited by celebs including Kendal Jenner..... His neighbor in the Hamptons (NY) is Steven Spielberg.

             The Island is a playground for the very rich or well known celebrities who descend there for big events like New Year's Eve parties on luxery yachts. Ronald Perelman was a regular.

             He's also associated with the Robin Hood Foundation, so Epstein ties there and with Glenn Dubin

              The earliest reference that we were able to find of a connection between Bill Clinton and Epstein was in 1995, when the president was running for reelection. Epstein reportedly attended a fundraising dinner for Clinton in Palm Beach, Florida, with about a dozen other people hosted by wealthy businessman Ronald Perelman.
