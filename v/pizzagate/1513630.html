<p>The Dutch elite has had a pedophile problem for very long. I think earlier on they didn\'t always kill the children. So, many eyewitness accounts and victims have come forward over the years. </p>

<p>there are more examples of eyewitness testimony, like Anne Marie van Blijenburgh </p>

<p>And then there are the multiple witnesses is the infamous Dutroux case</p>

<p>And in the Demmink case</p>
<p><a href="https://isgp-studies.com/joris-demmink-and-prince-bernhard-s-alleged-westerflier-cult">https://isgp-studies.com/joris-demmink-and-prince-bernhard-s-alleged-westerflier-cult</a></p>
<p>The allegations made by multiple people are never addressed. Our media pays no attention and the state prosecutor just acts like these people are insane and completely ignores them. 
There is no separation of power left in this country. The judiciary has been fully absorbed by the legislative and administrative branches. </p>
<p>EDIT: A politician is being prosecuted by the DOJ and found guilty of incitement by judges. Geert Wilders, the politician in question is implicated in some of the allegations made, but it sets the stage and a legal precedent for future hate speech cases.</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems everyone in the country thinks it\'s normal that there are people publicly accusing our royalty and former prime ministers of these crimes, and that these accusations have never been formally denied. Much like is happening now in America, we have been in that perpetual state, where nobody \'official\' or \'on tv\'  ever addresses this issue. </p>
<p>But don’t be discouraged by this, because America is not Europe. Remember that there live more people in the NY metropolitan area than the Netherlands. For that reason, among others, our establishment is much more entrenched. The elite is socially very immobile, as there is only a small linguistic space for them to operate.</p>
<p>As you may well know, university frats are where the initiations into the occult begin.
We got a handful of old, established universities supplying their people to virtually every key position in government and a large majority of all business boards. </p>
<p>There is no free market, as government spending stands at 44.9% of GDP and very extensive regulation form huge barriers to start-ups and entrepreneurship. Many details of public life are controlled and regulated too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dutch academia is thinking up rational explanation for the allegations.</p>

<p>On top of that, we have our vast and ancient nobility. Did you know that if our dynastic King wouldn\'t sign a law passed by parliament, we would be in a constitutional crisis? </p>
<p>By the way, did you know the constitutional head of State in Canada is the same as in Australia? They never had their 1776.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, American friends, is the reason you are the last hope for the future of liberty worldwide. You are the first and only country in history founded on the principles of human liberty. 
Nowhere in the world, social and economic mobility were ever higher than in your great land. The dark occult, festering within the elite of your country, might still be weak enough to conquer.</p>',

            It is so sad what has happened to America - it is now seen around the world as the most evil nation on Earth, one that wears a mask to dupe its own citizens and a few others in the Western world. But you're right, it started as something so much better, and these evil fucks have infected it.

            The woman Anne-Marie talks about places in the Netherlands and in Belgium where they bury the bodies of the children. Could some investigator find out where those places are, and go there to look, and film what they discover? Perhaps even a big team of investigators. I feel like we citizens need to start setting up independent organisations like the police etc, to do actual investigation. Just like we have an alternative media.

           <p>
            They gave the naive American population a large part of the material spoils. They did not do this because of kindness, but because the world would have a reason to hate Americans for their unwitting complicity in their crimes.

            They've awoken a sleeping giant. Through their sheer arrogance,  they pushed people to their breaking points and it's causing massive amounts of people to wake up.  It's scary how close they were to accomplishing their goal of a new world order. Believe me friend, once we get our shit together and drain the swamp, the next step is to liberate Europe.

             Countries like the UK and Greece were instrumental in bringing about parliaments and democracy and establishing laws etc, and they too have just been quickly usurped by these awful evil people, who have managed to turn democracy and freedom into weapons to be used against the people. It's even worse than an outright dictatorship, because people believe they are free to an extent, or they believe in the benevolence of their rulers and than nay restrictions are necessary and for their own safety, or paradoxically for the protection of their freedom. At least if you are ruled by an evil dictator, you know the score. You know not to trust the media, you know your fellow citizens all know the score - it's easier to find a way to fight back. But this is so much more difficult and so much more entrenched into the whole of society.

            Welcome brother from the Netherlands, i heard Prince Bernhard, (who founded bilderberg) is a nasty character is heavily involved. Queen B most likely as well. You are not alone, this is a global fight and we will win. Take care from USA.

            The ideals embodied in the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence are the most noble of any political document on earth, IMO. Our elites have never fully lived up to them - but we can try.

            I totally agree thank you for posting this: they are very threatened by democracy and the second amendment and freedom of speech. This is last bastion here in America! History has been repeating itself and we are watching it unfold.

            Beautiful words. Thanks to the Internet, we can and must bring our minds together. Americans have some leverage—in the form of a well regulated militia—but we still need provisions and support from our brothers and sisters around the world. They can't enslave the entire planet without a noble and vicious fight for our freedom to live. Let's put these vampires back into their graves—permanently.

            The Founding Fathers laid down great principles which no European state could ever match, not even France. Sure, they were betrayed early on, but I have faith in the American people.

            Thank you so much for your insights on this horrid issue. Thank you for pointing out to us Americans how precious our country is, as we who were born here take this all for all granted, especially the younger generations. While we do not have the monarchies that Europe has, we have the oligarchies which are firmly entrenched now, witness the Bush/Clinton dynastic change they just tried to pull. (I would be where you are now, if my distant ancestor hadn't killed a guy in a tavern back in the 1600s and had to flee the country!) Thank you again for your comment, it has touched me deeply.

            Prior to the current era, victims didn't have a mouthpiece or outlet. While social media has allowed unprecedented opportunities for pedos to network and coordinate, it has also allowed victims to have a voice and citizen investigators a way to dig into their stories.

            I do think murder is the name of the game now though. No witnesses. Blood, organs, snuff. Whatever. They'd abuse the victims' individual atoms if they could.

             They probably learned with the Dutroux case and the Catholic church abuses not to leave witnesses.

            You are so right.  America was truly a place where people came together like no where on earth through the constitution and the values that were upheld and now it's it's decaying into the worst degradation of those values.

             I'm not trying to be a debby downer, but the people who founded our country were part of a long lineage of child rapists dating back to Egypt.

             On a bright note, the people of America are the strongest in the world. We will overthrow our masters and put bullets through their heads.

             It's time to buy an assault rifle and glock. That's coming from a lifelong liberal who even voted for Hillary.

              Yes, it does and that's what we need to understand, even just a little.   I've blown it already with a brother and friend.
America was the greatest country at one time, now it seems to be no better than a third world country, except for the good people who won't back down.  I really do think this is our last chance to fight.
