<blockquote>
<p>Prison guards assigned to monitor Jeffrey Epstein on the night he apparently killed himself fell asleep and failed to check on him for three hours before falsifying records to cover up their neglect, according to officials.</p>
<p>The two guards have been placed on leave and the warden of New York City’s Metropolitan Correctional Centre (MCC) has been reassigned as federal authorities investigate the financier’s death, the Justice Department has announced.</p>
<p>It comes amid mounting evidence of failures at the chronically understaffed prison which allowed the 66-year-old to take his own life as he awaited trial on charges of sexually abusing teenage girls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Epstein, who had attempted to take his own life in July, was taken off a suicide watch last month for reasons that have not been explained and should have been checked on by a guard every 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Investigators have learned those checks were not done for three hours before he was found hanged at 6.30am on Saturday, according to a person familiar with the case.</p>

            None of you know the inside of a prison. Whether falsified, staged, or real; people who commit sex crimes do not last long.
           </p>
           <p>
            The indoctrination within the prison system is as isolated and separated as the indoctrination we receive on the outside. Limited TV, almost all Fake News constantly, and sports. Guards do half the time an inmate does, and are as institutionalized as a long-term inmate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their codes are strict, too.

              The lawsuit still isn't settled,

              Seems odd after all these years, it hasnt even gone to court yet
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe some of the girls have backers?
             </p>
             <p>
              Epstein does move a lot of money around, how does he really earn it?

            I believe all his co-conspirators are shaking in their boots &amp; pissing themselves..
           </p>
           <p>
            I learned this..
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein is death is guna make it much more difficult for the co-conspirators that Epstein had info on because of something called "standing" -
           </p>
           <p>
            No one else will have "standing" to challenge the search warrant on his house or any of his properties.
           </p>
           <p>
            EVERYTHING obtained will be admissible against any other defendant without the possibility of a motion to suppress 😁👍
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparantly everyone was lawyering up to try &amp; block these search warrants, that all just went bye-bye after Epsteins death.

            This is beginning to sound like Welch's trip to CPP.  What are the odd of more than 1 guard falling asleep at the same time.....unless they were slipped something in their drink.  Three hours is enough to get you to Gilligan's Island.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfSLuEj99d0

              This thing doesn't end with Epstein, but the (((figures))) highest up in the food chain
              <em>

              Other ZOG personnel (probably in similar situations to Epstein, potentially on the verge of getting caught) are watching all this closely. They must keep silent or the whole thing comes apart.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Epstein was truly killed, then the others would have no reason to remain silent; they'd speak out. So they needed a big flashy show to demonstrate that if they keep quiet, they'll be taken care off. Epstein's "death" and subsequent escape shows them that they'll be okay no matter how dire things get.

            It’s a narrative the media are pushing right now, as if he died because of these two guards not paying attention. If one believes this story then one has to believe he hung himself as well. No way, at least in my opinion.

              <p>
               First they said the guards were called away, now they’re saying that they fell asleep.
              </p>
              <p>
               They’re also saying that those guards falsified the records.
              </p>
              <p>
               Something else that I don’t believe has an official source yet is that Epstein had paper blanket and clothes, which aren’t strong enough to hang a person with.
              </p>
              <p>
               The coroner has also come out and said that they can’t make the determination that his death was a suicide. Why would they say that if the cause of death was hanging? They could have meant that they can’t prove that he himself was the executioner, but the way they worded it was... suspect.

                They won't make a determination on cause/manner until all of the labs are in.  And a pathologist does a autopsy protocol but essentially the coronor documents the cause and manner

                I believe this "death" is a white hat move. Epstein and his backers were ready to prolong the case to memory-hole it when some false flags happen. We have these shootings recently, the massive info dump a day prior to Epstein's suicide, and right now it seems ALL the right people are sweating.
