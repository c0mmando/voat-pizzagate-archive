            Fancy that, elitism during an investigation into the so-called elite...
The quoted comment, while not inaccurate, serves no purpose and offers nothing of value. Least of all, for those who it deems to be in need of a catch up on the broader scope of things beyond CPP.

            That'd be the other problem, you(or whoever posted the comment) seem to be of the opinion that nobody else here sees far beyond the CPP element, which is just woefully egotistic and ignorant.

            Being a jaded cunt is pointless, seriously, we all had to start somewhere right? Do you not remember a time when you were oblivious to this shit?
