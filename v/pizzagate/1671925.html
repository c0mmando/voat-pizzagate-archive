            The "Dont eat me" neurofluxation caught was even bigger IMO. That ties into a lot of things in itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now where the hell did this video come from? If the voice was not dead on JP, and the lights didnt look the same as CPP, I wouldnt have even taken the time to do anything with it. I have not heard anywhere what the original source of this is. Thats irritating the crap out of me. Seems if someone hacked their server they would be bragging somewhere about it, or we would at least know where the file originated 100%.

            I dont have enough points on the site this is posted to since I am a lurker, so I had a buddy of mine upload this for me after I cleaned up some of the noise and drop boxed it to him. I also took what people were saying was not the name John being spoken. I slowed it about 15%, cleared the noise, and repeated if a few times at the end of the audio clip.
           </p>
           <p>
            I kept trying to put this on YouTube and it would not post. I used Nero Wave Editor to clear it up from the original video. I'm NOT an audiophile, so I am sure someone could have done a better job than me. I am an IT guy for a long time though, so its not half assed either.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can confidently say that he is NOT saying John Pode- though. Once the audio was isolated and I looped it repeatedly I could not hear it at all. I honestly do not even remember what point it was said now. I left NO VIDEO, audio only so no distractions. It is very clear, I would suggest if you really want to pick at it to use noise canceling headphones.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there is something you think I could have done better, let me know. Especially if you are a Nero WaveEditor user. I have version 10 myself, so I am a few versions back, but they do the same thing. I know how to use all the tools, I am just not 100% sure if after removing the noise, distortion, and slowing that last bit a hair for clarity, if anything else would have made it even clearer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since #CNNLEAKS dropped, I am sure I will be pulling out wave editor a lot more, so tips would truly be appreciated.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say enjoy, but I dont think anyone likes hearing this shit. Sound like John to me though. If I sent it to anyone I know I couldnt imagine they wouldnt say the kid is saying John. Its clear as day repeatedly. The lights in the video also match the stage as everyone already know, and its spot on for accent and everything else on John's Voice.

            it sounds like the kid says Skippy to me and also that the kid might have an English accent its just awful. He might even say don't eat me ugh this just makes even worse....

             You are correct. Holy shit. I missed that. Slowed down and cleared up a bit so you can hear it. Repeated it to so you dont need to keep clicking play. Did my best to remove other noises. That IS a British accent. You nailed it. I posted this in a reply to you since YOU caught that, also putting it in another post.
