<p>I thought the last few David Seaman video\'s have been alarming.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGQlB8svnp0">Look at this video.</a>  He says &quot;John Podesta <em>is</em> a pedophile&quot; multiple times throughout it in a non-nonchalant,  matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>As evidence for this he says: &quot;John Podesta uses known pedophile code language&quot; and &quot;he\'s using the phrases pizza and hot dogs to describe something inedible&quot; and &quot;he uses the phrase pizza over and over again&quot;.  These statements are <strong>blatantly untrue</strong>.  I would seriously question his investigatory skills and journalistic integrity if these are the kinds of things he is saying.</p>
<p>You can look for yourself:  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=pizza&amp;mfrom=john.podesta%40gmail.com&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=2#searchresult">This is the wikileaks search for the term &quot;pizza&quot; filtered by sender for John Podesta.</a></p>
<p>There are only 10 emails there and if you go through them one by one you will see that a majority of the instances the word pizza occurs in the replied text (he didn\'t type it), one time he is using it in a proper name &quot;Comet Pizza&quot;, and only <strong>once</strong> in the decades worth of emails does he say &quot;pizza&quot; and that is when he is responding to someone else talking about pizza.</p>
<p>You can do the search yourself but he also <strong>never</strong> says hot dog(s).  
</p>
<p>This might seem like a small point but I just want everyone to think about where your information is coming from.  The accusations being made are serious and when you back it up with statements that are completely false you should pay a price for that.</p>
<p><strong>Is pizza talked about often in the emails?</strong></p>
<p>A second point I want to question is whether the term pizza is used in the email often <em>at all</em>. I wanted to see if there were many conversations involving pizza going on so I did a search for pizza that excludes the terms &quot;h4a&quot;, &quot;big campaign&quot;, and &quot;news clips&quot; since those things are simply summaries of news events with the campaigns and budget lists.  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=pizza&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=h4a%2C+big+campaign%2C+news+clips&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=2&amp;page=1&amp;#searchresult">Here\'s that search.</a>  
</p>
<p>You have to decide for yourself but considering that these are emails spanning 8 years and that many of the emails are continuations of one conversation (re: and fwd:) I would say that it isn\'t unusual and you could say with certainty that they <em>at least</em> aren\'t coordinating a ring through the emails.</p>',

            I found literally hundreds of results of pizza in the podesta emails. I didn't think any of them made sense taken literally, only used the search term  pizza, and than as i learned more about the code language, i looked for others like "domino", "walnut" "sauce" "cheese". Can you explain your searches to me, because i don't even understand them?

             Most of them look pretty innocuous, actually. These people live for their dinner parties. It's also quite clear the Podesta's have an interest in food and cooking that is not just centered around codewords.

             The podesta emails include anything that was in his inbox. So when you search for "pizza" you will find anything that was sent to him either directly or indirectly (apart of an email group).  To see if John Podesta is "using the phrase pizza over and over" and "he's using the phrases pizza and hot dogs to describe something inedible" I did a search for "pizza" and then if you go to advanced search you can filter the search by sender.  If john podesta wrote out pizza and sent it the email would be in that list.  But also if someone he's replying to mentioned "pizza" it would also be in that list.

             Those words are not "known pedophile code words", there's actually no evidence for that.

              man I really tried to take you seriously. But you can even find these entries in urban dictionary. A well known site for slang. on top of that, they have date submissions so you can see they were added years ago. 4chan is also a very fucked up place, and i guarantee you an unhealthy number of people will know these words too. Have you read the fbi anon thread yet? A path i can suggest for evidence, is researching into that triangle symbol found here

              </a>
              and you will find it in very strange music videos and other mediums that will then also reference symbols like pizza. I also did the advance search on john podesta to only showing pizza emails he sent. 50 is still a pretty high number, and I will look into these emails again further.

               If you all want to say you think that the podesta emails are using the words in the way defined by urban dictionary that's fine.    Here's a comment I wrote about it:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                My criterion for believing that a coded language exists is more strict than an entry from urbandictionary that sounds like a joke and doesn't even mention pedophilia. Urbandictionary is not meant to be used this way. Most of the entries are jokes. Just scrolling down the past few top entries shows entries like rectoral college and doctorbating that are heavily upvoted not because they are actual words in use but because they are funny. This is not a serious site, it can't and shouldn't be used this way.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               And
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Show me Dominoes = Domination, Cheese=girl. If those words do appear in urbandictionary (which I can't find them or any of the others) talking about something relating to sex you still can not say "code words" or that they are related to pedophilia. There is no proof for them full stop. They need to be removed in my opinion.

               You must have accidentally filtered it by "sent to" you need to do it by "sent from".  There will only be 10 in that list and if you go through those he will only use the word "pizza" once.

            The point is well made to benefit Seaman and all investigators.  Definitive statements without definitive proof expose those making (and repeating) them to potentially horrendous liability for libel/slander.  They are also dangerous for the investigation as a whole because they can be seen as evidence of "fakery" and malice.  To be taken seriously and to avoid those dangers, opinion, supposition and guesswork should always be clearly identified as such, and the apparently reasonable bases for them should be cited at the same time so that readers can make their own judgments.
