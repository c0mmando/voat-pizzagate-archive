<blockquote>
<p>Ronald Bernard, the elite Dutch banker who was forced out after being asked to murder a child to get into the really big deals, gives more testimony at the International Tribunal for Natural Justice about his childhood and youth that led him down an abusive, dark path. Gives a lot of insight about others who are still on that path.</p>

<p>This testimony of Ronald Bernard gives you inside information about his life, how the world works, your inner child, the \'program\' and the effects on damaged children. This testimony will raise the awareness in general. Original source: <a href="https://commission.itnj.org">https://commission.itnj.org</a></p>
<p>Ronald gave this testimony in the Westminster seatings of London for the International Tribunal for Natural Justice (ITNJ) Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking &amp; Child Sex Abuse. Please sign the ITNJ Treaty: <a href="https://www.itnj.org/itnj/itnj-treaty">https://www.itnj.org/itnj/itnj-treaty</a></p>
<p>Comment of Mark Pearce about the testimony:</p>
<p>I found this to be one of the most moving talks I\'ve witnessed about the understandings of the human mind and spirit. Ronald has been on both sides of the fence as a perpetrator and victim. He talks of the inter-generational traumas of abuse and why this led him to become an elite international banker and how this gate opened him up to be locked-up (metaphorically) in a cell - a story about freedom, restraint, slavery and slavery perceived as freedom.</p>
<p>Ronald’s story is worthy of feature-length documentation. He shares some of the deepest insights into the human condition and how a system of today\'s society can both ruin a mind and also lead one to redemption. Thank you Ronald for your honesty, bravery, consciousness, inspiration and love. I hope by sharing this testimony with the world we can all learn more about forgiveness and how to heal. Filmed at Westminster, London - April 2018.</p>

            Ok, I have a problem with this now. Can somebody confirm that it is Robert David Steele sitting next to Kristy Allen at the 40:43 markin the video I posted below? Hope I am wrong because Steele is a spook, delivers obvious disinfo and doesn't want anybody arrested. If he is a part of this, then I would have to question if these testimonies have lies mixed in with the truth. Kristy told a wild story about her possibly having been used to fly planes and move drugs in the Vietnam war, without any memory of it. Not saying it is not true or can't happen, but it's out there even for me. Anyhow, RDS would be a red flag. Is that him?

             That sucks, but we know for certain that the whistleblower is the real deal. He spoke where he invited, I don't blame him. I can't imagine someone checking into every guest/panel and determining whether they want to tell ther story based on the history of each onlooker. I'm glad he decided to tell his story here, and anywhere for that matter. I want MORE of this guy. (And fuck RDS)

            Kristy Allen was even more compelling IMO. She brings up MK-ultra, Adrenochrome, live organ harvesting etc. She is an SRA survivor and father was in CIA.

               There are mixed opinions about Robert David Steele AND Bernard. That fact is also a likely explanation for downvotes.

               Nobody is really here to get votes though, right? If you get a bunch for something that is more or less reasonable... take it as a sign that your onto something or you hit a nerve.... or just a sign of the battle that we’re in.

                No, I was only hoping to glean some understanding about why this post would be viewed negatively by some people. It is news to me that people question Bernard, let alone to the degree we question mr "ex" CIA-turned-truther (always with his hand out for a donation). It seems as silly to me to distrust Bernard as it is to trust RDS.

                <p>
                 Well... Like I said, I personally accept Mr. Bernard. His interviews strike me as authentic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think the issue that some critics have goes to the basic cognitive dissonance associated with exposing this evil. Like voting for an old time politician... they have to imagine an idealized person. If a victim or whistleblower comes forward to tell us about these things, immediately a majority will reject the story, and if pressed, they will look at every aspect of that person’s life through a highly critical lense. Their associations and occupations become suspect.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For example, some people apply this rubric: “Mr. Bernard is still involved somehow in finance (I think this is true... not sure); ergo he is not credible.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Any reasonable person can separate his occupation from his testimony and see that they do not conflict. It’s just his job.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The problem stems from the nature of evil. When real evil is exposed to a person... it’s unacceptable. The mind can’t take it. We want to imagine a hero inside of each of us, capable of standing up and resisting the monstrous activities that have taken place in history, but the fact is that we all likely would fall into the categories of ‘collaborators’, ‘deniers’ or even ‘willful participants’.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We are fortunate to live in the bubble of protected society, where the madness of evil is only on the edges of our lives, hidden. We may choose to watch violence and evil as entertainment; knowing or believing it to be fake diversion. In ancient times, even up to the beginning of the modern era, this was not so. Ultra violence was a mandatory, state-sponsored community activity. On my honeymoon, I visited the pyramids of Cancun. At first, it was a lark.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But then the tour guide told us about the sacrifices. In anthropology classes, and personal research I leraned a reality. Have you ever seen that movie “Apokalypto”? It’s tame compared to the true story. Imagine what happens when crime scene investigators use luminal and their UV flashlight in a hotel room. Gross body fluid deposits can be seen everywhere. No imagine the Aztec pyramids. Every step, stone and stelae... covered with blood and guts... every day. For centuries. Imagine the culture that maintains that level of ultra violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When the tour guide took us to the cenote (a circular pond, more than a hundred feet deep), she told us about the bodies disposed of their, stacked up so high from the bottom, that the bottom was unreachable through the pile of bones under the water. Imagine commerce and daily routine in THAT culture. Realize that it wasn’t just Aztecs. Virtually every region worldwide echado a similar period in early history.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The lands around Israel are a prime example. People criticize the Bible, for its accounts of violent destruction of the cultures surrounding the early Israelite nation. The Bible only touches on the depravity of those cultures briefly. It’s the archaeologist’s lament. A prospective archaeologist can go to that area and excavate. It’s like a gruesome lottery, though. There is a chance of making a great historical find: maybe a fragment of an ancient scroll, or discoveryping a lost settlement, or a trophy from an ancient battle. But when they find an altar to Baal or Molech or Dagoth... it’s time to stop. If the find a sacred pole if Ashtoreth... it’s time to give up. Why? Because nobody wants to discover the gruesome second part: the pit of skeletal remains that accompanies that altar or sacred pole. There are uncounted sites all around the ancient Bible lads. The Israelites were surrounded by nations that practiced these evil religions, and the pits typically have the remains of thousands of chopped up and burned and smashed women, girls, children and infants.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It’s unthinkable. The mind can’t process it.in all of history, sane people have been introduced to these realities and faced them alone. Only a few moments in history allowed such ‘good’ people to band together and try to turn the tide. The most recent time before this arguably birthed western civiliazation. You and I are fortunate enough to be able to participate in a group of such individuals that support and strengthen each other, motivating each other to maintain our values and virtues and take a stand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In history, most people like us were cowed and ran away and turned a blind eye. That is happening now around us as well. That, in my opinion, is why people are eager to be discredit Bernard and the like. Victims like Fiona Barnett and others are treated so badly.... beyond skepticism, partly because they take a stand against an implacable enemy, but also because of the sanity-preserving cognitive dissonance that humans tend to blanket their minds with.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I believe this evil is in its last us. Right now there are more people than ever in history, ready to see the truth exposed and in a position to see it righteously ended once and for all. Expect resistance. The monsters won’t go quietly. Keep up the good work. Take pride on downvotes. It means you did your part.

                  I appreciate this thoughtful and time consuming reply! I also believe evil is in its last days. I had a "near death experience" and can actually guarantee this is true.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also visited Tikal and Tulum. At the time, I didn't know one thing about the sacrifices and have been horrified in hind sight by the fact that i SAT right where the heads were cut off. This was so long ago, there were no ropes keeping you from going anywhere you wanted. So long ago i don't even know if they had tour guides at Tulum. I am hearing this info about Tulum for the first time from you! Although I did later find out about Tikal. I climbed to the top of those pyramids and just hung out there. I remember it was strangely sloped, in that it was a little too sloped to get up easily or ever feel comfortable, you always felt like you were going to topple over the edge, and the steps getting up were very small. It was a very uncomfortable experience, it felt energetically "stuffy", now i realize it's probably haunted af.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I have been studying this fact of evil in the past few years. And also the power of cognitive dissonance - it's fascinating.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I grew up in Omaha during the Franklin case, and knew people involved. I later became a crack addict and ended up seeing a very good psychotherapist who determined that although my memories are blank, i was the victim of a pedophile father. I since pieced together that it started at age 6 months. and after many years, i realize my father didn't know he was doing evil. The same had been done to him, and I think pedophiles believe that the victims won't remember so it doesn't count.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My therapist also told me about a meeting she attended regarding the missing child crisis that was most evident at the time in our area. It was a meeting of law enforcement and FBI from all across the country. The FBI had gathered them to tell them they had discovered the reason - THE reason - for the skyrocketing rates of disappearing children. It was satanic sacrifices.

                 <p>
                  When you are given some knowledge that doesn't fit with anything, and you have no way to process it, sometimes you just have to tuck it away.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When the case came out about the brother &amp; sister in England who exposed their school's satanic cult, i studied it intensely, only to see that like Franklin case, our society had no trouble sweeping it all under the rug. This pained me deeply.

                  Finally when PIzzagate emerged, we had a massive group of people who were willing to discuss these matters, who somehow were overcoming cognitive dissonance and becoming brave. I immersed myself in this sub (2 other accounts that i've since burned), it was cathartic and educational. It was through pizzagate research that i've really learned about evil as it exists on earth today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Did you know even in Tibet, they sacrifice a baby to new monasteries, and bury it at the entrance? At least until recently, not sure if it has ended.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I am not saying i can wrap my head around all that i've learned, but my grasp of the subject has finally landed me in a good place: i KNOW that this is serious shit, and that getting as close as i can to Jesus all day, every day, is what i need to do now. That's where all this information leads.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Besides cognitive dissonance, one must consider that 'doubt' and negative feedback on this sub is mostly, if not all, social engineering by intel agencies who are here to made sure we don't come too close to their operation. I studied how to spot these types, and

                     Hang in there. You’re a survivor for a reason. God wants everyone to survive, and it’s sure that he has the power to restore and heal and revive all who have suffered in this evil system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I’m convinced that He’s going to make some big changes soon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     One last thing about cognitive dissonance... I think it can be overcome, with patience. The evil that challenges this world is too big for us to handle without being prepared and adjusted. It’s like an ant trying to understand a human. We are to big for them to even see us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If the true evil were revealed, it would blow people’s minds. The dissonance is a protection. Blissful ignorance... it took me a few years to remember what happened to me, to deal with it and I’m only just now going forward in a healthy way, thanks to God. I wasn’t seriously traumatized, but I had a few strange events and encounters growing up that I repressed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now looking back... it Took a long to process. Real evil is like that; especially when we’re are talking about evil on a scale that affects the whole world... like in WW 2. People and governments were content to ignore Hitler and Stalin. It didn’t affect most people, so they didn’t care. It wasn’t real until Pearl Harbor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Right now, statistically, more people, percentage wise, are living well and in peace than ever in human histtory (this was true at least 4-5 years ago). True, the worst evil ever in human history is finally being exposed, but you can imagine now the scale and motivation behind the dissonance that we are up against.

                       Thanks, and you are to be commended as well, but I have to give credit to God. I’ve had to many second chances to stay asleep. This time around, I have too take notice of the being/force that has rescued me so many times and give Him the credit He’s due.
