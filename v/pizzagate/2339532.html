            That should FINISH HER CAREER!! No more loyal wife and mother she is now a demon looking out for her bottom line (as well as her murder inc boss I suspect) She should never work in DC again but sadly she will fit right in there and Hollywood as they will think not only is she down with the sickness but shes also like the honeymoon phase of the mafia when people are loyal, keep secrets and will take one for the team. You cant tell me that someone that would take dirty pictures for minors with their own child in tow or will leave said child with the deviant monster that would do so suddenly cares about the safety and privacy of anyone but themselves...I think they call those narcissists.

              Yes, there is something that most people don't know.  There was news on the internet about "El Chapo" having donaed $1M to the CF.  Immediately all of the articles were taken down.  Nothing anywhere.  Zip. Nada.  Now we heare that Penn visited him and that Emma and Huma  are "an item".  There is def more to this story that needs to come out.
