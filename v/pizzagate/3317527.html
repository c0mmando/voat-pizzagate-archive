<h1 id="md-german-priest-causes-church-walkout-as-preaches-for-predator-priest-forgiveness">German priest causes church walkout as preaches for predator priest forgiveness</h1>
<p>The cleric said he wanted to tell parishioners about the biblically important meaning of forgiveness. He regretted that predator priests were labelled &quot;criminals&quot; but many of his congregation walked out of the church.</p>
<p>Retired priest Ulrich Zurkuhlen caused consternation in the city of Münster, northwest Germany, when he dedicated his sermon to the concept of forgiving priests who had sexually abused minors.</p>
<p>Zurkuhlen\'s remarks come at a difficult time for the Roman Catholic Church, as it grapples with continued allegations, from various parts of the world, of priests\' predatory conduct and church attempts to cover it up.</p>
<p>In 2018, the German Bishops\' Conference published a report revealing that 1,670 priests, roughly 4.4% of clerics, had abused 3,677 people between 1946 and 2014 in Germany.</p>
<p>The controversial sermon took place in the Holy Spirit Church of Münster. The internet portal Kirche-und-Leben.de (Church and Life) reported that parishioners were incensed, with some 70 members of the congregation walking out in protest.</p>
<p>Several parishioners reportedly interrupted the 79-year-old Zurkuhlen and tried to argue with him. A worshipper told Kirche-und-Leben that the situation became chaotic and the priest was not able to finish the sermon.</p>
<h2 id="md-a-real-shock">\'A real shock\'</h2>
<p>In an interview with Kirche-und-Leben.de, Zurkuhlen griped about the fact that even bishops refer to predator priests as &quot;criminals,&quot; despite the fact that these men were also good clerics in their communities.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is just profoundly evil,&quot; the priest said. &quot;Goodness and guilt are often combined with each other or stand side by side without touching,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Zurkuhlen insisted that it was &quot;time for the church hierarchy to say a word of forgiveness after a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked about the reaction his sermon caused among worshippers, Zurkuhlen said that it was &quot;a real shock.&quot; He lamented that he was unable to get his point across, especially the biblically important meaning of forgiveness, to what he called &quot;the screaming mob.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="md-backlash">Backlash</h2>
<p>A spokesman for the diocese of Muenster told DPA that the organization believed the focus should be on &quot;the victims and not the perpetrators,&quot; when it comes to the delicate matter of sexual abuse cases.</p>
<p>Stefan Rau, a fellow priest of the Holy Spirit Church, regretted Zurkuhlen\'s position.  &quot;I always try to give my colleagues in the pastoral team encouragement,&quot; he told Kirche-und-Leben.de.</p>
<p>&quot;But this was not possible this time,&quot; he conceded.</p>
<p>&quot;There has already been a conversation with the priest concerned and the entire pastoral team, and there will be another conversation,&quot; Rua said, ruling out disciplinary action against Zurkuhlen at this time.</p>
<p>But the incident did prompt the parish to invite worshippers to a conversation about the sermon, which will take place next Monday.</p>

<p>This priest doesn\'t know his theology. Mortal sin means that yes, <em>indeed</em>, grave sin most certainly <em>does</em> drive out all goodness. That is exactly what makes a sin &quot;deadly&quot;. It kills the divine life of the soul and sends the Holy Spirit packing. All goodness is from God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-18.htm">as Jesus said</a>, &quot;No one is Good but God alone&quot;) and evil cannot abide in the presence of God, it cannot tolerate the excruciating light of God\'s truth and beauty -- hence Hell, where those who choose sin take themselves to escape.</p>',

            If you believe Jesus is God, you should believe in forgiveness. If you don't want to forgive that's fine, but don't pretend you're Christian.

               You have no understanding. Christ is The Son of God. The prefect lamb prepared before the foundations of the Earth were set. He is The Word of God made manifest in the flesh. Then given the holy spirt when in this world to do His Work. He was tempted by The Devil.
              </p>
              <p>
               You actually think the devil would tempt God? Ha! 
You think Christ prayed to himself those many times?
              </p>
              <p>
               Read and pray for understanding.
There are not multiple interpretations of The Word. It was said plainly yet the flesh desires FANTASY instead of truth. Shame on those that ignore Christ's words.
