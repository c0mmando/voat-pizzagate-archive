Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

Given Spielberg’s ties to Geffen, Wexnar, and Bronfman Jr. he has a two link chain connection to Epstein at max. More direct connections are likely.</p>

Happy Days being a two link chain to Steven Spielberg (Spielberg -&gt; George Lucas’ American Graffiti -&gt; Garry Marshall’s Happy Days)</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/">https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/</a> This film is most likely where Reiner raped Corey Haim. Possibly Feldman and River Phoenix too. </p>

<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/8n72.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/8n72.jpg</a> Ask Rob Reiner what happened to Heather O’Rourke.</p>
<p>🚨 Is there any evidence that Rob Reiner is a member of the “Red Shoe Club”? He IS friends with a member of such group after all. 🚨</p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           David Geffen is a known buddy of Jeffery Epstein. Given Spielberg’s ties to Geffen, Wexnar, and Bronfman Jr. he has a two link chain connection to Epstein at max. More direct connections are likely.

           This film is most likely where Reiner raped Corey Haim. Possibly Feldman and River Phoenix too.

           Reiner was a chairman to a Jerry Brown fundraiser at SoHo. Its highly likely he’s an associate to Steven Spielberg.

           Ask Rob Reiner what happened to Heather O’Rourke.
          </p>

           🚨 Is there any evidence that Rob Reiner is a member of the “Red Shoe Club”? He IS friends with a member of such group after all. 🚨

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

             The film where it happened was Stand By Me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given the attempts to solve where it happened have turned up that he was raped at a specific age (14 IIRC), process of elimination places it at this movie. Reiner is by far the most likely culprit.

               Rob Reiner was the director for the film?
              </p>
              <p>
               The reason said film is suspected is because Haim was 14 when the incident happened. Going through the list of films he was working on, SBM is the most logical scene of the crime.

                  River Phoenix's death was suspicious. Nothing's come out about him being a Pedowood victim, but he did grow up in the Children of God cult. He has allegedly said he lost his virginity at a very very young age, like 4 or 5 (I can't remember the exact age.) He was a true talent.

            A child would be taken to the doctor for anal bleeding. Children do not usually have problems with the symptoms.......so it is suspicious.

             Love the yacht connections. Adnan ran into financial difficulties due to Iran Contra and BCCI. The Sultan of Brunei then bought Khashoggi’s  megayacht named after his daughter Nabila.  Donald Trump later  bought the yacht and renamed it the Trump Princess. After Trump ran into financial difficulties, the yacht was bought by Citigroup angel investor prince Alwaleed bin Talal and renamed after his holding company Kingdom, his favorite number 5, and the initials of his kids K and R thus Kingdom 5KR.  Dopey Alwaleed is the son of the former Saudi finance minister and likes to “play with daddy’s money” as Trump said.  According to Moussaoui, one thing Alwaleed liked to invest in was 9/11. He also likes to buy stock in Fox News, Apple, and Twitter. Small world these people live in.
