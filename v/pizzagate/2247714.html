            Since this stupid "Q" thing everyone has become silly. The property is part of the National Trust and is open to the general public (think of it as a museum / gallery). No Rothschild lives in the house or has for quite a long time. The Aircraft did not land in the property and the helicopter runs scenic flights and the small Cessna is owned by the local Airways Flying Club. Both came from the training Airfield only a few clicks away...

            My concern is that no one seems to fact check anymore. I see all these posts claiming things that could have been validated or invalidated easily with a little basic research. This Q thing is undermining peoples commonsense and I worry that it may lead to disappointment and embarrassment when the bubble bursts and lots of people may lose interest in the very real problem of pedophilia. Let's stay focused on track and research properly BEFORE posting comments.

            One of the first tenants of modern warfare is to bring a threat to your enemy's front doorstep.  Immediately after Pearl Harbor, several bombers limped along and were sacrificed for the purpose of immediately striking targets on Japanese soil.  The next step in modern warfare goes back to the William Tecumseh Sherman philosophy - erode your enemy's ability to wage war in any way that you can.  Next come's the Patton philosophy - attack aggressively, swiftly, and on as many fronts as possible.

             Nice post man. The biggest problem, like you mentioned, is getting the normies to understand that there is a war going on against them, their families, and their future children. The Rothschilds, and others of their "kind," want to make the entire world their sexual slave playground. And you may be right, we may be the last generation to be "awake" enough to do anything about it, because the younger generations are literally being raised from birth with a smartphone in their hands, being programmed right out of the womb with the Deep State's fake system of lies.

              My advice is to tread carefully when engaging people who are not on the same page.  People don't usually flip their worldviews and core opinions in an instant, the process takes time.  Attacking someone's core belief system(even if done as part of a friendly debate) will activate the same parts of a person's brain as when they are being physically attacked.  Read books, cite credible sources, and do not discredit yourself.  "They" have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar on numerous occasions.  Bringing up a vague, "anti-hierarchy", sort of philosophy can be useful.  Liberals do not like big business telling the public what to do.  Conservatives(in theory) do not like bureaucrats telling what the public to do.  Everyone agrees that there should be no kings, so from that standpoint you can start to introduce verifiable facts to suggest that there is something amiss with the way that reality is being portrayed on their TVs.

               A big obstacle I have to get over is the fact that I adapt easily to this information, while others do not. I have always been a person who didn't believe the things he was told about "how things work," and it's sometimes hard for me to remind myself that not everyone thinks that way, and that people like myself are in a tiny, tiny minority. It's why I find myself cursing so much and getting so frustrated at how stupid people seem to me. Like when Katy Perry put out that "Bon Apetit" video, and I was trying to explain to my friends about the similarities between Marina Abramovic, Spirit Cooking, and Witchcraft, and no matter how legit I tried to make it sound, no matter how many sources I cited or videos I showed, many of my friends just completely shut down, and I noticed that they actually started smiling and laughing at the things I was saying. That's where we're at. The masses are so clueless to the existence and prevalence of Witchcraft that they snicker and laugh at the mention of it. It pisses me off knowing just how well the elites have people under their thumb.

                Forgive them, for they know not what they do.  Ignorance is not the same thing as stupidity.  Had I not had certain experiences in my lifetime, a conversation that went straight from political discourse to Witchcraft/the occult would sound crazy to me too.  People expect others to be somewhat logical and to think in a somewhat similar manner to how they think.  The Witchcraft and Occult overtones that are employed serve a dual purpose IMO: 
1. They legitimize their activities in the minds of the adherents.  People don't want to believe that they are being manipulated and used as pawns by control freaks, but fusing their activities to "Satan" or some other higher power causes people to shut down the logic and critical thinking portions of their brains.  Through drugs, psychotronics, terror tactics, and conditioning, the adherents get to a point to where they merely shrug their shoulders and say to themselves, "Things are the way that they are because of the Devil."  They don't stop to think deeply about how they may very well just be low-level players in a fabric of totalitarian soft oppression, woven by highly educated control freaks.
2. Plausible deniability.  A lot of the occult breadcrumbs and hints dropped in the media are just that - vague hints that don't make sense to most people.  By "moneyballing" the process and stratifying the population into estranged subsets, they can cause different messages to have completely different meanings to different people.  By associating certain types of information with figures such as Alex Jones(who goes out of his way to appear non-credible to the average viewer), they can effectively hide certain things that may make sense to a small portion of the population, but make no sense to the ignorant, in plain sight.  Have you noticed that a lot of "conspiracy-minded" sources have a conspiratorial theme in and unto themselves?  The Corbett Report, InfoWars, George Webb, Voat, 4Chan, the Paul family, and many others play a game of confirm and extend by intertwining conspiracy information with certain political ideals(Trump love, nationalism, bigotry, "do-what-thou-wilt environmental/economic policy, etc.).  Jimmy Dore and Abby Martin are some of the exceptions to this rule, but they usually don't dive all that deeply into the rabbit hole.  They don't seem to care as much about any of the wars that they start as much as they do about social engineering and propaganda.
About all that we can do is to feed our brains, keep a cool head on our shoulders, and try to fight the good fight however we can.  Be tactful with it.  People who may not agree with your worldview have consumed an entirely different set of data than you have.  Our brains are not unlike computers, faulty programming = faulty output.

                 Very good post. Very thoughtful. Thanks for your input sir. I often wonder what it must be like to be someone who is completely asleep. I've always been a curious person who asked "but why" too often, and I've just naturally questioned everything. Got me in a lot of trouble in school, and with my family, too. But I know that accepting what you're told is the norm, and most people are told that the world works one way, and that's it, Cut and dry. The concept of a whole different sub-system, operating parallel to the system we call "the government" existing, that's hard enough to believe on its own, but when you throw in the "oh by the way, these people are part of ancient religious sects that seek to worship and gain powers from demons," then you're getting into territory where people think you're literally insane and a danger to others.

            Possible faked death? If so I doubt it would fool Trump or the people in the know. At worst we have forced the top to run scared. At best we got rid of major players. Though I would like them to see trial so the public can truly be redpilled.

            Was the pilot's body actually found? Or was it ASSUMED the piolt is dead?
           </p>
           <p>
            If no for that first part, then I have a theory that solves the event.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Theory: That plane was unmanned, and it was an assassination. The assassination was a warning shot to the rest of the Rosthchild family.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Exhibit A: Shortly before that crash, Q sent a coded threat to LdR saying basically "we know where you and your family are at all times and can strike at any moment".
