<p>hope you are well. 
i copied you in on a little email i sent to III.
he got screwed over. with: . just like and countless others... the pictures will help.
you will see that they have a group of sexual predators,
deviants ruftil rampant over there.
no, they are not jamming guys in the ass persay, but they are shay/C.1; judgenment.
i think guys in this business are pretty much some of the best and some of (kw worst.
it is the companies responsibility to protect the good from the bad until they show ugly heads and can be removed. in this case the ugly ones are running
the damn thing or in case of joe or donna are too clueless to recognize the truth or has
no power to change it. in the event M fails to inform you.

i know this entire thing is going to make life less bearable over there for all of us.

AGNA been blind to all this and those good people are getting worn out and

            reading the pdf of the e-mail it looks like common pervert activity in remote zones occupied by bored military personnel. 
A  lot of US military units have sex-party 'initiations' over certain promotions etc.  so this may be weird but not so weird in the military.
I am sure mercenaries and contractors do what they want in lawless zones. That work would attract sadists and perverts or both.

             Thank you. I believe that's it! The date and "vodka" correspond. Civilian security contractors.

            If you look at the attachement, it looks like the original document was written normally and then some kind of automatic text reader created the document with all the words jammed together, might be able to get a better translation by deciphering the pdf manually

            It seems that the sender didn't want this email to come up on any keyword searches (and I can see why, sender seems to be one of the good guys).

            I would just like to know who the sender and recipient are!

             I didn't think of that. I wonder if this could be connected to the Secret Service, who were caught with prostitutes? That is only a guess. I don't know the date that the scandal occurred, only when it was later reported. It sounds like the recipient does not know about whatever this incident is.
