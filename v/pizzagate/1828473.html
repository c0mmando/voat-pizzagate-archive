            Looks like Webb is engaging in a smoke screen campaign, re-visiting old cases that have re-appeared in the PG investigation, in an attempt to direct the narratives around them. When are people going to stop believing there is such a thing as 'Ex CIA' ?

             There might be a more sinister motive. A poster called Joanna made an interesting comment on

             "Robert Zimmerman and Bob K I agree with you, you brought up some very good points, George Webb needs to answer our questions and not ignore them or dismiss them, or give us cryptic answers or just make joke of them and call people conspiracy theorists.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to the red flags you have listed, I noticed that George Webb keeps bringing up False Flags and hoaxes and treats them as if they were real or like they happened according to what we hear in the main stream media, like the Omar Mateen from the Orlando shooting hoax, Tsarnaev Brothers from the Boston Bombing hoax, the Facebook shooter Steve Stevens hoax or the 9/11 false flag?
            </p>
            <p>
             Lately George focuses on connecting Muslims to all kinds of crimes and events without providing a convincing argument for why he is doing it and what the link is between those crimes and Muslims like the Awan Brothers and others.
            </p>
            <p>
             He seems to just jump from place to place and from one investigation to another, without any conclusion or closure, like for example he connected Awan Brothers to Eric Breverman, to the murder of Seth Rich, to Seal Team 7, to a murder of the two teenage girls, and to other crimes, it is hard to keep track and to follow his reasoning and to understand why he is doing what he is doing or why he is going where he is going and knocking on people’s doors.  Also, I don’t understand why he is publishing peoples social security numbers and addresses, it doesn‘t seem right.
            </p>
            <p>
             He seems to have switched from investigating the deep state and elites criminals to investigating various Muslims and connecting them to all kind of crimes.  One of the red flags that bothered me was when George Webb started taking about 9/11 mosques and radical Islamic terrorists connected to 9/11 – it is obviously pointing us in the wrong direction and misinformation, pointing us in the direction of people who were falsely blamed for 9/11 away from the real criminals who are behind 9/11 like CIA/Mossad/deep state/traitors in our government.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few weeks ago, Ole Dammegard, a well-known False Flag researcher said in one of his interviews that the next False Flag will be blamed on a truther, on someone who found out things on the internet and it inspired him to commit a crime.  It will be used to shut down large portions of the internet and to censor the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that there was recently a hoax Facebook shooter, that may be used to censor the internet, and that the Rolling Stones magazine has a hit peace on George and some other internet vigilantes concerns me, it may be a part of an elaborated psy-op used to censor the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the globalists own and control all the main stream media and use them to brain wash us, and that more and more people are getting their news from the still free Internet, makes the criminal elites very worried and they are looking for ways to censor the internet so that they could continue to censor the truth and manipulate us.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would not be surprised if Ole Dammagard was correct about his prediction and if George Web videos were part of the upcoming False Flag.  George Webb seems to be encouraging people indirectly to take law into their own hands, he even said lately “I had to publish the SS numbers since FBI is not investigating, I had no choice”, which may not end up well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember a few months ago, when a lot of people were investigating pizza gate, there was a hoax, a crisis actor went to Comet Pizza with a gun and did some shooting, which was staged and fake, but was used by the main stream media and authorities to increase censorship of the internet and pizza gate investigation.  I have a feeling that we could be dealing with a similar situation here, I hope I am wrong, but still, there is a lot of things about this investigation that don’t add up.

              This is exactly when I stopped watching his series.  After his 3rd consecutive day on the Awan Bros., I called him out on Youtube.  I told him members of the PG community were concerned that the focus of his investigation suddenly was on the usual suspects, ie. Muslims. He took the time the respond, but like you said,  he brushed it off.  Something to the effect of: ' I love these comments, if you think exposing corruption and bribery in Congress is targeting Muslims, then whatever. '  Well, he never followed up on how Congress was involved. Yeah, he's not to be trusted and I refuse to watch a disinformation program. Since then ( about day 87? ), it has really turned into a frantic shit show.

               I think his 15 minutes of Internet "fame" are almost over - his video views are dropping rapidly but his bots are attributing that to censorship. These same bots have started tweeting "rolling stone" who I bet have never even heard of him.

            Why in the world would we not mention George Webb. He was at the scene of two new murders yesterday of a 12. &amp; 13 year old who had been garratted (strangled with wire) to the point of losing their fingers during their death. He was also at the scene of an Muslim training camp (there are at least 22 in the US) where young undocumented refugees are being trained in combat skills such as garrating just a few miles away from the dead kids which is a finders case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again why would you not talk about him. Do you want to wait until all the bodies are found and there are more dead kids. He said again yesterday he is lifting the veil on the top of the RatLines involving CIA drug running and underneath is pizzagate/pedogate.

             Got independent confirmation of ANY of that?  As usual with Webb's "insider scoops," the answer is NO.

             He never mentions Israeli involvement or MOSSAD.  That's because he IS MOSSAD.

              For Mossad he curiously has taken on FBI on behalf of Muslim kids. He just put out another vid. on behalf of somali's being used for organ transplants in Minneapolis. Has mentioned Mossad multiple times. Exposed Epstein as Mossad/CIA.... Exposing everyone right now because it is in the US you fool. Stop fighting researchers and help... kids are missing &amp; dying left and right. Does not matter what religion or race, we have to help stop this.

            You know, whenever I'm off in my own world, trying to make sense of PG my mind often wonders back to this story and the lack of questioning and delving further into why his mother thought it necessary and relevant to mention the phone call of her husband the night before he disappeared. Like he knew and deep down she knew from what she heard, that he was going to be kidnapped that next morning. What was the fathers job again?

             The phone call you referred to to her husband in the middle of the night in her mind could not have been just a wrong number because hubby David was too quiet and too long with uhh ha.. tonight? Then tells her it's a wrong number. John David Gosch was a seed seller in agriculture who traveled across the heartland. David shurter says he was in a bar and Omaha that had a dungeon with children downstairs and Mr. Gosch was a frequent visitor. But Noreen only found that out approximately 2007 8 9?

             Another abduction that occurred during that time was the Jacob Wetterling case.  Lot's of holes in the official story and his mother went on to become head of the NCMEC.

               so yeah... I think these abductions were not just exploited but designed to create data bases for children and child porn like the NCMEC and ICMEC. Those secretive leviathans are infrastructure of child trafficking and pedo-blackmail. I know this more than I know my own name.  Patty Wetterling is a liar and was involved in Jacob's abduction.
