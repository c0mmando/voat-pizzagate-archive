<p>The former Intl Program Director of Intl Adoption Guides Inc. (IAG), an adoption agency, pleaded guilty today to conspiring with others to defraud the United States by submitting fraudulent documents to the State Department for adoptions from Ethiopia and paying bribes to foreign officials.</p>
<p>James Harding, 55, of Atlanta, Georgia, admitted as part of his guilty plea that, he and his co-conspirators submitted fraudulent documents to the State Department to facilitate adoptions of Ethiopian children by U.S. parents.  Harding admitted that, in support of U.S. visa applications for the Ethiopian children, he and others submitted false documentation, including contracts of adoption signed by orphanages that could not properly give the children up for adoption because, for example, the child in question was never cared for or never resided at the orphanage.</p>
<p>In entering his guilty plea, Harding also admitted that he and others paid bribes to two Ethiopian officials so that those officials would help with the fraudulent adoptions.  Specifically, Harding admitted that an audiologist and teacher at a government school was given money and other valuables in exchange for non-public medical information and social history information for potential adoptees.  Additionally, Harding and his co-conspirators provided cash and all-expense paid travel to the head of a regional ministry for women’s and children’s affairs in exchange for his approval of IAG’s applications for intercountry adoptions and ignoring IAG’s failure to maintain a properly licensed adoption facility. </p>

            This is going on all over. God only knows where those Children wind up. The European Adoption Agency in Ohio was raided by the FBI and shut down. Tied to HRC. They should ALL be shut down. We have many Children here waiting for a Lobing Home 🏡.

              I had always wanted to adopt a child but never did.  Now I wish I had.  We are not in any position to do so now, monetarily nor age wise.  But I hope that many will consider.  I worked with Children years ago volunteering at a school and I loved them and still have contact with a few.  I am so glad that place is shut down.  There is also some program going on with CPS and foster homes where they get Churches to help provide backpacks for kids and they always seem to have a bunch of kids avail. for these programs.  Where do they get all these kids?  I am getting so sick of this.  The adoptions, the foster homes, the CPS.  Yikes.

                LDS, yes tied to Mitt Romney and Elizabeth Smart and it all started from Masons.  Did you know I posted a picture on here of Eliz. Smart and her husband.  Husband is straight from Scotland and is a Mason wearing his kilt.  It doesn't get any wackier than that.
