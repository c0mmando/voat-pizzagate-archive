<p>What are your thoughts on this case? Do you think new evidence is on the horizon? How often are the cops given funding to boost the hunt? I, along with several others contacted portugal authorities last year voicing &quot;concerns&quot; in regards to the emails and research conducted from the WLeaks emails. If enough people messaged them it could have triggered something...</p>
<p>I think this is pizzgate related. I do find it to be interesting timing to boost search. I don\'t know if the P Brothers had anything to do with it or if they were being framed for it but the police sketches are definitely them... I also know that as soon as the emails were released last year i was on twitter trying to share and get more info and there were massive censoring efforts to shut it down. 
I will say this, there is more to be discovered in the McCann case. Maybe now that some of the corruption has been removed from power there will be more cooperation in efforts to solve the mystery.</p>',

            Parents sold their daughter, the Pedo brothers likely were the ones who went overboard and killed her during their fun. The body being carried was likely dead, not sleeping, and getting rid of it might have been what they were doing. This charade will go on indefinitely without closure, just like J.B. Ramsey.

             But why keep the case alive...the majority are not even concerned .mmore into the footie...
So they r not aiming this exercise in futility at the lemmings...
Just like they sell hopelessness to the majority..this seems to be a concentrated form of them saying...
Look ure no different to the lemmings...we ate still at it..and can arrange funding while we r covering up in plane sight by selling the lemmings a narrative of investigation...
...
Its like they r playing the rile of the court jester ...and we r the sovereign..
They r setting up scripts to laugh at us...while we the sovereign ignored the national debt and r involved in fun and games...and conspiracy theories undulating inside the debt maze...
This is how the trabadour spies ...used to work..as well..
Sell rumours...script plays ..that gave encoded in them messages to their agents of the court..
Its just a game ...and they laugh at us for not getting out of it..

            So very sadly, this poor child is deceased and has been for a long time and her remains will never be found...  Her Freemasonic father and (most likely) Order of the Eastern Star/witch mother who love misleading the public already have all the answers. Would be interesting to follow these people on the Satanic calendar dates and see where they end up. Her siblings would be a wealth of information if anyone is close enough to them.

            Can’t get the police to attend an emergency due to lack of funding, let alone stop the almost daily murder misery happening in London but hey, there’s always a couple of hundred grand spare to throw at the McCanns.  ‘Why indeed’ is the ubiquitous national outcry here, as far as I’ve found.  What is it about the disappearance of this child that has merited the investigation continuous tax payer funding and consistent column inches and airtime that supercedes that of any other missing child in the ELEVEN years since she ‘disappeared’.  They’re already tipping the scales in terms of public opinion, and rightly so imo.  Why the fuck indeed.  And my suspicion grows with every new campaign renewal.

            The official remit of Operation Grange to, "Investigate the abduction as though it occurred in the UK" is proof positive that it has been nothing but a sham (and an utterly disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money and manpower) from the start designed to keep alive the bogus abduction narrative; no investigator starts with the conclusion!  7 years and 13 million pounds of taxpayers' money later, it has not developed a single lead and not even bothered to question the McCanns or the Tapas 7.

                No problemo (I should've been clearer, tbh).  It's also of note that Operation Grange was set up after Rebecca Brooks of The News of the World threatened the then Tory government under David Cameron with a solid week of bad headlines if they refused.  More evidence of legacy media complicity of covering up the truth of Madeleine's death.

                 I hear ya.  Just baffles me as to why our money is still being thrown at this?  There has to be something that underlies this.  There has to be something.  I personally don’t hold much credence to the Pod bros. E-fit as I believe Kevin Halligan was part of bringing that into the narrative for his own personal reasons - so it stands that there has to be a fundamental basis for keeping this within the public conscience that we haven’t yet considered.  I can’t understand the U.K. passivity sometimes. I’m hearing questions from complete sleeping normies left right and centre as to how and why the government is still throwing money at what is largely considered suffered a dead case (funny how they come to seek answers from the more awake when it suits, but it presents redpill opportunities if nothing else!). None of whom are prepared to contact their MP and make their concerns known, of course.  But some are starting down that rocky road of questioning, which is always a good thing, I guess.

            I know of some experts looking into locating the body of MM, they might have a lead. If so, that would explain the funding. My thoughts on the case itself are that the parents are responsible for MM's fate, and that the P Brother's sketches might have been red herrings to misdirect the pizzagate story away from JA selling CP to embassy row.

             Very interesting... there are some sick people out there. Those sketches confuse the hell out of me. Its totally obvious they are who they look like. I think you may be right. There is so much speculation and so much funding.nits real shame 2hen you see the lack of evidence turn up

              I wouldn't be surprised if the photos were released to put Podesta, and by extension Presdident Hillary(lol), into submission of sorts. If the elites keep each other in check via being compromised, this is a hell of a compromised position.

            They're gonna milk this psyop forever.  (Also the police sketches that amazingly match the Podestas, Wiener and Ghislaine Maxwell are part of the disinfo.  IMO the mysterious case of MM was only ever a psyop, planned years in advance.  Don't waste another minute of your time on this.)

            Thanks. This is a desperation move. So many people know that the Podesta's kidnapped the girl. Whooo, 150K.  That buys some overpriced stuff, and staff. Basically giving the money to the slime that enabled it.

             Thats what i was afraid. Ive not been able to look into the MM case extensively but what i have learned is very troubling. I hope there will be justice for Madeleine one day.

               Sometimes a user could become shortsighted and ignore spam guideline. It is actually pretty generous in that you can promote your commercial interest, as long as it is in 5/10 ratio. If the website is interesting, other users are likely to promote it for the site owner naturally. Take BitChute for example (
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/BitChute/submissions">
                https://voat.co/u/BitChute/submissions

                I warned the guy posting only TLAV that this was going to happen several times, and explained Voat's policy in detail. If he got banned, it's his own fault.
