<p>A summery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L\'Enfant"><strong>Pierre Charles L\'Enfant</strong></a> history is needed first. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pierre Charles L\'Enfant</strong> - (1754 – 1825)  French-born American architect and civil engineer best known for designing the layout of<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/L\'Enfant_Plan_of_Washington_Superimposed_on_the_Rectangular_System_from_which_He_Worked.jpg"> the streets of Washington, D.C</a>., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Enfant_Plan">L\'Enfant Plan.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pierre Charles L\'Enfant</strong> arrived in America in 1777 at the age of 23, and served as a military engineer with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette">Major General Lafayette.</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 1780 he served on General <strong>George Washington\'s</strong> staff for the remainder of the Revolutionary War.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1783 he was promoted to Major of Engineers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the war ended he was one of the first people to join <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Cincinnati">The Society of the Cincinnati</a></strong> and designed their <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Order_of_cincinnati.jpg/220px-Order_of_cincinnati.jpg">badge</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The suggestion of the bald eagle as the Cincinnati insignia was made by Major Pierre L\'Enfant, a French officer who joined the American Army in 1777, served in the Corps of Engineers, and became one of the first members of the Society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Society of the Cincinnati</strong> is the oldest hereditary society in North America starting in 1783. <a href="https://i.sli.mg/M838wO.jpg">Building</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1784 King Louis XVI ordained the French <strong>Society of the Cincinnati</strong>.Up to that time, the King of France had not allowed his officers to wear any foreign decorations, but he made an exception in favor of the badge of the Cincinnati. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati"><strong>Illuminati</strong></a> were kicked out of Germany around this time and had connections in france)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>George Washington</strong> was elected the first President General of <strong>The Society of the Cincinnati</strong>. He served from December 1783 until his death in 1799.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>President <strong>George Washington</strong> appointed <strong>L\'Enfant</strong> in 1791 to plan the new City of Washington who added a lot of masonic symbolism to the city plan. <a href="http://100777.com/images/washintgon01.jpg">Pentagram</a> <a href="http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/Owl-Capitol-Building.jpg">Owl</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl_of_Athena">Athena/Minerva</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>L\'Enfant</strong> died in poverty, June 14, 1825. He was originally buried at the Green Hill farm in Chillum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>He may have died in poverty but the state sure has made up for it since his death</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since 1902 many of <strong>L\'Enfants</strong> visionary plans have been far more instrumental in considering the lay-out and architectural plans of Washington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1909 the state recognised his contributions so was dug up and moved to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/GraveofLenfant.jpg/1280px-GraveofLenfant.jpg"><strong>L\'Enfants</strong> grave</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Many more incidents of recognition happened since his death. So its safe to say L\'Enfant was a well know and influential person at the very top of society. As he was an engineer, architect and a man of power and influence it would seem only natural he would join the Free masons. There is <a href="https://scottishrite.org/about/media-publications/journal/article/the-masonic-career-of-major-pierre-charles-lenfant/">evidence</a> to say he joined the Scottish Rite 33 degree masons in 1789 hence the masonic symbolism in the L\'Enfants Plan of Washington.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Based in Washington, D.C., the Southern Jurisdiction (often referred to as the <strong>Mother Supreme Council of the World</strong>) was founded in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1801.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Society of the Cincinnati</strong> predates <strong>The Scottish Rite Freemasons</strong> by about 16 - 18 years.</p>

<p><strong>Supreme Council, 33°, Scottish Rite Freemasonry</strong> <a href="https://scottishrite.org/">https://scottishrite.org/</a> <a href="https://i.sli.mg/M838wO.jpg">NOTE LOCATION</a>.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NOTE: The <a href="https://i.sli.mg/MtOC1w.jpg">roof</a> to <strong>Supreme Council, 33°, Scottish Rite Freemasonry</strong> building is exactly the same as the <a href="https://i.sli.mg/jj2XYR.jpg">roof</a> design for the <strong>Pegasus museum</strong>. This <a href="https://youtu.be/0SGk0CTI46I?t=2m57s">video</a> explaining where the kill room was (which has been taken down multiple times and resulted in the reporter getting threatened by JA) touches on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOTE: When I was searching for the links and video to the roof on <strong>Pegasus</strong> I came across this <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1548709">Voat</a> by <a href="https://voat.co/user/mumma_ra">@mumma_ra</a>.
He mentions a person or interest called  <strong>Paul Weil</strong> (former singer of <strong>The Apes</strong>). I sat up when I saw this because whilst researching <strong>Pegasus</strong> I came across <a href="https://i.sli.mg/K27XkG.jpg">this</a>.(<a href="http://www.ardue.org.uk/university/degs/deg25.html">Link to Original Page</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOTE: I\'ve noticed <strong>Oriental Gate of Heaven</strong> in some other Masonic writings also. This could do with looking into.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pegasus</strong> is the subject of a very rich iconography, especially through the ancient <strong>Greek</strong> pottery and paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry</strong> is probably worth a read. It was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Pike">Albert Pike</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Continuing this line of investigation took me to <a href="http://dcsr.org">http://dcsr.org</a> (more investigation needed) and a Scottish Rite Freemason</strong> <a href="http://dcsr.org/bodies/bodyAlbertPikeConsistory.php"><strong>Brother Basil Mossaidis</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brother Mossaidis was born in Philadelphia, and has served as the Executive Director of <a href="http://ahepa.org/"><strong>American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association</strong></a>, commonly known as <strong>AHEPA</strong>, in Washington, DC since 2002.....Brother Basil is also very active in the <strong>Greek</strong> Orthodox Church, and has been honored by the Patriarch for outstanding service thereto.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only does it talk about his involvement with kids but he talks about being the Director of <strong>American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association</strong>, commonly known as <strong>AHEPA</strong>, in Washington, DC since 2002</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenism_(religion)"><strong>Hellenism</strong></a> is the historical spread of ancient Greek culture.</p>
<p><a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5388?menuId=5"> <strong>The Center for Hellenic Studies</strong></a> <a href="https://i.sli.mg/pRYg55.jpg">NOTE LOCATION</a> </p>
<p>Somewhere there maybe a link between AHEPA and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Acacia_brothers">Acacia Brothers</a>. <a href="https://zeitgeist77.wordpress.com/category/nwo/2-farternal-society/north-america-orders/page/9/">This</a> might help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So who lives on the same rd as The Center for Hellenic Studies? HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>HRC</strong> lives in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehaven_(house)"> Whitehaven House</a> on Whitehaven Rd <a href="https://i.sli.mg/4uyALE.jpg">NOTE LOCATION</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HRC</strong> lives at the end of a dead end road and her house backs directly on to a woodland park called <a href="https://i.sli.mg/jYwyrU.jpg">Dumbarton Oak Woods</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this <a href="http://archive.is/GLOqq#selection-647.281-647.308">article</a> it talks about <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml"><strong>The Finders</strong></a> holding kids at an address in Glover Park <a href="https://i.sli.mg/aEnh98.jpg">NOTE LOCATION</a></p>

             Since 1902 many of

              L'Enfants
             </strong>
             visionary plans have been far more instrumental in considering the lay-out and architectural plans of Washington.

             In 1909 the state recognised his contributions so was dug up and moved to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

          <h2>
           Many more incidents of recognition happened since his death. So its safe to say L'Enfant was a well know and influential person at the very top of society. As he was an engineer, architect and a man of power and influence it would seem only natural he would join the Free masons. There is
           <a href="https://scottishrite.org/about/media-publications/journal/article/the-masonic-career-of-major-pierre-charles-lenfant/">
            evidence

           to say he joined the Scottish Rite 33 degree masons in 1789 hence the masonic symbolism in the L'Enfants Plan of Washington.

            Regarding the Finders, I believe there are also the Watchers that watch the captive children, and the Movers that move the children from one location to another.  This is from the Dr. Phil Human Trafficking episode.

            Please have a read of this. Freemasonry connected to yet another Church.  Is the Church that powerful it needs Police to Guard over it?

            There are more than 3 literal degrees, but there are only 3 true degrees of "the special part" of Freemasonry. The real third level corresponds more or less to the degrees above 30, plus there's all kinds of honorary and special degrees way above 30 (90, 95th degrees etc.) but those don't really have the same meaning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, it's been twisted, copied, mimicked, and really distorted over time either way.

            Do you know where the theory about his sacrifices were busted? You truly do need blood to get certain magick-related things to work, and as someone who explored both paths/sides of magick, I wouldn't be surprised if Crowley dabbled in the darker side occasionally.

            They were supposedly trafficked poor kids and orphans, ladies of the night. They were sent over by Louis XIV,  100 years before Louis XVI, as wards of the king, and given a dowry.  Maybe not related, but interesting....

            It is common knowledge that albert pike says the power of masonry is lucifer, dumbfuck, also common knowledge masons worship lucifer. You are the idiot who is not aware of these facts not me. Go fuck yourself for your proof fucktard, or research about what you speak so you don't sound like a fucking retard all the time. There is massive mountains of evidence that masons control the government and have since it started in 1776 and that they are satanists. Masonry is based on kabbalism, which is ancient babylonian satanism. This is not a belief you stupid fuck. This isn't my preconcieved notion. These are facts you yourself could independently verify if you weren't a shit for brains shill. The 3rd world war as described in pikes letter to mazzini is about to take place and you are here shilling for mason satanists, doing a terrible job of it, and exposing yourself as a world class fucktard. You probably think trump will save america too.

            I can't speak for his accuracy on Crowley/Thelema, that's the issue with anything occult, many styles of worship have a left/right or black/white path that allows for some to follow a less moral (or even straight up evil) path than others.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll find that Luciferian worship is very important to modern Freemasonry (especially post-Pike revision) and has had it's rituals and degrees changed from the original path (hint: there are only 3 real Masonry degrees, and most Masons never ever make it to the 3rd degree, even some quite high-level ones). Lucifer is also what Crowley channeled ("Lam"), and it is a 6D group-consciousness according to them (take that as what you will). If you follow Greek thought with Prometheus, or Sumerian tales of Enki and Enlil, Lucifer is not as clear-cut negative as things are made out, hence how once occultists learn this some go a bit too far like Pike and worship him a bit much.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, apparently "Magick in theory and practice" says that ritual sacrifice is almost a necessity to get anything important done with some types of magick
            <a href="https://raumfahrer.wordpress.com/manson/crowley-on-sacrifice/">
             https://raumfahrer.wordpress.com/manson/crowley-on-sacrifice/
            </a>
            He makes it almost like "well, no duh you need to kill some people" which is not what I expected tbh...
"For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim."
He doesn't admit doing it but he explains it at least. I think this may be relevant to finding abuse victims even...
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's some discussion and it seems he talks in code about using 150 victims (Frater Perdurabo is an alias of his) that are male children.

            Nice job presenting facts, OP.  "The bear, the ape, and the Pegasus..." quote from Albert Pike is interesting.  No doubt, Freemasons are somehow involved in this mess... how couldn't they be?

            educate-yourself.org is registered to Ken Adachi, who died in 1989. According to Stew Webb this is an alias of an identity thief and troll known as John W. Allman who uses many aliases to harass online whistleblowers, and feed them disinformation.

            When a posting begins ** EXPOSED ** you know that mindless lunacy about 33s, the Masons and 18th century charlatans will ensue. Is there any Pizzagate here. Mods?

             That's why I didn't put my work on the front page , but instead on the Pizzagate whatever.. I 'm certain it wil be deleted for "lack of relevance" Or 'What will they think of us now? '' Which itself is a total op .. What do we think of *them is the question

              I'm sorry you feel that way. I know it's a bit of a history lesson at the beginning but if you get to the end of the post I believe its very much pizza related.

            Just because I need to post this somewhere, incoming veep Mike Pence and his wife have been living in a rented house in Chevy Chase DC for the past month or so. (They will of course be moving to the official Vice President's Residence at the Naval Observatory this Friday.)

             The Illuminati plot has been masterminded and executed over the years by a number of so-called illustrious "heroes." Their globalist philosophy was perhaps best expressed by 19th century British poet, Alfred Lord Tennyson, an occultist and Mason, whose revealing poem, "Locksley Hall," epitomized the lofty aims of the elitist conspirators. President Harry Truman, a 33rd degree Mason, carried a typed copy of Tennyson's "Locksley Hall," in his wallet every day of his adult life and often pulled it out and read it to friends.&gt;

             I am hoping Trump let them appoint his VP to fill his cabinet with the most important guilty parties to take them down. It makes more sense this thing that got swept under the rug for instance means they also traffic humans.  And Pence picked her for Transportation secretary...

            I believe Masonry has deep symbolism and earnest original roots but it involves a certain path that is open to a lot of negative options/powers. Their main centerpiece is ancient Egyptian knowledge that the old King Sequenre Tao = Hiram Abiff
            <a href="http://www.mastermason.com/hiramdiscovered">

            (shitty formatted site but good history summary) held who fought the evil Hyksos rulers, so he was a good guy back then. Just like the Illuminati literally had a decent intention originally but were destroyed, slandered, and renamed/coopted, Freemasonry has noble purposes on some levels but appears to be really corrupted at some levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a former 32nd-degree Mason's allegations/explanations
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WbRKAyn4-I">

            for why they do it. An interesting observation is that it is literally a way of giving yourself power over someone young and full of potential by causing great psychological damage in a certain way and actually effectively altering the course of the abusers life for the better if they succeed. It's like killing off future competitors in a weird way... but anyways the ritual stuff is mostly sub-conscious symbolism that triggers certain psychological responses in the abused that go very far back to base, instinctual things that everyone fears.

            no they was surelly not all evil, but like in some other later cult, the secrets was kept in high priest ranks,  its a not so much known fact but at some period they also practiced humans sacrifice etc...quite hard to find good infos on it but from my research they did...like in some ritual i forgot the exact name but something like "ritual xxxx of Amenophis" for example...

            Really not sure how to intimate this, since it's so much more than sensitive and I'm 110% sure every thread on this site is surveilled:
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a friend who's getting deep into independent investigation of the various emanations coming from good ole Jimmy Comet and his pizzeria(?). Now that we've narrowed down the Pegasus Museum as a potential kill room/utility building, and we've zeroed in on its location, the only way to investigate further would be law enforcement search warrants that give no time for cleanup (which has probably already been completed tbh). But my friend brought up a very astute point: law enforcement doesn't run the streets of DC, or any other city for that matter. It's the street gangs; in DC, there's a sizable contingent of La eMe bangers and Latin Kings and some smaller Black Mafia/Gangster Disciples/Crips/Bloods, but MS-13 basically runs the greater DC area. This is the longest of long shots, but perhaps if someone with inroads to the other side of the law could make a case, we'd be much more likely to get intel on the underground tunnels in DC and possibly an inside look at the Pegasus Museum. Sure it's a pipe dream, but most organized crime outfits are very adamant about killing pedophiles in prison. If they found out a pedophile mafia was running under their city, I think they'd be quite, shall we say, perturbed.

             I think it's a bad idea because there is nothing to gain. 
The gangs are run by the drug lords et cetera. 
Yes, the Mafia hates pedos, but likely that's why we've gotten as far as we have - via the leaks.

             The investigation is not for amateurs. What could be gained? I'm missing that.

             They're a part of it. In it for the money, not the blood-spilling, but still. They get their 'trafficked loot' mostly from Mexico (daily international shipments arrive at Mexican ports, basically) and from there, the Mexican cartel members 'move' the young people to the U.S to be exploited and inserted into the sex-slave trade. I got this info from a very interesting thread on here and read up on the links provided. If I can find it, I'll happily post it here.

            When his father was working for the French royal family pedophelia was rampant there... From a comment corbettreport*:
"Marion Sigaut, she tracked back these pedophile networks up to the Ancien Regime in France (during Louis XV reign especially). She explains the traffics in public hospitals by tracking the entry and checkouts of the orphans, etc. also explaining how Louis XV lost power because of pedophile blackmail (which weakened Louis XVI up to his overthrown by French Revolution)."
           </p>
           <p>
            I would not be surprised if James Alefantis is somehow related to this family.

             An aside on the "French Revolution" and the Masonic connections:
            </p>
            <p>
             It appears likely the "beheading" of Louis 16 was a "King Kill" ritual/ fake - out / psy - op as some believe the JFK event was.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/barindex2.pdf">
              http://mileswmathis.com/barindex2.pdf
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It appears likely; especially in the context of all the psy-op events in the last 15 years, since "9/11" and the fact the majority has remained in ignorance of these programs ; i.e. "Project Gladio" "Strategy of Tension" - which apparently continued in the U.S.A. up until today.

            </p>
            <p>
             Even though the JFK event never made sense, the Propaganda Media stuck to the original ridiculous story and just doubled - down; and then sent-out controlled-op to herd anyone who couldn't be initially persuaded (a fairly small subset of the population kept interest / research - and were mocked / marginalized, over many years).

             "9/11" was also a Masonic Ritual: re-Inactment of the destruction of the 2 Pillars of the world. Jachim / Boaz. [We went into this in extreme length over many years; on my Forum; including an elaboration of the details and evidence around all the staged events which tended to peak in intensity over the past few years - until we were vandalized / defaced 12/10 Dec 10 2016.]
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is a video series which touches on many of the points on the "9/11" event as an occult ritual, and is by someone who is likely himself a Mason - this video series from '07 was what originally got me onto the research around the connection between politics and occult symbolism:.

             I wrote about the alleged beheading of Louis 16 on my Forum which was hacked and brought down after 8 years + of work on Dec 10th 2015 after I connected to this Voat subverse and started linking our Pizza meme research and other research over here.

             . There was a whole section on the falsification of History.
            </p>
            <p>
             . Much has been written on the "Illuminati" engineering of the "French Revolution" Napoleon was a member of secret societies and his "War" was basically to just plunder different countries and split the spoils between those in on the ruse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's from a Masonic site arguing against the case - but you can see that people believed "Illumanati" / Secret societies were behind it from the very beginning. Such a long standing /original "conspiracy theory"
            </p>
            <p>
             In any case, the "French Revolution" is certainly not what we are told.

             Ironically, a leading researcher, Miles Mathis, into the falsification of history, appears to be enamoured himself of young girl children! - Just to be totally candid on his context. I still have confidence that much of what he writes is correct. You can check it yourself. Not all the articles are equal.

             For instance, he apparently believes the entire "Pizzagate" is an -op / hoax.

             The King Louis 16 and his circle fooled the public to believe he had been beheaded. Then the same man with the same name "Louis" came back from hiding as his own brother 11 year later as Louis 18. Both "brothers" were said to have had the same name, i.e "Louis"  from birth

             This is what I believe and independently found ^^^^ (Mathis site is up and mine is down. Wouldn't you know. Just because he wirites love poems to little girls, doesn't mean he's a pedo - but that's an interesting co - incidence certainly)

              Yes my journey on this took me to France and my previous knowledge of the history of the Illuminati took me to France. Both around the time of 1780-90s. So I can see a strong link for sure.

              Initally looking at this line of investigation it feels that its far from PizzaG8 but when you look at the bigger picture and start to understand how complex "it" is (there is always the posiility "it" might not even exist and it's all just one mad Dan Brown book we are writing in realtime) then this line of research is makes complete sense.

            many masons are good, thats a fact, but u have to understand something, first there is differents lodges, some mostly good some not, some very secrets in which only selected people from other lodges will can come in...in the bad lodges, only bad people will make high degree, if they did not past the little test others initiates do to them, like if they refusing to do something bad for them for example, they will never go on top of the pyramid, and they will never know the true face of the cult and the true goal and meaning.., but they will stay in and being just apart of some secrets and activities..
My point is , they HAVE to appear to doing good, if they want doing bad, they will use mostly the good peeps in their initiates like a cover, and those who will believe all their life that they workd for good, while some selected one in the same lodge would have maybe took part of some sacrificial stuff for example...
           </p>
           <p>
            occultists bad groups (yes not all are bad, occult mean just "secret", magician for example  could do good, but in middle age they was considered bad and have to do it in secret for not being persecuted) so these groups always reverse everything for going to their goal, its an old technic used since centuries, it was a commun thing to do like that...like the templars also preyd the devil, even if they was considered like good christians by most of the people..its quite a know fact if u research it well (not only on youtube or mainstream medias) i know a good book about it but i dont know if its have been translated in english, name should be something like : the secret doctrine of templars by Jules Loiseleur 1872..maybe u could find it..

            Good info and layout.  I wish I was as talented in posting.  Mine all get taken down and called a "wall of text" :(
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I've seen the pentagram Washington layout but never the owl.  That's pretty cool.  There clearly is an owl in the layout.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the society of the Cincinnati badge, it looks like there's an owl with children holding hands in the breast of the Eagle.  Am I seeing this wrong?

            That is correct. Within Scottish Rite, there is also York Rite (the other major branch). As well as masonic organizations (Rosicrucianism, irregular freemasonry, Bohemian Grove, etc.) that are basically freemasonry in their teaching, and are run by the same people.

            This is a very good read, and excellent information. Thank you.

            I want to let you know about a very deep secret that MAY affect how we read this. A lot of the masonic influence on the founding was actually a psy op. Washington, Franklin, Jay, and many others joined freemason societies in order to disrupt intelligence efforts in Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Illuminati was actually the result of this. Look at when it was founded and when it ended. Look at pictures of Adam Weishaupt. This effort confused European masonry into thinking the Revolution was one of their efforts, when it was a genuine revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are STILL books being written arguing that Franklin and others were secretly spies for the British because they were such good double agents.

              There are several factions. The Bush-Windsor bloodline is the continuation of an ancient Egyptian (Ramses II, Cleopatra) and Roman (Caesar, Piso) bloodlines. The royal families of many countries all continue from this line. The Knights Templar fought for the Merovingian bloodline after their empire was destroyed around 800AD IIRC (Frank empire) and this line included Charlemagne. This was considered the "grail bloodline" and alleged to be related to Christ. But there are aaaalso allegations that Flavius Piso of the Windsor-Bush bloodline was responsible for creating much of the bible and using it to describe Tiberius' rape of Jerusalem in 70AD. That manipulation was run by the Holy Roman Church (the "evil priest" faction) and the Vatican with the 9th Circle being responsible for a lot of not-so-nice stuff. They have a hard-on for Jerusalem and using Temporal Power and convincing everyone that Jesus said they're the shit, and do that through the Jesuits - who have had a hand at suppressing anything against the church all through the ages, particularly the Inquisitions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyways, DC establishment = Royal bloodlines, that's the key thing.

               Many people tens of thousands descend by their family allegedly from those so-called royal ancestors and are not part of this criminal group.. This group have a specific philosophy which they keep secret - they also change their names / lie / and hijack history and genealogy. They are plunderers. Not builders of civilization .. The ancient world is not what we are told / led to believe.

               They have their own sect which goes back to the ancient world. And S. Zev is connected to Arabian figures and to Jesuit figures. At the top they may all be the same / they perform the "inversion" of morality are "anti - life" and hold materialistic philosophy of brutality for hidden power. They compete with Nature "trans - humanism" "creating the FRANKendstein / Golom.

                The figure of the man who occupied the center of the movement is a most unexpected and surprising one. By now, his biography is one of the most completely documented of any Jew who played an important role in Jewish history. Shabbetai Zevi was born in Smyrna (Ismir) on the Ninth of Av, 1626 (unless the date was manipulated to conform with the tradition that the Messiah would be born on the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple). His father, Mordecai Zevi, came from the Peloponnesus (Patras?), probably from a family of Ashkenazi origin, and as a young man settled in Smyrna, where he first was a modest poultry merchant and later became an agent for Dutch and English traders.

               Yes. The people of America had concerns around secret societies in the late 1700s.

               published several pamphlets under the pseudonym Cassius where he criticized the society as an attempt at reestablishing a hereditary nobility in the new republic.The pamphlets, entitled
               <em>
                An Address to the Freemen of South Carolina and Considerations on the Society or Order of Cincinnati
               </em>

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I only wonder that, when the united Wisdom of our Nation had, in the Articles of Confederation, manifested their Dislike of establishing Ranks of Nobility, by Authority either of the Congress or of any particular State, a Number of private persons should think proper to distinguish themselves and their Posterity, from their fellow Citizens, and form an Order of hereditary Knights, in direct Opposition to the solemnly declared Sense of their Country.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Even then these societies were thought to be dangerious.

            Good job on this. I was looking into this area earlier. I feel like the Finders have to do with the CIA's MKULTRA operation a short walk away at the Georgetown Hospital. I wonder if this tunnel would go under the gated in Hillandale community.

            Could this be where the other end of the tunnel leads?

               Voat doesnt like Google maps url shorteners. Or any other url shortener for that matter.
              </p>
              <p>
               You cannot archive Google maps.
