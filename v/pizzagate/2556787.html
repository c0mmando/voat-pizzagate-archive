            YRM : Yes we should be disgusted that Weiner engaged in this kind of conduct with a 15 year old. But she  had a bit of a Lolita streak in her. She initiated the contact and flirted with Weiner for more than 6 months. The  erection picture with his son in the same bed was evidently the last straw. She contacted  Ms Leathers for guidance but refused to carry out her advice to report the matter to the police. Ms. Leathers was the adult with whom Weiner had a sexting affair previously. The girl admitted that she just wanted to mess with Hillary's campaign. So Ms Leathers arranged for an expose in the Daily Mail publication which paid the teenager for her story and the photo.  I kinda feel sorry for creepy Weiner, after all Hillary had stolen his wife from him: what's a virile man supposed to do?  He should have had a discreet affair  with a sex worker...and hope her name wasn't Stormy Daniels!

            You knnow we only have access to one warrant here. There could be others. So we are all speculating as best we can with the clues available to us. News reports are not always accurate either.  How did the feds learn that three devices were  at Granite?  I can't imagine the feds being interested in a plain vanilla porno texting between 2 consenting individuals, one of whom later turns out to be a teenage minor. Think of all the cases which have been mentioned here over the past 18 months that  were state prosecutions and state prison terms.  Nor can I imagine child welfare authorities contacting the feds rather than their own local police with its Special Victims unit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something more than a bedroom photo on the front page of Daily Mail  or NY Post pricked the interest of the feds.
           </p>
           <p>
            This still doesn't mean Erik Prince is to be believed entirely. He made his first statement on November 4th  which gave him plenty of time to obtain info from  his connections...or to embellish. His claim of more crimes on the part of Hillary and her gang, if true, would be better investigated by the feds than NYPD.  So if true, it would have been the feds engaged in a cover up.  And Lynch certainly had the ability to cover it up with a threat of civil rights prosecutions.

            What we need are some more snitches.

             I'll add...Weiner had been on the radar of the White Hats for a long time.  They have collection abilities and possibly had sucked everything out of the laptop even before the NYPD arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prince has
             <strong>
              long standing
             </strong>
             ties with the IC, up to, and including LTG Flynn.  It's likely he already knew of the laptop's contents well before the NYPD had the laptop.  Prince also has close ties to NYPD (one of the largest and best armed standing armies on the planet) through the IC.
            </p>
            <p>
             It stands to reason that Prince likely knew of the contents in advance, and the seizure of the laptop confirmed what they already knew.
            </p>
            <p>
             This plan has been in place for a long, long time.

             That's why I left the insurance file out of the OP. SAP's, pay to play, and them covering up sexting with a minor to protect her campaign is enough. That's what could have disgusted the NYPD detectives. It disgusts me to know they probably allowed Weiner to molest someones 15 year old daughter.

            I also forgot to mention that the search warrant was limited to searching the dsvices for evidence in connection with violations of federal codes re:  national security issues,  not  child pornography. Presumably the prosecutor was allowing state authorities to work the pornographg issues for the time being. Both the states and the federal.government have laws addressing child pornography.

            Also, did Trump get impatient with Preet Bhahara  for not pursuing the other crimes mentioned by Erik Prince and thus fired him?
           </p>
           <p>
            Note also the rumored  warning by Attorney General  Lynch that if these other matters mentioned bu Prince were pursued she would reopen the Garner case and go after NYC cops for civil rights violations.

             This only applies to the second warrant on Weiner's laptop.  The warrant to seize the laptop involved FEDERAL crimes around child abuse/pornography.  Several crimes are listed on the warrant, here is one.

            <p>
             18 U.S. Code § 1470 - Transfer of obscene material to minors

             No. Because Erik Prince is a liar.  Bhahara was fired because Trump headquarters in the Southern District of New York.  Michael Cohen's office was in the Southern District of New York. Bhahara was involved the case that got Sergei Magnitsky killed.  Some of that stolen money was laundered through NY real estate.  The lawyer in this NY court case was the same Russian lawyer who met with Trump JR.

             Assuming Fact Not in Evidence, couselor.  Also the NYPD was not the first to open and investigation.  The sexting investigations were open by feds and by locals the same day.  The day after the newspaper article appeared.   The facts you assumed-- that the NYPD went first are contradicted by the NY Times big review on this case  and the ProPublica/New York big review of this case.

             Kudos for stating an opinion as an opinion.  Far too many on here state it as a conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't follow your other conclusion.  Why would the US attorney need the NYPD to write up the warrant?  As you point out Weiner's lawyers were proactive in this, case, why couldn't the Weiner's attorney and the US Attorney have talked.  Why would the NYPD know the devices were moved to Granite?  They would't they would have have had to talked to Weiner's lawyers.  NYPD is extraneous in this case. Anything the US Attorney would want he could get from Weiner's laywers.

            I forgot to mention that the federal search warrant expired on October 3rd. Note the blank Return of service. Typically there are multiple carbon sets of such warrants whereby the  Return becomes a separate document to be completed  and filed with the court detailing the time and date and place the search was carried out. Whoever filed for the unsealing of the Warrant forgot to obtain the separate  Return. Or maybe no warrant was executed since the evidence was voluntarily.turned over.  Peter Strozk said on 9/28 that Weiner's attorney turned over thousands of emails to SDNY( U.S  District Attorney's  office) and that he was sending a team up there to review them.

             Is it possible that the current federal warrant we're seeing is just the one for the phone and the laptop was handed over? Confirmed in the Strozk texts as you stated.

            The Sate of NY  participates in the  Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) joint task force  authorizing the feds and local LE to work together.  The NYPD Special Victims Unit opened a file on Weiner on September 26 in connection with the child pornography aspect. But childrens protective services was already involved with respect to child abuse/neglect  issues as a result of Bill Donahue's complaint. Meanwhile there were scads of newspaper articles throughout September covering the incriminating photograph of  Weiner's hard-on with his son next to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weiner stated in January 2017 that he turned over his electronic devices to Granite Intelligience on September 23 to avoid  the spectacle of an FBI raid at his home. Undoubtedly this was done with advice of counsel and the wish to appear cooperative.  There was no need to destroy evidence of his texts with the teenager since her devices held the same information. As for the rest of the contents, he was not a guilty party and the proof of wrongdoing by Hillary was his insurance policy. As for his wife....I cannot say.
           </p>
           <p>
            His sttorneys would know there were competing agencies wanting access to this content and the best course of action was to place his devices with Granite for safekeepjng and let the searches begin. NYPD would thus be the first agency to search the devices having been the first to  open an investigation.  Its search would have stumbled upon the emails. No sesrch warrant is needed if a suspect consents to a search. As of January 2017, there were no formal charges filed regarding a child pornography crime by the NYPD or the feds. As we can imagine, Weiner was negotiating the best deal possible. There were mandatory prison terms for specific child pornography crimes at the state level and. probably more lenient sentences at the federal level inasmuch as Weiner eventually copped a plea to a federal crime and imprisonment in a federal facility.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm of the opinion that the NYPD  accessed the electronic evidence first. Not only was the NYPD thanked by the feds but how else would the USDC prosecutor know how to prepare a search warrant with such specificity unless it had been made awsre of the evidence by the NYPD.

            Exactly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think that this whole question was part of a disinfo campaign that swept like wildfire. The NYPD would HAVE to had access ... otherwise ... no case. They'd have to be able to prove that the sexting was done from Weiner's phone, etc. You just can't produce a printout or transcription. And even if the victim had records, you'd have to prove it was Weiner receiving the messages.
           </p>
           <p>
            It just seems that somebody went to a lot of trouble to throw the allegation that NYPD detectives saw a lot more than they bargained for into question ... and the worst part is that it worked. And, yes, it's just an allegation until proven, but anyone who did any sort of research on the Seth Rich murder knows how hard it is to find records/documents. They all go into some deep freeze storage bin that's located at Antarctica.

            How much fucking confirmation bias must you have for this?
           </p>
           <p>
            22/9 Daily mail carries a story with a whole bunch of sexting data from THE GIRLS phone
           </p>
           <p>
            Weiner panics, 23/9 gives his hardware to Granite
           </p>
           <p>
            The warrant is issued on 26/9 . It does say 'any law enforcement officer' - so I take that to mean it is
            <em>
             possible
            </em>
            the NYPD did the raid on Granite, not FBI
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT
The NY Post and Washington Post put out stories on 30/9 saying FBI has the laptop, and there's Hillary emails on it
           </p>
           <p>
            thats a 4 day window in which they have to 1) execute the raid 2) take it back to the NYPD cop shop 3) get authority to check its contents 4) surrender it to the FBI 5) FBI assesses its contents 6) report on that to the Media
           </p>
           <p>
            i suppose its possible, just, but that's a very narrow time frame
           </p>
           <p>
            but I keep coming back to this:  We have no public statement DIRECTLY from NYPD corroborating Eric Prince's claim, and
Eric is one dodgy motherfucker. Every other person who repeated the 'insurance file' claim is downstream from Eric Prince, no independent verification
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, when the 'Steele Dossier' paid for by Hillary is the only sole piece of evidence of 'muh collusion' and Robert Mueller hasnt substantiated it from ANY OTHER INDEPENDENT source, I roll my eyes at those who still push the collusion narrative
           </p>
           <p>
            applying the same standard of evidence, I roll my eyes at the 'insurance file' claims because we similarly have no independent verification of Eric Prince's claims, and we have very solid evidence showing that the window of opportunity for the NYPD AT BEST was very, very, narrow
           </p>
           <p>
            NYPD SVU were looking into it because of what was disclosed to Daily Mail.
           </p>
           <p>
            and the Victim was in NORTH CAROLINA - this means the NYPD may have been compromising the case if they looked into it because of their Jurisdiction Limitation - so it would have been wiser for them to leave it to the Feds anyway
           </p>
           <p>
            Occams razor still tells us the greater likelihood that NYPD never had it

             Eric Prince didn't break the story,
             <a href="https://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/">
              True Pundit did
             </a>
             . Prince corroborated it 2 days later. Here's a couple excerpts from the article.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             If the FBI were the only ones who saw the laptop, why would Comey reopen the investigation he had already decided to gloss over? He wouldn't.. They would've just destroyed the evidence and called it a day. Comey would've got a fat check from Clinton too.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents,
              <strong>
               who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from the NYPD.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This last paragraph makes me wonder if the current warrant we're seeing is specifically for the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something isn't right, multiple sources reported it was the NYPD investigating the sexting case, even

              You're right about True Pundit - and True pundit does specify that it was informed by NYPD sources (Eric prnce, 2 days later, who knows if he had any source other than True pundit?)
             </p>
             <p>
              and I concede what keeps it in contention is that we have no solid confirmation as to WHICH AGENCY EXECUTED the Warrant (which actually mentions ipad, iphone and laptop, not just the phone)
             </p>
             <p>
              I mentioned the 'Preet Bharara Subpoena' - perhaps that subpoens wasnt to GRANITE - it was from the Feds to NYPD
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, if i recall correctly ,  Q in the last week has fingered Preet as part of the FBI corruption
             </p>
             <p>
              So that does leave us with a potential scenario of NYPD raiding Granite, getting it back to the cop shop, the Paedostocracy going 'Holy Crap get that fucking hardware off the NYPD!' and sending in Preet Bharara
             </p>
             <p>
              One issue with the True Pundit story is it comes 2 days AFTER the WaPo story saying FBI have the hardware and found Hillary emails -  (maybe the NYPD, having understood the FBI corruption was going to bury it, went to the media to try and keep some prospect of justice alive)
             </p>
             <p>
              the 'big rush' 2 years later is a function of the warrant being released to the public. I think that's a standard procedure, yer? If not, then the release of the warrant would seem to be a WHITE HAT INITIATIVE - because why would the paedostocracy release it and throw scrutiny back on a topic they'd rather keep in a 'tin foil hat' drawer, yer?

              The story started before True Pundit because it was a disnformation campaign.
             </p>
             <p>
              A fake facebook profile had it first.   Rolling Stone tracked down the woman behind that Facebook profile and she was a 60 year cat lady in Joplin Missouri claiming she had NYPD sources.  That was the first reference on Facebook.  An anti-semitic and anonymous Twitter account tweeted her story. Because I'm sure he was Facebook Friends with her.   Then YourNewsWire picked it up.
Another guy claimed there were three folders  IntimateXXX, DNC Nuclear Arsenal and Live Insurance.  Two days later True Pundit did their bit on the same day Doug Hagmann told the same story on Alex Jones.  Doug Hagmann accidentally let the cat of the bag, claiming that Rudy Giulaini was behind most of this.  Giuliani, of course, was a member of the Trump campaign.  If this shit was real, Giuliani could have just said so himself instead of leaking it to the  fringe media.

              Look, I was upset too when I found out Santa Clause wasn't real.  I wanted to believe it so much that I couldn't let it ago.  But eventually the facts won out.  A magic sled?  delivering presents to every Christian kid all over the world?  One the same night?  I mean we didn't even have a chimney.

              The Weiner laptop story is DEAD.   It will remain DEAD even if SVU did work on the case.

               You wish it was dead, that would mean the emails never existed, but those non existant emails caused Comey to reopen the investigation and cover that up. Plus, there was at least one form of CP on his computer he just didn't get charged for it. Who's to say all the other shit wasn't there when he obviously got a whitewashed court case?

                Legal papers filed ahead of Weiner’s sentencing next week say the serial sexter took part in three video chat sessions via Skype during which the girl “made clear that she was not just a minor — she was, in fact, only ​​15 years old.”

                “During the latter two Skype sessions, on February 18 and 23, 2016, and in a Shapchat communication on March 9, the defendant used graphic and obscene language to ask the Minor Victim to display her naked body and touch herself, which she did.”

                Not many people are aware of the full story of how it broke, they might just be aware of where they saw it first. But it was pushed all over the place.   The full story was kind of pieced together later.  It was being pushed by bot networks before it hit TruePundit.  Rolling Stone did an article on the origins of pizzagate that went back as far as the facebook and twitter posts and that it was popping up on messageboards before that.  Infowars was what really broke it big.
               </p>
               <p>
                Based on what they had  I did some original research and found that Kent Dunn video and the fact that that the guy on Alex Jones linked it to Giuliani.   If you remember Giuliani was talking about an October surprise before Comey released his letter.  Rudy was also talking about the fact he was getting leaks from the FBI.  When people pointed out this is illegal, he changed his story.  The FBI IG is investigating leaks from the NY office of the FBI which was said to close to Trump.   How the girl hooked up with Weiner is much, much, wierder than this even.

                It would not mean that because Weiner's sexting and the emails did exist outside of this fake stories about what was on Weiner's laptop.  It's the fake stories that are dead.  The real story still exists, of course.

                He did not get a whitewashed court case, he got a plea deal.   You've heard of this?  Way over 90% of federal cases end in plea deals.  It's routine.  It save the cost of a trial and it's a sure thing, whereas with a trial there is a risk he gets off.  You have no basis for a cover up.

                  Read the Rolling Stone report.  They found highly automated accounts at work tweeting about this before True Pundit and when researchers looked into in they found a good portion of these original tweets were deleted.  That is a way for bot accounts to get a hashtag trending, but then cover their tracks so people don't learn it's automated.

            I don't have the links, but I remember when the story broke, it was the NYPD that had first access to the laptop because Weiner's home was located in their jurisdiction and they had authority to investigate his alleged sexting activity with a minor. They found more than they bargained for, including Hillary's emails. That is when the info had to be turned over to the Feds. Perhaps the Federal investigators had suspected that the Weiners might have them, but couldn't initiate a warrant without more evidence. The sexting opened the door for the NYPD. I don't know that either group expected to find an "insurance" file.

             Either that or Strang is a sleeper white hat who pulled it off somehow someway under the "Mueller" identity. One way or another I believe NYPD got to the laptop and either way it appears Weiner and etc committed OOJ and the FBI let it happen and covered up the attempt.
