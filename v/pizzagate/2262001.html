<p>If we say the movie industry is rife with pedophilia, no one defends them, or makes excuses.

<p>If we note how the CPS is often complicit in child abuse no one tries to defend them.  But there is clearly a need for some form of government services to step in an protect kids from abuse by parents and family.  The solution is for this to see the light of day and reforms to take place.  
</p>
<p>If we note how politicians are often guilty of pedophilia most of us aren\'t ready to do without government.  The solution is to let this see the light of day, admit it is happening, punish the guilty and seek to prevent it from happening in the future.  Criticizing the government for most doesn\'t mean we want to dissolve all government and live in anarchy.</p>

<p>But if I post a series on various religions abusing kids it is assumed I am saying get rid of religion.  I am no longer religious but I know that their are many good teachings in religions and many people take the best teachings and use them to be better people, kind and caring.  I know religion with its promise of something after death can be a great comfort to many people.  But a knee jerk reaction - my religion is not like that sort of thing - means that the light of day is not be put to the issue when it comes to religious organizations, the same light of day we think is a good thing for other organizations.  Thus many times religious people actually become enablers of those who prey on their children.  I have heard enough of the stories of kids abused by priests to know that their parents, be denial, abetted the abusing priest to continue his abuse.  But many don\'t tell because they fear they won\'t be believed, or even worse have so been indoctrinated that the adult, especially the teacher, pastor, priest is above reproach that they actually believe they must be at fault.  Of course some are threatened.  I imagine most abusers know which card to play with which kids.  But it is the adults who set the tone of unquestioned reverence for your elders, and your church.  And so they enable the abuse.</p>

They should welcome it so they admit the problem or the potential for problems and in the light of day make sure their church, synagogue, etc (I don\'t know all the terms for each religion) is open and safe.</p>',

            It's not that organized religion across the board abuses kids.  It's the infiltration and subversion of those religions that are abusing kids.  Specifically I'm talking about organized abuse of children not the rogue actor who you could find in any walk of life.  Organizations that abuse children are almost all (possibly exclusively all) Lucifarian based.  The Catholic church is rife to the hilt with Lucifarians .  Mormons are masonic.  Free masonry is Lucifarian.  Hillsong Church as well as many of the Mega christian churches in America have all been infiltrated to the top.  You want to know how to tell if a church is infiltrated by those pedophile lucifarians?  If they are preaching coming together under a world religion or kissing the ring of the pope even though they are protestant or are of the feel good charismatic movement type church then you have a major reason to be suspicious.  Lucifarians that infiltrate churches have an agenda to subvert the teachings of bible, the sacrifice of Jesus, and lead people astray.  Ultimately the goal is to bring everyone together under one leader (the pope) using the illusion of Christianity while teaching to opposite.  Hillsong church from Australia and now in NY and LA are a perfect example  on who not to trust.

            Anyway, it's not religion that is the problem, but the subversion of it.

             When people post comments that make no sense and I point out that their arguments are irrational, they can either attempt to use a rational argument to prove me wrong or they can resort to ad hominems like accusing me of bait posting.  The resort to such tactics must mean I hit a nerve.  But come on folks, for the sake of the kids put your wounded feelings aside.  When a religious leader rapes a kid it is worse than when a movie executive does it because this person has represented themselves as being extra holy.  In the case of at least Catholic priests they say they hold the keys to eternity and they can damn you by excommunication.  So there is an additional and terrible psychological damage.
             <br/>
             If I am going to be attacked for raising the issue of abuse by religious leaders and coverup by religious institutions on this site of all sites then we have lost the battle.  I hope to wake people up.  Maybe some mom on this site will check a bit more carefully when the sunday school teacher invites some kids to his house for a sleepover.  Maybe when some young boy says he doesn't want to be an altar boy anymore some parent will have a light go off.  If I begin to sound confrontational it is a reaction to the very surprising reactions to my posts that alert people to all the places pedophilia might be found.  I am stunned that it appears in the end, defending religious institutions is more important than protecting the kids.

              Really ? Who's defending religious institutions for covering up sex crimes against children? I don't care what religion I am , I will never condone that and I think that's how a lot of people feel . You have misconstrued what is being said .

              Why don't you point out the real culprits such as the Jesuits, Zionists, Sabbateans, etc...that have infiltrated religions instead of blaming all religions whole cloth? They are the reason for all this. You totally ignore that.

                Yes. The same people are the ones that have infiltrated because their entire lives exist to hate anything that is not like itself. I could launch a history lesson but, naahhh I will just call them what they are, Talmudists, Canaanites, Hivites, Zionists, Phoenicians, Sabbateans, Frankists, Venicians, blood drinking cults, Satanists, Luciferians, Jesuits Society Of Jesus, etc....they have hidden under many names but its basically all the same people with the same goal.

                Jesus's principles invented freedom and they have been pissed about it for 2000 years.

            <p>
             When you read OP's other thread on sexual abuse by Tibetan Buddhists, you will see that someone said he/she could hardly believe this, as there were strict rules for Buddhist monks. He/she also asked why victims haven't come forward in great numbers if it was indeed true that Buddhist monks abused kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it seems quite legit to post this submission now. I don't agree OP is shilling.

              Because the OPs whole purpose is to cast wide aspersions on all religions. In Morals and Dogma Albert Pike plainly states that their goal is to destroy all religions and create a one world religion. Every since I read that years ago I watch patterns in people when they post about religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              They mix truth in their posts but instead of pointing out that religions in and of themselves are not evil, but have been infiltrated intentionally. This serves their purpose of destroying all religions.
             </p>
             <p>
              This poster is too intelligent not to know that a small group of deviants has infiltrated religions and even mocks the idea. This poster is a saboteur.

                Thank you think...yes, the last thing in the world I would want is one religion.   Or one world government.  As I have pointed out hierarchy creates the conditions where this can happen which is why major religions with strong hierarchy are more often where this happens such as the Catholic Church, And any religion that is a state religion.  It happens whoever hierarchy is strong like politics, or the movie industry.  It is wrong wherever it happens, but denying it happens in religions while attacking it elsewhere just gives pefophiles a safe place to operate.

                They are sneaky. Poster also oy veys about ad hominem instead of admitting who the infiltrators of religion are. That means that poster is an infiltrator or not educated enough to stop helping the Luciferians.

                 That would betray the stealth mode of working toward a one world religion. Stealth one world religion works just like stealth one world government. It hides and infiltrates all institutions and organizations. This poster is creating the illusion that the problem is with religion itself, when the truth is that they have been infiltrated, and to ignore that is helping the enemy of humanity.

                   I understand but I think it works against us without pointing out the parasite that infects religion. The problem is not religion it is the parasite hidden within. Its ok if we disagree on that though. I enjoy your posts :)
