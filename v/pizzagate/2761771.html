<p>Was there fear that the FBI’s Jeffrey Wilson would Rat out others?</p>
<hr />
<p>One New York FBI source says there was. But that is no longer a concern because Wilson was found dead in a New York City hotel room Saturday, literally hours before he was scheduled to sign a plea deal.</p>
<hr />
<p>“There was fear of what he would testify to because he was a wildcard,” one FBI insider said. “The Bureau was trying to keep this entire case away from the media. It’s a mess.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Wilson worked computer crimes for the FBI in New York City. He may have known too much or was ready to trade some of that knowledge for a sweet plea deal.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wilson was facing two counts of child rape with force, and six counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 years old.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are two victims in this case, and the attacks allegedly occurred in Grafton, Massachusetts. The alleged attacks dated back to 1998 and continued to 2006.</p>
<hr />
<p>Court records indicate at the time of his arrest, Jeffrey Wilson was employed by the New York Office of the FBI working computer investigations.</p>
<hr />
<p>The New York FBI confirmed at the time of his death, Wilson was no longer working for them, but court records indicate, when the FBI was informed of the indictments against Wilson, the federal agency conducted its own investigation.</p>
<hr />
<p>But Wilson had worked out a very favorable plea deal in Massachusetts, Wilson would get a sentence of 18 months in the House of Correction plus probation, but he would not get a lengthy prison sentence.</p>
<hr />
<p>That deal had some brass in the FBI concerned, a source said.</p>
<hr />
<p>“When you see a deal like that the first thing that comes to mind is what is he (Wilson) is giving the prosecutors in return,” one FBI source said.</p>
<hr />
<p>Instead, Wilson was found dead in Queens, New York over the weekend. It is believed, rather than plead guilty in Worcester on Monday, Wilson killed himself Saturday night.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another hotel room “suicide.”</p>

                 I
                </em>
                might kill myself, and that's not even taking into account

            is another source on Ward's death, local Boston news station. Definitely suspicious, Ward's own lawyer said he had already cut a plea deal where he would only get 18 months. The fact that he worked in computer investigations in the NYC branch of the FBI definitely makes me think Anthony Weiner's laptop, obviously have no proof though. Worth also pointing out, that CDAN (Crazy Days and Nights), has released some "blind items" about two celebrities (mostly people speculate are Anthony Weiner and Jared Fogle), that are rumored to be angling for deals with the feds, where they would divulge info about other elite perpetrators in exchanged for reduced sentences.

            Three scenarios I can think of. Dead people tell no tales, unless they have backup files with multiple points of distribution. When will the recently dead ever learn?

             If he worked for the FBI, who could he trust to give backup files? Perhaps an anonymous website is out there to hold confessions in the event of sudden suicide or murder.
