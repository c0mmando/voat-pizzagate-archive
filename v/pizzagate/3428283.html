           <p>
            Firstly I just want to point out how young people and children do take their own lives. This can be due to bullying, relationship problems and yes even exam stress.
           </p>
           <p>
            What sets Mya-Lecia Naylor apart from most girls her age is she was a successful child star who had just appeared in a new tv series. Also having just appeared in The Witcher pilot her career showed signs of moving away from children's television. But really there was nothing at the point to suggest her acting career would not have continued in some form as she approached adulthood. So it begs the question, why did she feel like her entire future depended on her school exams?
           </p>
           <p>
            I read the news reports and quotes from her family and doctors. I found their explanations of what happened very strange. Her father said she wasn't a moody person but said on the morning of her death she ignored him when he said good morning. He says he didn't find this strange and thought nothing of it. How can he not have taken any notice when he's claimed she wasn't moody? Surely that would be unusual behaviour? But he dismisses it as nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also describes her suicide as accidental and a cry for attention rather than intentional. What I disagree with about this is such behaviour would be after an argument. A cry for attention would involve a suicide note or a threat to kill yourself. Some kind of cryptic message on social media. But Mya-Alecia did none of this. Her Dad makes it clear that the night before and the morning of her death, he didn't think anything of her mood or behaviour to set alarm bells off. Whatever was going on in her head she was keeping it to herself. She even waited for the morning when people are generally rushing around busy, she even waited for her Dad to go out on his run. So how can her death be unintentional when she has kept her thoughts to herself, gone somewhere unusual(the back garden) and chosen a time when she'd be least likely to be found?
           </p>
           <p>
            What sets people apart intent on ending their life with those who are just unhappy and stressed is that its always sudden and shocking. People who knew them can come up with reasons why they may have taken their life, but in general they will admit that it was out of the blue and that they had no idea the person was thinking of killing themselves. This to me describes Mya-Alecia Naylor. No indication in her social media, no huge emotional outbursts or threats to hurt herself. Just keeping everything inside.
           </p>
           <p>
            Going back to her acting career, its interesting to note that her first ever role was as a baby. This means acting was not necessarily her decision but something her parents put her into. Acting is not just performing. It's also means attending drama schools or clubs and attending auditions. Were these her decisions or was she pressured into it by her parents? As I said she was successful. She'd been the star of her own TV series and she'd been a regular in another show for 4 years. Clearly a popular and talented young actress who was in demand The Witcher pilot also proved she was being spotted by casting directors for adult television too.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Entered into the acting industry by her parents who may have also influenced her career as she grew up
           </p>
           <p>
            -No signs of being unhappy. Dad didn't think anything of her being quiet the morning of her death despite claiming she wasn't a moody person.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Had made no threats, left no messages or notes indicating she was about to kill herself
           </p>
           <p>
            -Made a deliberate effort(in my opinion) to avoid detection as she took her life
           </p>
           <p>
            -No matter how worried she may have been about her exams, she had a successful acting career
           </p>
           <p>
            -Because her parents had entered her into the acting world, it is extremely unlikely that they would have put any significant pressure on the importance of her grades. Its just not going to be something pushy fame hungry parents care about and her Dad even admits they told her it wasn't something she should get so worried about.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I put these points together, I don't see how they can come to the conclusion that nothing was wrong with her beyond general teenage stuff and that she didn't intend on ending life. I think they must be in denial because something had deeply affected this girl that is either being kept silent or that she had somehow kept to herself.

             Yo I think you actually just took a sardonic comic from the 70s way too literally and projected your own bias onto it. It's just being ridiculous about people who smoke marijuana being perceived as horrible people doing horrible things.

               Rereading the comic, I still think it was just being overly ridiculous to make a point, that point being that marijuana isn't as bad as alarmists at the time made it out to be.

                Potheads think everything is about pot. People that do not partake, could care less. Gilbert Shelton and co. were jews. Most underground comix were funded by the CIA. That's the facts Jackson!

            What the fuck? She worked with Tom Hanks, ergo that means he killed her? You’re either purposefully trying to discredit real researchers on this sub by drawing such a loose association, or you are not cut out for investigating. This type of nonsense detracts from the goal of catching these cabalists by distraction and disillusionment.

             No, I’m pointing out some odd relevant facts. I do NOT know if he was involved yet.

             The death itself IS rather suspiscious given what was known of her final hours.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been suspected that he was involved in the stuff regarding Issac Kappy.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has been also suspected of being part of the “red shoe club” along with being involved in Pedowood shit.
