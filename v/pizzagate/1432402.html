            Its all big Pandora's box of depravity fueled by their narcissistic personalities.  They feel special and want to feel exclusive from all other beings on this planet by thinking they can get away with this shit and do it and flaunt it in all our faces. Remember all pedos are sadists and from there you get SRA and cannibalism

            Here are some of the keywords to throw about if you want to DISCREDIT Pizzagate:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              "Illuminati"

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "Satanism"
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "Cannibalism"
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "Nazis"

           </ul>
           <p>
            And so on. You get the idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if cannibalism were taking place, why would you want to bring this prematurely? Why discredit something that could be true by making an allegation like this BEFORE any evidence for the allegation comes to light?

            I see some people are trying to avoid the occult/satanism angle, but it has been a part of pedophilia rings in the past if you look into it--and there are some strange things going on with this that point in that direction. Even the cannibalism angle is there. Look at Michael Aquino, founder of the Temple of Set and his intelligence background. Look at what happened at the Presidio while he lived there. Looking at the documentation on it, it's hard to see him as totally innocent in what happened.  I think the people running these shows at the top may be controlling those under them with the satanism angle, whether they believe it or not.  It could be a psyop and their way to manipulate others, along with the drugs, threat of blackmail, etc. Or, they may really believe it.  I've been watching a number of videos of these kids being interviewed who have escaped this kind of thing. And they all have the same story--even though their cases are separated by years and they take place in other countries. They all experienced very similar things, and they are horrific.  This one video was enlightening in that regard. I was especially interested in what they therapist had to say in Part 2, but both parts have information about what they do--the rape, drugs, impregnation of underage girls, and yes, even cannibalism...
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3kKRzp-awE">

            </a>
            Look into the Alisa and Gabriel Dearman scandal and how it's been silenced in the UK.  I can understand protecting the children, but what about the adults they've accused? What's happened to that case, too? It's really strange. Just the fact that the MSM is pushing back on this so hard points to something being there they don't want us see.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some of these people in these types of cults who actually believe raping children allows them to live longer, because they believe they're somehow ingesting the child's life force. Years ago, I worked with a woman whose husband helped bust one of these satanic rings because they were luring underage kids into the group with the promise of free drugs, and they were having sex with them. They also did sacrifice animals, drank their blood, etc. And in reference to the "spirit cooking" references, they did ingest their group leader's bodily fluids. It's part of the belief, and you sometimes see it in other folk magic. I think it would be a mistake to dismiss any of the occult clues, because I don't think these are pedophiles who dabble in the occult for shits and giggles. I think it's their darker occult beliefs that influence them to participate in the pedophilia. Don't forget what Larry Nichols has said Bill Clinton told him about Hillary. Or the fact that they went to Haiti and participated in a voodoo ceremony on their honeymoon. You don't just walk in off the street and participate. They had to be prepared, and I believe it was Bill Clinton who wrote about it. They participated with Max Beauvoir, Haiti's "Grand Houngan." Bill also talked about Hillary communing with Eleanor Roosevelt on a number of occasions. So the Clinton's do have a bent for that occult stuff.  There's a lot of strange twists to this.  I'm just not sure it's a child trafficking ring and nothing more. I think the occult angle could be the key to it. So let's not overlook any of the clues.

            "Even now you try to diminish it by saying there's no satanism/cannabilism in Pedowood" Once again, I never said there was no satanism/cannibalism involved. I said it shouldn't be the central area of focus and investigation since neither of those things are actually illegal. Mock parties, luciferian messaging, spirit cooking, weird artwork, etc etc also not illegal. The pedo/cp stuff is provable and illegal and, therefore, should be (in my opinion) the primary area of focus. If you're still having trouble understanding my point I'll refrain from insulting you back and I'll also leave you with the last word since I've made my point several times over. We disagree. Cheers and god speed. Let's get back to work!

            So what? Satanism is not illegal nor is having Satanic symbols in your logos. Abusing children is illegal which is why I think that should be the area of focus.
Edit: for clarity.

            It depends on the state they're convicted in:
            <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty">
             http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty
            </a>
            But one thing you need to understand about the death penalty is that it's hardly ever used because it's difficult to get a conviction when that's on the table. Too many people are upset by it. When someone has been convicted, it's an automatic 10 year wait so an appeal can be launched. From there, most are overturned and given life imprisonment instead. You can find all the information on it for the United States at

            Well if you look at the Dutroux dossier it's pretty off the charts what one of the seemingly credible witnesses said they were doing, like something out of an over the top horror movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I don't doubt at all that it's "worse" than sexual child abuse, at least with some individuals who are involved. It's entirely possible that there are plenty of murders happening since these kids are adopted from 3rd world countries and so they have no one to notice if they go missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The murders might be a means of minimizing risk -- you don't want a former victim coming forward years later. There might also be motivations around some kind of rituals which play a role within the social organization of these VIP pedo rings. And as far as that goes I would not be surprised to see some drinking of blood or cannibalism. The over the top aspect itself almost forms a veil of protection because it's so absurd no one believes it. So I was probably a little strong on poo pooing the cannibalism aspect in my comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's entirely possible that Steve Huffman is a cannibal, I have no idea, I just don't think OP's image means much. I saw elsewhere that FN invited spez and then left the sub, and he did it in protest of auto promotion.

            Hold on, friend. We're on the same side and I'm not trying shouting you or anyone down. My apologies if I did. Also, no need to call me ignorant. Here's are two reasons why I think the satanism/occult/cannibal angle should be a secondary or tertiary area of focus (notice I didn't say completely ignore it). First, we all know that the media runs on narratives. My opinion is that if we want maximum exposure on pizzagate, we should attempt to frame the narrative in a way that is of most benefit to us. My opinion is that the way to do that is to start with just one thing that people are "ready" to engage with: pedo/cp. Look at the pedo headlines that have grabbed national spotlight recently: Elijah Wood and Corey Feldman talking about pedo rings in Hollywood (no mention of satan/cannibalism). Second, we're dealing with circumstantial evidence at this point so we need to focus on finding something concrete. My opinion is that the most efficient use of resources to accomplish that goal is to focus on the areas where the investigation has had the most success so far: the emails, the pedo stuff.

            Fucking bingo! Thank you for posting exactly what I was thinking! Would the CEO of Reddit openly brag about being a cannibal if it weren't tongue-in-cheek? You'd have to believe he is retarded to think that is the case. But cannibalism being some sort of code word for something, now that just fits right into the spirit of our investigation doesn't it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Currently, there is nothing to suggest there is anything amiss about the cannibalism connection, as ridiculous and overt a display as it may be. If this is a topic the community feels deserves closer examination, then we're gonna have to either find direct circumstantial evidence of cannibalism or the more plausible idea of it being code for some other potentially nefarious deed.

             It might be just what it is--cannibalism. As disgusting as it is, there used to be a place in Canada that bought cadavers and sold and shipped human meat to people. It was one of those weird things the kids found online once and I looked into it after they told me. This was years ago--and I couldn't believe it, but it was true. We're talking like 15 years ago or so. The place did shut down. Probably because it's not good to eat dead people. I used to do research for a living--some of it was medical. And I remember people in New Guinea--actual cannibals--would sometimes die from ingesting human brains from people who suffered from prion disease. (Mad cow is a prion disease.) It's called Kuru disease. So there might be a sick sub-culture of cannibals--and most are probably purchasing the meat from cadavers somewhere. As a weird side note--there used to be talk that Idi Imin was a cannibal--this guy, if you're too young to know who he was--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin.  This was in the news years ago. I remember reading the story in a magazine. They claimed he was a cannibal and he had said humans taste like mutton. (This makes the gorge rise in my throat!) There might be people who just get off on the outlandishness of trying something so taboo. But I do think there is a cannibalistic element in real satanism, too. We know they do mock sacrifices to Moloch at Bohemian Grove. But they also do more than that. There is prostitution there, but there have also been stories that there is child abuse going on, too--like the Franklin Scandal/Johnny Gosch type of thing. The original Moloch was a Caananite god that they sacrificed children to:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch
             </a>
             (There are different spellings--I've seen Molech and some others, too.) Remember in one of the Clinton or Podesta emails someone mentions going in their backyard and sacrificing a chicken to Moloch. They also mention a rabbit's foot. Most people took it for a joke, but I had the feeling there was more to it. If you believe Larry Nichols story about Clinton--something he alleges Bill Clinton told him--there could be something more to the stories. My daughter and I have been doing some reading lately on the scientists that were brought to the U.S. during and after WWII from Japan and Nazi Germany. The Japanese were working on bioweapons and were brought here under Unit 731. But they also brought more Nazi doctors and scientists than just Project Paperclip. The Nazi's had done quite a bit of research on mind control and were especially effective with children. One of their ways of breaking down their personalities to prepare them for reprogramming was through sexual abuse. And like in the Franklin Scandal, if you listen to some of these people who claim to have been raised by these elite "Luciferians", they all talk about that aspect of their childhoods--how they witnessed children in cages, being abused in front of them to break them, etc. I don't know what to think about all of their claims, but I think there is something to it. And people tended to discount people like Ted Gunderson, but I'm listening to him a bit more closely now because of all this. I think we're getting a look at the tip of the iceberg. And people may not pay attention to it, just like they didn't to Ted Gunderson when he was alive. But I think there's more to it than people realized. I think it's better to keep looking at all the angles. The cannibalism, the satanism, etc. It looks to be related.

             There's something else that comes to mind that a friend told me when we were in high school. A former satanist had spoken at her church and one of the things she shared with me because it horrified her so much was that his pinky finger on his left hand was missing. He explained to them that when he became a leader of this group, they cut that part of his finger off and passed it around to everyone in the group to chew on until there was nothing left of it. There were S &amp; M elements in this stuff, too, there are sex acts performed in front of the group for certain rituals, etc. Some of this I learned years later from the husband of a friend who was in law enforcement. He had busted a group of satanists who were recruiting high school aged kids with free drugs. To some of these people, it's just amusement. But others actually believe what they're doing--that they're contacting Lucifer or satan, and invoking demons, etc. If you've ever read any of Malachi Martin's books, he spoke about a group that had infiltrated the Vatican. When I thought about it, it actually made sense that they would do something like that, as they use ritual elements of the Catholic faith and pervert them in some way. So I wouldn't discount any of the stories. There might be an element of truth in all of them. And there might be clues. I'd document everything you find out. You can discard what doesn't fit once you have all the clues and can put  it all together.

            Satanism does not involve hurting kids and animals. Any harm put towards a person is through ritual magic and not direct physical interaction with the intended target (unless you are defending yourself against an attacker)

            Not sure who posted the picture, but the title of the image mentions cannibalism, and spez is in the picture.  The whole #pizzagate thing has indications of more than just pedophilia, such as also killing babies, eating babies, drinking blood, etc.  If you go through the #pizzagate material you will see way too many coincidences to be called coincidences.  Just to go twitter.com, search for #pizzagate, and click "latest."

            Okay, stop with this cannibalism BS. And also, stop with the satanism. We have solid leads and circumstantial evidence on the pedo front. These two aspects of the investigation are red herrings. Even if they are true, it is a misuse of resources to dig into it. Yeah it grabs headlines but it sends this whole story into another realm of conspiracies that normies will quickly excuse as "tin foil hat" BS. Stay focused on the leads that actually have some legs.

             I agree 100% with you. This should be said anytime a post like this(and it seems like 90% of all posts now) somehow make it past the hard working mods. These disinformation freaks need to be called out. Any leads that don't stem from the polestar emails or demonstratedly proven to be worthy leads related to them are not pizzagate, and should be posted somewhere else(like
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pedogate">
              v/Pedogate
             </a>
             or something), or deleted. It seems like these disinfo pedos are hard at work on voat. Evil ultimately fails by its own design, so I'm not discouraged. Still, the research stems from polester emails and all evidence not tied to that and fantasy Reddit cannibal posts definitely do not belong here.

             These people are just disgusting. Of course put the effort into the pedo stuff but have a sub-folder - other sick stuff we think that makes these people even more despicable than the scope of the pedo investigation is showing.

             Also, does it really matter if they worship the devil? There's lots of Muslim and Jewish and Christian pedos as well. The only reason why someone would bring up the fact that they are Satanic worshipers is because it's shocking to some people and is good clickbait.

              Yes yes yes yes. Very good point. Satanism is not illegal. Actually, just googled it, and turns out cannibalism is not illegal either. The satanism/cannibalism part will send this into the clickbait realm very fast instead of legitimizing it. 
Edit: added in more info about legality of satanism/cannibalism

             Agreed 100%. The fact that this crap keeps getting posted by the same accounts in other threads where it's completely out of context should make everyone suspicious that this yet another attempt to discredit pizzagate and make everyone look like idiots.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you have
             <em>
              any
             </em>
             actual evidence of cannibalism then by all means, but with Spezgate going down and all the incoming attention on pizzagate this looks to me like a desperate effort to shitpost in order to scare away anyone who might have otherwise had an open mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been following pizzagate since day one and before pizzagate went down I was already well aware of the mountain of evidence regarding past VIP pedophile rings like the Franklin scandal, Dutroux affair, UK Parliament, Jimmy Savile, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate is new. Part of the process of investigating a conspiracy is making connections, even if a bit vague, and brainstorming until you can determine which connections are meaningless and which ones are significant. You're trying to get a bird's eye view and see if you can come up with a theory which actually makes sense and which can explain the evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             We aren't dealing with cannibals, we're dealing with pedophiles. There's an enormous historical precedent for VIP pedophile rings, and there's a clear explanation involving blackmail and the multi-billion dollar international child trafficking industry.
            </p>
            <p>
             If pedophiles are out there who aren't a part of government then we should assume there's some incidence of those within government. Those who are in government expose themselves to possible blackmail, and evidence of child sex abuse means they can be completely owned for life.
            </p>
            <p>
             The person or group, possibly as part of a blackmailing ring, who has the most damning evidence on the most influential people will emerge as the most powerful. Naturally they will use that power to begin promoting those with a proclivity for pedophilia. As the Franklin case clearly shows, elite parties happen where children are provided and influential people end up getting videotaped with hidden cameras. Just think about the level of power that gives the blackmailing ring. The blackmailees cannot say anything about it, so it creates a strong veil of secrecy whereby only those "in the know" can talk about it to one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once they know they are owned they indulge themselves continually, and the veil of secrecy and control, which extends across the three branches of government, media, big business which is connected to government, and any possible investigative bodies, render victims and those of us who understand what's happening powerless to prevent them from scuttling investigations and ordering endless media hatchet jobs on anyone trying to expose them.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for this post, I've never heard of any VIP cannibal rings. There is no historical precedent for this. Huffman being a cannibal for no reason and then posting about it on Reddit makes no sense. There's nothing here at all that suggests he's a cannibal or a pedophile for that matter. Trying sticking with the people we have actual evidence on rather than giving the Fake News Lamestream Media the "witch hunt" it wants so badly.

             For the sake of argument however, since we're forced to speculate about what happens at these parties, let's say there are instances of ritualistic murder combined with some minimal cannibalism. If it happens it's purely ritualistic and an outcome of the widespread pedophilia, it's not a motivating factor in VIP pedophile rings which causes them to form, and at this point there's nothing to actually indicate that these people are eating flesh, especially not from the dumbest pizzagate collage I've seen yet (and that's saying something).

            <p>
             Same goes for the occult. That's at least more relevant but you need to understand that this is not "satanism," it's a disgusting subculture which has risen up around the deeply embedded practice of pedophilia within the highest ranks of government power. They probably do have some rituals and other assorted weird shit, and they most likely get off on this all being an "open secret" which is "hidden in plain view" through all of the code talk and hints, but "satanism" is NOT the cause of VIP pedophile rings. The bizarre occult themes of sex and violence involving children are an outgrowth of their habitual pedophilic activities which have been festering in Washington DC and elsewhere for decades and beyond.

             Just like intelligence agencies seek to capture international black markets in narcotics trafficking (see Peter Dale Scott and Gary Webb, among others), they also seek to capture the multi-billion dollar global child trafficking industry as well as the international blackmailing market. As always the end game is power and the ability to beat out competing elites for maximum dominance.

             These are clear, rational explanations which don't require someone to go full tinfoil hat. This is the case that needs to be presented to the public.

              Agree that it all is important. But we need to be strategic about how we talk about it. Listen, this is on its way to the mainstream. Infowars/PrisonPlanet will do a segment on this soon. They're not super mainstream but like I said, it's on its way. My point is: the cannibalism and satanism aspects could be a millstone around its neck. Here's why: satanism is very weird but it is not illegal. Cannibalism is obviously super gross but it isn't illegal in the US (not really). They're shocking but they're misdirections. The pedo/cp stuff is much more valuable in terms of generating legal action against anyone AND it is also shocking. As this investigation becomes more widely known, there is an often-overlooked aspect of marketing this story to the general public. If you don't believe me, consider how John Oliver covered the Snowden revelations by talking about how the NSA would have access to your dick pics. Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras (who broke the Snowden revelations story) focused on the tech and obvious violations of rights but normies don't give a shit. But when you frame the issue in terms of something that is more easily accessible, people pay attention. We need to make this story as easy to digest as possible. People will spend time reading about a pedo investigation but when you add in the satanism/cannibalism, they'll throw their hands up and say "this is some crazy internet BS."

               And the idea that prosecuting or suing these people is going to go anywhere is laughable. Lawyers, judges, prosecutors, they are in it together. They're all the same group. You're expecting pedophile cannibal satanists to police themselves?

                Look at this morose motherfucker. Red herring and then concern trolling. So your line of reasoning is
                <em>
                 this is very hard and there are many powerful obstacles in our way so let's all stop
                </em>
                ? Bullshit. What did you think would be the endgame of the PizzaGate investigation? We all give each other high fives? Plus, all we have is circumstantial evidence. We need to focus on getting real proof and then we can start to worry about what to do with it.

            I'm here from the Donald. I saw this post there. I want to ask, is there any more proof that the elite politicians are pedophiles and not cannibals? In the emails they refer to have sex with kids as "having dinner". But what if they actually are having dinner, but eating humans instead.

            In the pic on the top right Steve even jokes that
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Business">
             /r/Business
            </a>
            that he did the AMA for has "similar" audiences to
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Cannibals">
             /r/Cannibals
            </a>
            so he must know something we dont.  How many people in top businesses are cannibals??  The Hampstead children mentioned "Mcdonalds, Starbucks, Pizza Express etc etc.
But I guess Steve's joke is a 5 year running one because thats how long he has been moderating the sub and it just keeps getting funnier...

            GUYS THIS IS THE KIND OF SHIT THAT IS DISCREDITING THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.  downvote this baseless drivel and let's stay focused.  Unless we're like 50% shills at this point, we should work as a community to do away with this kind of tangential bullshit.

            One Lounge, the restaurant in this photo

            Of all the places for a CEO for an online company to work, why would it be DC?

            Guys, there were two threads about this "rising" @
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/thedonald">
             /r/thedonald
            </a>
            . Within the scope of a few minutes they were both removed (from "rising", that is). Saw it with my own eyes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coverup confirmed. None of the general "I hate Spez he's such a fag" threads were dealt with similarly. We can assume that this means that we're really on to something.

             The snopes article says "false", but all it says is:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The man in the photographs is Chinese performance artist Zhu Yu, who staged a conceptual shock piece called "Eating People" at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. Maintaining that "No religion forbids cannibalism, nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people," Zhu Yu acted out a performance in which he appeared to eat a stillborn or aborted child (likely constructed by placing a doll's head on a duck's carcass) and said that he "took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             LIKELY?! It's only "likely" that an actual aborted fetus wasn't eaten, meaning they don't actually know for sure? What the fuck. This really confirms that Snopes is lazy bullshit info.

               The link sure as hell needs to be edited. That person took 5 words to say one word the whole way through. One of the most frustrating things I've ever read. It could easily be condensed.

            What the actual fuck. If this isn't a very weird in-joke (circumstances in general suggest that it isn't), it appears to be yet another case of sick fucks talking about and doing sick fuck things out in the open. Since the public is so fucking stupid and gullible anyway (the DNC leaks evince that this is how the elite middle management types view us) they might as well rub it in our faces.

            Anyone accusing these people of what they practically admit to will be barraged by "skeptics" and "debunkers" attempting to demonstrate how conspiracies (two or more people plotting in secrecy to achieve some end, typically a nefarious one) don't exist, or at the very least cannot be contained, because "someone would say something!" (never mind the fact that many, many people HAVE testified of all this shit, but they are systematically discredited
            <em>
             a priori
            </em>
            for espousing "conspiracy theories" or having "false memories" or whatever).

               that did not answer my question. I understand that Spez is cleary the mod of that subreddit. What I'm wondering is, is the subreddit itself a joke, or do the members there genuinely enjoy the consumption of human flesh? if so, as people here seem to be implying, how in God's name is that subreddit still in existence while

             Anyone else here who can't access those archive links in this thread? The captcha is expired and even if I get there I get an error as if the page doesn't exist. (Error 504 Website is offline. Gateway time-out on every archive.is link I click)
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: Added the Error-Code
