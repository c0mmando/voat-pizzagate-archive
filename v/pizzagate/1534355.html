            The most recent claims were in July 2016, where police allegedly found suspect material in a 'raid' - I personally think the people who tried to destroy him completely, sort of failed, and there are still people trying to cash in on his death / life. I think it's entirely possible law enforcement could have planted whatever they found, or others seeking to make a quick buck.
           </p>
           <p>
            I researched all other claims in great depth and it all seems like bs to me, and doesn't fit with his character. As far as I can see...

              Michael was abused himself just like so many hollywood kids. Their being abused is the price parents pay to get their kids to stardom. The hollywood paedos believe they own these kids because they 'make them'.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Look at this documentary (banned) as an example:
              <a href="https://youtu.be/z1ydixjtcAc?t=25m29s">
               https://youtu.be/z1ydixjtcAc?t=25m29s
              </a>
              - it starts at a location where a victim gives an account of how many paedos are in Hollywood
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Michael went to war with his owners - the record companies etc - including SONY - calling the CEO 'a devil' live on stage. He even disclosed details of him stalking his ex wife Mariah Carey and tapping her phone (she told Michael this herself)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Watch Michael with kids and fans. Compare his body language and theirs with someone like Joe Biden (Suspected Paedo / creep) - he is a very loving person and everyone is comfortable in his company.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Parents would often push their kids on Michael to extort money / favours from him.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Michael related to children more because he was denied a childhood by his abusive father. He was clearly very sensitive and felt hurt, cheated and betrayed by adults (his own words) - he said he was having the childhood denied to him.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Just some points..

            One of the most massive betrayals was the documentary filmed by Bashir - a UK Journalist, discussed here:

            Yeah, I did a pretty deep dive on this too and all the cases against MJ were highly suspect.  In fact there has been some evidence that MJ, after being abused himself as a child, was trying to prevent children from being abused by making Neverland ranch a safe haven for abused children.
