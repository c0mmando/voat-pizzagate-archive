A few years ago, a male escort was given a number to call. It was a local area code to that particular Florida city, but when the escort Googled the phone number it wasn’t associated with any person they could find. The male on the other end wanted the escort to come to a very exclusive resort in Boca Raton. It was not the first time a man had called from the resort looking for this particular escort. He was and is very very expensive. Very exclusive. When the escort arrived at the suite, he didn’t recognize the man (A list politician) or the name (fake) that was given either. Just another anonymous older white male with a wedding ring who wanted some same sex fun while out of town. This man didn’t want to touch or be touched by the escort. When the escort tried to give the man a hug when he walked in the door, he was pushed away. The client sat down on a sofa and directed the escort to a bed. Basically, the client wanted the escort to pleasure himself and the client just watched. At some point, the client did begin pleasuring himself too. Apparently the client finished fairly quickly and as soon as he did he told the escort to stop and to let himself out while the client went to the bathroom. The escort had no idea who the older man was until about nine months ago. Now he does. The whole world does.</p>

            This is such disinfo. The escort didn't pleasure himself. That's absurd. I know someone in Florida and they told me what really happened. The male escort was Russian and he gave the client a Golden Shower.

                Almost. But I was married to a woman who had which kind of explains how I was practically forced to watch all of them at gun point.

                Ever been married? If not don't be fooled by the sex in the beginning. That all goes away and pretty soon you have a constant debate in your mind about what would be worse, staying in the marriage or being confined to solitary confinement in a Federal Penitentiary "Super-Max" somewhere in Colorado.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not joking.

               <p>
                It's so fucking bad I want to start a 501c corporation to repeal Gay Marriage not because I'm opposed to the idea, no not at all. I want to start a 501c corporation to warn Gay People of the horrors that await them after entering into a marriage contract with another human being. I can almost guarantee it's about 1000x worse than any Homophobia they've ever experience.

                        Whatever. Some people are made for marriage. Unfortunately I wasn't one of them. It used to bother me but then I finally accepted it and let me tell you I've never been happier in my entire life.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I think it's like how someone who is gay and in the closet feels when they finally say you know what, fuck it. I'm gay. I'm here, I'm queer get used to it.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        But for me I was a "closeted loner" which meant I literally forced myself to stay out of closets. I'm laughing right now because that sounds so comical. Then one day I said "Fuck It. I'm a loner, I'm going into the closet.". Lol
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I've never looked back.
