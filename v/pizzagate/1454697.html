            here hope you can share this :)
           </p>

            Indeed the truth is really harsh, too raw, crazy in big time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth of this sick shadows that rule the world from high places are really scary in many ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sickness that they carry with and spread is a mix of greed, narcissism, pedophilia, maquiavelism, occultism and sadism. The fact that I show you this news is not to point my finger at you, but to give you the key.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that you can't see them doesn't mean that they don't exist. Another proof why God exists. He did warned us through His prophets, of the dark hand of the principalities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Helgerian dialect that guides the manipulation of the masses in an eternal conflict, In a continuous grinder of sufferance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet God also provide you the shield you need to be free. Remember that as they can take your life, they can shut your voice, they can torture you in their sadistic ways, we must not worry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because it is not the vessel that we need to be concerned of, but what the vessel carries. As long as you do not break that or let that go, the dark hand will not reach over you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that these are the beginning of the days of days. Everything starts to be revealed, you then decide, as it was meant by Yahweh. Freedom is in our reach as long as we reach out for our shield: Yeshua.
           </p>
           <p>
            People tell me, both close and not so much, that I should get out of this world of conspiracies that it is getting me crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then the definition of craziness is doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. So why do you keep sitting in their carnival horses game, expecting a different result?
           </p>
           <p>
            In time each one that rides and rides will fall, lost in their satanic occultism, because that is what they like to do: to play with your lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today new novelties come before the alternative media of a sadistic pedophile ring run by elites within the Washington DC area. In many different places that include connections to high politicians as John Podesta, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is it important for me to stay in this world of conspiracies?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because many of you decide not to look. Because I do care about you. Not about the world, because the world is not of God. But I do care about you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I care that you look for it not to change the way you find your lives to be, but to know about what surrounds them. Keep being yourselves, but know what is really netting your lives in a scary and horrific truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            That will help you set yourselves free.
           </p>
           <p>
            God bless.

             Hey I think I did the necessary corrections, but english is stil not my native language so I apologize for the errors. Thanks for the tip.

             To answer to your statement, well all this things must be revealed, and all the stuff that is happening must happen. This is not about changing the course of things but about to change your mind set. That will help you.

              There's so much information out there, it takes time for people to assimilate it. Crazy is a word that describes people who are unable to communicate what they know to be true.

               That is a really interesting way to see it, I like to say that convenience is that and crazy is the result of convenience but you sure made me smile with that comparison because it is logical in many levels keep exposing the ugly thruth out there, guys like me sure appreciate it.
