<p><strong>Headline:</strong> WikiLeaks: Clinton Foundation Staffer Gripes ‘Oxfam Screwed Us Publicly in Haiti’</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9588">An email released by WikiLeaks</a> reveals Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation’s director of foreign policy, trashing nonprofit charity organization Oxfam for being critical of the Clintons’ embattled charity after the anniversary of the deadly earthquake in Haiti.</p>
<p>More from Article: <strong>The bad blood between the Clinton Foundation and Oxfam began, apparently, after Oxfam International released a report that was strongly critical of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which was co-chaired by Bill Clinton</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So far, the Commission has failed to live up to its mandate,” the report of the Bill Clinton-led commission said. “Many Haitian officials still do not have the technical ability to lead projects, and almost no major reconstruction projects have started. The Commission is a key element for reconstruction and it must cut through the quagmire of indecision and delay.” Senior Clinton Foundation staffers coordinated with top Hillary Clinton State Department officials to give special treatment to people identified as “FOB” (friends of Bill Clinton) in the wake of the deadly 2010 earthquake in Haiti.</p>
<p>The former president of the Haitian Senate sharply criticized Hillary Clinton and her troubled charity following the release of the aforementioned “Friends of Bill Clinton” emails. “As my people were dying, Hillary was abusing her position as Secretary of State and prioritizing access to what the State Department viewed as a ‘gold rush’ for her wealthy donors in exchange for exorbitant speaking fees and large donations to the Clinton Foundation,” Sansaricq wrote.</p>

            they're being used as a distraction by the Democrats and the American and British media.

            The Democrats are also throwing Bill Clinton under the bus:

           <p>
            So the Clinton/House of Lords camp, both in the US and the UK, are throwing Oxfam under the bus. Why do you think it's only now, eight years after it happened that media reports are coming out?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like "
            <em>
             abandon ship, every man for himself
            </em>
            " and they are turning on each other like cornered rats.
           </p>
           <p>
            I myself think that this is a good sign, FWIW.

            Very interesting info, OP. I wondered why the British government was so quick in threatening Oxfam to cut their funds. This would explain it for sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other hand, this will get metooed and fire backwards. It's the best redpilling resource we could have hoped of. More and more people realize what charities did in Haiti, and are doing elsewhere, i.e. exploiting children for sex, it's not a far stretch now for many to believe that they are involved in trafficking as well. Save the Children (sponsored by Soros) is also in the news now, it has been on our watch list for human trafficking for a long time.

             The more focus on Haiti, the better. It's just a sample of what's been done around the world to women and children (and yes, grown men too) in places where humanitarianism is a front for human trafficking.

             The Clintons are gonna go down, but we all knew they wouldn't go down without a fight. There will lots of casualties in this war. But it's worth fighting regardless.

             Agree that it's a very good opportunity for redpilling.  I've been posting the Oxfam stories.  I'm hoping there's considerably more to come and they don't start shutting it down already.

            The bad blood created an opportunity perhaps for this particular dam to break.  There are already calls for investigations in other countries Chad and Algeria.

            The Charity Commission should be scrutinized, though the Guardian is saying their failures were due to underfunding:

             Agreed. Reminds me of the scene from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade under the streets of Rome with all those rats...light a single match and watch them scurry...gnawing and tearing at each other, climbing over one another just to get free...
