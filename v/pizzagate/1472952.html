            MSM has latched onto the part about Comet Ping Pong because that's the part that's dangerous to real, innocent people. I'm not defending MSM,  but analyzing it. If it weren't for the obsession over Comet Ping Pong, the media WOULDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT. That's why they aren't discussing anything else. That's why it took SO LONG to get any kind of coverage about anything. I 100% agree that the media is not investigating what needs to be investigated, but the Comet Ping Pong connection IS dangerous to the employees who work there, and their families. I've seen others who agree with me on this, it's not like I'm all out in left field thinking these people should be left alone. They don't deserve harassment.

            This is ridiculous. If all pieces of evidence were dismissed on the grounds that there is a danger of 'confirmation bias' no evidence could be found to support anything. Interestingly, much of the evidence relating to Pizzagate is dismissed out of hand, without even being evaluated, by those whose assumption is that there's nothing untoward going on. But there is too much evidence which indicates there is a great deal going on. Anyone who seeks to dismiss this evidence has clearly taken sides against the evidence in favour of the mere assumption that  there are rational, noncriminal explanations for the evidence - WITHOUT EVEN PROVIDING THEM.

             lol you can't prove a negative... What I mean by that is I CANNOT PROVE THERE IS
             <strong>
              NOT
             </strong>
             ILLICIT ACTIVITY at Comet Ping Pong. People don't seem to understand how PROOF and EVIDENCE actually work. You cannot prove a negative. Period. I don't know how many times I've got to remind people that you can't prove a negative. The example I've given time and time again is that
             <strong>
              I cannot prove that invisible pink flying elephants don't exist
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The burden of proof is always on the one making the claim, and at least one of the claims appears to be that  Comet Ping Pong is a central hub for child trafficking, which puts the burden of proof on those who make the claim.

            When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously though, the subject matter is so personal, so visceral, that it is nearly impossible to shake the confirmation bias out of any analytical evaluation.  As a parent, I cannot  even fathom the depths of horror which I think may currently exist - the movie Taken was a warm-up.
           </p>
           <p>
            But as someone with an analytical background, I can say that there is so much here, it is almost undeniable.  Yes, there are a shitton of holes.  But the preponderance of circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.  I've hit the point where I am starting to try and disprove everything.  Analysis of competing hypothesis an yet nothing makes sense other than the prevailing theory.

              Agreed.  When confronted with 5 possible outcomes in a minor situation, the outcome is always the 6th one you didn't consider.  LOL.

            This is where it's goin' down, Brother. That's why it's messy in here. We can't keep all the shills and crackpots out, so you just gotta deal. All the dead ends, bad ideas and weak links will wash away with time and we will be left with nuggets of gold.

            The fact that a known CTR shill ( r3d*) is sending investigators on a goose-chase next to a playground is troubling.

              Your record speaks for itself. I think serious Pizzagate researchers should henceforth refuse to take the bait from this character because his comments are just distractions designed to waste our time.

               I wish I had a job, that'd keep me occupied so I didn't have hours to spend every day looking at this stuff. I'm just as obsessed with it as everyone else here, but I'm trying to remain objective.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pizzagate is an interesting phenomenon. Both because of the implications of the criminal activity, and because of the effect it's having on the internet.
              </p>
              <p>
               So many people here think they know SO much... and just because I'm critical of a lot of it, while presenting my own "findings" when I do find them, I'm labelled a shill... That's fine. I'll take the criticism. Don't much care really. I will continue to try to encourage people to think critically, if that makes me a "shill" then so be it. Like I said, I don't care.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know where I'm at. and I voted for Trump, I can PROMISE you I'm not CTR. lol. This belief that everyone who questions things here is CTR is outrageous, but whatever... keep being narrow-minded.

            Showing up on board acting like you are 'down with the cause' to display concern to demotivate the actual activists.   Criticize while pretending to help.

            We ask 'why' and debunk MANY claims on here every day.    I can think of five right now that other sites allow without question:  Jimmy's name - it's an old family name and doesn't mean 'I love kids'; the Australian Rugby guy is different than the dude in the photo; the "I heard L'Enfant' refers to a cafe'; the 'basement claim' derived from Jimmy Comet referring to CPP having a basement when, in fact, it was a reference to the nearby Buck's basement (though CPP is listed as having 2 stories); and stories are debunked every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think also you need to realize "PIZZAGATE" now refers to the global corruption of the elites abusing and trafficking in children with impunity.  It's relevant if it's part of kids being endangered by scumbags.

            There's a little of that, and we do need more skepticism in certain respects, but for the most part people are just investigating potential leads.  The core evidence is strong enough on its own to show that pizzagate is real.  Why don't you go to the sticky post and try to argue that's all confirmation bias (it isn't).  I see in some of your other comments you talk as if you believe pizzagate is real, but in others you talk about "all this pizzagate stuff."

             I've got a great deal of cognitive dissonance with this whole thing. It's confusing.
The way I personally feel can best be summed up as saying the truth lies somewhere in the middle.

              It is challenging to separate out the disinformation, and be sure what exactly the truth is, but truth is truth.  It does not compromise.

              Confirmation bias = shills presume it to be false, so everything suspicious has to be fake or a joke.
