<p>This time I will be giving a short tutorial on how to track 501(c)(3) organizations (also known as Soros Mules (only in my head))</p>
<p>There is no one way to going about getting the EIN in the first place.  
</p>
<p>Generally <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/">https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/</a> is a good place to start.  It is a search tool that finds most organizations</p>
<p><em>(I haven\'t played with it enough to tell you if it finds all - although I\'m not finding &quot;feminist martial arts&quot; in there (maybe have the wrong name?) even if I do find &quot;feminist karate union&quot;)</em></p>
<p>You can generally also go to state web pages like <a href="http://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y">http://rct.doj.ca.gov/Verification/Web/Search.aspx?facility=Y</a> or search for state non profit registration.  Generally they have a search function (I think Utah was a pain and didn\'t give them out for free).</p>
<p>Once you\'ve located the EIN you can get their previous three 990 forms from foundation center </p>

<p><em>EIN 46-3408143 is for feminist frequency and I will be using it for further examples</em></p>
<p>Guild Star will also have reports and you can look them up by putting the EIN at the end of this <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/profile/">http://www.guidestar.org/profile/</a></p>
