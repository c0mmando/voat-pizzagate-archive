<blockquote>
<p>Amazing Polly\'s video starts with some clips of FBI Special Agent Greg Wing talking about the connection between Chicago and Hollywood in terms of prostitution and trafficking rings. Wing says that 80% of the business is now online. <em>\'People get out their smartphones and order victims\'</em>. Then she moves on to a Q post from April 20th 2018 about Allison Mack, the Standard Hotel and TOCK LLC:</p>

Tock has more than 2 million users signed up and says it has been utilized by more than 800 restaurants, wineries, and pop-ups, while its restaurant subscriber base has grown nearly 200 percent over the past year. </p>

<p>Amazing Polly wonders if something else can be ordered on TOCK\'s app...</p>
<p>Interesting because while doing some research for pizzagate, I recently came across an interview with Aby Rosen and wondered the same thing. Then there\'s a similar app for hotel rooms . .. </p>
<p>Standard Hotel parent company <strong>Standard International has a similar app for hotel rooms</strong>.  The Standard Hotel is unique in that one can rent a room for a few hours..: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2017/03/09/last-minute-hotel-deals/#6a4454583b9c">https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2017/03/09/last-minute-hotel-deals/#6a4454583b9c</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The night begins at 3pm.” At least that’s what One Night claims, their tagline directly supporting their model of only offering same-day bookings. The app’s beautifully image-driven interface and assortment of enticing luxury hotels bears a similar air to HotelTonight, though their offering of hotels is considerably more curated. What’s the reason for the stricter curation? One Night is operated by Standard International, the parent behind the trendy Standard Hotels, and their selection shows it. On top of all of the Standard properties, One Night has hand-selected other properties based on their approach to design and lifestyle experiences, resulting in user experience that’s deliberately limited yet highly appealing. If you like what you get at one One Night hotel - perhaps SIXTY SoHo, pictured above - you’ll probably like what you get from all of them. Though their properties are currently only available in Austin, LA, Miami and New York, One Night assures they’ll be adding more cities throughout the year. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One Night, a mobile app for same-day bookings at independent hotels, has raised $5 million in Series A funding. The app offers stays at more than 200 hotels in 15 U.S. cities, plus in London and Bangkok.</p>
<p>Swan and Legend, a venture capital firm, led the round.</p>
<p>This is the first external venture investment in the business. Hotel company Standard International incubated the business and provided the initial capital. Now Standard Hotels has spun off One Night, with Jimmy Suh, who is leading its operations as president.</p>
<p>By the end of 2019, the app aims to offer 300 properties in 30 cities. It intends “to launch a new distribution channel,” too, though it left details vague. The company competes with niche market leader Hotel Tonight, which offers more than 50,000 hotels worldwide in a booking window expanded beyond same-day reservations. <strong>Airbnb</strong> recently looked at buying Hotel Tonight, according to reports. </p>

<p>THE PHOENIX HOTEL - SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An article from Conde Nast <strong><a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-phoenix-hotel-might-just-make-san-francisco-a-hotel-city">The Phoenix Hotel Might Just Make San Francisco a Hotel City</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike many of Lambert’s past projects, the Phoenix did have a head start in the cool department. It opened as the Caravan Lodge, one of those very mid-century Americana motor court hotels, in 1956. Over the years, it became the place where every touring musician camped out when they were in town—the Great American Music Hall is around the corner and, maybe more importantly, it had the rare onsite parking lot big enough for a tour bus to park overnight. Everyone stayed, from David Bowie to Neil Young to Kurt Cobain, and everyone, it seems, has a pretty juicy—if not somewhat fuzzy—story about the place. In 1987, Chip Conley took over the hotel (it was the hospitality legend’s first property) and revived it as the Phoenix. Two decades later, sensing it was time for the Phoenix to, well, rise again, Conley reached out to Lambert, his friend and mentee (Lambert cold called Conley a decade ago when she was starting out in the business), and brought her and Bunkhouse onboard. </p>

<p><strong>Secrets Of The Phoenix, The TL’s Rock Star-Beloved Hotel - <a href="https://hoodline.com/2015/12/secrets-of-the-phoenix-the-tl-s-rock-star-beloved-hotel">https://hoodline.com/2015/12/secrets-of-the-phoenix-the-tl-s-rock-star-beloved-hotel</a></strong></p>
<p>Article mentions Pearl Jam stayed there as well..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been no overdoses or deaths at the hotel, but the Phoenix is still forever linked to the death of Kurt Cobain. Last spring, 20 years after his suicide, police released photos of a note that was in Cobain\'s pocket when he died. The note, mocking his wedding vows to Love, was written on Phoenix Hotel stationery. </p>
<p>Only two swimming pools in the United States are historic landmarks: the one at the Hollywood Roosevelt in Los Angeles and the Phoenix\'s. That\'s thanks to former mayor Willie Brown, Conley said. </p>

             The Phoenix Hotel Might Just Make San Francisco a Hotel City
            </a>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Unlike many of Lambert’s past projects, the Phoenix did have a head start in the cool department. It opened as the Caravan Lodge, one of those very mid-century Americana motor court hotels, in 1956. Over the years, it became the place where every touring musician camped out when they were in town—the Great American Music Hall is around the corner and, maybe more importantly, it had the rare onsite parking lot big enough for a tour bus to park overnight. Everyone stayed, from David Bowie to Neil Young to Kurt Cobain, and everyone, it seems, has a pretty juicy—if not somewhat fuzzy—story about the place. In 1987, Chip Conley took over the hotel (it was the hospitality legend’s first property) and revived it as the Phoenix. Two decades later, sensing it was time for the Phoenix to, well, rise again, Conley reached out to Lambert, his friend and mentee (Lambert cold called Conley a decade ago when she was starting out in the business), and brought her and Bunkhouse onboard.

           Article mentions Pearl Jam stayed there as well..

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            There have been no overdoses or deaths at the hotel, but the Phoenix is still forever linked to the death of Kurt Cobain. Last spring, 20 years after his suicide, police released photos of a note that was in Cobain's pocket when he died. The note, mocking his wedding vows to Love, was written on Phoenix Hotel stationery.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only two swimming pools in the United States are historic landmarks: the one at the Hollywood Roosevelt in Los Angeles and the Phoenix's. That's thanks to former mayor Willie Brown, Conley said.

             <p>
              The project is extremely complex and involves the installation of additional floors, a whole new core extending over 12 storeys down to basement -3 and a new swimming pool at roof level. The existing steel frame is also complex with many transfer structures supporting the upper level frames in a number of locations. These transfer structures had to be justified for the significant increases in load.
             </p>
             <p>
              The proposed Northern Line expansion is to run under the existing building directly under the new core. This has led to a raft solution being developed for the new foundation and required extensive discussions and approvals with both the Bank Station Upgrade team and the TfL Asset Protection team.

             The initial concept is created by Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia. They launch the website. To raise money, they sell cereal boxes for Barack Obama and John McCain, candidates for the 2008 United States presidential election. Airbnb becomes part of the Winter 2009 Y Combinator class. The business grows steadily. Brian Chesky moves out of his own apartment to live off Airbnb for three months. In November 2010, Airbnb raises $7.2 million in venture funding. On June 1, 2016, Chesky joined Warren Buffett and Bill Gates' 'The Giving Pledge', a select group of billionaires who have committed to give the majority of their wealth away.[23] He described some of his motivation: "With this pledge, I want to help more kids realize the kind of journey I have had. I want to show them that their dreams are not bounded by what they can see in front of them. Their limits are not so limited. Walt Disney once said, “If you can dream it, you can do it.” I would like to help them dream.”[24]

             In May 2017, Gebbia launched a modular office furniture business called Neighborhood. The furniture was created for Bernhardt Design, a furniture company that has worked with emerging designers.[16] By 1981, in order to diversify the product offering, Bernhardt began sourcing globally and now has offices in four Asian countries, staffed with 50 employees to ensure the quality for which Bernhardt is known. However, the company still has a significant manufacturing operation in western North Carolina, with 12 facilities and 1500 employees.

             Google, Inc. has a server farm, or "data center", located in Lenoir.[14] There was controversy over the nature, amount, and potential benefits of economic development incentives that the City of Lenoir, Caldwell County, and the State of North Carolina gave Google in 2007 to induce the company to build the server farm.[15][16] The less celebrated benefits of the investment have been construction employment and spending, a small-time server farm investment just outside downtown, Dacentec, as well as local charitable and educational endeavors by Google.

               Not going to answer all of these. I do like search engines though so have searched up some of your questions, for hobby maybe. So the chick from true blood is a rothschild under the new bauer new roth name, right?  And it seems youre sayin her brother (haven't found direct evdience of that tho), sister in law, and niece have a lot of pol power in anrea, which they do, which also has big deal with foxcoon, which is an indeed sketchy AF operation since no one's even sure wtf they going to do there, which  you seem to say is about a scaleable model concerning smart ccities and community policing. Sort of a technological communis doomscape of internel simulation. Other questions. Rockeffelers did the MoM embassy thing, right. Lots of acquifers in Wisconsin? Strangite stuff has to do with an offshoot of mormonism following JS's death. They were into some Ilumaniti lit scene and did have thet island. Emanuel bros seem a lot like podesta bros... Any way, I'll answer more., but and, no offense, personally think the socractic form is overated these days.

               Awfully hard to find out where ley lines (high high energy grid around the world) are actually located. Cathedrals and military installations are often placed on cross roads ..I think the reason it is  so hard to find out where they are is that the elites like to use them for their own purposes...Minot ND where our nukes are kept is on a cross road. Would bet Laurel Canyon in California is too. Seems like the dark ones are better acquainted with.them than us commoners....and the Catholics like to place their cathedrals on them. Dr. Joseph Farrell says that organ music played in them affects entire areas . ..

                 Would bet there are some serious ley lines in Lenoir NC...a citizen journalist I trust, Sylvia Germack, who used to write with Wayne Madsen, said that there is a corridor in mid state NC to eastern Tenn.....high high pedaphile areas. Several big pharm HQs in mid state along with big universities , mental hospitals and prisons to experiment with the drugs.NC is also not noted to have a lot of KKK...well kept secret that they had the most of any state in the country at one time. Ft Brag NC, and Duke University have been mentioned as training for MKultra.

             Airbnb and POLARIS (creator of the National Human Trafficking Hotline) have teamed up to fight against traffickers before they turn rentals into "pop-up brothels". Uh Oh.....
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Airbnb exclusively told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that it has teamed up with anti-trafficking charity Polaris to train its employees, develop new systems and work with the police to spot signs of slavery and prevent people from being trafficked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well what have we already surmised about POLARIS ?
            </p>

             <li>
              <p>
               has Palantir and CIA connections
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               operates the National Human Trafficking  hotline which is NOT a government agency
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               uses Salesforce to analyze their data (Salesforce = CIA)
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In early 2013, Polaris Project and Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children worked with leaders in the cloud computing industry to develop an SMS-based hotline for victims and survivors of human trafficking and at-risk populations. Communications developer Twilio provided the BeFree texting short code and technology to deliver the text messages, which are integrated into Polaris’s national hotline database, powered by Salesforce.com.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Polaris started its text hotline in March, through a philanthropic partnership with San Francisco-based cloud company Twilio, which powers text and voice customer service communications for clients such as Uber, Hulu, eHarmony and CocaCola.
            </p>
            <p>
             Match.com pairs potential lovebirds without revealing phone numbers, Airbnb sends rental notifications and the American Red Cross deploys volunteers, all through Twilio. ING, the European banking giant, recently announced it was yanking out 17 hardware and software systems across its global call centers and replacing all of it with Twilio. Its largest customer, WhatsApp, uses Twilio to verify customer accounts and logins.

               Pretty awesome tie in and the entire thread is very good workable research. From the outset it looks like a jumbled mass of confusion but can only necessarily be deciphered by those quite familiar with pizzagate.  I am no Q expert and have intentionally tried to divorce myself from giving the movement too much attention but it seems as though it was Entylawyer that had brought attention to the Standard Hotels and Q was riding off the coattails of that story there and from research here, or am I confused as to the timeline of events?
              </p>
              <p>
               The Entylawyer blind suggested that whoever was able to access the Hollywood Standard they would have to have a very long key pass code that they would still have to present to a receptionist, this process certainly looks like a streamlined evolution of trafficking allowing select users of the application to bypass any human scrutiny whatsoever. There are tons of implications for this research.

               I think it is also in the Manson record that one of the victims had called Esalen right around the murder time, perhaps it was determined to be Sharon or Folger?  I believe it may have been a call made from the Tate house phone.  This is just in my memory, so I don't have a link.
