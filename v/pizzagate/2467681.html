            My take on Craig Sawyer is that he is legit. Early on (about a year ago, maybe a little longer), we had many investigators branch out from sites like Voat into their own venues -- Disobedient Media, Pettibone, PizzagateGear for example -- who were then attacked ruthlessly by people (who I independently documented as disinfo shills) when they monetized their YouTube channels, asked for Patreon donations, or whatever. The smearing involved blatant lies mixed with truth, and happened in an organized manner to multiple people who were good researchers. There were also a couple of cases (pizzagate.com as an example) that were just reposting other people's research in an attempt to profit from it financially. Pizzagate.com tried to sell his domain name for some ridiculous amount, which he then lowered several times. Weirdly, he was only called out by legit users, not the shills smearing researchers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Craig Sawyer was hit by the smear trolls pretty hard (just look on SearchVote.co). Our mod
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Honeybee_">
             @Honeybee_
            </a>
            *who I don't think was a mod yet at that time) reached out to him for some explanations to get questions answered about his motives for the many followers of her YouTube channel. At first he got pissed he was being attacked and smeared and if I remember correctly, rudely blew her off. But they communicated more and ultimately I think she decided he was legit. I personally felt he was helping the cause and often retweet him on Twitter. He retweets our stuff from time to time as well, if I drop it as a reply to once of his tweets.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I recall correctly, we've had the Getty stuff pushed really hard here using several different alts at the same time ignoring our submission rules. That tactic usually screams "shill" (though of course it could be from a newly redpilled friendly person who is reacting emotionally). The more wild claims about the Getty strike me as disinfo designed to camouflage real shenanigans there using art as cover for CP. Someone should go back through our archives and try to sort everything that's been posted out.

            Personally, I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's done things that clearly put him in the camp of wanting to end child trafficking, but then there are other actions he takes make me question him. In terms of the example you gave, I don't think doubting the Getty story would influence me, though. There is a difference between a theory and actual fact. In the case of pizzagate, we do have evidence. Santa gave us those emails as an early Christmas present. In terms of Getty? Lots of smoke with no gun.
           </p>
           <p>
            CS might just be an individual who draws his own conclusion and doesn't freakin' care if he pleases everyone. Maybe that's not his mission. And he could be using child trafficking as the vehicle to make a name for himself and/or gain credibility. All of that is all right with me. We're all here for our own reasons, and as long as he's doing good in putting some pedos behind bars, it's fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm with you. CS is a shadowy figure, but I've got to be fair in not coming to premature conclusions. I doubt in his previous career that he went on conjecture. So it could be he's following the same MO in getting involved.
