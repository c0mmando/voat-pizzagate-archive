<p>As a new arrival, you are encouraged to form your own opinion.  Do not accept anyone’s explanation of anything ”lock, stock and barrel.”  Use your critical thinking skills to discern facts from fiction, truth from lies, and yes, even good from evil. </p>
<p>When you begin your investigative journey, you will travel down many internet paths.  Some of these paths will have already been travelled; some will not.  You must document your journey to preserve it for evidence.  (See below for some easy ways to preserve evidence. There are many ways to do this, but this is just a quick start.) </p>
<p>Many of you have made it to this destination because you have heard about pizzagate or f@k3 newz.
HRC has talked about it.  The p0pe has compared it to sh*t. 0Bommer has talked about it.  CPP guy has talked about it.<br />
Now, you make your own decision about it!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Everybody is represented here.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  The average guy. The players and perpetrators. The past victims.  Various religious beliefs. The Really Bad Guys.  And the Really Good Guys.  Unfortunately, somebody is cl3aning up loose ends on the internet.  So preserve your journey. </p>
<p>Don’t report the first thing you find.  Instead, realize that if you found it on the first day, that road has already been travelled.  Instead, find a person or business that people have been trying to connect to another specific group, and do your research on that path.  (search voat for specific topics of interests.)</p>
<p>Use Wiki to start.  Find trade journals that may have reported on some of the specific persons you are looking for.  Archive every link you find.  Even if you don’t see its significance now. Save it, just in case. </p>
<p>Record your journey in a text program (word, notepad, etc) for easier retrieval later. </p>
<p>Report your findings.  Like a real journalist should.  State the facts, include the archived links to back up your statement.  Use headlines to communicate accurate information in a short space.  Avoid inflammatory headlines.
WRONG WAY:  BREAKING!!! Person ZZBD is the mastermind behind ABCX.  Proof Here.
BETTER WAY:  Ronna Robo from CompanyHGF linked to CEO Pearson Otho through Haiti Project Blah Blah and/or CompanyWTR.</p>
<p>Use keywords in your title to help other researchers use your information and duplicate your trail.  
</p>
<p>Note: Certain sites will flag keywords, so sometimes being a little obtuse when sharing your information makes it more difficult for (ro)bots to forward your stuff to the unsavory characters for cleanup. </p>

<p>(previously  posted)
For those who are lurking, but don’t know how to help, your time has come.<br />
Your mission is to preserve potential online evidence. 
This will be done with archive.is.  (There are other archiving sites as well, but this is the one I use.) </p>
<p>Why is archiving important? Because TPTB are changing/removing online evidence.  As soon as someone publicly points it out, complicit media makes it disappear. We have all seen posts referencing Archive.is.  But a lot of us diggers are limited to only mobile devices (I am one of those), or we just don’t understand how it works in general or what the purpose is.</p>
<p>FOR EVERY RESEARCHER: 
It is important to Archive.is your link before publicly posting it.  Otherwise it is like the fish that got away; no proof except your words.  Best Practice is to practically archive.is every source you come across.</p>
<p>Technical Quick Start Guide to using Archive.is <br />
Open a browser tab.
Navigate to the www.archive.is website on a browser tab. (You will keep coming back and forth to this tab.  It is the machine that feeds your page into the archive.is library. Make it a favorite in your browser.)
Open a second browser tab (to search with). Search your keyword and go to webpage. Copy the web addresses.
Flip over to the archive.is tab.  Paste the web address here.  Save/Search. It may require a few clicks, depending on whether it has been archived before.<br />
{If someone could do a short tutorial on Archive.is for Dummies, that would be great!)
Now flip back to your search tab, and go back down your rabbit hole!</p>
<p>Maintaining a Running Record
It would be helpful to the investigation to maintain a bread crumb trail for the rabbit hole you are digging in.  That way, once you come upon a big connection that hasn’t been mentioned, you can copy and paste your trail of preserved evidence!  
</p>
<p>If you want to maintain a running record, copy the key info (such as headlines or paragraph containing info) and paste into Word, and then also obtain the Archive.is web address.  NOTE: Short and long archive.is web addresses can be found under the Share option</p>
<p>Once you understand how to use Archive.is, you can let your interest guide you from here.  There are two ways that I have approached the process, using Wikis and MSM/News Media sites.</p>
<p>Wiki: 
Select a wiki entry.<br />
Look for interesting connections and key information.
Follow the links down the Wiki rabbit hole.<br />
Stop at each destination and Archive.is it.<br />
Copy/Paste bread crumb path (archive.is link) into Word or other local software.
.  
</p>
<p>News Media:
Find any interesting new media story, video or photo.<br />
Follow the webpage’s algorithm on suggested stories.<br />
Archive each story as you go (sometimes I don’t even read them).
Copy/Paste bread crumb path (archive.is link) into Word or other local software.</p>
<p>We can use these type of comparisons to prove MSM is covering up and spewing pr0paganda. The general masses of sheeple need woken up to the sleazy media tactics that can be objectively seen.</p>',

            Thank you so much all.  Do we need to check on the later DCleaks (and maybe Guccifer ones) if they are DKIM verified?  At one time, people said DCleaks had possibly been compromised.

            Thank you for your post! It is very helpful! I am one of those people who have no skills... What I do have is a body and a voice! I am ready to take a sick day and stand outside my local TV station and demonstrate for honest reporting and justice for trafficked children! Why can't we organize a national day of disgust with our government and our media! If Anonymous can organize a Million Mask March, can't we organize a million voices for truth?

             It's not a national problem, it is a cultural one. The trick is to take the battle to the places we have a strategic advantage. Problem solving, language, and empathy work for us, top-down hierarchies not so much.

            Also we need to shine more light on DCleaks and Guccifer Leaks to expand the scope of investigation beyond wikileaks. Would be great if newcomers look deeper into those.

            Thank you so much for this! It's a good start for people confused as to what they should be doing. I've seen a lot of people grasping at straws here, desperate to prove their opinions instead of digging for facts (of which there are a lot).

            And please learn the difference between solid connetions and specious ones, and evaluate each post for these before upvoting. There are far too many of the latter being declared as genuine leads or breakthroughs and upvoted, when the original poster actually provides no evidence that genuinely backs up the connection they claim to have found.
