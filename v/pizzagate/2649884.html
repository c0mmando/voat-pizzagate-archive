<p>&quot;Would you believe me? Eminem, Kanye... fuck it. Even Paul. Someone come out and say something. The visions are KILLING me.
And NO, I am NOT saying Eminem and Kanye &quot;raped&quot; me. I\'m saying they were there, at Record Plant, in my defense. And again, I\'m dealing with 2 years of horrible visions, without being in tangible communication with my two witnesses. However, there is Big Sean. So... Em, Ye, and Sean know. Wait... Em, Ye, Sean, Rih (SiMarshall), Jazzy, KERI HILSON, and....You know what... blow me... I\'m snitching. Em, save your breath.</p>

<p>........everything is a blur, but faces and recent comments only confirm. And don\'t let me find out Matt Michelson did some wack sh1t, AFTER some wack sh1t happened. The only reason why I even agreed to work with Matt Michelson is because I was under the impression he was Eminem, since people in Hollywood supernaturally can transform. Eminem has been able to transform into very public (VERY public and HIGHLY controversial) figures, so it only made sense to me he would have a different identity when handling a situation as delicate as ...most popular urban music acts assaulting 3 of music\'s most INFLUENTIAL artists. And my fear is there are more names. All of them meaningless, none of them untouchable. Bitch, I\'m untouchable. I\'m being real, no secret society can do me worse than I\'m doing myself right now. Because I\'m putting something VERY personal online. 
Now. With me saying Eminem and Kanye West came to my aide as I was passed out in a studio across the street from an Illuminati initiation spot (of which I did not EVER willingly enter, because I have no interest in being a part of any secret society), take a listen to &quot;Recovery&quot; and Kanye\'s last few weeks of music. Why the F<em>CK would Ye be appalled? And what did Eminem mean with the line, &quot;I\'ll be damned if another rapper gets in my ass!&quot;? Was it the same as &quot;I\'m rollin with a swollen bowling ball in a bag. You need a *** to come and tear a new hole in my ass.&quot;? I told a few people a few years ago something happened. No one believed (publicly), so I let it all fester. Not so much now. Ever wonder where Songha, Chris, Dino, Alysse and J. Cole came from? Birth, muthaf</em>cka. And Jiovine (a) had nothing to do with it and (b) is strangely quiet as of late. I\'m laying next to YOU ALL\'s favorite producer in hip-hop, and y\'all think she\'s a dude. I might make out with her to further ruin the stigma of females being belittled in hip-hop. Lyte knows too. This is the blog entry to set some fires among you assholes. And Briana was NOT an agent. I said about 90%. So y\'all n1ggas sayin y\'all comin thru? Y\'all got the 10%. Hitch kisses, b1tches. Remember? Hitch said you go in 90% and the women come in with 10% Right.</p>
<p>Peace.&quot; </p>
<p>For those that may not have truly understood what Charles Hamilton has said, I will give you a brief summary of what you just read. First thing that needs to be acknowledged are the &quot;visions&quot; Charles has claimed to have been having. Most satanic ritual abuse victims &quot;black out&quot; most of there gruesome experiences only to be remembered later in their tapped subconscious. I believe that Charles is only talking from what he can remember. Another important thing to note is that he said he has been troubled with these &quot;visions&quot; for 2 years, that would place the time of the incident back in 2008, which was the start of his career. Probably the most shocking of this blog confessional is all the name dropping. As he listed much of whom we already knew were involved with the occult, one name is actually the most important: &quot;Lyte knows too.&quot; He is referring to his older cousin, female rap legend, MC Lyte.​</p>

<p>What most do not know about MC Lyte as that she too was (and probably still is) involved with the occult. Here is the cover from her 1996 album As Bad As I Wanna B:</p>

Note: Roc-a-fella symbol was not even in existence at this time</p>
<p>​
I believe that MC Lyte may even had some involvement in introducing young Charles to the underworld of the industry. The real question to all this, however, is simply &quot;is it all true?&quot; We\'ll one thing is for certain, I do not believe Charles Hamilton is trying to do this as some sort of publicity stunt. If you simply listen to some of his past records, you\'d know that he was dealing with some type of possession and it was affecting him deeply for quite some time. For example, listen to his song &quot;Reminder&quot; from his shelved debut album This Perfect Life:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFzYznaJQj4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFzYznaJQj4</a></p>
<p>Angels on my side/ Demons in my eyes/ screaming through my rhymes/ breathing in my mind/ keeping me awake/ sleepy all the time/ weakened by the lies/ evil intertwined with the people in my life/ leaving me to find/ a piece of peace of mind/ But frequently I cry, PLEASE JUST LET ME DIE&quot;</p>
<p>Charles Hamilton is not the only music artist that has claimed of sexual occult abuse from other artists. Raz-B of 2000\'s teen sensation B2K has recently came out to the public about the molestation and rape that he suffered from music manageer Chris Stokes and R &amp; B singer Marques Houston as a teen.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Notice that Raz-B said that his former group member Omarion is defending Marques Houston, saying that Raz-B was crazy and bipolar (sound like a few other people we know?) which explains these outlandish allegations. Omarion, however, has had his share of occult allegations himself.</p>
<p>Note: from Omarion\'s video &quot;Ice Box&quot;, Baphomet on his jacket</p>
<p>​
To add insult to Charles Hamilton\'s injury, after having his album shelved, he took a short hiatus from his imprisoned music scene. During his period of silence, rumors started floating around that he would return rapping as a transgender under the alias &quot;Lady Doom&quot; (picture below released and shortly removed by Charles Hamilton):</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>​
It seemed as if the occult was trying to push some sort of homosexual/gender confusion agenda through Charles Hamilton\'s rap persona. They even made him record music under this ego as well. Here is a very disturbing song called &quot;I\'m Allison (Lady Doom)&quot; with Charles Hamilton\'s best friend Corbys explaining the whole situation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls_1hkp1CY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ls_1hkp1CY</a></p>
<p>&quot;This video explains everything that happened to Charles Hamilton by the agents of the Illuminati inside the music industry. They have had Charles Hamilton under there [sic] control for his whole career, and when he didn\'t want to do what they said, they abused him, destroyed his mind, and made him record hours of useless mixtapes. In May, he escaped from them temporarily and took a bus from L.A to Harlem, and stayed at my studio, where he told his story to me and all my ******, in the form of a diary, songs and conversations we all had with him, and as he prepared to expose the people who abused him, he was kidnapped by them on 125th st and locked in a psych ward, until they transfered him to an Illuminati detention center in Long Island where he\'s been since, strapped up to a wheelchair with pink nail polish on. Since Charles couldn\'t expose his abusers, I will. We must save Charles, and all backpack tight jean wearing chain belt having rappers like him, from the clutches of devil worshiping soul stealing Sonic touching industry people. You fuckers are sick. Sonic hold your head, the truth will be revealed.&quot;</p>

            For those that may not have truly understood what Charles Hamilton has said, I will give you a brief summary of what you just read. First thing that needs to be acknowledged are the "visions" Charles has claimed to have been having. Most satanic ritual abuse victims "black out" most of there gruesome experiences only to be remembered later in their tapped subconscious. I believe that Charles is only talking from what he can remember. Another important thing to note is that he said he has been troubled with these "visions" for 2 years, that would place the time of the incident back in 2008, which was the start of his career. Probably the most shocking of this blog confessional is all the name dropping. As he listed much of whom we already knew were involved with the occult, one name is actually the most important: "Lyte knows too." He is referring to his older cousin, female rap legend, MC Lyte.​

            What most do not know about MC Lyte as that she too was (and probably still is) involved with the occult. Here is the cover from her 1996 album As Bad As I Wanna B:

I believe that MC Lyte may even had some involvement in introducing young Charles to the underworld of the industry. The real question to all this, however, is simply "is it all true?" We'll one thing is for certain, I do not believe Charles Hamilton is trying to do this as some sort of publicity stunt. If you simply listen to some of his past records, you'd know that he was dealing with some type of possession and it was affecting him deeply for quite some time. For example, listen to his song "Reminder" from his shelved debut album This Perfect Life:

            Charles Hamilton is not the only music artist that has claimed of sexual occult abuse from other artists. Raz-B of 2000's teen sensation B2K has recently came out to the public about the molestation and rape that he suffered from music manageer Chris Stokes and R &amp; B singer Marques Houston as a teen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice that Raz-B said that his former group member Omarion is defending Marques Houston, saying that Raz-B was crazy and bipolar (sound like a few other people we know?) which explains these outlandish allegations. Omarion, however, has had his share of occult allegations himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: from Omarion's video "Ice Box", Baphomet on his jacket
​
To add insult to Charles Hamilton's injury, after having his album shelved, he took a short hiatus from his imprisoned music scene. During his period of silence, rumors started floating around that he would return rapping as a transgender under the alias "Lady Doom" (picture below released and shortly removed by Charles Hamilton):
​
It seemed as if the occult was trying to push some sort of homosexual/gender confusion agenda through Charles Hamilton's rap persona. They even made him record music under this ego as well. Here is a very disturbing song called "I'm Allison (Lady Doom)" with Charles Hamilton's best friend Corbys explaining the whole situation:
           </p>

           <p>
            "This video explains everything that happened to Charles Hamilton by the agents of the Illuminati inside the music industry. They have had Charles Hamilton under there [sic] control for his whole career, and when he didn't want to do what they said, they abused him, destroyed his mind, and made him record hours of useless mixtapes. In May, he escaped from them temporarily and took a bus from L.A to Harlem, and stayed at my studio, where he told his story to me and all my ******, in the form of a diary, songs and conversations we all had with him, and as he prepared to expose the people who abused him, he was kidnapped by them on 125th st and locked in a psych ward, until they transfered him to an Illuminati detention center in Long Island where he's been since, strapped up to a wheelchair with pink nail polish on. Since Charles couldn't expose his abusers, I will. We must save Charles, and all backpack tight jean wearing chain belt having rappers like him, from the clutches of devil worshiping soul stealing Sonic touching industry people. You fuckers are sick. Sonic hold your head, the truth will be revealed."

            interesting anonymous letter....
           </p>
           <p>
            few tidbits of letter.....
           </p>
           <p>
            He explained that the companies we work for had invested millions into the building of privately owned prisons and that our positions of influence in the music industry would actually impact the profitability of these investments
           </p>
           <p>
            someone asked what these prisons were and what any of this had to do with us. We were told that these prisons were built by privately owned companies who received funding from the government based on the number of inmates.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more inmates, the more money the government would pay these prisons. It was also made clear to us that since these prisons are privately owned, as they become publicly traded, we’d be able to buy shares.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of us were taken back by this. Again, a couple of people asked what this had to do with us
           </p>
           <p>
            Our job would be to help make this happen by marketing music which promotes criminal behavior, rap being the music of choice. He assured us that this would be a great situation for us because rap music was becoming an increasingly profitable market for our companies, and as employee, we’d also be able to buy personal stocks in these prisons
           </p>
           <p>
            My daze was interrupted when someone shouted, “Is this a f****** joke?” At this point things became chaotic. Two of the men who were part of the “unfamiliar” group grabbed the man who shouted out and attempted to remove him from the house. A few of us, myself included, tried to intervene. One of them pulled out a gun and we all backed off. They separated us from the crowd and all four of us were escorted outside. My industry colleague who had opened the meeting earlier hurried out to meet us and reminded us that we had signed agreement and would suffer the consequences of speaking about this publicly or even with those who attended the meeting. I asked him why he was involved with something this corrupt and he replied that it was bigger than the music business and nothing we’d want to challenge without risking consequences. We all protested and as he walked back into the house I remember word for word the last thing he said, “It’s out of my hands now. Remember you signed an agreement.” He then closed the door behind him.

            Murder Inc Records
           </p>
           <p>
            After helping Def Jam with the success of DMX &amp; Ja Rule, Russell Simmons gave Irv Gotti his own label under Def Jam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Murder Inc. spent 2005 and parts of 2006 searching for distribution. Lorenzo first went to his friend Lyor Cohen at the Warner Bros.. Cohen offered a deal that would make Gotti the head of not only Murder Inc., but also Atlantic. In the deal it involved them buying Murder Inc. and Gotti getting paid the same as he did at Def Jam. The Inc. then ended talks with Warner as Gotti felt they would not get paid enough money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gotti had short talks with Capitol Records and Interscope. It was beginning to seem as if they were going to sign with Atlantic, then Universal offered Gotti a 7-year deal and 50% ownership of his materials and the label along with the job as A&amp;R which pays a large amount of money. A portion of the deal was financed by National Talent Agency out of Southern California.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Inc. would sign on to Universal (like Def Jam, a division of Universal) in early 2006 and began recording music. Soon after settling in at Universal,

             I will try to find the source of the charles hamilton blog post, but he has since revamped his blog. I've been into this for almost a decade now and never seen anyone mentioned his story, so I figured I'd post it (had to dig through old hip hop forums to find it).

             He was pretty public about this when he "morphed" into his Sonic/SEGA persona. More arbitrary info surrounding this can be found here from when it was being posted:

            His "visions" could have been induced by a method of slow dosing lsd to him, without his knowledge or consent. Lacing food/drinks, things he will touch, lsd can be used on colognes even, etc. As a liquid, it can be placed on anything around someone. Seeding his mind with words and ideas. Drinking and any drugs involved while partying. Add lack of sleep. Someone or something will awaken you after 2-3 hours, so your mind doesn't get rest.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this combined will induce hallucinations and is old MK methods to induce schizophrenia.

            Pimp C was killed quickly after going public stating many rappers in the industry doing get shit behind closed doors - Tupac dropped a buncha names on his last LP, Makavelli (right before being killed)... Sean "Puffy" Combs is a HUGE player in the rap game and suspected to be a huge industry gayboy - guarantee he's played his part in a lot of this weirdo hollywood stuff

             First thing that needs to be acknowledged are the "visions" Charles has claimed to have been having. Most satanic ritual abuse victims "black out" most of there gruesome experiences only to be remembered later in their tapped subconscious. I believe that Charles is only talking from what he can remember.

             recently posted a link to a New Zealand victim's account that talks about this.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Justin Davis
             </strong>
             wrote extensively about Pedogate drugs in a 58 page document, mentioning chloral hydrate which I just noticed is in MK Ultra literature.  He discussed manufacture, labs, dentists, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately I haven't read it, I just skimmed it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe people can generate some leads from it, in New Zealand, or generalized to other locations.
