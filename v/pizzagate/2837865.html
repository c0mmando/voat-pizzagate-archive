<p>Sharon Evans, who also runs the charity Dot Com, told John Nicolson the child abuse inquiry was all about controlling information, and she fears the Grenfell Tower inquiry will proceed along the same lines.</p>
<p>Evans was a senior figure and a public face at the inception of the inquiry, which was set up in 2015 following the Jimmy Savile paedophilia scandal while May was still home secretary.</p>
<p>She told John Nicolson that she soon began to harbour concerns about how the inquiry was being run, and these concerns prompted her to suggest to her fellow panellists that they write to Theresa May.</p>
<p>She continued: &quot;I was taken to one side and it was made clear to me, I was told that Theresa May was going to be the Prime Minister, this inquiry was going to be part of this, and that if I didn\'t toe the line and do I was told, if I tried to get information out, I would be discredited by her advisors.&quot;</p>
<p>She went on to allege that this warning was issued by the inquiry\'s QC, Ben Emmerson, who served as a go-between between May and the inquiry team.</p>
<p>Evans also claimed that, when talking to the Home Affairs Select Committee, she was given a 23-page document of what she should say and told then-chair Keith Vaz &quot;I fear that I may not be able to tell the truth because I have been told what I may and may not say.&quot; </p>
<p>Although Evans and her colleagues were promised the inquiry would be independent, she told John &quot;there was no independence&quot; and the confidentiality clause imposed on all panel members facilitated the &quot;suppression&quot; of the truth.</p>
<p>When asked who wanted to suppress the information, she said &quot;my belief is that it was the Home Office.&quot;</p>
<p>Grenfell, she continued, looks like it will be &quot;exactly the same... I want to try to stop them going down the same road, where they are controlled and information is suppressed. When there is an inquiry they can gather all the information and then they can choose what is released. That is what I think is extremely dangerous.&quot;</p>
<p>An IICSA spokesperson said: &quot;We are not aware of any such conversation. </p>
<p>&quot;As we noted yesterday, this Inquiry was established in March 2015. It is a statutory inquiry and our independence is underpinned by the Inquiries Act 2005. This is different from the previous non-statutory </p>
<p>Typical  that these fuckers can censor  everything. 
So basically  this woman  was put on the board and then told stfu or you will discredit everything if you tell truth.
In the US there is loads of leads on the filthy pedo elite but here in the UK its apparently  theres none nothing to see here.
What i mean by that is the uk scummy establishment have got everything  covered,  no leaks , no nothing.
I know and can research  us pedo lines but uk is a dead end, apart from rumors  and heresay,
Makes me sick nobody  covers  the  UK,  oh wait we try but they have it well covered.

            Sussex: Fifteen children among 21 people found in refrigerated truck
           </p>

             https://menafn.com/1097671547/Sussex-Fifteen-children-among-21-people-found-in-refrigerated-truck
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In a shocking discovery, British authorities have found 21 people, including fifteen children, some as young as 12, inside a refrigerated lorry entering the UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            The discovery was made by the Border Force at the port of Newhaven in Sussex, and the group was concealed among a load of sparkling water.
           </p>
           <p>
            The group is believed to have come from Vietnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Details about the shocking discovery
           </p>
           <p>
            The discovery was made when the Border Force stopped the lorry's arrival from Dieppe in France.
           </p>
           <p>
            After they were discovered, the group said that they were from Vietnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fifteen children, who did not require medical assistance, were transferred to the care of social services.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two of the adults were deported from the UK, and the rest are in immigration detention centres.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their cases are being assessed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Romanian driver of the lorry has been charged     Suspect
           </p>
           <p>
            Not much else is known about the incident as preliminary reports are still coming in.
           </p>
           <p>
            The BBC has reported that a criminal investigation into the incident is already underway, and a Romanian man, Andrut Mihai Duma, believed to be the driver of the lorry carrying human cargo, has been charged with assisting unlawful entry to the UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is in custody, awaiting a court hearing.

            I have found another article about Trafficking of Vietnamese Children and possibly this is one reason they are brought here.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://asiancorrespondent.com/2017/03/vietnamese-gangs-using-teenagers-slaves-uk-cannabis-farms/">
             https://asiancorrespondent.com/2017/03/vietnamese-gangs-using-teenagers-slaves-uk-cannabis-farms/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            VIETNAMESE gangs, who have long controlled the UK’s market in cannabis production, are using teenage slaves from Vietnam to tend their illegal crops.
           </p>
           <p>
            Human rights and anti-trafficking organisations are calling on authorities to tackle these illegal operations and crack down on drug gangs believed to be committing human rights abuses and profiting from slave labour.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the UK, “cannabis farms” are usually relatively small operations, often located in inner city houses, which have been stripped and fitted with ventilation, lighting and watering systems.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their only access to the outside word comes through food deliveries and gardening instructions sent by the drug gangs.
           </p>
           <p>
            A typical cannabis farm contains around 1,000 plants and generates profits of up to £500,000 (US$622,000) for the gangsters each year, such as the cannabis farm in Plymouth, which had been tended by Vietnamese “gardener” Van Nguyen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Demand for cannabis across the UK remains high with an over two million people using it each year. Casual users are unlikely to be punished with anything more than a fine if they are caught with small quantities of the drug.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some fat cat elites are surely profiting from this cannabis business and it's not in their dna to put a stop to it, nor the trafficking of Vietnamese Child Slaves.   All the govt. needs to do to stop this trafficking is shut down those farms.  End of Story.

             Shut down those farms?  If you know how to spot them, a casual drive around most inner cities in the U.K. from North to South can reveal the sheer number of ganja farms and in some housing estates it can be one in every two houses  Some more organised than others.  Back in the day when we had a police force, some of the bigger farms would be raided and in many instances they were being tended by young Vietnamese and Korean illegals. But within days the operation would be set up elsewhere and business continues as before.  Now we have had police funding cut to the bone and you’re lucky if you can even get police attendance, even to some of the more serious crimes or emergencies.  In this
climate he ganja trade grows daily and they operate with virtual impunity.  120 knife homicides in London since Jan 1 and increasing reports of current or historical sex abuses has the police force fully occupied right now.

              Wow.  That's really sad.  We of course know how bad the rapes are and abuse from all the posts here.  Our police forces here are slowly being taken over as well, but not quite that bad.  The situation sounds horrible and now I am afraid that when we get to the point where all of our states legalize it, that we will have the same problem.  Bringing the trafficked here to tend to fields.  I hope not.  I feel for you and the situation But the young children, that is the worst part of it.  Surely the police and govt. are part of it.  Beyond sad and disgusting.

               It baffles me that the public aren’t taking to the streets about what this government has done to the Police and National Health Service (not to mention education) and they reformed the welfare system which is leaving families and individuals without money for as long as three months; food banks cannot keep up with the demand.  Food banks, in  21st century ‘modern’ Britain is a disgrace to start with.  People are commuting suicide because of the pain and desperation they are causing. Bastards.  They’re working to a ‘plan’ of their own, methinks.  But then I remember; these people despise us.
