<p>While I knew the information about having leverage and Sanders having an agreement was important, I had no idea how important! Turns out that Sanders’ criticism of Killary’s wealth was a HUGE deal. So much so, it pulled a big dog into the fight! What big dog? None other than Lynn Forester de Rothschild herself. She wrote an email of her own, championing her little wittle maligned Killary. The original email Reynolds sent is dated May 26, 2015, and Puppet Master Rothschild’s (hereinafter referred to as PM Rothschild) is dated May 28, 2015. The exact same issue Is being addressed so there’s no doubt that the same incident provoked both and that this is the classic tale of the snowball rolling down a mountain causing an avalanche: </p>

<p>Subject: FW: POLITICO Playbook </p>
<p>Morning, </p>
<p>I am sure you are working on this, but clearly, the opposition is trying to undercut Hillary’s reputation for honesty (the number one characteristic people look for in a President according to most polls)…..and also to benefit from an attack on wealth that Dems did the most to start……I am sure we need to fight back against both of these attacks. </p>
<p>Xoxo </p>
<p>Lynn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PM Rothschild herself addressing the attacks on Killary\'s reputation? What reputation? The one where political enemies wind up dead? Or the one where she “allegedly” spirits kids off the streets of Haiti never to be seen again? It’s not mentioned, but what is mentioned is that the PM is out of sorts over the accusation of “wealth” and finds it troubling. She further points a sharpened painted talon at the Dems for starting the ball rolling. </p>
<p>But what about The Cannibal Queen? How did HRC take Sanders’ jabs? Well, MSN helps us out by publishing an excerpt from her book, “What <s>the Fuck </s>Happened?” </p>
<blockquote>

<p>&quot;When I finally challenged Bernie during a debate to name a single time I changed a position or a vote because of a financial contribution, he couldn\'t come up with anything,&quot; Clinton wrote. &quot;Nonetheless, his attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump\'s \'Crooked Hillary\' campaign.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently, she’s still pissed. REALLY pissed, but let’s get back to PM Rothschild’s email. The memo is addressed to Nick Merrill. So who the hell is he? Well, it’s another meteoric rise story – much like Cinderella. In rags one moment, and marrying the prince and living in the castle the next. Don’t know how many of these we’ve run across as concerns the dems. And you know the promotion isn’t merited. These scumsuckers are nothing but assholes who deserve jail time, but instead they zoom up the chain of command into high-powered positions. Ed Buck was a civilian who followed that pattern. So is the “Sleep Your Way to the Top by Bedding Willie Brown” Kamala Harris. But here’s a little something on Nick who somehow started as a staff worker and ended up as HRC’s campaign press secretary? WHAT? Yes, but first let me perform due diligence in providing a reliable source that proves Nick was a nothing burger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/gallery/2016/07/2016-hillary-clinton-campaign-entourage-advisors-aides-photo-gallery-huma-abedin-nick-merrill-palmieri-robby-mook-john-podesta-000647?slide=0">http://www.politico.com/magazine/gallery/2016/07/2016-hillary-clinton-campaign-entourage-advisors-aides-photo-gallery-huma-abedin-nick-merrill-palmieri-robby-mook-john-podesta-000647?slide=0</a></p>
<p>The affable traveling press secretary joined Clinton world as a lowly advance staffer on the 2008 campaign, gained Clinton’s trust at the State Department and was one of a few staffers who remained with her between Foggy Bottom and the 2016 campaign, serving as a one-man press team in her personal office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, we all know how that happens … we start our new job flipping burgers and the next day we’re sitting with Warren Buffet on a divan in the master’s chambers. But about Nick, here’s a REALLY interesting article about the Timeline of those HRC emails (note him holding the purple umbrella – this will come into play in another post I’m working on – or supposed to be working on): </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thompsontimeline.com/tag/nick-merrill/">http://www.thompsontimeline.com/tag/nick-merrill/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the above link ties in perfectly with what the subject of PM Rothschild’s email:. POLITICO Playbook. Keep your eye on the moving ball and do not let it out of your sight. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>January 13, 2015: Clinton’s press secretary has “teed-up stories” for a New York Times reporter before and she has “never disappointed.”<br />
Nick Merrill, Clinton’s campaign press secretary, writes an email memo to Clinton’s other core staffers (including John Podesta and Robby Mook) who are developing a strategy that is described as being “designed to plant stories on Clinton’s decision-making process about whether to run for president.”
The email names Maggie Haberman who at the time writes for Politico, but will switch to covering the election for the New York Times one month later. Merrill writes, “We have ha[d] a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. … [F]or this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.” … </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s what PM Rothschild was <s>sticking her nose into </s>… er, I mean, inquiring about. They were losing their stooge/parrot at Politico and looking to replace her with another stooge/parrot, but this brouhaha about Sanders interrupted discussing solutions to the problem of Haberman leaving.  
</p>
<p>But what about the Cannibal Queen? Take a look at a recent Politico article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/07/hillary-clinton-book-bernie-sanders-democrats-215584">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/07/hillary-clinton-book-bernie-sanders-democrats-215584</a></p>
<p>Hillary’s Message To Dems: Don’t Give Bernie The Keys 
Her new book relaunches the Democratic civil war of 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what’s Bernie saying? </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/bernie-sanders-responds-to-hillary-clinton-book-criticism-stop-%E2%80%98arguing-about-2016%E2%80%99/ar-AAru2M1">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/bernie-sanders-responds-to-hillary-clinton-book-criticism-stop-%E2%80%98arguing-about-2016%E2%80%99/ar-AAru2M1</a></p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes, Sanders responded to a section of Clinton’s book that references, of all things, the film There’s Something About Mary. 
“A deranged hitchhiker says he’s come up with a brilliant plan. Instead of the famous ‘eight-minute abs’ exercise routine, he’s going to market ‘seven-minute abs.’ It’s the same, just quicker,” Clinton writes of the movie. “Then the driver, played by Ben Stiller, says, ‘Well, why not six-minute abs?’ That’s what it was like in policy debates with Bernie. We would propose a bold infrastructure investment plan or an ambitious new apprenticeship program for young people, and then Bernie would announce basically the same thing, but bigger.” 
“Does anybody really believe that?” Sanders asked of the notion that he “stole” Clinton’s best ideas. “The truth is, and the real story is, that the ideas we brought forth in that campaign, which were so crazy and so radical, have increasingly become mainstream.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Huma Abedin got that quote from Killary. It was an excerpt from her book, but the dynamic has changed and Sanders is not backing down.. It means there’s a new “agreement” and HRC is not liking it one bit. The Puppet Masters are seeing Sanders’ popularity as something they can use in 2020 and Killary is going ballistic. </p>
<p>As for this “leverage”, like West Virginia, there is an opioid crisis. It’s what happens when you have <s>Dim</s> I mean, Dem leadership. </p>

<p>And I had to include this one. This idiot in New Hampshire wants to solve the opioid crisis by not using the word “addict” and instead call it: SUD. That’s person with a substance use disorder”. Yup, normalizing addiction by calling it SUD will help a lot! </p>

<p>As for the leverage, this scandal has the right timing. It\'s an essay on gang raping women. Note the date: May 31, 2015. Was this leak partial payback for insulting Killary? I don’t think it was THE leverage, maybe a hint at what they had onhim? Like I said, the timing is extremely suspicious and this certainly is lurid and out of keeping with his squeaky clean image. It had him backpedaling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2015/05/31/bernie-sanders-new-claim-about-his-gang-rape-essay-and-fifty-shades-of-grey/">http://www.theblaze.com/news/2015/05/31/bernie-sanders-new-claim-about-his-gang-rape-essay-and-fifty-shades-of-grey/</a></p>
<p>The Vermont senator — who’s running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination — has come under fire for an essay he wrote in which he claimed that women fantasize about being gang-raped.
On “Meet the Press” Sunday, he compared his very old essay to a very new literary phenomenon.
“This is a piece of fiction that I wrote in 1972, I think,” Sanders said. “That was 43 years ago. It was very poorly written and if you read it, what it was dealing with was gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive, you know, something like ‘Fifty Shades of Grey.\'”</p>

Well, it’s another meteoric rise story – much like Cinderella. In rags one moment, and marrying the prince and living in the castle the next. Don’t know how many of these we’ve run across as concerns the dems. And you know the promotion isn’t merited. These scumsuckers are nothing but assholes who deserve jail time, but instead they zoom up the chain of command into high-powered positions. Ed Buck was a civilian who followed that pattern. So is the “Sleep Your Way to the Top by Bedding Willie Brown” Kamala Harris. But here’s a little something on Nick who somehow started as a staff worker and ended up as HRC’s campaign press secretary? WHAT? Yes, but first let me perform due diligence in providing a reliable source that proves Nick was a nothing burger:

            The affable traveling press secretary joined Clinton world as a lowly advance staffer on the 2008 campaign, gained Clinton’s trust at the State Department and was one of a few staffers who remained with her between Foggy Bottom and the 2016 campaign, serving as a one-man press team in her personal office.

           Hey, we all know how that happens … we start our new job flipping burgers and the next day we’re sitting with Warren Buffet on a divan in the master’s chambers.

            January 13, 2015: Clinton’s press secretary has “teed-up stories” for a New York Times reporter before and she has “never disappointed.”
            <br/>
            Nick Merrill, Clinton’s campaign press secretary, writes an email memo to Clinton’s other core staffers (including John Podesta and Robby Mook) who are developing a strategy that is described as being “designed to plant stories on Clinton’s decision-making process about whether to run for president.”
The email names Maggie Haberman who at the time writes for Politico, but will switch to covering the election for the New York Times one month later. Merrill writes, “We have ha[d] a very good relationship with Maggie Haberman of Politico over the last year. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. … [F]or this we think we can achieve our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.” …

            Earlier in the evening, on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes, Sanders responded to a section of Clinton’s book that references, of all things, the film There’s Something About Mary. 
“A deranged hitchhiker says he’s come up with a brilliant plan. Instead of the famous ‘eight-minute abs’ exercise routine, he’s going to market ‘seven-minute abs.’ It’s the same, just quicker,” Clinton writes of the movie. “Then the driver, played by Ben Stiller, says, ‘Well, why not six-minute abs?’ That’s what it was like in policy debates with Bernie. We would propose a bold infrastructure investment plan or an ambitious new apprenticeship program for young people, and then Bernie would announce basically the same thing, but bigger.” 
“Does anybody really believe that?” Sanders asked of the notion that he “stole” Clinton’s best ideas. “The truth is, and the real story is, that the ideas we brought forth in that campaign, which were so crazy and so radical, have increasingly become mainstream.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So Huma Abedin got that quote from Killary. It was an excerpt from her book, but the dynamic has changed and Sanders is not backing down.. It means there’s a new “agreement” and HRC is not liking it one bit. The Puppet Masters are seeing Sanders’ popularity as something they can use in 2020 and Killary is going ballistic.

           As for this “leverage”, like West Virginia, there is an opioid crisis. It’s what happens when you have

           And I had to include this one. This idiot in New Hampshire wants to solve the opioid crisis by not using the word “addict” and instead call it: SUD. That’s person with a substance use disorder”. Yup, normalizing addiction by calling it SUD will help a lot!

           As for the leverage, this scandal has the right timing. It's an essay on gang raping women. Note the date: May 31, 2015. Was this leak partial payback for insulting Killary? I don’t think it was THE leverage, maybe a hint at what they had onhim? Like I said, the timing is extremely suspicious and this certainly is lurid and out of keeping with his squeaky clean image. It had him backpedaling.

            The Vermont senator — who’s running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination — has come under fire for an essay he wrote in which he claimed that women fantasize about being gang-raped.
On “Meet the Press” Sunday, he compared his very old essay to a very new literary phenomenon.
“This is a piece of fiction that I wrote in 1972, I think,” Sanders said. “That was 43 years ago. It was very poorly written and if you read it, what it was dealing with was gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive, you know, something like ‘Fifty Shades of Grey.'”

            We Searched Hillary’s Emails &amp; Her Relationship With Rothschild/Rockefeller is Now on Full Display
           </p>
           <p>
            an excerpt:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Buried in thousands of the former Secretary of State’s emails sent via her personal server, are intimations of her close relationship with the infamous Rothschild banking family and hints for a potential Rockefeller-State partnership.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lynn Forester de Rothschild wrote an email on April 18, 2010, in which she tells Hillary she would “love to catch up” — and “I remain your loyal adoring pal.” Clinton responds “let’s make that happen,” and signs her response, “Much love, H.”
            </p>
            <p>
             On September 23, 2010, Clinton emailed Lynn Forester de Rothschild (an email chain marked by heavy redaction) saying, “I was trying to reach you to tell you and Teddy that I asked Tony Blair to go to Israel as part of our full court press on keeping the Middle East negotiations going …”
            </p>
            <p>
             Rothschild responds, thanking Clinton for “personally reaching out to us,” and adds, “You are the best, and we remain your biggest fans.”

             I admit I never even tried. The closest thing to dirt is the spirit cooking and pics of their parties.

             When someone is that far up the food chain I tend to think it's really difficult to find things out, but I hope someone proves me wrong.

             TOP HILLARY AID suggested this? Please get informed about propaganda, I actually delved into the science and it was facinating. I know you mean well but this is propaganda. Zero hedge lets you decide so they are sliding in articles. Learn about propaganda it can really help you weed fast and get to the nugget of real news and you will really be informed then. Hey , have a good day.

            Bernie was controlled opposition who was bribed into shilling for bill's wife. So that in turn drove some Bernie bros into voting for Trump, who is also a Rothschild controlled opposition puppet.

           <p>
            They used it in 2016. Since all political candidates are selected, they simply had a little fun and had one of their puppets (Bernie) gather support against their other puppet (Killary) so that they could bolster yet another puppet (Trump). There's got to be a connection between Lynn Forester de Rothschild and Donald Trump somewhere.

            OMG, you are tireless. Upvoat and badger crown to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            So am I getting this straight?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is that H is (was) being crucified on the issues: specifically here: ill-begotten wealth; but also I remember allegations of favoritism to the elite, private v. public positions, Goldman Sachs speech money, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            What they dug up on Sanders was a 40 year old fictitious rape fantasy that never actually involved real people (or any actual allegations) and no accusations of pedo activity except him saying that if children are free to grow up without body shame while young they might not end up sexual deviants or something like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Could he have put that shit out there to blend in/join the club enough to be tolerated, knowing the kind of people he was dealing with in Washington? ie, you don' have to Brownstone me, see, I wrote this sick story!)
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that he is still out there, although he "capitulated" makes me think that there isn't any more on Sanders but that he was threatened with physical or financial harm. I think if they could have, they would have destroyed him completely but yet there is still talk of him running again. Compared to how easily they have taken down so many others this "leverage" isn't seeming very significant.  So far (Jane's college deal aside) there no sex victims that have come forward and there is no apparent body count.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess I'm saying that I'm not 100% on Sanders being a pedo, but I am also wondering what caused him to fold and support HRC so easily.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am curious to see what you are finding on Nick Merrill.

             Sanders is a creep, a commie and has an obsession with underage sex and how it is being persecuted. Fuck Sanders. He swallowed the sword, so to speak, because he is blackmailed. If not, he is just part of the storyline. He is not an outsider and hid his backers and never revealed them during the campaign. Clintons and Bush families are trash of the century, but Bernied is a creepy loner loser. This is what the owners of the central banks put on the ballot for us to fight over. Did I forget to say Fuck Bernie? Fuck creepy zionist war monger hypocrite Bernie.

             Yeah, Nick I haven't started digging yet. Cheryl Mills also. They're two quirky players in this drama.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Bernie, my take is that they never used the leverage. It's still out there. However, the Puppet Masters are testing to see if he's a viable candidate and that's setting Killary off. She can't use the leverage. She'd be going against the chain of command if she did.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe the essay was brought up to embarrass him and force him to do damage control which he did. I believe it was also hinting at something darker as is Killary quoting the serial killer in Something About Mary.
            </p>
            <p>
             No, they have the goods on this guy, but he's: (1) popular; and (2) has an uber loyal constituency. It's something Killary never had so there's deep-seated jealousy also. Killary can't run again and it would freak her out if Sanders was the candidate. And "the keys" remark is telling. It's a coded message no doubt.

              I'm not sure they'll stick with Bernie. His popularity is waning it seems. Most can't wrap their heads around his decisions over the past 10 months. I was all in on Bernie and stopped to reconsider as soon as he was going  around stumping for Killary. And I seem to remember him sporting a bruise or black eye shortly after Seth's death. - Anyway, I have a feeling Hillary is definitely responding to being cast aside. Great work by OP. Good read here.

               Thanks so much for the good words and opinions. Both are much appreciated.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'll be interested to see where this goes.

               Course my favorite theory is this: that the Repubs give so much pushback and grief to Trump that he runs on the Democratic ticket in 2020 and wins as a Dem!

                My guess is the Dems will run your favorite slut....Kamala Harris.  She was on MSNBC just yesterday in a pre-taped interview with one of their anchors,,,,,Ari ????.  It showed her to be quite engaging and caring and tough and fun and of course, down-to-earth, and you know, just the perfect person to run against Trump.   I think you had her number perfectly in the post you did about her.

                 True, but my guess is she'll be caught up in one of the numerous scandals that will be hitting Cali. Ed Buck is just the start. Once these arrests start coming, she better watch her skanky ass. And remember, her skanky sister was at the DNC to convince people that those Cannibal Elite care about minorities which everyone but dems knows that they don't. She could easily be involved with some of what went on. She attended those Pedosta pizza parties.

                 Exactly. When I tell people Trump is actually a liberal democrat, people scoff at the claim, but it's true.

                 He ran on the Republican ticket for obvious reasons. I'm thinking that the Dem party will pretty well be cleaned what with the Awan and ANTIFA arrests coming down the pike. If he switches parties, he can finish the cleaning from the inside and then go after the repubs!
