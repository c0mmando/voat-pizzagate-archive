            Hey bernitdown, you are not alone. There are thousands and thousands of people just like you, who feel the same way. I see them here, on Twitter, everywhere. I think it's important to be realistic: the only way this cancer could survive was for it to spread throughout the judiciary, entertainment and media, large corporations, schools and religious organizations. Otherwise, these groups would have killed it dead. What that means is you can't just leak the evidence and prosecute people -- all they would have to do is appeal until they hit an involved judge and get off, like Epstein. That's one factor. The justice system has to be reconstructed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, you can't just leak the evidence straight to the public if it involves the abuse of kids, because that exposes them to additional harm. Imagine surviving abuse at the hands of a pedophile who lured you with friendship and goodies, only to make movies of raping you. Now imagine being ten years or twenty years older and having those videos all over the news! The victims have to be protected, first and foremost. That's why some indictments may remain sealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is a year and a half really an unreasonable wait for an administration to quietly conduct major surgery on the justice system, gather the evidence, build what will have to be the most complex legal case(s) in history, secure international relations that will be damaged by the truth, and plug whatever holes in the apparatus of government and the economy might let these perps walk?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm amazed they've gotten so many in government, Hollywood, the media and the corporate world to resign; that there are so many sealed indictments, that they've neutralized Isis, brought NK to the discussion table, and deftly parried a 24/7 MSM blitzkrieg of toxic bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you don't see it here because busts of small-time pedos aren't within the scope of our ruleset, but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pedos have been arrested, and hundreds of kids have been saved in the last year and a half. And that's just those that have made the local news. Multiple laws were passed just this week that will make life much harder for middlemen involved in child trafficking, like truckers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, WE ARE NOT GOING TO STOP demanding this be dealt with. It's not going to go away, no matter how many shills they hire, how badly they purge us from social media, or how many times they dismiss our concerns as a debunked conspiracy theory. We'll be here. I will be here.

            I feel the same. I believe that it is 100% real, but even weeding through the shill posts that have many upvoats is exhausting. That doesn't stop me at all. I try to keep up, but the people here are too gullible and lack common sense. They believe the silliest things. Yes, I know everything needs to be looked into. You have to decide on your own what's real and look into everything.

            If everyone became aware, all at once, that all of civilization was ruled by child rapists/murderers, the entire planet would stop.

           <p>
            Trump and team need to be strategic about preventing that from happening. It's really short-sighted to dump such a thing into the wild without taking into consideration the societal consequences for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thousands of indictments so far, and the good guys focus on taking down the lowly grunts to flip them and move up the ranks. Sometimes it's best not to be hasty.
