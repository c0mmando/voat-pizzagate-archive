            Why feces?  Have you noticed the reports of the sex slaves forced to eat human feces...recent reports from a McDonalds about finding human feces....this report about putting feces on vegetables.  Granted, great fertilizer, but more to the story I would guess.  Is there something demeaning about eating feces is satanism? Or whatever weird sumerian religion these folks practice?  Are we "agreeing" to something by eating feces even though we do not know we are doing it?  Seems to me we are being forced to do this as a compliance thing...any ideas?

            I have heard of Clint Curtis before.  You can find a YT video about how he testified about his creation of the software for the vote flipping touch screen machines.  He was asked by a politician running for State Rep (I believe) to develop it.  Amazing.  This is software that can make the machine votes travel like a domino effect to other machines.  I am not too savvy,  Hope I explained ok.  So yes folks, do not use touch screen machines.  Paper ballots.  This whole mess with the Bushes and the Mafia, they are involved with all kinds of Mafias across the country.  Jeb Bush was on the Board of Tenet Healthcare which I have researched in St. Louis.  They are alleged to be involved there with organ harvesting.  Jeb is also the one that backed and protected Rich Scott and helped him get his start in Fla. to run for Gov.  Scott ran from Texas after having been fined a Gillion Dollars for bilking Medicare.  Sorry to burst your bubble if any of you liked Scott. It seems there is a Cesspool in every State and a Mafia.  Thanks for your hard work and post.  Upvoat.

            Do I get this right?
They are putting human feces on our vegetables to grow them?
Trafficking people and giving illegal people fake social security cards...letting them collect unemployment checks...keeping them in cages...letting them be used for sex.
I don't even know what to say!
The Leaders of America have proven they do not care even a little for their people.
Seems like they would get tired of living such a fake life.
What for?
A few years of comfort?  Can you even imagine their true feelings about us?

             Using human waste in agriculture is actually not uncommon... gross to think about, but not uncommon.

             It sounds like they were using effluent or sewage sludge to water/fertilize the crops.  I know around here this was used on massive crops of green beans that were sold to a major national canned veggie brand.

             .  This is sold at your local hardware store and is basically just processed/heat treated human waste in pellet form that is an excellent fertilizer.  We use this on our small garden to fertilize &amp; the odor also keeps the deer away.

               I think it is probably illegal to use pure human waste, but what they are using is treated to an extent.  Where a lot of the e. coli outbreaks occur is actually from the farm labor.  Think about all those workers out there all day picking fruit/vegetables... they have to use the bathroom, and there are not facilities... they do their business in the fields and use their hands or clothing  to clean themselves... and then use their hands to pick the crops.  This is usually why the outbreaks occur.  Always wash your veggies!!!!  especially the ones that don't get cooked!

                Probably is illegal?
There it is again...illegal but what can we do?
We have to change our lives to make it more accommodating to those who are breaking the law and don't care who it hurts.
I don't mean to make too much of this situation, but where does it start and where does it end?
That article names big names involved in this...no wonder they do it, there isn't any accountability!
We let them off the hook every time.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe we need to examine our own lives and see where we are compromising everyday?
Kinda like the song The Man In The Mirror.
It starts with each one of us...we have drifted off to sleep and then wondered why immoral people got away with what they did.
Can we turn the tide is the big question.

             It's mind boggling isn't it?  Yes, we can only imagine what they think of us.  But we know what we think of them.  And yes, a few years of comfort but by then they are looking like gargoyles and are swollen like Old Pappy Bush.  They get that by taking liberties with our children and harvesting our organs.  Yes, we know what we think of them.

              That's what Hillary's "deplorables" and "irredeemables" description of everyday Americans reveals, doesn't it?
She being part of "they" - that's what they think of us, and why they easily dehumanize us.

               Yeah, I am a Progressive that did not vote for Hillary or Trump in the GE.  What Dems did not get about her remark was that she considers ALL of us "deplorables".  I can just imagine how her whole body tingled all over while making that remark.  Smug and Elite.

                She said it on more than one occasion - to donors and in an Israel TV interview.  I wonder if it made anyone's skin crawl?  Talk about a cold heart!

                 If her heart was harvested, I would rather die than receive it.  I would say my goodbyes knowing I was leaving with my own heart and not one filled with hatred.  "They" are the scourge of this earth.
