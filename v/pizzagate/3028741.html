            What are your thoughts on the idea that the cabal targeted churches deliberately compromise them?  I know there is quite a bit of evidence of that happening in the Catholic Church -- not just from the Clinton staff discussing it in the Wikileaks emails, but also from Bella Dodd, who was warning about it as far back as the 1950's. Given the fact that the churches would be the most natural enemy of the these satanic sickos, though, they'd pretty much have to compromise all of them with any significant influence in order to succeed in their agenda.

             I have no doubt on that
            </p>
            <p>
             The Catholic Church has been compromised long ago
            </p>
            <p>
             take away the peoples faith, and nothing is left but broken shells
            </p>
            <p>
             What do Communists and Pedophillia have in common?
            </p>
            <p>
             there is a push for both under the guise of socialism and homosexuality
            </p>
            <p>
             Atheism is the cornerstone to Communists
            </p>
            <p>
             is it a wonder the Churches are enemies?
            </p>
            <p>
             not at all
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm starting to think there is more to Communism then just politics
            </p>
            <p>
             just might look more into it, because that is the direction many Countries are taking, but not coming out and calling it that
            </p>
            <p>
             as foe pedophillia, how many who have been abused become abusers?
            </p>
            <p>
             How do drugs add to the abuse of children?
            </p>
            <p>
             and let us not forget the internet
            </p>
            <p>
             recruitment on the web is disgusting
            </p>
            <p>
             EVERYONE knows there is a pedophille problem, but too many continue on their merry way thinking it doesnt effect them
            </p>
            <p>
             They are so wrong
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO, there is only one way to stop pedophilla, and that is to treat it as you would a rabid animal

            Bottom line- parents need to ALWAYS have their guard up and NEVER leave their children with anyone who they don't know extremely well! Predator pedos lurk everywhere where there are children!

            Yep sure are right about that. It’s not just the RCC. sicko perverts everywhere. You don’t need a minister or pastor or church to pray to God. He will listen at any time of the day or night and anywhere. Out in nature is even better. Men or women wearing a cross can be just as perverted and sick as a convicted sec offender. Beware.
