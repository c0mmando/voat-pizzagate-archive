            Because it was a reply to someone else's comment. I would not have written said reply if the initial comment had not been posted, so, forum sliding has nothing to do with it.

            Tread lightly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shamanism in a broad sense, should not be directly correlated with
            <strong>
             abusive
            </strong>
            renditions of what many now call "spirit cooking", if I need to explain this further, I'd rather encourage you to just do your own digging. Yes there is a relation in terms of underlying knowledge employed, but, the distinctions come down to consent and intent; blood magick is not always abusive or perverted.

              this

             Which points out not only the commonality of this practice, but the fact that, as in pedogate, ritual sacrifice and/or cannibalism helps an oligarchic elite maintain control on society, which is exactly what we are discussing in pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             "In Japan, it was said that sacrificing a woman at a rushing river would placate the spirit who lived there, allowing for the construction of bridges and the safe passage of boats. In Greek myth, the warrior king Agamemnon decides to kill his own daughter in exchange for a favorable wind on the way to Troy. The Egyptians buried some of their pharaohs with dozens of servants when they died, ensuring that their needs would still be met in the afterlife. Bodies found entombed in bogs across Europe may have been slain as gifts for higher powers. The great civilizations of Mesoamerica killed people, smashed food and sank treasure to pay their debts to their gods.
The ancients could kill you in a million different ways and give you a million different reasons why it needed to be done. In much of the pre-modern world, ritual sacrifice was framed as necessary for the good of the society at large — the only way to guarantee, say, a plentiful harvest or success in war.
But the priests and rulers who sanctioned such killings may have had another motive, a new study suggests. An analysis of more than seven dozen Austronesian cultures revealed that the practice of human sacrifices tended to make societies increasingly less egalitarian and eventually gave rise to strict, inherited class systems. In other words, ritual killings helped keep the powerful in power and everyone else in check."

               <strong>
                Shamanism
               </strong>
               (/ˈʃɑːmən/ SHAH-men or /ˈʃeɪmən/ SHAY-mən) is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching altered states of consciousness in order to perceive and interact with a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.[1]
              </p>
              <p>
               A shaman is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of
               <strong>
                benevolent and malevolent
               </strong>
               spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.[2] The word "shaman" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia. According to ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen, "the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms" such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and "nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia.[3] The term was introduced to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in 1552.
              </p>
              <p>
               The term "shamanism" was first applied by western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighboring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples.
               <strong>
                Upon observing more religious traditions across the world, some western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense, to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.
               </strong>
               [4]
              </p>
              <p>
               Mircea Eliade writes, "
               <strong>
                A first definition of this complex phenomenon
               </strong>
               , and perhaps the least hazardous, will be: shamanism = 'technique of religious ecstasy'."[5] Shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.[5]
              </p>
              <p>
               Beliefs and practices that have been categorized this way as "shamanic" have attracted the interest of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, religious studies scholars, philosophers, and psychologists. Hundreds of books and academic papers on the subject have been produced, with a peer-reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanism. In the 20th century, many westerners involved in the counter-cultural movement have created modern magico-religious practices influenced by their ideas of indigenous religions from across the world, creating what has been termed neoshamanism or the neoshamanic movement.[6] It has affected the development of many neopagan practices, as well as faced a backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation,[7] exploitation and misrepresentation when outside observers have tried to represent cultures they do not belong to.[8][9]

              Shamans performed a very important function in older cultures which were very connected to the earth.  Indeed there were 'bad' shamans, and just as many examples, if not more of 'good' shamans can be found.  Read up.

               Yes. And. Shamanism is very much studied by CIA groups in relation to dissociative states and inducing said states to produce multiple personality disorder.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many shamanic practices involved or still involve human sacrifice, or other forms of mutilation of themselves or others.

               I have read, but, thanks for being condescending because that definitely helps your argument. Perhaps you should read on CIA Anthropologists like Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson - the latter openly worked for the OSS in psyop operations.

                I'm not denying that shamanism isn't being studied and used by intelligence agencies at all.  What I got from your comment was that you did not seem to recognize that shamanism was also a force for good (the village shaman was often also a healer) within ancient culture.  If I got that wrong, I apologize.
               </p>
               <p>
                Shamanism is very important for us to understand ourselves as humans.  It's why the transhumanist movement is trying to move people away from that knowledge.

            The connection to pizzagate is in the title; Abramovic was a central figure in pizzagate and is the central point of this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of the post reads:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I think in the context of Esalen's extreme interest in shamanism and native ritual, it is important to note the cannibalistic traditions of many of these same cultures. So it comes as no surprise that Maria Abramovic, whose spiritcooking rituals helped spark the pizzagate scandal, would have such an interest in Brazilian rituals that she is visiting the area and producing a film from the visit. One can only guess at the activities that will occur off-camera.The importance of this, is that it directly ties Abramovic's practice to similar Native and shamanic rituals which I pointed to in my Esalen post. Many have viewed Abramovic's "art" in terms of satanism or inverted christianity. However, this potentially leads investigators to miss out on important connections and trends in ritual abuse, like the similarity in practice and interest that Abramovic has shown to the culture and ritual rites of South America."
           </p>
           <p>
            "I also commented in my Esalen series on the similarities between Marina Abramovic's spiritcooking rituals which include a child-shaped object placed in the corner, on the floor of an empty white room. This was very similar to descriptions of South American rituals with used wrapped fetuses in the same manner. In both ritual practices, the wrapped objects are doused in liquid.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it is therefore extremely interesting that she not only mirrored a South American shamanic type practice, and is also going to be travelling to Brazil to experience ritualistic practices there."
