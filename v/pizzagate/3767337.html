<p>It was created by <a href="https://voat.co/u/Jem777">Jem777</a> (the murdered journalist that exposed a lot of pedos and overall rampant corruption in Racine) where she actually tells us that her killer commented on that very thread, like she already knew the traitor personally. </p>
<p>On that thread commented only about 5 people and looking through all of their history one account stands out as being very suspicious: Dressage2 , which also reported her death and admitted they talked to her on the phone, as you can see here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2672730">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2672730</a></p>
<p>This is the article reporting her death:</p>

<p>Another user that died after reporting on Racine Wisconsin corruption was <a href="https://voat.co/u/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt/comments">Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt</a> </p>
<p>Also recently the user <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3766641">gamepwn</a> was threatened with death after also reporting on Racine Wisconsin corruption:</p>

<p>Anyone else finds this very suspicious?</p>
<p>I think Voat should release the IP addresses of everyone that is/was involved with this and a thorough investigation made. </p>
<p>As we are all witnessing, the days of the wicked are numbered, their tranches infiltrated. </p>
<p>The root of the problem is already identified and isolated, they are acting like a herd without a shepherd, each going berserk trying to save their own skin. </p>
<p>They fight for power between themselves and end up destroying each other, but in their blood lust for power and control we are all affected, especially the children, and this is unacceptable. </p>
<p>Justice will come sooner or later, time will make sure of that, but why not do everything we can too accelerate the process?</p>
<p>We are all obviously suffering and at the same time thirsting for justice and truth. </p>
<p>Everyone can start with themselves to eradicate corruption, then extend to their family and friends. </p>
<p>Don\'t lie and don\'t tolerate lies. It will hurt you at first but eventually the pain will go to the ones doing the lying and deceiving, the ones that are corrupt to the core, that are being protected by each and every one of us through the lies we tell ourselves and others, and by all the lies we tolerate inside our families and group of friends. </p>
<p>Once the good people stop lying it will become obvious who the corrupt and wicked are, so that the good people will stop fighting their wars for them and the only blood being spilled will be their own, and the source of all suffering that will exist on Earth right now will be isolated inside of them.</p>
<p>Stand up for truth and truth will set you free, I know this for a fact.</p>',

             "COVID-19: Further Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US"
            </p>
            <p>
             As readers will recall from the earlier article (above), Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists and pharmacologists have determined that the new coronavirus
            </p>
            <p>
             could have originated in the US since that country is the only one known to have all five types – from which all others must have descended.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wuhan in China has only one of those types, rendering it in analogy as a kind of “branch” which cannot exist by itself but must have grown from a “tree”.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Taiwanese physician noted that in
             <strong>
              August of 2019 the US had a flurry of lung pneumonias or similar, which the Americans blamed on ‘vaping’ from e-cigarettes
             </strong>
             ,
            </p>
            <p>
             but which,
             <strong>
              according to the scientist, the symptoms and conditions could not be explained by e-cigarettes.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             He said he wrote to the US officials telling them he suspected those deaths were likely due to the coronavirus. He claims his warnings were ignored.

             You are correct. The main two were Dressage2 and EquineLuvr for anyone paying attention. There have been a slew of bad actors since this all began after Reddit Pizzagate was shut down. You have seen how this all has played out over the years and how the moderators have proven to be untrustworthy liars.

                Right. You make a submission full of blatant BS using a three-year-old sleeper account, start pontificating about "truth" and attacking moderation that calls you out on your hypocrisy. Cry me a river.

            , please have a look at the submission rules in the sidebar. You need links to support every major claim. I will give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit this in accord with our submission rules. Here are some questions that I have:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Another user that died after reporting on Racine Wisconsin corruption was Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You need linked evidence supporting this claim.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I was reading about Racine Wisconsin corruption and found a very interesting pattern. It has to do with this Thread:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2220476">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2220476
             </a>
             . It was created by Jem777 (the murdered journalist that exposed a lot of pedos and overall rampant corruption in Racine) where she actually tells us that her killer commented on that very thread, like she already knew the traitor personally.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Where in that thread does Jem "actually tell us that her killer commented"?
            </li>
            <li>
             You've linked no evidence Jem was murdered
            </li>
            <li>
             What pattern are you referring to? You need to describe this "pattern", not just allude to it with innuendo.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Most importantly, why are you pushing a debunked shill narrative that was used to terrorize this subverse, discourage research, and attempt to destroy trust in moderators? Jenny Moore was not murdered. There is no evidence she was murdered, and substantial evidence she died of natural causes.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Don't lie and don't tolerate lies.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Indeed. That's why we require linked support for every major claim. To weed out the lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why have you made no submissions since November 30, 2016 -- THREE YEARS AGO -- until today?

               Most of the past moderators were exposed in the process of revealing The Truth, and only a few remain.

               This is also why the False Prophet Q was created after SenateAnon said to “keep digging into Racine”.

               The death threats are real and many have been killed for Knowing The Truth. They will stop at nothing.

              Marcus Conte may have paid for the death report however Marcus Conte is not credible nor Trustworthy. Marcus also does not believe in Jesus Christ and The Truth.

              Jenny ddI not die of natural causes. Who did she fight with immediately before she was killed? They were not fighting about Mike Flynn as falsely claimed. Who did she say she “was done with”? Who was she attacked by? Why was George so close and friendly with the hotel staff?

             <p>
              We know more about this than anyone. George knows that, and he is afraid of The Truth. Jason and Trish were the early role players until they were exposed. He also used JK to sing, pray and shed crocodile tears after she was killed. JK is a corrupt Jesuit. Once he was exposed and his ‘mission’ was done, he disappeared. Marcus was also used in a similar way.
             </p>
             <p>
              George didn’t want to leave the hotel too soon after for obvious reasons, and then suddenly moved out the hotel the very next morning after his brother Dave found The Truth in a Titus Frost chat. Dave was extremely upset that Jenny forced George into going to Racine where George claimed to have met Jesus Christ who “had the drop on him”.
             </p>
             <p>
              George deleted several videos and parts of videos that exposed too much, including the ending of his video from 11/1 where he cursed Jenny Moore and Jesus Christ claiming he never wanted their help. George is not Christian in case you didn’t know.

              Some who knew both Jenny and WIC are still here sharing The Truth under constant attack, downvoting, stalking, censorship, banning, lies and continuous death threats. Sharing The Truth with everyone is the only option.
             </p>
             <p>
              New accounts had to be created to bypass the banning and censoring in order to Share The Truth with All.

               , since you did not edit this submission to provide evidence for claims, and most of them are demonstrably full of crap, rather than remove this per Rule 2 per the submission rules, I am going to leave this up with a "Disinfo" flair as public service announcement. I think it's important that folks be able read and judge for themselves which users are pushing bullshit.

             The path of souls is the Milky Way, whose galactic center passes over Racine, Wisconsin. The Native Americans believed this is where some souls went after death. They believed that after death a soul would wander the earth until he came to
             <em>
              water,
             </em>
             and from there could leap into the milky way when the "hand with an eye on it" appeared. Once inside the milky way they would begin a long journey full of trials and adventures, which could cause him to stumble and fall either back to earth or into the underworld. Eventually the soul would reach a fork in the road and would have to choose a path. One path was a dead end, and the soul was trapped there. The other path lead to a great bird who acted as a judge. If you passed this judgement you entered the place where your ancestors reside, and if you fail you and your memory will be blotted out of existence.

              Very deep and revealing information. Thanks for your contribution.

              The truth just became a pattern that can never be ignored again. They were never trying to replace the truth with their own version of it. Because they had none. The only thing that unites them is the dread of perdition they can feel in their bones. They tried to make the word truth obsolete by discrediting anyone that shared it. They hate sharing and the whole point of the truth is that it's being shared with everyone else. Just like a Cosmic DNA.
             </p>
             <p>
              The truth is alive and its the foundation of the human genome now and forever. So much noise and so much suffering for a cause that was lost since its inception. This is the epitaph of the saying "getting drunk on water". I mean even blood is made or water.

               Not remove them from Earth, isolate them somewhere on Earth, they can live like the cavemen they are, without any access to the technologies they are currently using for which they didn't contribute at all. There is no wisdom and no rationality in lawlessness. The fruits of corruption are suffering and death.

                Fair enough.  I do not agree to "isolation", would rather exterminate the insects.

                On that note, hope you can rid Racine from the perverts that seem to infest the area.

                 You don't kill the animals in the jungle for being ruthless killers, you protect them from extinction and observe them from afar.

                 What's difficult for us to do right now might be very easy to achieve in the future, so what's the point of destroying a species (corrupt humans) when you can just encapsulate and conserve them.

                 With the advancements in quantum computing and virtual reality we might be able to offer them a virtual habitat that they can't distinguish from real life because of their lack of awareness. They want power and control with no consequences, they want a world where they are all glorious gods so they can rape and kill virtual children all day, a virtual reality can give them all of that without any victims.

                 You can never truly eliminate evil, because it will always remain in our memories, but we can contain it and depending on how much we evolve, we can give it a purpose that we can't even think of now, and in doing so we bring some clojure to all the suffering humans went through so it wasn't completely in vain. But I'm sure that as we learn and develop we can come up with even better solutions. Once the evil people that currently control the resources and vital decision making institutions are taken out of the loop, and the decision making becomes a collective function, with the help of technology (like swarm intelligence modeled the human anatomy),  there is no limit to what the human mind is capable of achieving, things we can't even dream or imagine right now.

                  When you're a farmer, you remove threats.  See a fox in the hen house?  You shoot the fox.  See coyotes out with your livestock?  You shoot the coyotes.

                  Maybe someday there will be a fantasy Matrix for these piles of shit.  I do not have the compassion to put forth any effort to these people besides terminating their existence.

                   Compassion comes with maturity, you have to nurture it for yourself first of all, because the lack of compassion fills you with hate, and hate will destroy you from within. Save yourself and learn compassion even for those that don't deserve it and you will see justice and truth triumph and you together with it.
