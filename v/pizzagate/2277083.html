<p>Pre-read to my story:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2131817#submissionTop">I have now become a Targeted Individual, Marked for Death.</a></p>
<p>I have worked at a company from July 3rd to November the 13th. This company facilitates software for the state / communities that provides in a platform for youth healthcare. Organizations and communities can keep track of clients, healthcare supportive items like crotches, wheel chairs etc.</p>
<p>Without further explanation: This is a covert Zio-Satanist corporation. I\'ve uncovered 2 procaticing kabbalah satanists. I\'ll profile them briefly below:</p>
<p><strong>Mariel H</strong></p>
<p>Twitter + LinkedIn: <a href="https://imgur.com/yi3zfoM">https://imgur.com/yi3zfoM</a></p>
<p>This woman serves multiple purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining signatures from communities to get their software accepted and rolled out in said community. Weapon: Massive suggestive seduction; kabalah magick.</li>
<li>Controlling <em>me</em>. This woman has been weaponized to assimilate me into the Zionist gang. When this did not succeed, she has been trying to incriminate me as someone who &quot;just wants to phuck&quot; with the purpose of showing our secret service members I would not know what is true love.</li>
<li>Managing all males at this company. They are like mirror minions, they do what ever she wants. She can decide whether I was mentally terrorized, or otherwise be \'less\' terrorized where she then would come around as my saviour from their terrorism. I did not fall for it.</li>
<li>Nation-wide connections. She\'s actively been obstructing my job search by spewing false truths to Zionist connected IT recruiters. Most every recruiter is Zionist run.</li>
<li>Through the STN (Syntethic Telepathic Network, see first link about having become a targetted individual) I learned that this woman is their most capable Satanist in the Dutch sphere. A national matriarch for them with highly powerful seductive qualities which she employed on me too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gerda E</strong></p>
<p>This is a confirmed satanist. On august the 17th, she wore a bright red coat; in satanist-communication this is like the horns and OK sign, a flash-sign, though female specific. Note the date, the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1732706">17th</a>. Guess what happened at this date: <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-17/van-plows-crowd-people-barcelonas-city-center-many-injured#comment-10090345">The attacks in Barcelona</a> Be sure to read my user comments in there, I already describe this woman and another guy. Reading her flash-sign, I knew she is aware of the global satanic cabal and their high-profile global false flags. She knew at least <em>something</em> was going to happen that day. So did I. And when I got home, so it did: The Barcelona attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Hildo d B</strong></p>
<p>This guy is the database server / query guy. This guy has not shown satanist specific flash-signs, however this guy made several inappropriate remarks pertaining to child abuse / cannibalism and pedophilia. This guy the orgnizer of after-work office sessions. He was the one that introduced these sessions long before I worked there. He has dubbed them &quot;Pizza Peer&quot; sessions. The double-P. The word Pizza. The very unusual word combination for after-work sessions. The ping-pong table they have at the company. Him speaking of said pingpong table and playing pingpong on multiple occasions. </p>
<p><strong>Database</strong></p>
<p>When I worked there, I had to work on code pertaining to invoices. When testing for a potential bug in the code I noted something. I found an invoice line database record that had as its primary key the number 666. After further inspecting I was able to establish that the line AND the primary key value had been entered manually. See picture: <a href="https://imgur.com/zClSyLF">Database screenshot</a></p>
<p>The red squares signal the 666 encodings. The &quot;NUMMER&quot; column is the primary key column. It is a normal field, NOT an auto-increment or identity field. It can be manually edited / inserted. As a method of primary key generation they use the method of having a table (&quot;NUMMER_UITGIFTE&quot;) in their case, that stores the current IDs to hand out per table. At the time of the manual entering the satanic line, the number for the table was at 192 and by far not yet at 666. When I made the screenshot the number for this table was at 402. The number has never went past 666 yet and so I knew it was deliberate intent and no intermediate record deletes had taken place.</p>
<p>The satanic record was added 3/19/2015, see green rectangles. The social security number (BSN) you see also incorporates 666.</p>
<p>With this, we have absolute proof of a satanic school of thought going around in that company. It was an intentfully defined primary key by manual means. Mind you, this was the development database and NOT a customer database.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>These three persons AND the CEO and a bunch of others are all &quot;alignment synchronized&quot;. This means, when their hivemind leader goes left, the rest goes left. When she goes right, they all go right. Both the two women as described are affirmed Satanists by virtue of their flash-signs and alignment synched inver-validation. These two as such form <strong>TWO ABSOLUTE REFERENCES</strong> a large network of involved people. People at former employers I worked for at that, and people in the Secret Service (AIVD). And, together with the satanic record in the database I knew this was a shit-hole of Zio-Satanist cabbalists along with minions (and some unsuspecting employees).</p>
<p>This Mariel bitch is now trying to prevent me from obtaining a new job and I am nearly without cash. I have a month and then I will lose my home and belongings. I\'m prepared for it but it\'s NOT my choice. I will not succumb to them though.</p>
<h2>Heads-Up</h2>
<p>The healthcare support software they build allow an odd statistic to be recorded for clients (young people needing healthcare). And those are: <strong>LIMB SIZES IN CENTIMETERS</strong> This way accurate and way beyond what\'s needed for support facilities like crotches because: ALL FACILITIES ARE ADJUSTABLE TO A PATIENT\'S DIMENSIONS.</p>
<p>Then why recording upper-arm length, lower-arm length, upper leg length, lower leg length, torso size / length IN CENTIMETERS? Well.... How about a national inventory of body parts / limbs without actually having to snatch children and stock them up in a dungeon? Just query the f\'cking database for suitable targets the satanists need for SRA, organ / body part trafficking etc. THAT is what this is about. And so this is a HEADS-UP to all nations that may have in their domestic counties / communities healthcare software that records these same parametrics about patients / clients. BE-WARE: A good chance there is a satanist network involved.</p>
<h2>Pizzagate link</h2>
<p>Reallife experience with Satanists and Pedos at a cover organization I worked for the past few months (and got the fuck out of).</p>
<p>Further more, I will update this post as I go with more detail. BUT, I have to get the info contained with here ASAP. I don\'t have much time.</p>
<p>P.S. I have tried to get in touch with Law Enforcement. Nobody listening. All corrupt, all are deflecting. I\'ve attempted to contact lawyers. No response. I get deflected. I\'m on my own. My country is corrupt to the brim with Zio-Satanists in every facet of society.</p>
<p>One more thing I learnt through the STN:</p>
<p>They call their mental quarantaine they apply to people to harass them, or to have them comply... guess what... their &quot;Wall of Jericho&quot;. Yes, that\'s the term they use for their mental quarantaine, a.k.a. their black-ball profiling me in our society, making it darn hard for me to find a job and stay out of being harassed.</p>',

             Thank you mate. I'm crossing my fingers that there's still good people here in our system to independently help out one way or another. I've already stated that if I die or suffer any sort of medical anomaly, that that will be absolute affirmance of everything I wrote on VOAT and other public venues. I am not suicidal and have no plans on dying.

             Ahura Mazda (/əˈhʊrə ˈmæzdə/;[1] also known as Ohrmazd, Ahuramazda, Hourmazd, Hormazd, Harzoo and Hurmuz) is the Avestan name for the creator and sole God of Zoroastrianism, the old Iranian religion that spread across the Middle East predating Judaism, before ultimately being relegated to small minorities after the Muslim conquest of Iran. Ahura Mazda is described as the highest spirit of worship in Zoroastrianism, along with being the first and most frequently invoked spirit in the Yasna. The literal meaning of the word Ahura is "mighty" or "lord", and
             <strong>
              Mazda is "wisdom".
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Ahura Mazda first appeared in the Achaemenid period (c. 550 – 330 BCE) under Darius I's Behistun Inscription. Until Artaxerxes II (405–04 to 359–58 BCE), Ahura Mazda was worshipped and invoked alone. With Artaxerxes II, Ahura Mazda was invoked in a triad, with Mithra and Anahita. In the Achaemenid period, there are no representations of Ahura Mazda other than the custom for every emperor to have an empty chariot drawn by white horses, to invite Ahura Mazda to accompany the Persian army on battles. Images of Ahura Mazda began in the Parthian period, but were stopped and replaced with stone carved figures in the Sassanid period.

             Some Arab trader brought some shellfish up from the red sea and poisoned a whole town under the jurisdiction of Darius 1. That beget the entire banned foods thing that is in certain societies today. His laws were very common sense at the time, but I still can't believe that people still follow them as religion in completely other religions across the world. He even copied earlier rulings in the god/king court from Sumaria. Don't eat pork or catfish because Darius says not to.

            I have been conversing with one of their Zionists on their STN. The STN is theirs. This profile which I attributed the letter "R", which I do not know who it is in real-life, is fully alignment synched with this Mariel H I wrote about. Whenever (when I was still gullible to her extremely amical reaching out to me) I attributed her positive alignment, this profile "R" then went on to say I found out "the absolute truth" for righteous Zionists (I know good and evil sits everywhere and there may be inherently good, unsuspect Zionists not aware of the hidden dark-side).
           </p>
           <p>
            What absolute truth was this profile "R" talking about? Well this truth:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/1565769/tm-russian-billionaire-to-spend-100-000-000-to-find-aliens/260#post_24228155">

           </p>
           <p>
            I never spoke of "The absolute truth". No, instead, my claim is that "Infinity is factual". And the subsequent spiritual implications can be far-reaching. It basically says, to say in a spiritual, religious fashion: "The existence of God (or which ever monolithic deity description one uses) is FACT". Though foot-note, this is in the most abstract sense. The Infinity framework does not dictate how to conduct spirituality as per concrete religions. It simply says that infinity is fact and is surrounding the world we live in. Infinity in every direction.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I finally identified Mariel for what she is, a Zionist kabbalah practioner (a.k.a. Satanist), this profile "R" then went on to propagate that I was no more than a schitzophrenic that thought he had figured out the absolute truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Zionists are after people who figure out turths about our existence and the universe. Why is this important? Because the whole premise of Zionism is that a human rabbi at one time declared victory over 'G-d' and claimed authority. From then on, Zionists warship Rabbis, not God. That's why they hate the notion of 'God' existing, infinity being a fact. It's one reason for them to attempt to assimilate me. To cover their Satanists behind my absolute-good alignment and through my work, claim authority as the legitimate religion for the world.

            Secondly, there is another culture that they want to obtain from endorsement. This is the Hopi Native people within the USA, the state of Arizona. These are very intelligent, wise people who possess lore about the history of our planet. For this, you will have to explore and learn about them to understand the deeper aspects behind the reasoning for them Zionists to obtain endorsement.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I will already tell. There is a prophecy their Elders have spoken of. It will tell about the past. It tells about the future. These are very peaceful people that you can read about here:
           </p>

           <p>
            <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/hopi2.html">
             http://www.crystalinks.com/hopi2.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that at the second link, there is disinformation in regards to the explanation of the prophecy. Read the entire page and you might want to do further research. It's about our origins. Through study and understanding and a form of remote-viewing I have been able to understand deeper meanings within the prophecy. A story of origins. And the Zionists are after it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, the Vatican placed a telescope named LUCIFER in Arizona, in sacred Hopi lands, desecrating their heritage and lands. This is a very special place to them, and ultimately, mankind. I will not yet disclose yet what is the importance of this location.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I will share with you my finding on the prophecy itself. Before you click the link, I ask you kindly to read about the Hopi themselves first. To understand who they are and why they are who they are. Again, this is a good start:
            <a href="http://www.hopiculturalcenter.com/about-me-shift/#hopiland">
             http://www.hopiculturalcenter.com/about-me-shift/#hopiland
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I ask you to have a respectful mind when clicking the imgur link below, for it shows the prophecy in its original form. It is a divine work and tells a story about the whole of man-kind.
           </p>

           <p>
            Ponder this and realize about the times before there were Bibles, Qurans, Torahs, Talmuds and other scriptures.
           </p>
           <p>
            And again, as a final note: I am spiritually autonomous and sovereign and bide by the mere abstract of the absolute duality between good and evil. Having chosen 'good' over 20 years ago.
