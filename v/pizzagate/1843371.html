            More importantly, apart from the 9 released Haitians, the initial sting also included Americans and Canadians who were quietly released before they publicised the arrest of the locals.  We wrote about it here on voat at the time.  I'm still wondering who those North Americans were, and somehow I think they may have been connected with the military.

            That was all a set up. It was literally fake news. You would know because some MSM reported in it. The plan was to try and quash everyone's concerns by staging a sting. They even used the name and players of an operation already involved in trafficking and threw some fake Mormon heros like Beck to throw everyone off. Webb called it a week before it even happened.

            It was a bad acting job by everyone. Nobody bought it.

             Huh? I remember Beck getting involved, but I have otherwise no idea what you're talking about.

            <p>
             What MSM organizations covered it and how would a staged sting "quash everyone's concerns?" If anything, that would have only helped bring attention to Pizzagate, especially considering The Clinton Foundation's pulling out of Haiti days before.

              I would argue that is was all a CIA fakery as well.  As soon as I heard Glenn Beck was involved. (Edit: super half-assed report with zero details, evidence, photos or sources - basically fake news).

            Obviously, officials are on the take. They probably get a healthy slice of the human trafficking pie. Really sad. Corruption needs to be rooted out.

            I don't want to bring negativity to the sub but I can't help but worry this may happen with these thousands of arrests that have happened. How much are people following them up? Is this evidence being archived anywhere?

             I hope not, but it does seem to be the trend.

             With this story, the MSM pretty much entirely ignored it, so it was really easy to just let the suspects slip away unnoticed (if that's the case). The only two sites I know of that even reported on it were local Haiti news organizations. Really makes it look like even more of a concentrated media coverup than it already did.

              Yes it does. There must be someone in the law enforcement here that could shed more light on this?
