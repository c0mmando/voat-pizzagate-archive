<li><strong>He found dozens of made-up articles about Mrs. Clinton kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant’s back rooms. The articles appeared on Facebook and on websites such as The New Nationalist and The Vigilant Citizen, with one headline blaring: “Pizzagate: How 4Chan Uncovered the Sick World of Washington’s Occult Elite.”</strong>  
</li>
</ul>
<p>The claim that Hillary Clinton is molesting children in the back rooms of the restaurant has never been made by Pizzagate. Even the article they reference doesn\'t make that claim. In fact, the article concludes about Alefantis: &quot;They publicly celebrate a specific culture of death, abuse, and dehumanizations through their art and events, leaving us only to speculate what they do behind closed doors.&quot;</p>

<li><strong>While Mr. Alefantis has some prominent Democratic friends in Washington and was a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, he has never met her, does not sell or abuse children, and is not being investigated by law enforcement for any of these claims.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Alefantis having some prominent Democratic friends is an understatement. Simply calling him a Clinton supporter is an understatement as well. As a restaurant owner, Alefantis is listed as the 49th most influential person in Washington DC with big ties to Hillary Clinton and powerful Washington figures. Although there is no photo proof of Alefantis and Hillary meeting, they are very closely connected.  It\'s unlikely that they\'ve never met.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/ezdQE">The Washington Post has run a story revealing that Comet Ping Pong has been accused by a Washington Neighborhood Commissioner of being a &quot;haven for rape and murder&quot;</a></p>
<p>Despite it\'s claim to be &quot;family friendly&quot; the restaurant has a number of disturbing sexual references inside and James Alefantis makes a number of references to pedophelia both overtly and implicitly online. </p>

<p>Alefantis posted a photo of a man with a yellow bead necklace around the head of a young boy. Yellow sex bracelets can imply analingus, and the hashtag #chickenlovers in the instagram can imply a pedophile reference to adult men who are attracted to underage boys:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.png">The companies nearby Comet Pizza, Terasol Bistro and Besta pizza had FBI pedophile symbols as logos</a></p>
<p><em>Note of significance: Besta Pizza has now changed its logo online and Terasol has removed its logo from its website. What are the chances two restaurants next door to each other both had &quot;accidentally&quot; used pedophile symbols in their logos that required changing once brought to light by Pizzagate?</em> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>That idea jumped to other social media services such as Twitter and Reddit, where it gained momentum on the page “The_Donald.” A new Reddit discussion thread called “Pizzagate” quickly attracted 20,000 subscribers.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">r/Pizzagate</a> is not a thread. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Glen Caplin, a former campaign official for Mrs. Clinton, did not comment directly about Comet Ping Pong but said, “WikiLeaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked.” Mr. Podesta did not respond to requests for comment.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Wikileaks has a perfect publishing record and has never spouted any conspiracy theories. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aupnh/breaking_i_believe_i_have_connected_a_convicted/m">The only trafficking connection Wikileaks made was linking a Reddit thread which ties Laura Silsby to Hillary Clinton on their Twitter account.</a> Laura Silsby was caught trafficking 33 children out of Haiti. Hillary aided her and the lawyer who got her off was a pedophile. Beyond this, Wikileaks has made no mention of trafficking or Pizzagate. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Musicians who have performed at Comet Ping Pong have been pulled in, too. Amanda Kleinman, whose band, Heavy Breathing, has performed there several times, deleted her Twitter account after the abusive comments became overwhelming. Similar comments have flooded her YouTube music clips.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://heavybreathing.net">Heavy breathing band website</a></p>
<p>Is this kind of website normal to be linked to a family friendly pizza place? I get the feeling once most people look into Heavy Breathing they won\'t have much sympathy for Amanda Klienman.</p>
<p>I do not condone threatening anyone. Pizzagate is far and beyond Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis. James Alefantis, his friends, the bands that play in comet, and the Podesta have a very &quot;dark&quot; taste in art. Nowhere in the article does it mention or refute: </p>
<ul>
<li>Alefantis bizarre Instagram posts </li>
<li>Podesta\'s possibly coded Wikileaks emails </li>
<li>Nearby businesses having FBI designated pedophile symbols as logos</li>
<li>The Podesta brothers twisted taste in art depicting death and child abuse </li>
<li>The Clinton\'s and Podesta\'s close relationships with convicted child molesters  
</li>
</ul>
<p>The article provides no explanations whatsoever to debunk any of the Pizzagate claims regarding Alefantis besides &quot;they\'re wrong.&quot;</p>',

             Glen Caplin, a former campaign official for Mrs. Clinton, did not comment directly about Comet Ping Pong but said, “WikiLeaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked.” Mr. Podesta did not respond to requests for comment.

           Wikileaks has a perfect publishing record and has never spouted any conspiracy theories.

            The only trafficking connection Wikileaks made was linking a Reddit thread which ties Laura Silsby to Hillary Clinton on their Twitter account.
           </a>
           Laura Silsby was caught trafficking 33 children out of Haiti. Hillary aided her and the lawyer who got her off was a pedophile. Beyond this, Wikileaks has made no mention of trafficking or Pizzagate.

             Musicians who have performed at Comet Ping Pong have been pulled in, too. Amanda Kleinman, whose band, Heavy Breathing, has performed there several times, deleted her Twitter account after the abusive comments became overwhelming. Similar comments have flooded her YouTube music clips.

          <p>
           Is this kind of website normal to be linked to a family friendly pizza place? I get the feeling once most people look into Heavy Breathing they won't have much sympathy for Amanda Klienman.

           I do not condone threatening anyone. Pizzagate is far and beyond Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis. James Alefantis, his friends, the bands that play in comet, and the Podesta have a very "dark" taste in art. Nowhere in the article does it mention or refute:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Alefantis bizarre Instagram posts
           </li>
           <li>
            Podesta's possibly coded Wikileaks emails
           </li>
           <li>
            Nearby businesses having FBI designated pedophile symbols as logos
           </li>
           <li>
            The Podesta brothers twisted taste in art depicting death and child abuse
           </li>
           <li>
            The Clinton's and Podesta's close relationships with convicted child molesters
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           The article provides no explanations whatsoever to debunk any of the Pizzagate claims regarding Alefantis besides "they're wrong."

            The mural was in the restroom and Comet Ping Pong and was posted by a Yelp reviewer long before Pizzagate broke.

            What I find interesting is that they're defending Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong a lot but not the Podestas and Besta Pizza.
