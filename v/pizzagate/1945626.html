            Here are a couple of interesting related excerpts. Paul Wellstone knew too much about the system of Global Criminal Corruption. He was going to expose it as he fought against the Iraq war and collusion specifically in the agriculture, insurance and banking industries. That is why he was murdered.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The following is a digression: Sometimes planes and helicopters fall out of the sky. "Dictator" Omar Torrijos ruled Panama from 1968 to 1981; he instituted major public works, built schools, negotiated for the Panama Canal to be turned over to Panamanian control. He had an air accident. "Dictator" Manuel Noriega, a CIA asset, assumed power. Later, he too was removed by an American invasion to regain control of the Panama Canal. Noriega wanted more than he was getting from the Bush-Reagan administrations, and he threatened to blackmail a 'Skull and Bones' man. One might ask, were the air crashes of Lockerbie and those that killed Ron Brown (the first African-American Secretary of Commerce), Senator Carnahan, Senator Paul Wellstone, and John Kennedy Jr. all accidents? Wellstone's death shifted power to the Republicans in the Senate until Senator Jeffords switched parties over environmental and social issues." The author goes on to point to the Council of Thirteen behind many of these actions in collusion with corrupt agencies and other groups. 
Drifting Towards Another Civil War in America
By Donald Kropp
           </p>
           <p>
            "(John) Kerry’s inquiry widened to look at Cuba, Haiti, the Bahamas, Honduras and Panama. In 1989 he released a report that slammed the Reagan Administration for neglecting or undermining anti-drug efforts in order to pursue other foreign policy objectives. It noted that the government in the 1970s and ’80s had “turned a blind eye” to the corruption and drug dealing of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who had done various favors for Washington (including assisting the contras). The report concluded that “individuals who provided support for the contras were involved in drug trafficking…and elements of the contras themselves knowingly received financial and material assistance from drug traffickers.” And, it added, US government agencies—meaning the CIA and the State Department—had known this."

            . Both Noriega and Khashoggi were involved in Iran Contra. They're killing of the ones who can inform on Republicans.

             My contact does refer to some of these people as the "Bush Clinton Crime Family". A smaller fraction of what's been deemed the "Khzarian Mafia". The people I mentioned in my last two submissions are probably more connected to the Bush part of this.

             He says that 70% of Congress is compromised via blackmail of some kind (includes PG), so at least that many people will be taken down by all this.
            </p>
            <p>
             The pentagon (ie the military) for the most part is on the side of the people. Current intel place them at least 90% patrioit.

              Never once doubted this, which is why the Pieczenic worries about a civil war if it all came out never bothered me. I know a lot of military people and not a single one of them, including the West Point grad, would ever use force against U.S. citizens in a major way, no matter what their orders.

            Noriega became the CIA's &amp; Mossad's facilitator for movement of cocaine north and weapons south, but he made the mistake of thinking he could use a blackmail dossier against Bush, who upped the anti, invaded Panama, and renditioned Noriega to US soil.
