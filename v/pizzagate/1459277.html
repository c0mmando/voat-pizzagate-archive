            Uh, yes they are, and they have
            <strong>
             the same type of irregularity, and it's 1/20000 births
            </strong>
            .   Extremely rare.  Blood harvesting? No.  But it could be for stem cells, or some other reason.  It could just be a coincidence, but the extreme rarity of this defect makes a HUGE coincidence.  That said, I agree it's not necessarily evidence of anything, but I think it's something to be aware of.

              The eFits were supressed for five years.
The witness testimony they were based on is dubious.
The private investigation company that helped produce the eFits is being hunted by the Clinton-appointed DOJ.

            You seem intent on carrying a message of shaming.
           </p>
           <p>
            And you think it matters if a "mainstream reporter" thinks some information is weird?  Lack of mainstream reporting is part of the problem here, not something to be tiptoed around.

            Luckily this is an open forum, so even those with a strong tendency to normalcy bias may vent.  But if that's all you have to contribute, well, time will tell whether you are truly concerned about unearthing evidence to help some children now and in the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you wish to simply be a debunker, that would be fine, but don't present your debunking so emotionally and angrily.  Just debunk and do a better job of it.  I am interested in your information regarding a false post, but you need to provide a link to it, then calmly present your points about why you think/know it is false.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically your presentation sucks, though your heart is supposedly in the right place.

             I think if any credible journalist from - let's say RT or AlJazeera would cover the real circumstancial evidence that was found, this whole thing can take off. That is what I care about - I don't care about being part of a fringe internet community that tries to convince people Hillary Clinton drinks the blood infants at night. The woman has enough financial ties to crony companies to make an argument from there...

             And here is the link to the post I was referring to (

             </a>
             ). Please read it carefully and critically decide for yourself if the "evidence" posted has ANY real, verifiable connection to HRC, the CF, the Podestas or Alefantis.

              That's better but you can cut out the complaining still.  No one cares if you are worried about your reputation.  Either contribute or shut up.  And when you post, provide substantiation about what you are talking about, keep the caps down, and back up your conclusions as best you can.  Good luck.

            :-)  I see where you're coming from, but it's the nature of this beast.  You need folks from all backgrounds bringing their skill-sets to this inquiry.  Every following, whether religious or political, will have its share of crazy.  However, there are enough people here now that likely do or will soon have the ability to downvoat content they deem irrelevant.  Before I saw voat threads about pizzagate, I would have deemed it an impossible conspiracy theory.  However, delving through some of the content, there is quite a bit of circumstantial evidence. The record of pedophile rings in political circles around the world prove it's not out of the realm of possibility.  There will be batshit crazy posts, but there will also be relevant leads.  Nature of the beast.

             Oh I totally am onboard with you but the post does NOT connect any of the #pizzagate people with "Besta Worlds". If it was the case then it would def. be a smoking gun. But it isn't.

              Comment in those threads to let us know where/when it was debunked etc.  I am relatively new to the pizzagate thing; so, I am unaware of the vast majority of this research.  I worry that I post things that are either irrelevant or have already been discussed, but I need seasoned folks to tell me if either is the case.  In the meantime, I am trying to read and research.  You have a lot of old voat goats who are only now discovering this subject.
