            That's only because the real dirty dirt hasn't come out yet. James Comey got fired last week and I'd bet dollars to donuts Andrew McCabe's ass will get hit by the door as he leaves his office for the Final Time this week.

            With those two slow walker's gone you will see a flood of leaks the likes of which you will not believe. And when they're done the MSM media will finally chime in when the story has already been out there for a month.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why will the MSM be so late to the party? Because they've been held hostage by the Deep State and Hillary &amp; Co. Remember Michael Hastings? Remember Seth Rich and all the others? The cowards in the MSM do too. The Jake Tappers of the world with their 7 figure salaries, organic food and effete palates couldn't be bothered. They couldn't risk losing that third vacation home on Nantucket so they stayed quiet. Unfortunately for what will soon be called "The Jake Tapper Has To Sell His 3rd Vacation Home In Nantucket Syndrome.*" the Internet never forgets.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope you enjoyed those million dollar bonuses Jake. I hope it was worth it. I hope you enjoyed your time at the top of the Mountain. Because we all had to listen to your obnoxious ass for the past 10 years as we bathed in what we thought was the Truth but in reality was your filth. Shit flows downhill Jake, you didn't know that? Bathing in MSM effluence was a real mother fucker let me tell you. ...Soon it will be our turn at the top. And it will be your turn to listen to our obnoxious asses for a change. And believe me Jake you have no idea the degree to which your average Deplorable Shit Lord can be an obnoxious ass. When you downsize your life and take your first "shower" in a bath tub just remember us Deplorable Shit Lords couldn't afford to shop at Whole Foods. You may have thought your shit didn't smell but let me tell you our shit stinks to fucking high heaven.

            Freedom from/of religion doesn't provide immunity from crimes. You are moderately free to believe and or say what you want but that doesn't make mass murder okay just because you think you are satan. The problem is that the judiciary is corrupt and even if these cases are brought to court, the judges let the perpetrators off with barely a peep. Rape, child porn, and trafficking are increasingly sentenced with mild probation and a go out and do it again card, no religion necessary.
