<strong>First, some background.</strong> 
<em>O\'Connor was born in Glenageary in County Dublin and was named after Sinéad de Valera, wife of Irish President Éamon de Valera and mother of the doctor presiding over the delivery, and Saint Bernadette of Lourdes. She is the third of five children, sister to novelist Joseph, Eimear, John, and Eoin.</em>
<em>Her parents are Sean O\'Connor, a structural engineer later turned barrister and chairperson of the Divorce Action Group, and Marie O\'Connor. The couple married young and had a troubled relationship, separating when Sinéad was eight. The three eldest children went to live with their mother, where O\'Connor claims they were subjected to frequent physical abuse. Her song &quot;Fire on Babylon&quot; is about the effects of her own child abuse, and she has consistently advocated on behalf of abused children. Sean O\'Connor\'s efforts to secure custody of his children, in a country which routinely denied custody to fathers and prohibited divorce, motivated him to become chairman of the Divorce Action Group and a prominent public spokesman.</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin</a>%C3%A9ad_O%27Connor
Sinead O’Connor has been very public about the horrible physical and sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother. O’Connor has stated that her mother was angered because she wasn’t born a boy and did all she could do to ruin her reproductive system and insisted on making her look like a boy.
<em>“My earliest memory, she’s telling me I shouldn’t have been born. She didn’t want me. She didn’t want girls. She wanted me to be a boy,” the “Fire on Babylon” singer said. “She dresses me like a boy, she chops my hair off. Whenever she beats me, which is daily, I’m naked. She makes me take my clothes off. I have to lie on the floor. I have to open my arms and legs. I have to let her attack my abdomen. She wants to burst my womb. She wants to destroy my reproductive system. She wants to stop me from being a female.”</em>
<em>“She was not well,” she said. “She was really very, very, very not well. I would say she was possessed, although, I’m not sure I believe in such things. So either she was just a sadist and a pedophile or she was possessed by the devil.”</em>
<em>When she was 8 years old, Sinead’s parents divorced, and she says her mother got upset that the kids were sad when their father left. As punishment, Sinead claimed she made them live outside in the shed for several months. The abuse finally stopped when Sinead got older, according to the singer.</em>

<strong>Now, let’s take a look at Bono.</strong>
<em>Bono was born in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, on 10 May 1960. He was raised in the Northside suburb of Finglas with his brother (who is eight years older than Bono) by their mother, Iris (née Rankin), a member of the Church of Ireland, and their father, Brendan Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hewson, a Roman Catholic. His parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised Anglican and the second Catholic. Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother.</em> 
<em>Bono was named one of the 17 Irish artists to be proud of by the Irish Post on 9 April 2013. Time magazine ranked him at the 8th place on its list of the &quot;Most Influential Celebrities&quot; in 2013; he was the only person from the music industry in the Top 10.</em> 
<em>Bono\'s work as an activist, which is due largely to his Christian beliefs, began in earnest when, inspired by Live Aid, he travelled to Ethiopia to work in a feeding camp with his wife Alison and the charity World Vision, an Evangelical Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organisation.</em>
<em>With regard to Bono\'s 2013 declarations in interviews published and videotaped of his faith in Jesus Christ, he states that Christ was either who he said he was, or he is &quot;a complete and utter nutcase&quot;. As early as 2005, Bono was invoking this argument, identified as the &quot;Lewis trilemma&quot;.</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono</a>
<strong>For someone who went to church often as a child, he sure has an odd opinion on Jesus. The “Lewis trilemma”</strong> <em>is an apologetic argument traditionally used to argue for the divinity of Jesus by arguing that the only alternatives were that he was evil or deluded. (Strictly speaking, Lewis is not trying to prove the divinity of Christ but is merely arguing that one cannot simultaneously affirm that Jesus was a great moral teacher and not divine.) One version was popularised by University of Oxford literary scholar and writer C. S. Lewis in a BBC radio talk and in his writings. It is sometimes described as the &quot;Lunatic, Liar, or Lord&quot;, or &quot;Mad, Bad, or God&quot; argument. It takes the form of a trilemma — a choice among three options, each of which is in some way difficult to accept.</em>
<em>This argument is very popular with Christian apologists, although some theologians and biblical scholars do not view Jesus as having claimed to be God. Some argue that he identified himself as a divine agent, with a unique relationship to Israel\'s God. Others see him as wanting to direct attention to the divine kingdom he proclaimed.</em>

<strong>Forgive my Wikipedia citations. It really is the easiest way to gather this info and branch out without getting too obscure and off track.</strong> 
<strong>Here are my threads regarding research I’ve already done on Bono:</strong>
Loser Bono pushing abortion
Bono\'s love of boys; honors incest and homosexuality
U2 honors Bourdain with a song and a strange comment + Hutchence &quot;suicide&quot; 
<strong>The following about Bono is quite frightening:</strong>
<em>Based on the fact that the Bible says there are “many antichrists” (1 John 2:18) and the son of perdition will oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped and show himself that he is God (2 Thessalonians 2:3,4), we ought to be especially alarmed and watchful when a public figure like U2 frontman Bono manifests such a blasphemous spirit of antichrist in conjunction with musical worship, idolatry and political power.</em>
<em>Bono’s star status has enabled him to secure meetings with a variety of influential public figures including Tony Blair, George Bush, Barak Obama, and Dmitry Medvedev. The scope of Bono’s religious and political influence makes him one of the most powerful men on earth.</em>
<em>With Bono’s anti-poverty work with DATA then ONE then RED, he has made many allegiances in the evangelical community as well by meeting with people like Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Billy Graham.</em>
<em>Even today’s celebrities, politicians, presidents and world leaders turn to Bono as the “world leader” that can “save the world.” In an autobiography, Tony Blair says that Bono has world leader potential.</em>
<em>In an Emergent book called Get Up Off Your Knees, several contributing authors including Eugene Peterson, author of The Message Bible translation, praise Bono and U2 as a prophetic voice. One contributor, Brian Walsh, believes U2 lyrics should be taught in seminaries and that U2 concerts demonstrate how worship should be done in a postmodern Emerging culture.</em>

<strong>As Pizzagate and MK Ultra reserachers, we know all about how trauma can create alter personalities in children who are victimized during repeated Satanic rituals. Is this evidence of Bono’s alter?</strong>

            EC, A wealth of info about Dublin, Bono, Sinead. I have been in Dublin many times and in Glenageary a few times. I did not know most of this info even though i live in Ireland. One of the most important elements of the coming Q Storm is putting an end to child sexual abuse and sacrifice. Thank you for keeping a focus on it. What is done in the dark will be brought to the light. PS. Patriots. I am a newbie and need upvotes please and thanks.

            Dublin is certainly very suspect.  Don't forget it was once known as "Strumpet City", famed for its beautiful female prostitutes and visited often by very lusty men from all over Europe and further afield including princes, kings, emperor's sons, earls, dukes, lords (the global connections run deep and high).  Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, hails from the northside like Bono. Dublin man Jonathan Swift wrote "A modest proposal" advocating the cannabalism of infants. The druidic tradition in Ireland worshipped serpents which everybody knows symbolises evil.

            Good luck with your research.  I look forward to your conclusions.

               My pleasure! No, no essay. I just submit all sorts of research in an attempt to connect dots hoping it leads to the big picture, and wake people up to what's truly going on.

            What was the original Hellfire Club like?
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Meetings would be held twice a year. Invitations were sent by the Prior and costumes were required to be worn by attendees. These meetings were recorded in 1779 in a book called Nocturnal Revels.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Every member attending would be allowed to eat well and enjoy the company of “cheerful ladies of lively dispositions”. Sex and wine certainly seem to have been a major part of the rituals – even the landscape was sexualized.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             The gardens included a Temple of Venus and Parlour of Venus as well as statues of Pan and Priapus – perfect for a club dedicated to divine procreation.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Who were the original members and what were they like?
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Members included the notorious John Wilkes, whose political spat with fellow monk, and founding member, the Earl of Sandwich (yes, that was a real guy), would expose the activities of the club to censure and cement its notoriety in the public imagination,  Benjamin Franklin, founding father of the USA and fan of the madness inducing glass harmonica, Chevalier D’Eon the sexually ambiguous cross-dressing French Spy, and George Selwyn the eighteenth centuries own necrophiliac ‘gentleman sadist’, to name but a few.

            BRYAN SINGER attempted to pay homage to the HELLFIRE CLUB associated with MARVEL COMICS.

           <p>
            <em>
             When Fox revealed the Hellfire Club premise a year or so ago, the pitch was focused on a young special agent tracking a woman with mutant powers in the 1960s. The mystery woman would've been involved with a secret society of millionaires intent on world domination.

                Oh, good find! Was this what the movie 'Dunkirk' was about?

                   In the Second World War, atop Dover’s famous chalk cliffs, the medieval castle was the tip of the sword with which the country kept Nazi Germany at bay. For hidden in the bomb-proof tunnels beneath the ramparts was the control centre of defensive operations in the English Channel.

                    This article says they were converted and made radiation proof later on, and now they're just a tourist attraction. Although I wonder if parts of the tunnels are off limits.

            While there's no true mention of Satanism in your link, it does mention orgies, torture, and other egregious forms of behavior, so I'll consider it as a form of corruption, but not directly linked to Satanism infiltrating, which was my original intention, but I see I wasn't very specific about this. I'll edit my intro.

A former swim coach he represented who currently lives in Florida was meant to be extradited to Ireland on abuse charges but keeps getting off the hook. There was a swim coach pedophile ring in Dublin, more details here. Note the Church and police were involved in the cover up

             What a hIdeous monster, and his buddies! He looks like death warmed over! Too bad these creatures don't always look as nasty on the outside as they are on the inside. From the article:
             <em>
              Cynthia Owen named 12 men who called to the Murphy family house regularly and paid Peter Murphy and his wife Josie, both of whom are now dead, to rape and abuse their children.
             </em>
             I think this is what O'Connor's mother did to her and her siblings.

             Check out this bullshit! How can a man who dresses up like the devil have any room to talk about morals and innocence?

             <em>
              U2 singer Bono says President Trump’s election caused the band to significantly delay and rework their upcoming album “Songs of Experience,” because they felt the “moral arc of the universe” was no longer bending in the direction of “fairness, equality and justice” and they felt the need to address it through music.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Bono said Mr. Trump’s election was a defining moment in America’s history and caused many people, conservative and liberal, to mourn for “innocence that was lost.”

              U2 probably borrowed the title "Songs of Experience" from William Blake's collection of poems by the same name. I'm not familiar with the content of said poems, but Blake was certainly an early occultist weirdo back in the 18th century. I guess Bono's nonsense about a "moral arc of the universe" has something to do with the typical satanist's worldview wherein one day a perfect dualistic, everything goes new world order is to be established on earth.
