<p>If you look right now on their website, the first link I inlcuded...their &quot;666 Calendar&quot; of upcoming events shows &quot;Th-Mo, Jul 20-31, 2017  Philmont Scout Ranch, Cimarron, NM&quot; If you look up Philmont Scount Ranch in New Mexico..it looks like there has definitely been reports of child molestation. <a href="http://crewjanci.com/crew-janci-files-new-boy-scout-abuse-lawsuit-new-mexico/">http://crewjanci.com/crew-janci-files-new-boy-scout-abuse-lawsuit-new-mexico/</a></p>

<p>I can\'t seem to locate much information on leaders or members from the troop.  There is little info on names of leaders. Is this normal with Boy Scouts. Seems like this organization is trying to operate in the shadows, rather than to go out and promote how great it is to be a part of their Troop. </p>
<p>Seems pretty Odd to have a group with ties to child molestation, carrying the name &quot;666&quot;, while being allowed to operate in the basement of a church. But i mean...this is D.C. we are talking about, so I\'m not surprised. Perhaps we should dig a little more at this cuz something just doesn\'t sound right.</p>',

            The Troop 666 in DC is different from the Troop 666 in NY. Troop numbers are designated by the local area council, so there could potentially be a Troop 666 in each of the 272 councils nationwide.

            You are onto something but I would advise anyone to not make phone calls to organizations like BSA. Have to be smart about it. Research and archive everything.

            Focusing on #666 is a distraction.  The Boy Scouts usually meet in church basements, that's where mine met.  It's likely the case in your town right now.  They don't need a 666 number to be involved with sexually abusing kids.   That comes naturally in my experience within any all male dominated power structure. The church is one of these male dominated situations also.  Not all my scout leaders abused and not all the ministers in my church, but many did.  The ones who do, cooperate with each other in passing on kids who have been groomed and keeping everyone else in the dark.  Nothing is odd about Scouting and Christianity and Child Abuse being all mixed up together.

              Agreed, but it's an old arrangement.  It's the same, a male dominated secret society.   They do seem to be the ringleaders.  Freemasons freak me out.

            I'm afraid I don't get the basement connection. I attended scouts in the basement of our Methodist church, there were no pedos. One entered the church going up high steps almost half a story. The basement was finished off to look like any school room and thats where we did Sunday School. It was very bright and airy because the high windows were above ground level. Their were kitchen facilities down there as well.  The church, the pews, alter, choir section, etc. was off limits for non-church activities, only church services, weddings funerals etc. Every church I attended thru out childhood set up like that. Churches and residential  homes down south and out west don't seem to have basements. So i guess folks have different perceptions of basements depending where you live.

            It seems they're allowed to pick what troop number they are, so they chose 666 on purpose.  I definitely think there's something going on here, no legitimate church or BS organization would allow that.

            There is no way in hell a legitimate Christian church would allow a BSA Troop
            <strong>
             666
            </strong>
            to operate in their basement.  Real Christians would flee that church day one when they found out.

            This seems too convenient.

            I would really like to know how the boy scouts number their troops and see if it actually lines up with a legitimate reasoning for this D.C. chapter being #666.

            All right, I don't know what part of my brain this came from, but when researching St. Louis and the Catholic Arch.  I remember one of the priests being caught up in sexual abuse and the connection was with a place in NM.  I am trying to find but no luck yet.

            On the National Youth Leadership Training it says to contact Tony LaCava  Round Table Commissioner (found on net)  he is also listed with the Toronto Blue Jays.  Is this the same guy?  Could be some connection a lot of sports guys are sketchy.

            I would definitely report this to the BS of American Organization.  This is as sketchy as all get out.  They should have a record of who is heading this group.  I remember the church in our neighborhood area always had events listed in their bulletin and they always asked people to contact the leader and asst.  Seems like they are trying to keep it a secret.  I would call the BSA and say you are interested for a relative and with all the stories in the news about child sex abuse that you just would like to check out the leaders for safety.  That is if you feel safe enough to do this. Wood not blame you.

              It is so sad that those disgusting pieces of vermin have made me question almost every great outfit for kids now.  I will, though, not start branding everyone, for that is what they want us to do.  Will look at your link.  Thanks.

            Seems like a weird coincidence. Do you think these people are that schizophrenic about their numbers though? And as schizophrenics they would have to be really evil to want to take advantage of that number via agenda.  Personally i try not to ascribe too much to random numbers, for my own sanity. Still fucking weird though, thanks for sharing

              I am using it as a heuristic. I am very familiar with schizophrenics and the symptoms of schizophrenia. I apologize if i offended by my use of the term, but i was making a point (albeit lame) about obsessions and idealism with numbers.
