<h1>The Hollywood Rape Machine</h1>
<p>The anonymous blogger describes himself on his Twitter profile as a “300 pound entertainment lawyer who has been married six times, lives in his parent’s basement and has an obsession with digging up celebrity dirt.” While it is doubtful he’s that fat or “lives in his parent’s basement,” he is legitimately a lawyer in show business, and the dirt he’s been digging up has made him “King of the Hollywood Blind Item.”</p>
<p>A “blind item,” in journalistic parlance, is a gossip-column story that doesn’t include the names of its subjects. At his blog “Crazy Days and Nights” (CDAN), the entertainment lawyer puts out blind items and his commenters play a guessing game to figure out who it’s about. He has gained a reputation for impeccable accuracy, as his earlier items on Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Matt Lauer have all been confirmed in recent weeks and, if he maintains his 100% accuracy record, we haven’t seen the end of it, by a long shot. The wildfires currently raging through Southern California may be omens of a forthcoming inferno in Hollywood with billionaires among the casualties.</p>
<p>David Geffen, for example. Commenters easily guessed that a CDAN blind item about the rape of two teenage girls by a rock star was about former Eagles drummer Don Henley. According to the CDAN item, money from the music mogul Geffen was crucial to keeping Henley out of prison in that 1979 incident, and the rocker likewise benefitted from his friendship — through ex-girlfriend Linda Ronstadt — with California Gov. Jerry Brown. Also, coincidentally, Henley was a big supporter of the Clintons, for whom Geffen went “all-in” during the 1990s, so the story has political ramifications. There are connections here, and when you realize that Geffen was one of three Hollywood tycoons, along with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, who united to form Dreamworks in 1994, the possible fallout could be catastrophic.</p>

            Wow.  They are all infuriating. I read CDAN all the time now.  The one that goes straight to my heart is Heather O'Rourke.  SS and DG both need to Go Down.  I don't care who goes first.  Then George Lucas and Woody Allen.  Then Charlie Sheen and Rob Reiner and then Oh Well...................

             I'm waiting for Spielberg. Again, there is no evidence tying him in with anything, but why is he always the catalyst? And he works with Lucas?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, but with Heather, was the mother that clueless? She really just left that little girl all alone on the set? How? Why? Did she have something better to do? And there had to be symptoms of being abused. There always are. So she just ignored them and cashed the paycheck?
            </p>
            <p>
             If she really didn't know, it's one thing ... but really? REALLY? No one would make an anonymous call to her and say, "Your kid is being molested."

              With HO I think that mother would have had to have stars in her eyes to Block The Truth.  If she had those kind of injuries on the inside, the would definitely be showing on the outside.  A Mother would see that.  She had to be Totally Deranged or Looking the Other Way.  In those days though we did not have the internet nor where there people coming out like on CDAN.  Many would be Scared Stiff to come out against him.  Now not so much as we are seeing.  That is one good thing, people are Waking Up and are Becoming Emboldened.  Thank God.

                I am willing to listen about the Mom, but I will through her under the bus if anything comes out about her being AWOL with Heather.  Yes, in those days not much was swirling around like now.  Also, by now the count of those abused must be Astronomical.

             The thing about blaming Jews as the source of all evil is that, well, they're not. Blacks, whites, Hispanics, even the odd Asian is just as guilty. So what good comes of highlighting race? Well, depends on what you consider good. If your idea of good is discrediting the people in the pizzagate community, then keep on bashing Jews. Oh, who are we kidding!? Of course that's your goal. It only makes sense. As if you give a damn about the welfare of children. You hate so many types of people, why not kids too? 😌

               Predictable you! 😏 I'm not the weak one here. That would be you, and it's embarrassing how out of touch you are. Without anything intelligent to say, all you are able to do is churn out slurs, profanity, and epithets, much like the hyper-emotional overgrown child you are. As if that weren't bad enough, you're utterly predictable. Someone could literally replace you with a sloppily coded computer script. And if your employers were smart, they would - it'd be more cost effective. 😘

             Geffen was also a big Obama supporter and helped him win over HRC in 2008. He had a falling out with the Clinton's in the 90's over don't ask don't tell.
