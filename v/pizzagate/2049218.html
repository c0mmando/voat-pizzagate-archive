<p>Now for anyone missing the point, the Clinton defense has and continues to be the &quot;Fake news hurts Real people&quot; card... This is where puppet man James Alefantis had his 15 minutes of fame on CNN. He was the real person, PizzaGate was the \'fake news\'. It\'s the same logic congress used to pass the last 10 months of anti-free speech internet legislation. It\'s the same logic that centralized intelligence agencies are selling, to further excuse even more data collection and collaboration with Social Media Giants. Their goal is to &quot;combat fake news&quot;, however these bills they introduce give congress unbelievable power to legally censor and regulate our news feeds. The net is theirs to regulate as they see fit, in the name of &quot;Fake news, hurting real people&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What actually happened on October of 2016 when #PizzaGate spawned is one of the most beautiful things I\'ve been apart of. On that month spawned a large scale demand for more information. The will of the people was so strong that any and every available platform proceded to explode as a hangout to discuss and review evidence.. To this day what we are currently participating in is the largest scale citizen led open investigation in our known history. It is the only of it\'s kind.

            Similarly back in 2012 Webster Tarpeley called wikileaks a limited hangout that was intended to push through a bill to expand censorship (I believe a few months later David Rockefeller and others did try to push this bill, as he predicted).

           <p>

            You're absolutely right.  This shit has been going on for centuries, but we are in a unique time in history....now that we have the interwebs.  Too many independent researchers, too many investigative collaborations to be stopped.   Too much momentum and red pilling.  It's  inevitable that everything will eventually come to light. ... and We will all get to witness the beginning of the end of this madness, God willing, due in no small part to all the great work you people do here.

            It's either the red pill or the normalization of pedophilia. We are on a crossroad. A sudden collective awakening seems improbable. 
If the public's sleepy "whatever" reaction to 9/11 is indicative of anything, we are doomed. 
Even if presented with irrefutable video proof, most people would likely chose denial. While MSM broadcast around the clock breaking news about Putin planting fake CP material on Podesta's laptop. All confirmed and sealed by 17 intelligence agencies. 
We need a paradigm shift. Perhaps a simultaneous arrest and interrogation of the main protagonists. Waterboard if necessary. 
The fate of humanity is at stake. It's either us or them.

            You don't call it pizzagate in the real world, silly! Almost everyone is aware of it now though we may not discuss it as "pizzagate."  That fact in itself is an astounding achievement considering that just a year ago the vast majority were completely unaware of just how psychotic many powerful people actually are.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just hope that we reach a stage where justice is done and children are again free to be children, safe from such predation. This is really a fight to free humanity and save the world.

            Excellent.  It's what I have been trying to tell people I know for months now.  I am braaaand new to voat, and a few other things because of this.  I've been lurking the internet since the day the wikileaks dump hit the newsstands so to speak.  It has caused me to take a serious interest (or develop an obsession) in computer sciences, network communication and the fundamentals of conducting investigations.  These are real skills that could potentially be marketable someday.  It has caused me to become laser focused and relentless in seeking to put an end to it and perhaps make the world a better place to live.  It is absofuckinglutely profound.

              It's going on 4chan today.  I will send you a message with a link.  I've found even more strange things associated with this group so I will take any help I can get in dissecting info.  Those with knowledge of occult symbolism, Luciferian philosophy, and hacking skills will help crack this this open.  Pizzagate seems to have hit a wall but there are other networks to be exposed.  Thanks get back to you soon.

            Yup.  Pizzagate is all about people who don't understand jokes, metaphors, art, irony, modernism.

              Freedom was the weapon.  It was the freedom of inherent in Abstract Expressionism that the CIA promoted.  Modern Art was a weapon, just like Jazz and Rock and Roll and Blue Jeans were also weapons against Communism.   I'm down with all of them.   None were created by the CIA.  The CIA was telling anyone what to do.  Dizzy Gillespie or Little Richard didn't need government approval for their albums.
             </p>
             <p>
              Washing Machines were also a weapon.  They also represented a type of freedom too, didn't they?

               No, it is cynical cultural war using the ILLUSION of freedom to direct, modify and groom society - in secret, undemocratically and at taxpayer expense.

            I meet more and more people that may not have heard of pizzagate, but are very open to the fact that elite pedophilia is a real thing. There is definitely an awakening to all this shit, on the internet AND in the real world. That is the reason they're doing all this "fake news" propaganda and demands to more censorship.

            I think Wikileaks opened up the real truth.  Without it Pizzagate would not have been as significant.  Citizen journalism will be here to stay.  I have read posts from retired people on here say they have something to do.  Nothing worse than a senior citizen with time on their hands.  Especially, the really bright ones that want to hone that edge.  I love working on Pizzagate and you are so very right there is so much more to it.

               Yawn. Is all caps, personal attacks, "muh jews", and insults the only thing you're capable of? Boring.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's see. Similar names who are identical in terms of their moronic rhetoric, writing patterns, and general asshole demeanour? That's the very definition of an "alt" jackass. Or is the term "Sock Puppet" (a known shill tactic BTW) a better name? What a "fucking retard" we got here.
              </p>
              <p>
               You have openly admitted to down voating submissions because they didn't "name the jew". Your constant ranting about, "its the jews behind everything" basically implies what I said is in fact your beliefs. Seems I'm the one with the brass balls and you are the one with the "cuckold faggot family".
              </p>
              <p>
               If you had even the slightest glimmer of intellect, you would have known that "luciferian" is an alternate term for a satanist. Pizzagate is about satanists, which includes whatever religion they masqurade as.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wow, 0/3 there. You must be in your own words "the stupidest motherfucker here". Congrats, because you had a lot of competition amongst your shill brethern. Even PGIsStupid was smarter than you.

               <p>
                Jews are behind Pizzagate, political correctness, mass immigration, abortion, sexual deviancy, etc. Acknowledged fact BY THEM. PLEASE READ SOME JEWISH PUBLICATIONS YOU IGNORAMUS THEYRE PROUD OF IT. 3600 JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY PUBLICLY SUPPORT IT.  Others don't.

               <p>
                Your theory is that a roughly equal number within every religious denomination is a crypto-satanist group? How would such a situation come about you MORON!

                Just admit you would never accept blaming one group over others because you're a pussy and it makes you feel uncomfortable.  Meanwhile I actually have Jewish blood, LOL!  Say where do the concepts and NAMES of Satan/Lucifer come from? Oh judaic religions.  You think "Satanist" is a new fad they created, a rainbow coalition of perverts? LMAO! WHAT A STUPID ASSHOLE!
               </p>
               <p>
                I feel so sorry for you dude. You're basically an SJW and you don't even know it.  Who could respect you knowing what an illogical crybaby fag you are?

            Its almost like you don't know what a limited hangout means. Noone is saying that their isn't a pedoring in Washington DC, we're just saying that this shit is a very complicated psyop with many layers and some of you just aren't smart enough to see through it.
