           <p>
            I agree FBI Anon is important, but not because he endorsed Jerome Corsi.
           </p>
           <p>
            The essential thing is to listen to the audio of Seymour Hersh talking to Ed Butowsky, and to understand what Hersh is claiming to know, versus what he is speculating about. About the FBI report and evidence that Seth Rich contacted Wikileaks, Hersh says, "I have someone on the inside who will go and read a file for me." This is about as good as it gets in our world. It's one degree of separation. Hersh then goes on about Brennan, and NSA head Rogers, and how they're liars and morons and so on, but he doesn't actually claim any definite knowledge that Brennan had Seth Rich killed. The single big reveal on the audio tape is that someone Sy Hersh knows and trusts confirmed that the FBI report linked Seth Rich to Wikileaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does this matter? Consider two things. First, when Hersh says "I have someone on the inside," he is telling the story in a way that plays up his journalism, his vast network of contacts, his prestige. Which is all perfectly normal, but then we have to ask why that person is willing to take serious risks for Hersh. What is their actual motivation? It can't be just to stroke the ego of Seymour Hersh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second point, again about what Hersh would know or not know. Seymour Hersh is an old-school reporter, with no particular allegiance to right or left. He has been around since the Vietnam War. I see nothing to suggest that he is techno-savvy; he doesn't have a blog, for example. So I think he would be absolutely unaware of FBI Anon or basically anything relating to 4chan. Why does this matter? Because I think Hersh's source may be FBI Anon.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is basically Occam's Razor and not multiplying entities beyond what is needed. We believe in FBI Anon because his/her predictions came true, and the Vince Foster documents were put up on the FBI website at the appointed time. Personally, I believe that Hersh does have someone high level at the FBI who passes him information. Now, what are the odds that there are TWO high-level people at the FBI, working in complete independence from one another, to leak damaging information about the Clintons? It's simpler to assume that this is the same person. (Bear in mind that I regard all the other supposed insiders since the original FBI Anon as LARPers. I'm willing to take the word of Hersh that his source is real, and that makes this the first time that Occam's Razor has been needed.)
           </p>
           <p>
            They don't seem to have made this connection on
            <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/136245911/lets-talk-about-seymour-hershs-audio-referring-to">
             /pol/
            </a>
            yet. The media have gone very quiet on Hersh, and of course they never had any interest in, or appreciation for, the FBI Anon episode. They won't make the connection. I believe that what we are seeing, in this Sy Hersh episode, is another move in the chess game being played by FBI Anon. He didn't just come to 4chan. He went to Hersh as well, and probably went other places that will become known over time.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's insanely dangerous for him, and I'm not altogether sure that I'm helping by putting 2 + 2 together in this way. But I think there are people on the other side who have had their knives out for FBI Anon for a long time, and I prefer to err on the side of helping him than do nothing.

             The fact that we let a man who was compromised and subsequently converted to Islam become D/CIA with a complicit media that covers it up says it all. 1984.  Precrime shit.

             They do love their limited hangouts. The Seth Rich shit just doesn't sit right with me. Everyone who goes to investigate self-implodes afterwards and loses all credibility (George Webb, Hannity, Rod Wheeler, whoever). Plus Seth's parents don't seem too concerned, and the whole thing with his brother smirking at the funeral. But then as I was thinking all of this to myself, I started to wonder if Seth Rich could be alive. Do we have confirmation of a body? Plus his neighbor said he saw Seth walking with cops after he had been shot, and that he didn't seem to be in any pain. And if so, why? What does his death solve? And then I get a headache. Lol

              If you believe like I do that the brother Aaron was helping Seth leak (that he had pasword of the dropbpx etc) than the behavior of the family makes perfect sense. Basically Aaron was involved in dealings that got his brother killed, and could get him killled,  and had to explain this to his parents.  laughing when nervous and terrified seems totally reasonable.

                “you need both a public and a private position” ~ HRC
               </p>
               <p>
                The public position is that Seth Rich was killed, and for anyone with an IQ above room temperature, that he was probably the leaker.
               </p>
               <p>
                IMO the private position would most likely be: we don't eat our own. The private position is made to people who are aware of the deceptive and criminal nature of the operation, the people who help maintain the facade of legitimacy. If they believe that they could be thrown under the bus in order to prevent public exposure then their loyalty to the cause would be placed in jeopardy.

              Nothing. There is no trace he was even at the hospital and the gag order on all attending hospital staff sort of proves it was a phony fake show.

            InfoWars is a limited hangout and Jerome Corsi is exactly the reason why limited hang outs exist. 99% of what Jerome Corsi ever says is factually accurate but you just need 1% to do the dirty deed. And in this case it's claiming Brennan murdered Seth Rich. It's possible you just have to explain the GLARING problems in the story:

             All of the above excellent points.  Wag the Seth, who killed Seth ya da.  Complete and utter bs imho.  Distractions, chasing tails with tales.  Complete waste of focus/which of course is the intended result.
