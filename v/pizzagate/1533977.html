Tracing the usage of &quot;lost boys&quot; as a hidden term related to pedophilia / child trafficking, starting from the children\'s book, but more specifically in the 1987 movie &quot;The Lost boys&quot;. The movie itself containing an alternate interpretation from a hidden/pedophilia point of view.</strong></p>
<p>(willing to move this to another sub if asked)</p>
<p>We throw around the term &quot;code words&quot;, meaning words that are suspected to contain a hidden meaning relating to pedophilia and/or occult practices including sexual child abuse. there have also been references to popular culture that seem to support an alternative, darker interpretation. I want to delve into this, and ask you to confirm or debate the links I make and the conclusions I draw.</p>
<p>Like alice in wonderland, in the beginning, there is a suspected pedophile, that gets an itch to write a book for children. This story is no different. the &quot;inspiration&quot; for the lost boys in Peter pan are the 5 boys that the author took guardianship of when their parents died. what may (or not) surprise you is that his guardianship over the years was not uncontroversial.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there has often been suspicion about the nature of Barrie\'s relationship with the boys, there is no evidence that he engaged in any sexual activity with them, nor that there was any suspicion of such at the time. ...... In an interview taped in 1976, bisexual Conservative Party politician Robert Boothby, who had been a close friend of Michael during their teens described Michael\'s relationship with Barrie at that time as \'morbid\' and \'unhealthy\', but dismissed the notion that there had been a sexual aspect to it.[4]&quot;</p>

<p>if you are still in doubt about the pedo nature of the relationship that inspired the lost boys of peter pan, look further into this review of a book called &quot;J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys: The real story behind Peter Pan&quot;</p>
<p>It\'s clear that Barrie loved the five Llewelyn Davies boys, was fascinated by their boyish innocence and bravado, mourned deeply the two who died young. But he also basically stalked the family, manipulated himself into a guardianship of the children when their parents died, and obsessed over intense &quot;friendships&quot; with little boys. Reading it felt like playing a sordid game of Clue or Charades, as the author makes no actual accusations, does not ever outright discuss the potential disturbing reality behind Barrie\'s love for his &quot;lost boys.&quot; Instead, the book includes disturbing primary documents and quotes (multiple nude photos of the &quot;beautiful&quot; boys while young, all taken by Barrie, quotes from one of the surviving boys and from their acquaintances accusing Barrie of unnatural and obsessive feelings, of acting more like a lover than a father figure, etc., etc.) with little commentary, all merely offered up to the reader with what struck me as cagey subtlety.

<p>Now that we have established &quot;the lost boys&quot; as a term created by a suspected pedophile, let\'s turn to the 1987 movie &quot;The lost boys&quot;. I would state, that the movie can be interpreted as a story about child trafficking and sexual child abuse, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ABUSER. The fact that two of the lead child actors in the movie, Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, were sexually abused, points to that the production of the movie had warning signs.</p>

<li>Michael is initiated into the pedo ring (<a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lostboys/images/0/0c/Michael-emerson.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20080828161935">http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lostboys/images/0/0c/Michael-emerson.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20080828161935)</a>)</li>

<li>the frog brothers represent ineffective law enforcement involved</li>
<li>Grandpa is in fact the mastermind behind the pedo ring</li>
<li>Lucy the mother knows what\'s going on.</li>
</ul>
<p>bonus question: what does Phoenix represent?</p>

            Vampires always have a sexual context but in the movie it was a homosexual context. The vampires led by Kiefer Sutherland were gay and they wanted Michael to join them and he finally did. The scene where they are hanging under the railroad bridge as the train goes by overhead and the vampires all drop into the fog then Michael finally does the same thing that was his entry into their homosexual cult. Also the director Joel Schumacher is a flaming queer who loved the homosexual subtext in the script.

             I agree there were plenty of homosexual cues going on. I am taking it one step further and stating that it was specifically of a pedo nature. after he drops into the fog and wakes up in his bed, what does he do? He tells his young brother (Sam) to take a bath and then tries to get him. which Sam's dog prevents. But the second time he succeeds, as after Sam gets off the phone with mom (notice the grunting noises from behind) agrees to "let him in" when Michael asks him to "open up". Sam agrees to not say anything, and it is after the kitchen scene with the close up of the missing kid on the milkcarton, that his mom makes the comment if he has been eating pizza.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yes, there is homosexual subtext. but even more, there is a subtext of systematic abduction of young children, Pedophilic symbolism, and the mechanisms by which this nasty business is carried out.
