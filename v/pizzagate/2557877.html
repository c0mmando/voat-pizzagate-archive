<p>Gina R. Hutchinson allegedly committed suicide on October 9, 2002.</p>
<p>She was a girlfriend of Keith Raniere.  Her sister said he statutorily raped her when she was 15 years old. He was in his mid-20s at the time.</p>
<p>One day, Gina’s older sister, Heidi, caught him and confronted him: He was an adult man sneaking into their house.</p>
<p>Keith told her she did not understand. Gina’s soul was much older than her biological age. He explained Gina was a Buddhist goddess come to earth to be with him in his mission. She was his consort. His eternal companion.</p>
<p>Heidi thought he meant to marry Gina, who would be 16 shortly.</p>
<p>Gina soon quit school and left with Keith. She soon discovered that Karen Unterreiner was his secret girlfriend: Then came Linda Smith, Pam Cafritz, Kristin Keeffe, Barbara Jeske, Dawn Morrison, Barbara Bouchey, etc., etc., etc. One after another. For years, he was with Toni Natalie.  Toni left when she found out about the other women.</p>
<p>Gina loved Keith but hated being in a harem. He was her guru. She was, after all, a Buddhist goddess and he was a great soul. Sometimes, she thought he was the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>She rebelled against the harem. She tried to break away permanently, but one of the women in Keith’s inner circle would call repeatedly, urging her to return.</p>
<p>She was distressed. She left him. One of the inner circle women told her that Keith might die because they were spiritually connected. She came back. She tried to adjust to harem life. She hated it. She stayed. She went. Like a yo yo. On again, off again, for 19 years.</p>
<p>One day she met a man and had sex with him. She confessed to Keith.  He cursed her and it is believed he raped her. Then he told her she could never cure her “ethical breach” in this lifetime. Her soul was cursed and she would have to wait until she died and came back in her next life before she could atone for what she had done to him.</p>
<p>What happened next is not clear.</p>
<p>She appeared confused. Much like Kristin Snyder. She may have been pregnant.</p>
<p>There may have been a threat. She may have told Keith she was pregnant.</p>
<p>This is speculative, but some in Clifton Park wonder.</p>
<p>She left Clifton Park and drove her Toyota Tercel to Woodstock and got a room at Cocco’s Motor Lodge.</p>
<p>Like Kristin Snyder, it started out as a missing person report.</p>
<p>Gina Hutchinson lived at 261 Lapp Road in Clifton Park about 3 miles from Keith Raniere.</p>
<p>She was 34; 5 ft. 6 m., 120 lbs., Blond hair. Blue eyes. She drove a Toyota Tercel.</p>
<p>It was reported to police that she was “mentally disordered”.</p>
<p>Sergeant David Downes of the Woodstock Police Department received a report from Colonie Police to attempt to locate Gina Hutchinson of 261 Lapp Road in Clifton Park, New York. Investigator Vitale stated she might be distraught over the fact that her mother had just died. Family members [unnamed] were concerned that she might harm herself.</p>
<p>It was a Friday night about 10 PM.  Sergeant Downes and Patrol Officer Howland started checking the area for her car. They found it parked on Macdaniel Road, north of Meads Mountain Road, a few hundred feet from the Tibetan Buddhist Monastery, called Karma Triyana Dharmachakra.</p>
<p>The two policemen walked through a field toward a pond north of the monastery.  About 500 feet from the vehicle, Sergeant Downes noticed a small flashlight lying next to the pond. PTL Howland noticed the body of a female lying in an embankment off the side of the pond.</p>
<p>The body of Gina Hutchinson was found on October 11, 2002, at approximately 10:25 PM.</p>
<p>Miss Hutchinson was found lying on her back, along the bed of a small stream, fully clothed with multiple layers. Her body was well preserved and appeared to be in complete rigor mortis. Livor mortis was not visible. Blood and a gunshot wound were present in Hutchinson’ head. A black .20 gauge pump action shotgun was lying on top of the body with the muzzle stuck in her hooded sweatshirt. There was one discharged .20 gauge Winchester shotgun shell in the chamber (buckshot).</p>
<p>At 12:49 AM, representatives of Lasher’s Funeral Home arrived. The body was removed from the stream bed. Police examined her right front jacket pocket. It contained car keys and a lighter. The left front jacket pocket contained a cardboard box of Winchester .20 gauge shotgun shells/5 pack with one missing, a pack of gum and a motel room key to Coccos Motor Inn.
Was it a suicide? Maybe. But why did she get a room at a motor lodge?</p>
<p>And why did she use a shotgun – and where did she get that gun?</p>
<p>And was she, in fact, pregnant?</p>
<p>And when did she last speak to Raniere or one of his minions?</p>
<p>The questions keep coming – but there are no answers.</p>

            Wow. It takes a special kinda stupidity...  the more I hear about this guy Raniere, the harder it is for me to believe that he was so smart. I think he just has predatory instincts that he’s used to find particularly vulnerable or naive young ladies.

             The low self esteem needs to park itself in the biggest ego they can find..
The low self.esteem comes because of patriarchical. society potraying them as a weaker sex...when in actual.fact it is their womb that the collective is after..
Without the womb there can be no human battery cells fornthe debt system...
This is why priests walk around in frocks..they have taken over the trusteeship of the womb when the woman as trustor hands title over it during the ritual of marriage..
Rome is the accou tant of a woman womb..its like a company with assets ...and the company has to have an accountant to take care of the assets record keepeing
If only they women knew ..and taught their children to reduce the debt and the world knew how to reduce.  It...then there would be abundance of energy as credit ..
Women are at the bottom of the credit rating as they have given the most valuable asset on this planet to Rome as her trustee..

              Well, he admitted on tape he's killed. I posted it not too long ago.

              Then there's the CDAN article. Yeah, no way this could have been going on without the bigwigs knowing. They condoned the activity because of the sex trafficking.
