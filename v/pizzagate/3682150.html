<p>Hey all</p>
<p>Have a 6 year old kid, I let him play his ipad on the weekends.</p>
<p>We downloaded this game called GOAT SIMULATOR:</p>
<p>All the info/title page etc look completely harmless, and to be honest we had a lot of fun and laughs playing for several days.</p>
<p>Its VERY FUNNY... you are a goat and can wander around and do <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/goatsimpatch.jpg">all kinds of funny things</a>, jumping on trampolines, flying around with jetpacks and all kinds of hilarious stuff. I really enjoyed it and we laughed a lot playing it, it seemed exactly the kind of game I like; unstructured, free to roam around and explore, lots of secret things to discover, etc</p>
<p>But then one day I was watching him play and he discovered <a href="https://i.cubeupload.com/jOja8Y.jpg">THIS</a> hidden in the trees </p>
<h1 id="md-wtf">WTF</h1>
<p>At first I didn\'t know quite what to think, but I went to do some research, and it turns out that THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GAME IS TO CREATE A SATANIC RITUAL!!!!</p>
<p>You have to bring 5 people into this circle and SACRIFICE THEM. As you do this the circle and pentagram start to glow:</p>
<p>Once you get 5 people, you become a SATAN-GOAT</p>
<p>By the time I figured this out my son was already ahead of me and has completed this, and was running around as the demon goat.</p>
<p>I told him to delete the game and explained exactly why.</p>
<p>THE POINT IS NOT that there is a satanic video game, this is no surprise.</p>
<p>The point is that there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to indicate that the game has any such elements in it until you are deep into the game. </p>
<p>It looks totally innocent, and is marketed as a silly, harmless app for kids that is just fun and silly.</p>
<p>Then they twist and it is 100% Satanic.</p>
<p>That\'s fucked up, man.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="md-section-2"></h1>
<p>After reading about this father\'s experience, I watched a video (easter eggs in the game)</p>
<p>A few other things (of many)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blood Goat Throne</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raid drug dealer\'s house and get high (actually have to go there a lot)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It\'s apparent that the game has parodies of various games and movies.  Hard to vet games when, as parent noted, satanic or occult or drug culture etc. can pop up at any time.</p>
<p>This isn\'t the only example I\'ve noticed with seemingly non-occult games, that once you start to play you discover otherwise.</p>',

            No No lady. You've fallen for the biggest scam in all of mans history.  An all loving God would not threaten his creation with ETERNAL BURNING while letting some fictitious figure roam free to torment this rock flying through space.  That theory is ass backwards.
           </p>
           <p>
            One would think that an all loving god would protect his children and destroy the bad Devil.  I would imagine an all loving god would take us into his arms, at the moment of our death, and comfort us, talk to us, Show us where we failed. You know. Like a loving parent would. Not burn them in a lake of fire FOREVER.

            Thanks for posting this. I meet with parents and will pass this on. They are covering all the bases it seems. They have clubs in schools and now games to entice them. Moms and Dads can’t use iPads as babysitters. Dangerous.

            Giving this the "Share!" flair, K9. Watched a video by Fr. Chad Ripperger, an exorcist, a few weeks ago, who warned that multiple exorcists have had to deal with cases of demonic obsession and/or oppression of kids and teens related to real demon-summoning rituals in video games over the past few years. Wish I could remember which video it was. He's got a LOT of enlightening talks on YouTube.

            The fact they hid the diabolical elements of this deep in the game is very telling, IMO.

             I used to hate It when watching a show on TV when I did watch TV and they start chanting or do a spell, always hit mute as I feel this is a way to bring whatever they are saying into one's space as well.

              Yes. From what I've been reading, neither angels nor demons can read your thoughts, but they can access your imagination and memory -- faculties based completely in the physical body according to Thomas Aquinas (thoughts are the province of the intellect which resides in the soul, not the body). This is why it's important to be careful about what you allow into your imagination and memory, because demons can use that material to deceive you, tempt you and attempt to create anxiety in order to spur you to sin. It's also why seeking the help of your Guardian Angel is so important -- he can help you remember good things and forget bad. Very interesting stuff.

             Will do, exorcism is serious, people should not be attending them spiritually unprepared or they too may end up possessed.

            Glad you brought this up and I have been screaming about what is in video games for 15 years now,since I discovered something in a game my stepson was playing.I also was a  voice actor and did a popular (not going to mention it). I found out a whole lot doing that and these games, many of them, are to indoctrinate your children into their satanic world,warm them up to the idea of trans humanism plus much much ,more. As a parent, always check the games. These games today have more sway than films or TV for many children

              Ripperger says in various of his talks on his experience as an exorcist that drug dealers, porn distributors, game distributors and some pharmaceutical manufacturers regularly use rituals to put a curse on their products, making them more addictive.

            And just think. Satan doesn't even exist and this shit is still being pushed and idiots fall for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The human race is RETARDED.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Q himself said. "Does Satan exist? Does the thought of Satan exist?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would he say "The Thought"  Q knows Satan doesn't exist. This is all a conjured up human created scam for the soul purpose of creating fear in people who think handing over money to a church will save them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The constant fear of eternal burning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Really ? Why didn't God just snap his finger and make Satan Vanish ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would an all forgiving, unconditional loving God hold the treat of eternal burning over our heads?
           </p>
           <p>
            "Love me or I'll burn you forever"  That's the words of a dictator. Words of a human being. Not a loving god.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where was God BEFORE the children were kidnapped, rapped, tortured and murdered ?  Anyone ?

              Well that wasn't a very nice thing to say from a God fearing Christian fella like yourself. Three negative hate words all in one sentence. LOL. No worries Bra. Some of the worst, rude, utterly crude comments come from you Christian people.  Satan doesn't exist. Nor does the magic ole man in the clouds.

             Oh, he exists alright. There is positive evidence for his existence everywhere. Anyone who's participated in a satanic ritual or who has been a victim of satanic ritual abuse would tell you the same. But you seem to have subscribed to the non-scientific materialist dogma that forms the philosophical framework for most or all atheists. Your belief that Satan doesn't exist is based upon a naturalistic framework of the world, i.e. that only material causes exist. If there was no evidence for Satan, that would be one thing. But there is evidence everywhere of an adversary's existence.

             The word 'Satan' just means ''adversary' and 'deceiver'. It is a title or description, not a proper name.
            </p>
            <p>
             This doesn't change the fact that there are many 'Satanists' in this world - people who choose to perform actions aimed at corrupting that which is good or pure.
            </p>
            <p>
             A great many of these Satanists work toward their goal within the entertainment industry - TV, movies, music, and video games.
            </p>
            <p>
             I woild be very cautious of criticizing others for belief in a God when you yourself follow 'Q' - an invisible entity within government who tells people to 'trust the plan' and sends out anonymous and cryptic messages.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 'Love me or I'll burn you' vengeful God of the Old Testament (Jews) was replaced with the 'God is Love' graceful God of the New Testament (Christians). Or did you miss the memo?

            You let a 6 year-old play video games on "his ipad". You're the one sacrificing children to satan with shit like that. Imagine pretending to be surprised that giving an ipad to a 6 year-old was a bad idea. The guy obviously hates his child.

              It's also a fair contention that the father let their

              Nobody is in the right between the two.

             <p>
              That said, Goat Simulator is a terrible video game and in at least a few ways should be condemned for being a blight on the industry – there's even a mild connection to Activision (discovered while digging further in the time since my comment), which opens the whole thing up to further suspicion.

              </a>
              – under less suspicious circumstances, I'd shrug this off as no big deal, but reading the history/founding/recent activity of Double Eleven Studios gives at least myself reason to distrust their intention.

             </em>
            </strong>
            . Then you head out to the ritual site,
            <strong>
             <em>
              which is just up a short path nearby to a house which represents the game developers HQ with signage reading "Coffee Stain Studios",
             </em>
            </strong>
            and
            <em>
             then use your newly gained summoning power to appease the ritual using summoned goats (no humans required)
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            While reading through the comments to this video, I discovered many
            <strong>
             <em>
              people saying that they can only summon 4 Goat Ragdolls.
             </em>
            </strong>
            As it turns out, someone replied to one of these complaints by informing them that
            <strong>
             <em>
              the summoning ability was changed for the XBox releases to only summon up to 4 Goat Ragdolls, thus creating a requirement for the sacrifice of at least one human.
             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore, the element of human sacrifice was not originally a
            <em>
             requirement
            </em>
            of the 'ritual' (though it appears that the Goat Ragdolls and human subjects are interchangeable on all platforms), but was actually introduced as an unavoidable requirement for the XBox versions (published by Double Eleven Studios) and likely the subsequent, inexplicably PG-rated mobile app versions (which were published by the original developers, Coffee Stain Studios).

            All in all, I'd go ahead and agree that this game,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/3661592">
             like Outer Wilds
            </a>
            , reeks of industry manipulation (potentially even serving to help launder money) and attempts to, on some level or another, mess with people through questionable content.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the grounds of industry manipulation, there are many notable tangents worth digging into via the wiki pages for Goat Simulator,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Stain_Studios">
             Coffee Stain Studios
            </a>
            and Double Eleven Studios, but I'll leave that part up to those interested for now.

            as they say (and corporate hierarchy/history).

              Y'welcome. Normally I wouldn't pay much mind to something like this in such a garbage game, but the discrepancy between PC version and XBox (+ others?) versions, namely the
              <em>
               introduced unavoidable requirement
              </em>
              , is particularly "wtf?". Given especially that console and mobile app releases are far more likely to fall into the hands of those under the ESRB age recommendation of 17.

               We've all played the role of both hater and hated at some point. What matters is whether we continue that trend, or make a conscious effort to break free of the cycle of hating.

                Nope. I don't play roles here. ESOTERICshade does, though. He loves playing roles such as hater/hated/sage/savior/etc via alts to trick people into siding with him... uses one or more alts to hate/harass/defame, then swoops in to defend his target with another alt (or more than 1).

                 By your own apology to others starting off your linked post, it's clear that you previously did play the role of hater. And you are now being hated on by others.

                <p>
                 I don't mean 'playing an artificial role' as in LARP'ing or pretending via alts, but rather the role that you play in any given situation. Categorically, every person will be both the critic and the one criticized at some point in their interactions with others. We all play different roles in our own lives at different times in different places.

            That's not the whole point of the game lol. It's a sandbox game, you can do whatever you want. Just like in real life, you can choose not to summon Satan. It was never an innocent silly game. It's rated 17+ for a reason.

             This is a simulation game in which players cause as much damage as possible with a goat in an open-world environment. Players earn points by using the goat's abilities (e.g., ramming, jumping, running) to destroy objects and complete challenges/stunts. Several stunts depict acts of violence: characters getting hit by vehicles; players shooting people with baseballs, destroying a gas station, pushing humans off cranes. A handful of challenges involve knocking other goats out of a large blood-stained fighting circle. During the course of the game, players can engage in a text-based mini-game (i.e., “Drug Wars”) that involves the fictional buying and selling of drugs (e.g., crack, heroin, opium). The game also includes instances of crude humor (e.g., characters holding signs that read “No penis shaped foods.”). The words “f*
             <em>
              k” and “sh

             t” appear in the dialogue.

             It's true the father didn't see the other activities as being a problem (for a 6 year old to play) as he played the game with his son for a few days. (I doubt he saw the drug selling parts of the game).  The game is a parody of other games/movie scenes and has a lot of humor added in it seems, so for a parent who is used to more serious (violent) games, it may not have seemed like a big deal.

              Yep, already looked into the swedish end of things as much as I had the energy to for now (bed soon). Bit of a dead end there for me thus far. As previously mentioned though, the Activision angle keeps suspicion in the air.
