<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jarecki">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jarecki</a></p>
<p>Born to a Jewish-German family</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as a child, he fled Nazi Germany with his family for the United Kingdom and subsequently the United States. His wealthy family was able to transfer their wealth from occupied Poland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Academic and Doctor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He spent more than a decade as an academic, teaching at the <strong>Yale Medical School</strong>, and as a <strong>psychiatrist</strong> in private practice in New Haven, Connecticut, and at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. <strong>Jarecki remains an Adjunct Professor at Yale.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commodities Trading</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1967, Jarecki became involved with the London *<em>bullion house, Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid</em>/, Ltd. In 1969, he established the American counterpart to Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, known as <strong>Mocatta Metals Corporation</strong>.</p>
<p>After leaving Mocatta, Jarecki was the Chairman and lead investor in the <strong>movie information and ticketing company Moviefone</strong>, which was sold to AOL in 1999.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Science Philanthropy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More recently, he has helped the City of Heidelberg, Germany to develop a campus in Bahnstadt for young research-based companies, and has established <strong>PsychoGenics, a psycho- and neuro-pharmaceutical contract research and drug discovery company in Paramus, New Jersey.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hollywood</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Henry Jarecki has also been a motion pictures and theater producer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SJW Causes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jarecki is a leading advocate in Germany and the United States for refugees, calling for an alternative narrative on refugees, and stating, &quot;Giess Wasser zur Suppe und heiss alle willkommen,&quot; (&quot;Add water to the soup and make everyone welcome&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other Philanthropy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2004, he co-founded the Gloria and Henry Jarecki School in Ratanakiri, Cambodia.</p>
<p>He presently serves as a Governor of H. Lavity Stoutt Community College in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, as a trustee of the Island Resources Foundation, and <strong>founded the British Virgin Islands\' first youth center, the Youth Empowerment Project, in Tortola.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(That could use more digging!)</em></p>
<p>So I tried a search combination of Jarecki and Epstein. I came across a PDF from the Institute of International Education celebrating the 10th anniversary of their Scholar Rescue Fund. </p>
<p>Henry Jarecki is the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Institute of International Education. The IIE\'s Scholar Rescue Fund was established in 2002 by none other than Henry Jarecki.</p>
<p>Website here: <a href="https://www.iie.org/programs/scholar-rescue-fund">https://www.iie.org/programs/scholar-rescue-fund</a></p>
<p>PDF in question: <a href="http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/sites/default/files/pdf-articles/rescue_of_science_and_learning_0.pdf">http://www.scholarrescuefund.org/sites/default/files/pdf-articles/rescue_of_science_and_learning_0.pdf</a></p>
<p>In the PDF Jeffrey E. Epstein is listed as a donor.</p>
<p>The flight logs publicly available online are all from before 2008. So that means Dr. Henry Jarecki has at the least known Epstein for many years. And possibly continued their friendship even after Epstein went to jail. Friends or not, Jarecki and his Fund still openly accepted donations from Epstein through 2012 while other institutions were trying to hide any tiesnto the pedophile.</p>
<p>Also important to note, Dr. Henry Jaracki owns two islands in the British Virgin Islands. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jarecki has a home in Rye, New York and is also a part-time resident of the British Virgin Islands, where <strong>he owns two islands within the archipelago: Norman Island and Guana Island, both in the British Virgin Islands. Jarecki was made an honorary Belonger of the BVI.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy has escaped a lot of attention from this whole Epstein fallout, but it looks like there might be more to it. He and his son Nick Jarecki were both listed on the Epstein flight logs. </p>
<p>Nick Jarecki is another dig at well as some of the other leads here.</p>',

            , can you add this link to your post (we require every major claim have linked support (See Rule 2 in the sidebar), so we need a link to the flight log). Please state where/when in the document this guy's name appears. Also, you might want to note where he flew from and to. Thanks. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit.
