            FWIW - DWS was the first person to use the term "fake news", that I can identify.  She warned that anything coming out of Wikileaks in the next 48 hours was likely "fake news."

             Hi, This is complete nonsense.  The dossier existed for months before this LARPER on 4chan tried to take credit for it and, of course, he knew nothing of all the other parts of the dossier.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know how anyone over 14 would believe such silliness.

               You're a moron who believe what he reads on 4chan so you standards of proof are terrible, but for the other folks coming into this.
              </p>
              <p>
               We know who compiled the dossier.  We know he is an ex MI6 agent who used to work in Russia and now heads Orbis business intelligence.  He's a serious dude with a serious reputation.   We now he started this work way before the November election.  The work was intended to be used during the Republican primaries which started Feb 1st.  So he was mostly likely hired 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, the 4chan Larper didn't know this when he made his claim.  The information that Christorpher Steele wrote this came out afterwards.  Shortly after that the the 4chan Larper shut up because none of his claims matched the facts.
              </p>
              <p>
               The dossier was a series of ongoing reports.  The "Kompromat" material on Trump that the 4Chan Larper claimed to have created was reported by at least by June 2016.
              </p>
              <p>
               The 4chan Larper claimed to have created this story in November 2016, but didn't give any details.  Just I gave a fake story to Rick Wilson
               <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--beqI2jWi--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/xalqhh6ldpwqky5ybtup.png">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               and the 4 chan Larper got the distribution of this material completely wrong because he was unaware it can from Christopher Steele and unaware that Christopher Steele aleady passed the dossier to US and British intelligence and was already telling several news outlets to look into this story, he did not show them the dossier though.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mother Jones published on Oct 31st and mentioned that Harry Reid had email the FBI back in August about this.

              </p>
              <p>
               Reasons we know the dossier didn't come for 4chan.
              </p>
              <p>
               We now know who wrote it.
Investigative work would have started before Republican primaries, at least by December 2015.
Reports were published as early as June 2016.
               <br/>
               The June 2016 report included the Ritz Carlton Kompromat story that 4chan took credit for.
The reports were circulating during the summer of 2016.
Harry Reid references the Russian story in August.
Mother Jones references it OCT 31.
Nov 1 4chan LARPER  says I sent some fake story out, let's see if they bite.
Jan 10 Dossier is published.  Way more detailed than just the Kompromat story.  Larper probably never read this, because he never mentions the other parts.
Jan10-11 
Larper takes credit, says I wrote piss story.....though he didn't say anything about piss in Nov.....I gave it to Rick Wilson, he gave to Evan McMullen who had his CIA friends type it up, they gave it McCain and McCain called the FBI.
Christopher Steele is identified as the author and his identity will eventually be confirmed by several journalist he tried to get to publish this story.
              </p>
              <p>
               LARPer bullshit falls apart.

            If all you remember off the dossier is pissgate, you haven't read the dossier.  The piss "Kompromat" as the Russians call it is one part.  There are multiple other parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            One part that is said to be validated is a Russian diplomat named Kalugin was actually a spy.  Russia snatched him home quickly.  The US had surveillance on him before he left.

           <p>
            CNN did a story without mentioning any claims.  BuzzFeed published the dossier.  Many media outlets had the dossier, but mentioned it was unverified as did BuzzFeed right up front
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A dossier, compiled by a person who has claimed to be a former British intelligence official, alleges Russia has compromising information on Trump. The allegations are unverified, and the report contains errors.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Some of the errors were spelling errors.  Alfa bank was referred to as Alpha.  The spy's name was misspelled.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The point I'm trying to get at is that 'Pissgate' was likely fabricated and illegally pushed to these two outlets by Team Hillary.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Illegally?   What would be illegal?  And we know how the dossier got commissioned. It was from a Republican opponent of Trump who hired a group to do opposition reaserch, they subcontracted to Orbis intelligence which is headed by an exMI6 agent Christopher Steele.  He went to his Russian sources and put the reports together.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the Republican primary a Democratic group paid for his work, but not the Hillary campaign.  Steele kept working without pay after the election.  Steele also sent the dossier to British and US intelligence in 2016.  He then tried to get jounalists interested in the story
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the fake dossier aimed at Trump right after he took office, was instantly debunked by Trump's administration?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            How was it instantly debunked by the Trump Administration?  I'm genuined curious as to what you are referring to.  Also it was published before Trump took office during the Obama Administration.

             "News outlets" publishing the equivalent of tabloid drivel is the real news here. Unverified claims are not stories. journalism 101. This should red pill anyone that cares and the story being so stupid  proves how flippant the whole thing is. This is them broadcasting to the world that their standard of journalism is literally 0. Based on their criteria they could literally publish anything as "unverified news."
            </p>
            <p>
             At some point ...if you keep believing them... that is on you. Just don't say no one tried to warn you.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wouldn't be surprised if they were to release the "unverified dossier on pence's time travel collusion conspiracy" next. If you want to write the news make 4chan jokes. If you want to read the news have standards.

              CNN's story is solid and is based on the fact that the US intel agencies found this document substantial enough to brief to the President.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.
              </p>
              <p>
               The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.
The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers.
One reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took the extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing documents was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington, multiple sources tell CNN.
These senior intelligence officials also included the synopsis to demonstrate that Russia had compiled information potentially harmful to both political parties, but only released information damaging to Hillary Clinton and Democrats. This synopsis was not an official part of the report from the intelligence community case about Russian hacks, but some officials said it augmented the evidence that Moscow intended to harm Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's, several officials with knowledge of the briefings tell CNN.
               <strong>
                &gt;The two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials.
               </strong>
               ...
              </p>
              <p>
               At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations. But, in preparing this story, CNN has spoken to multiple high ranking intelligence, administration, congressional and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign officials and others in the private sector with direct knowledge of the memos.
Russia denies having "Kompromat" on Donald Tump
Some of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer. What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.

              Notice that main point of the document was not Kompromat, but that Russian had mounted an influence campaign against Donald Trump and there was "a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government."

              We know that Kushner took several meetings with the Russians and even asked to communicate with them using Russia's own communication gear.  Flynn is no longer NSA because he lied about his meetings with the Russian ambassador.  After about a week of lies Donald Trump Jr has now admitted to meeting with intermediaries of the Russian government.  We know that the Russian ambassador told his superiors he discussed policy with Jeff Sessions.  We know that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation and we know that Trump wants Sessions to quit because of the Russian investigation.

              The dossier is about so much more than a night in a hotel room in Moscow.  And more and more evidence is propping up the general story it was telling.
