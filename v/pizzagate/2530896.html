<p>I honestly don\'t get it. How does your life improve if Hillary Clinton is arrested?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>KABOOM! </p>
<p>My head exploded upon reading this! Seriously, how the fuck can he even ask a question like this? Or defend her? Or give a SPOILER ALERT?!!!! What? Is he trying to be cute? He\'s anything but! </p>
<p>In the first place, he knows SHIT about ANYTHING going on in the DOJ, the FBI, or anyone else for that matter! I would hardly give credence to his opinion on legal matters involving The Cannibal Queen\'s culpability in any of the perversions or crimes that have taken place, but the circumstantial evidence is MORE THAN TROUBLING! Because it is, it HARDLY DESERVES A PASS! </p>
<p>In the second place, HTH can a Trump supporter, knowing all the shit we know, possibly NOT think that she should be arrested? And notice he doesn\'t even deny that she\'s committed crimes. He doesn\'t ask us WHICH of the numerous scandals do we think has enough traction to bring her down. Oh, no! Instead, he centers his question on nonsense! I mean, why is he hinging this question of this bitch going to jail on how it will improve our lives? </p>
<p>How did the arrest today of the sex traffickers improve any of our lives? It didn\'t put money in the bank. It didn\'t put food on the table, but doesn\'t knowing they won\'t be able to victimize women and children, and not use to money to fund other illicit schemes help us sleep better at night? Doesn\'t the fact that we know our government/ICE are taking action against these traffickers ease our minds and give us the security that we have a responsive government? In other words, think about how troubling it would have been if ICE issued a statement that they\'d found a trafficking ring, but wouldn\'t take action because it wouldn\'t improve any our lives. WE\'D BE LIVID! </p>
<p>So in case you didn\'t see this, now you do! There is no explanation or apology he could possibly offer that would clear this up for me. He is officially off my list of resources for information. Further, I hope his little shill indie journalist sham he\'s wearing falls apart! </p>

             The opening is Cernovich, pretending to be all professorial. We'll see if the movie lives up to this being as slick as the trailers.

            Q said there would be information and disinformation. What if POTUS has called on Cernovich to say what he's saying?
I dont agree with a lot of what he says but over all he's for Trump and against the corporate elite bankers. You gotta give your Trump supporters more grace and let people be wrong sometimes. I'd rather be in the trenches with a guy like Cernovich fighting these evil bastards, than with any Liberal. Everyone in an Army Unit won't all believe in the same things. The two things they gotta remember is why they are fighting and which team they are on.

             Look, I respect the hell out of you and what you said, but just no. Cernovich has nothing to do with Q. Nothing. If you trace him back, he's had very disturbing misogynist tweets. I mean, shockingly filthy and coarse. Like I said, while it wasn't enough to dislodge me from backing him, it did stick with me and planted some seeds of doubt. I mean, people do change ... and sometimes people going through a stressful situation act really, really badly. So maybe the tweets were an outgrowth of that, but in coming up with a scenario, I really was being an apologist. They were wrong and he was wrong. But this is an entirely different matter.

             In other words, it's one of the promises he ran on! One of the important ones. And now we have this guy going ahead and, in essence, ''normaliziing'' Clinton's behavior? And more or less putting the onus on those seeking justice for past crimes as somehow deranged because it won't improve our lives?

             I think that tells me all I need to know about this scumball. It more allows me a window to view his psychological holding cell because it's telling me that HE doesn't do anything without something improving HIS life. Whether it's momentarily or attracting attention to give him greater importance, he's not going to be motivated to do anything without the payoff. To hell with doing something because it'll improve OTHER people's lives. I guess that's an anathema to him. Some foreign concept to be reviled and loathed, but in justice, that's often what we do. We insist on punishment because it aids in healing a victim's life. Does he think Juanita Broaddrick wouldn't markedly be improved if Slick Willy had been convicted and gone to jail for what he did? Or would he claim her still speaking about the crime was foolish because at this point it wouldn't ''improve her life''?

             I'm done talking about this. Ether someone gets the monumental stupidity of uttering such a notion, or one doesn't. But I'm not on the enabler train anymore, and I'm not handing out free passes to pompous, self-serving assholes who want to make a name for themselves. And that's all Cernovich is.

              (who the hell is he again?) is because I'd BLOCKED him. If I have somebody blocked it's because they're a straight up asshole. No, I don't block people just because they say something mean. Or because they don't disagree. I do it because they're idiots/shills/disruptive and add nothing to the conversation. I also block when they seem to have a personal agenda in making life difficult for a select poster. Evidently, whatever set me off to block him fell into one of those categories, and now he's a Junior Moderator? You've got to be kidding me! There's a whole contingency on Voat that hates what I do and now they have someone to turn to a whine about what I post? Someone who's going to listen to this nonsense?

               i haven't the foggiest notion why you blocked me.  frankly i don't care.  you are likely the only user on this entire platform that has.  i aim to treat everyone fairly and with respect, which i'm confident i've done since i joined this community in Nov. '16.

               you obviously don't share my values, which is fine.  it's not a rule here to be mutually respectful.  personally, though, i don't care too much for your insulting, overly hysterical reaction to a simple 24hr edit flair. 
but so is the life of a lowly janitor...we evidently need to deal with a lot of crap.

               I vetted all of the mods pretty thoroughly and would never choose someone who is an enemy to PG or to investigators. Could you tell me what it was specifically that caused you to think he was someone you needed to block? I have never seen anything shillish or disruptive from him...he is particularly mild-mannered and noninflammatory (one of the main reasons I invited him to mod -- he doesn't get caught up in flame wars).

               I wonder if there is a chance you misunderstood something he said at some point? Do you typically reply to notifications through your inbox rather than from the thread comment tree? If so, you may have misconstrued a comment of his as a reply to you when it was a reply to someone commenting in one of your submissions. For example, if Donkey or one of our other termites said something shitty, and ben replied to his comment, you may have thought he was attacking you when he was really defending you, just as you apparently did with exposethecriminals in comments of this thread, when they were trying to help you.

                This. I could possibly have misconstrued something. I do read comments through my Inbox most times. As to what it was, I don't know. I absolutely don't remember.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, I just got a message from think- saying I'd blocked him on his first day on VOAT. I'll take his/her word for that. That was months ago, so for me to block someone their first day ... I don't know. It really shifts me back to thinking that I didn't misunderstand anything and that the block was justified. And since he's been blocked, I haven't seen any of his other comments. 99% of the time, I don't read blocked responses. It's why I didn't even know who he was and thought either you or think- had flaired the thread.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's not like I have a vendetta against him. If I did, I'd at least remember his name. And if his being onboard allows you to get some sleep, more power to the arrangement.

                 I don't either, but like I said, I don't block people unless they're behaving in a way that suggests they need blocking. And we'll agree to disagree. Lots of times, there's someone that other people like, and I don't. Doesn't make them bad, just means I don't get along with them.

             This is what I mean! These fucking shills push themselves to the front and get PR! And it's funny that authentic pizzagate journalists -- like David Seaman got thoroughly pushed out! Even though he was a LEGITIMATE JOURNALIST! He got sick, his friend was murdered, people posted all sorts of shit, AND he got BANNED FROM TWITTER FOR LIFE! If that isn't hardcore, I don't know what is!

              Oh gosh I don't know anything about Cernovich, I could never watch his videos.

              I'm not a shill.  I posted the Vanity Fair link to your thread to try to help you because the mod said the thread would be deleted without something tying MC to PG.

               Your personal opinion of Cernovich aside, I'm failing to see how this post is directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate (Rule 1). Perhaps this would be a more suitable post for
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever

              <p>
               That said, you (and the community) have 24hrs to establish a direct link between Cernovich and #pg.

                has been a mod almost as long as think-, MP. He's just doing his job. You can't expect mods to know everything, especially since Thermobitcth was outed as a shill early in 2017 and no one on this sub has taken him seriously in a year. I didn't see your post before you edited it, but Ben was right to flair it if you just shared the tweet link and your opinion and disgust with that huckster, without explaining the role he played early on. We get noobs in here all the time, and we need to give background information. This is a research sub, remember? :-)

                 All I know is that I blocked him and never blocked think-. That tells me all I need to know.

                <p>
                 And I don't expect anything, but a leading shyster promoting pizzagate? I would think anyone involved in the subject would know how he's involved. As for the suggestion of putting the post in politics, Cernovich aligned himself with Dershowitz in the Epstein sex with a minor case. How is that political? And it's not ''whatever'' either since pizzagate has focused on Dershowitz and Epstein for months and months now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And I didn't know think- either. I only became aware of think- when
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/s/he">
                  s/he
                 </a>
                 was introduced. I'm just here to post. I don't get into who's a  mod or who's not. And I was confused because I'd blocked him/her and didn't get a notification. Not even for the reason. I found out when I read through the submission and saw he was blocked. I was like, no ... the block couldn't be because of this guy/girl, so I clicked ''show'' and read.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In summary, this is my problem that someone I think is an asshole is a mod and not yours. I'm sure this person does not talk to you the way

                  If a mod is being shitty to legit users, I need to know about it. That said, when I chose mods, I read their comment histories back months to make sure they were fair, not pushing any one agenda, and had the well-being of the whole community at heart. Please let me know why you think there is a problem.

            I agree with you.  How would it improve anyone's life?  Just one example, any 12-year old could read the circumstances around the 100+ Clinton-connected deaths, with the Clintons' names replaced with pseudonyms if need be, and know those two are very hazardous to people's and society's health, and might be mass murderers, by proxy.

             Exactly! I was walking around fuming thinking of the federal prosecutors, whistleblowers, friends, Haitian officials, and ex-Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown! Need I mention Nancy Schaefer! No, I don't think Killary went to the house and personally murdered her and her husband -- how could she on those CANKLES!!!! But who was behind what was concluded to be a murder/suicide? Who would it benefit to silence her and keep all the names she was going to release, and all the crimes CPS was committing a secret? For her alone, somebody should burn in hell!
            </p>
            <p>
             And do I need to mention Seth Rich? WHO WAS BEHIND THAT? Geeeee ....
            </p>
            <p>
             But how is it going to improve our lives to find out who FUCKING MURDERED SETH RICH AND PUT THAT PERSON IN FUCKING JAIL?
            </p>
            <p>
             So ricidulous!

           <p>
            Your personal opinion of Cernovich aside, I'm failing to see how this post is directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate (Rule 1).  Perhaps this would be a more suitable post for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            or
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/politics">
             v/politics
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, you (and the community) have 24hrs to establish a direct link between Cernovich and #pg.

             MP has added links, so I'm removing the flair. Thanks ben. Cernovich is directly related because he was trying to help Dershowitz unseal the court records of Epstein's underage victims while posing as a Trump supporter. Also, he was one of the early proponents of Pizzagate, before the election during the initial Wikileaks drops. It was quite a while back, and he's a huckster. Goats figured his BS out pretty early on. (RebelSkum and JrSlimss busted him via legal docs on the Epstein thing).
