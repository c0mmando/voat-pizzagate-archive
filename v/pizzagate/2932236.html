<p>Looking into Jet Blue Airways a bit further, we find a Podesta Group connection:</p>
<p>Emails show Podesta Group’s work for Pro Russia Ukrainian Political party- <a href="https://artvoice.com/2018/05/22/emails-show-podesta-groups-work-for-pro-russia-ukrainian-political-party/#.XCC7a1xKg2x">https://artvoice.com/2018/05/22/emails-show-podesta-groups-work-for-pro-russia-ukrainian-political-party/#.XCC7a1xKg2x</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, the new emails show then-Obama White House Counselor John Podesta, lobbying on behalf of the Podesta Group’s efforts to secure a maintenance facility from Jet Blue and Lufthansa for Puerto Rico. </p>
<p>In a June 27, 2013, email former U.S. Ambassador to Germany and current New Jersey Gov. Philip D. Murphy writes to John Podesta, Minister-Counselor for Economic Affairs at the American Embassy in Berlin Seth Winnick, and others:</p>
<p>Jet Blue and Lufthansa are considering 2 locations for a maintenance center – Puerto Rico or Mexico. The Governor of PR wants this badly. The question is can we get to LH at the right levels to make the case. Either John or colleague OR John’s brother Tony or colleague will get to us with more details.</p>
<p>Winnick then writes to John Podesta: “Washington alerted us to this advocacy issue and we are on it. Phil will try to connect in the next few days and we will follow up.”
Later that day, in an email sent to his brother Tony Podesta and Winnick, John Podesta writes: “Thanks Seth. The Governor is a friend of mine. My brother Tony represents Puerto Rico and will follow up with details.”</p>
<p>Winnick replies to John and Tony Podesta: “Happy to help on this one. I think we have the details we need for now from SelectUSA at Commerce but will come back if any issues arise.”</p>
<p>Puerto Rico was selected by the airlines for the facility to service A320s in 2014.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;JetBlue is already the dominant carrier in the Caribbean, with a strong hub in Puerto Rico,&quot; Lufthansa Technik Puerto Rico CEO Elmar Lutter told Avionics Magazine. “Spirit flies into Aguadilla as well what makes exchanging aircraft between operations and maintenance extremely easy. Spirit has been an LHT customer for a long time. Puerto Rico is as ideal a location as Florida without the upward pressure on prices and wages there.&quot;.  </p>

<p>Both Spirit Airlines and JetBlue — which diverted 1709 flight to Santo Domingo and sent it to Fort Lauderdale Friday night &quot;due to the civil unrest,&quot; announced flight cancellations Saturday into Port-au-Prince. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the article blames raised gas prices for the rioting.  This is far from the truth.. the Haitians have been protesting the occupation (as they see it) of their country by \'peace forces\' like the UN and NGOs.  They want international organisations out because of the ongoing abuse (including pedophilia) and the stealing of their natural resources.  Haitian lawyer and activist Ezili Danto explains: </p>

           <p>
            In a June 27, 2013, email former U.S. Ambassador to Germany and current New Jersey Gov. Philip D. Murphy writes to John Podesta, Minister-Counselor for Economic Affairs at the American Embassy in Berlin Seth Winnick, and others:
           </p>
           <p>
            Jet Blue and Lufthansa are considering 2 locations for a maintenance center – Puerto Rico or Mexico. The Governor of PR wants this badly. The question is can we get to LH at the right levels to make the case. Either John or colleague OR John’s brother Tony or colleague will get to us with more details.
           </p>
           <p>
            Winnick then writes to John Podesta: “Washington alerted us to this advocacy issue and we are on it. Phil will try to connect in the next few days and we will follow up.”
Later that day, in an email sent to his brother Tony Podesta and Winnick, John Podesta writes: “Thanks Seth. The Governor is a friend of mine. My brother Tony represents Puerto Rico and will follow up with details.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Winnick replies to John and Tony Podesta: “Happy to help on this one. I think we have the details we need for now from SelectUSA at Commerce but will come back if any issues arise.”

           Note that the article blames raised gas prices for the rioting.  This is far from the truth.. the Haitians have been protesting the occupation (as they see it) of their country by 'peace forces' like the UN and NGOs.  They want international organisations out because of the ongoing abuse (including pedophilia) and the stealing of their natural resources.  Haitian lawyer and activist Ezili Danto explains:

           <p>
            Annette de la Renta (born 24 December 1939) is an American philanthropist and socialite, the widow of the Dominican fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. She was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1973.[1]
           </p>
           <p>
            On 26 July 2006, Annette de la Renta was appointed temporary guardian of the 104-year-old Brooke Astor, a long-time friend, in the wake of elder abuse allegations being made against Astor's son, Anthony Dryden Marshall.[citation needed] On 13 October 2006, de la Renta became permanent guardian.[citation needed] On 20 October 2014, her husband, Oscar de la Renta, died of cancer, at age 82.[12]
           </p>
           <p>
            De la Renta serves on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum, the New York Public Library, the Morgan Library, the Animal Medical Center, and the Engelhard Foundation. She also served on the board of directors of ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY  for 25 years, and now serves as a trustee emeritus.[13]

            She and her husband had a close relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton and a couple of other names listed.The Kissingers, Charlie Rose and Barbara Walters
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton and Henry Kissinger: It’s Personal. Very Personal.
           </p>
           <p>
            What Clinton did not mention was that her bond with Kissinger was personal as well as professional, as she and her husband have for years regularly spent their winter holidays with Kissinger and his wife, Nancy, at the beachfront villa of fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, who died in 2014, and his wife, Annette, in the Dominican Republic.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clintons and Kissingers appear to spend a chunk of their quality time together at that de la Renta estate in the Punta Cana resort. Last year, the Associated Press noted that this is where the Clintons take their annual Christmas holiday. And other press reports in the United States and the Dominican Republic have pointed out that the Kissingers are often part of the gang the de la Rentas have hosted each year. When Oscar de la Renta died in 2014, the New York Times obituary reported:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Over Christmas the Kissingers were among the close group who gathered in Punta Cana, including Barbara Walters, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Charlie Rose. “We have two house rules,” says Oscar, laughing. “There can be no conversation of any substance and nothing nice about anyone.”
</code></pre>
           <p>
            This gathering of the Clintons, the Kissingers, and the de la Rentas seems to occur most years. In 2011, de la Renta, a native of the Dominican Republic, told Vogue that he built this seaside estate so he could host his close friends, and he cited the Kissingers and Clintons as examples. “At Christmas,” he said, “we’re always in the same group.”

             Great post. Key players. Why the Dominican Republic?
Oscar was WELL connected and talented. He is a key to all sorts of relationships. Here is an excellent in-depth article on his life. MUST READ. Here's some info on his house in Dominican Republic :  “He loves their house in Kent, Connecticut, where he’s created gardens that supply “the most spiritual and purest of joys,” and the house in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where he has built an orphanage and day care center that serves more than 1,200 children."   "Their dinner parties – in their homes in Manhattan, Connecticut and the Dominican Republic – were legendary, mixing old and new money with fashion, entertainment and politics."  "“He works side-by-side with his stepdaughter, he dotes on his adopted son Moises, and he has an enormously wide range of close friends, all of whom say pretty much the same thing that Nancy Kissinger did years ago: “Oscar and Annette are the two most thoughtful people I’ve ever known.”"
            </p>
            <p>
             "In June 2001, he created a garden for Lord Jacob Rothschild at Waddesdon Manor, the turreted French château-style home built for the Rothschild family in Buckinghamshire, England. Read more about it here."
 " Life in the social world’s elite advanced for Oscar when he became the third husband of Françoise de Langlade in 1967....She had been a mistress of Baron Elie de Rothschild, and married firstly to French businessman Jean Bruère, and secondly, diplomat Nicholas Bagenow."

"Chelsea Clinton reveals designer Oscar de la Renta personally knit a dress for her nine-month-old daughter Charlotte just weeks before he died
The former first daughter, 35, told an A-list audience at the CFDA Awards that the designer sent her a knitted pink dress for her baby
Chelsea said the gift, which she received weeks before the designer died, was 'among the last - if not the very last thing - he ever made'
She also credits Mr. de la Renta, who made her wedding dress, with helping her to be less of a wallflower  "
REMEMBER, CLINTON FOUNDATION PAID FOR CHELSEA'S WEDDING....

              Yes, we have learned to read between the lines.  Orphanage, day care center, 1,200 Children.  His adopted son Moises.  His wife Annette was not very kind to the son.  I wonder where and how did he find this boy?  What was their relationship.  I also read that Oscar was involved with sugar plantations.  A dirty business.  The connections with the Rothschilds do make one wonder how far this all goes.  These people make me sick.  Their gardens and chateaus.   I read the Mother Jones article about 2 years ago and was shocked.  Walters and Rose?  Really?  Now look what has become of Rose.  He and Kissinger are very good friends, very close.  They deserve each other.  Kissinger is beyond old.  He needs to go.  Wonder what makes him live so long when he looks as he does. Hmm.

              Moises de la Renta: Oscar's adopted son....
             </p>
             <p>
              "Oscar de la Renta snubbed adopted son in will
             </p>
             <p>
              Moises de la Renta, adopted by Oscar from an orphanage in their native Dominican Republic, was left a relatively threadbare portion of his dad’s $26 million estate — and was warned that if he ever tried to contest the will, he would be cut out completely, court documents show.
Moises, 30, had angered his dad by launching his own women’s fashion line in 2005."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Oscar said he adopted Moises, then just 24 hours old, after his first wife, Francoise, died of cancer.
“I never thought I would get married again. I thought my son and I would have each other,’’ he said."

             Headwaters Relief Organization is a Minnesota-based, non-profit disaster relief organization that organizes volunteers to support the emotional, cleanup and rebuilding needs of families and communities ravaged by disaster.
Our mission is to bring hope and build resilience to people and communities following a natural disaster.
Headwaters seeks to inspire passion to serve others. We forge connections between those who are being served, the Headwaters team and the community at large. We work to ensure that every volunteer, regardless of age, background, skills, or experience, feels valued and motivated to continue to serve others. 
Our volunteers learn to recognize, respect, and value differences. In doing this work, Headwaters volunteers build stronger communities and a better world for all.

              "Headwaters Relief Organization traveled to Haiti in March, with a medical team performing clinics in a remote part of Haiti and seeing nearly 350 patients in 4 days.  Members of the team also conducted research studying the impact of disaster on children, a research project being done in conjunction with Georgetown University.  The team of doctors were also able to visit our sponsored orphanages to see to the medical needs of the children who live there."

            <p>
             Ezili Danto, NY/Haiti human rights lawyer is reporting the following (I have no way to validate, but she often seems to be "in the know"): "There's a DECHOUKAJ (uprooting) list circulating everywhere targeting corrupt politicians and repugnant oligarchs to clean the swamp."
            </p>
            <p>
             26) She states: "The illegitimate government is facing the fiercest resistance since Obama-Clinton stole the election for them. Kenneth Merten and his career economic hitmen are scrabbling to stop Trump from cleaning the swamp with his own solution."
            </p>
            <p>
             27) She states: "The demonstrators have burnt the Clinton edifices in Haiti, including the Oasis Hotel, the Best Western Hotel, the Digicel building was attacked. They pummeled the NATCOM building. The airport is barricaded with trucks and flaming tires.

            <p>
             60) More reports from Ezili: "The U.S. State Department, headed by former CIA head, Pompeo are talking to the "key" opposition to the current government. They are not opposed to getting rid of the Obama-Clinton travesty, however..."
            </p>
            <p>
             61) Ezili: "there are also, career diplomats with nearly 40 years of career machinations to maintain Haiti's poverty, chaos and indirect occupation which has never stopped since 1915. Men like Thomas Shannon, Kenneth Merten, Larry Swing, and..." #Haiti
            </p>
            <p>
             62) Ezili: "Thomas Adams, who have worked for both Bill Clinton &amp; the Bush Dynasty Administrations are still in play in Haiti and running things for the global oligarchs, Deep State, and big business.
             <strong>
              The current Trump Ambassador comes out of this heritage &amp; held UN titles also."
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             63) Ezili: "So, it's against this background you have these "meetings" happening between the usual suspects to "calm the streets," or otherwise buy off the so-called opposition "leadership." We've seen this hundred of times." #Haiti

              The Rothschild connection to CEMEX is clear. Bronfman E.L. Rothschild L.P., a wealth management firm for high net value clients, owns a substantial share of the concrete giant:

             They sold most of their shares (IIRC at the beginning of this year??) though.

             Interestingly, Soros bought more CEMEX shares around the same time, almost as many as the Rothschild's sold IIRC.

              Back on Earth, Pizza Hut has guest-starred in more than 19 movies and was even the first pizza ever delivered to the White House — and the recipient was none other than the late Barbara Bush. The order was made in 1989 by the then-first lady, who was throwing a pizza party for her “Reading Is Fundamental” program, the largest nonprofit children’s literacy organization in the country. (Pizza Hut has a similar reading program called “BOOK IT!”)
             </p>
             <p>
              Reading is Fundamental  (the largest nonprofit Children's literacy org. in the country)  This should be looked into.  Especially since she has been linked to Rainbow Cultural Garden (Rainbow Cult-ural)   and her just being a Bush   Also the Book It Org. 
These both involve Children and that is frightening to me.  A Bush involved with Kids and a Pizza Co. with Kids.  Scary.
