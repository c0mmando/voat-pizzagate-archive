<p>Atlanta is a big, Southern city that boasts a lot of money, heavy traffic with immediate access to the Interstate highway system, and an International Airport. The moving of victims in and out of cities like Atlanta is relatively easy, given the right connections - political and otherwise. Given its growth over the past few decades, it\'s easy to envision ATL as a major hub in the trafficking, rape, torture, and murder of children. The above links, among several to other such stories, bear this out. Perhaps this is why Ben Swann was shut down so swiftly and so definitively. Further investigation required...</p>',

            Yep, to it all. I live just outside of Atlanta. I do not have links as I am a heart centered participant with integrity. What is being talked about at my place of work is WTF, how are homeless person/people being blamed for what is stored under our overpasses? Where is oversight, what is being stored there and why? Who's job is it to know these things? To summarize, and I do wish for you to see hope amidst seeming nuttiness (I refuse to say chaos as that plants seeds of fear) and we done had generations of that. Things are changing. We communicate now, one on one. The BS is planting the seeds of its own destruction because it is blind to truth and light. I refuse in the strongest terms to be afraid anymore. Amen to what I just said. Woof!

             yeah hate to keep harping on this, but again Ms Hnyh was allegedly shot within a half hour of filing the FOIA on the phony bridge collapse (not phony in that it didn't collapse but phony cuz it almost certainly involved explosives as opposed to 3 crackheads igniting spare non combustible cables).  She was an "in house" lawyer for  UPS,  and apparently their trucks had been re routed before the "collapse".  Hnyh had experience in construction litigation.  I really think the death relates to the bridge, but if there's more info on her litigation against elite traffickers i'm all ears
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd hat to think that the powers that be use pg to divert from the real story (her looking into the collapse)

              I think it's the other way around. They blew the bridge up to distract from Trinh Huynh's pedo investigations. I could be wrong, but it seems pretty unlikely that she would be filing for FOIA material so soon after the disaster, before internal assessments are completed. Atlanta is a CIA hub. This is a warning to the Trump-authorized anti-pedo crusaders: attempts to get too high up in the pedo prosecution will be met with massive resistance through costly sabotage, blamed on muslim terrorism (ISIS-style explosives are said to have been used.)

               IDK either.  I think the isis angle re the bridge is inaccurate.  if you check YT vids re the 'collapse' there's an unmarked helicopter flying overhead as it happens,  all i know is the bridge collapse story is very fishy, the woman was suspicious of it and had expertise in that area, and was shot right after she makes a formal request for info.  it could be a message allright such as do not look into this.  again, your theory could be more right but i'm still thinking it's the bridge.  Again my thinking could change if she was actually working on an elite trafficking case but so far, other than a headline, there's no info on that (other than she volunteers time to an organization that could theoretically do such a case)

             You said it. Don't forget that earlier in the day of the I85 collapse a deranged person claiming to carry 'red mercury' was the supposed cause of an extensive HAZMAT situation downtown at the Region 2 location of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
