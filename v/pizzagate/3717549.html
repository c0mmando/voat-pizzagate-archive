<blockquote>
<p>YOU are headlining a finance event in support of Hillary for America at the home of Tony Podesta. Tony was the driving force behind this event. The purpose of the event is to raise money from Tony’s network and engage a different set of supporters involved in the Washington, DC metro area food scene. This event is expected to raise $75,000.</p>
<p>Tony was very interested in hosting a cooking fundraising event similar to the event he hosted last October with <strong>Chef James Alefantis</strong>, Chef Amy Brandwein and Chef Massimo Fabbri. Carla Hall is a personal friend of Frank and Sylvia White.  They brought her on board to help him host a food-focused fundraiser. </p>
<p>Carla Hall and I speculate that churchyards might indeed be the ultimate origin of this seemingly odd triumvirate of food. Fish frys have long been popular as a tasty and affordable meal for large gatherings. Logistically it can be prepared and served fresh out of the fryer in large batches, and it\'s easier and quicker than something such as fried chicken or barbecue. Spaghetti, too, is cheap and easy, and slaw, well, that just has to go on everything in the South.</p>
<p>Add some pickles, mustard (because ketchup would be gross), onions and hot sauce and it\'s a done deal. <strong>Fried fish</strong> may be a pan-Southern dish, and versions like this have been found as far away as South Carolina, but this particular amalgamation is rooted deeply in Nashville. </p>
<p>We get back in the car and head over to <strong>Ed\'s Fish and Pizza</strong>, arguably the oldest established fish sandwich joint in town, open since 1972. At 3 p.m. on a Friday it\'s busy, with cars snaking around back to the window and a steady pilgrimage through the front door. Loyalty, like grease, hangs in the air. To a person, they all declare Ed\'s &quot;the best.&quot;Owner Anthony Drumwright avoids questions and points me to a customer sitting at the small counter, saying, &quot;These people are repeaters.&quot;</p>
