In this pizzagate investigation, examining the lingo and possible code language of the more minor players around Podesta, Alefantis and others constitute much of the circumstantial &quot;orgy of evidence&quot; pointing at a Satanist child trafficking subculture that flourishing in DC for at least the last 10 years - from guys who built child size coffins for a hobby and dug underground tunnels at night, to moms who made sure kids where in the pool to entertain adult male dinner guests, &quot;spirit oooking&quot; dinners at private homes, and so on.  
</p>
<p>Tony raised some eyebrows with this strangely specific comment about his and John\'s mother Mary when she died <a href="https://www.thenationalherald.com/11823/mother-of-chief-of-staff-to-bill-clinton-podesta-dies-at-89/">comment</a> &quot;She had two sons, <strong>but she adopted another 25 people during the time she came to Washington, said her older son</strong>, Tony Podesta, a Washington public affairs strategist.&quot;  The usual figure of speech would be more like, &quot;She had two sons, but adopted a whole lot of our friends over the years.&quot;</p>
<p>The article adds, re: mother Mary Podesta- &quot;So its no surprise that once Mrs. Podesta moved to Washington, D.C., to be closer to her sons, <strong>she took to cooking at political fund-raisers.</strong> (any spirit cooking?)  What is surprising is how <strong>she became a celebrity of sorts<strong>...Mrs. Podesta, known to many of the nations Democratic elite as Mama Podesta, died Friday in Washington from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was 88...</strong>She had two lives.</strong> She was a wife and mother in Chicago, but then...&quot; etc...</p>
<p>Who were the 25 mother Mary Podesta &quot;adopted&quot;?  Was it a group of devoted Satanists that she assumed a leadership role over as an elder female High Priestess?  Let\'s look -</p>
<p>At about 4:55 in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdRx4nRUJg8">video</a> you are viewing a Podesta wikileaks email originally written by Tamara Luzzato, the DC lobbyist and the mom who assured Podesta that for a dinner party &quot;the kids will be in that pool&quot; when he visited.  Here, just after wife Mary Podesta is involved in a car accident in May of 2010, Luzatto offers that since she is &quot;...hearing from book people galore, I thought I\'d better send this out.  At your and Mary\'s service to guide <strong>a circle of 25</strong> or so <strong>totally devoted fellow readers</strong>, but also friends, and again, anything else I can do to just keep people informed.  <strong>I hope I worded this suitably or aptly or whatever</strong>.&quot;  Here Tamara is afraid to misstep and so hopes she speaks carefully enough - why?  And here is a specific reference to 25 - the 25 that Mother Podesta &quot;adopted&quot; perhaps?   Finally <strong>she offers &quot;pain for her pain&quot;</strong> which isn\'t the most common way to say Get Well Soon,  but makes a bit more sense in light of our new understanding of &quot;spirit cooking&quot; circles.  Marina Abramovic\'s theatrical blood ritual performance art uses similar lingo.  
</p>
<p>Later in the video we see an email (5:56)Luzzato writes to John Podesta about the accident of &quot;OUR Mary&quot; - Mary Podesta who is in &quot;our own circle&quot;, and who drives her to their &quot;book group&quot; of &quot;devoted readers&quot;.   She writes that she is at Podesta\'s service &quot;to guide the circle of 25&quot;   This is likely the string of about 25 names (26 plus Luzzatos email) that is also shown.  
</p>
<p>She informs the group (4:35) that in her talks with Mary who drove her to the &quot;book group&quot;, Mary declared her &quot;love for her family, Truckee, AND our own circle - we really did talk about all that, SO I will refrain from saying what I REALLY think about a vehicle hitting her or why this all happened to her.&quot;   Since they REALLY did talk about that, does that mean that the 25 the email went out to can be assured that Mary\'s devotion to the group is not in question... The whole train of thought and speech is decidedly odd.  Finding out what &quot;Truckee&quot; is might be interesting.</p>
<p>Earier in the video (2:34) Luzzato writes to Podesta  - &quot;I will try to keep sending word, or find a way that you get word, and when we can all do something to help.  I and our other <strong>Mary Followers</strong> will round up ways to truly help&quot;   Sorry, this just isn\'t your usual book club or bible study group.  
</p>
<p>Thelema Favor email -  (2:09 same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdRx4nRUJg8">video</a>Is a forwarded email from wife Mary to John with the subject line &quot;Thelema favor&quot;, a hard to explain away reference to Aleister Crowley\'s (self-proclaimed Great Beast) cult religion of ritual Satanist worship called Thelema.  At the top of this email, it is clear that Podesta has recently changed his email the writer, another &quot;John&quot; goes through Podesta\'s mother Mary to reach him.  This favor is no small thing - a meeting with the US President for the mother of a friend\'s family doctor who is in &quot;Love&quot; with Obama.  Really?   Of course Washington runs on favors, and a &quot;Thelema favor&quot; must be a special one.  
</p>
<p>Do these emails help us reconstruct the barely suppressed lingo of a cult group of about 25 or so close knit people who meet regularly but not in a way that can be openly discussed?  This is a group that you have to worry about how you are &quot;aptly&quot; phrasing your words, in fact.   (Sorry that these emails are on video, I need help if anyone cares to assist in obtaining the original emails from Wikileaks.  I just turned the sound off on the video, enlarged them and read them for myself.)</p>
<p>Now here\'s where it gets a bit weirder.  From &quot;Spellbound: Women and Witchcraft in America, pg. 255 <a href="https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ZVd7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=aleister+crowley,+25,+coven&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=72M34_V_Ny&amp;sig=viPE4iW62GxHM_4qh8Se0wFEPfc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxm9mM8v7QAhWMlZQKHcUwAtEQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aleister%20crowley%2C%2025%2C%20coven&amp;f=false">Here</a>)<br />
Gerald Gardiner was an admirer of Crowley, and elaborated on Crowley\'s Thelema witchcraft rituals by being &quot;the first to promote and publicize a magical-religious pantheaon headed by The Goddess, an idea which he seems to have gotten in part from the writings of C.G. Leland, a folklorist who described late 19th century witch cults in Italy....Gardner\'s rituals had a number of Crowley-like aspects: <strong>Rituals were to be done in the nude; sexual arousal was a source of magical power;</strong> the High Priestess was to perform <strong>sex acts with the High Priest (if not the whole of the male congregation); flogging and brandishment of knives (dominoes?) went hand in hand with a mythology of ritual incest (mother/son) and human sacrifice.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the Gardinarian tradition has a strong tradition of female leadership (reference same book and page as above), and this string of emails underlines the importance of Podesta\'s mother, his wife, a female doctor\'s elder mother, and the central role Tamara Luzzato plays within this &quot;book circle&quot;.  The fact that many of these women come from Italian heritage is also interesting, considering the Gardnarian connection to Goddess oriented witchcraft from Italy as recently as a century ago.</p>
<p>Final thought - Politics and Prose comes to mind when discussing a &quot;book circle&quot; that would be right on ground zero of the businesses surrounding Comet Pizza.  It has been pointed out elsewhere that it has a spiral pedo symbol in it\'s logo and a stairs to lead to a portion of the bookstore that is in a &quot;basement&quot; level.  
</p>
<p>If you got all the way here, hope this stimulates some ideas and discussion.</p>',

            I went looking for Mary Podesta's original obituary on line so I could post the link and it is no where to be found. I typed exact wording found in that article it is no longer available on line.  I looked it at a couple of times it was available on the first google page that came up  but not anymore...weird.

             Are you saying her obit is gone, or the article with the Podesta comment about "adopted 25 children"?   There is only one copy of that now it seems, whereas it had been picked up and was in several papers before...It is archived here -

            Hi - i somehow never saw this.  I will say that someone looked it up from voat and could find no record of any adoptions.  Also Mama Podesta would have been getting on in years a bit by the time she came to DC - 60s or so?  Doesn't mean she couldn't adopt, but unlikely to adopt 25 lol.  I think fostering was looked at too, can't remember on that one but certainly nothing of signifigance.

            This may be nothing but I just stumbled on this email and when I googled Lucy Uriel it brought up the Lucifer television series.  Could there be more to this or could it be spam.  Looks like it was a linked in account...

            Tbh I never thought much about the pool email until reading this. "Classy" people tend to speak retarded in general.  Good job.

            One thing to note though is not all Crowley followers are Satanists or Luciferians. Given the spirit cooking and everything else we know it is my opinion that they fall into the Theistic Luciferian category. I don't think they are 
Satanists

            Somewhat off topic I went to Barnes &amp; Noble while Christmas shopping, and first thing I see on this big round table display center isle is a book by Marina Abramović. I couldn't help but think it was only put there because of pizzagate. Maybe just a coincidence.

              Agree. Also, people tend to dismiss these claims when everything is considered "satanism." The belief systems between Satanists and Luciferians are fundamentally different.

            There is a string of emails planning their family vacation. They go to Truckee and pose in front of a hair salon with an Illuminati pyramid logo. A few interesting photos attached, lots of hand symbols.

            Let's also not forget: Tamera Luzzatto was Hillary Clinton's CHIEF OF STAFF when she was a Senator in New York. Before that, Tam worked for JAY ROCKEFELLER. She and her husband, David Leiter, refer to themselves jokingly in one email as "Frank and Claire U(nderwood" from House of Cards...She's high up on the food chain.

            Truckee is the town John Podesta has his vacation home based on what I have researched.  It looks like it is in the same area where the Donner party was found.

             Yup, Truckee Lake is where several of the families were camped that had to cannibalize each other to survive. Interesting that Podesta owned a home in Truckee also.

             I have been to Truckee, it is indeed very near at the
             <strong>
              DONNER PARTY/PASS
             </strong>
             it is also near North Lake Tahoe and the Cali-Nevada border.  The North Tahoe area was a big time haunt for Sinatra and I think a whole ton of other celebrities too, possibly old school CIA involved ones.
