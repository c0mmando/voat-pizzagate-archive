<p>I\'m thinking something along the lines of a forum/wiki to organize information, and an IRC network for real-time discussions.

All public IRC channels and moderation logs from the site would be published to prove that no censorship is taking place.</p>
<p>reddit and voat are definitely great places to organize the majority of the community, but it is far too easy for important content to be buried or locked down by site admins.

            Here I am and take my upvote :)
           </p>

            I think the website is a good idea, I also feel like we need to somehow have a "storefront" which looks like a MSM website (meaning by that all the graphic standards will aligned to those of a MSM website so that people kind of the trust solely based on their perceived "professional" look) where we put articles aout our most up to date findings (findings that we will have discussed in our private onion chan or irc or whatever is possible).
           </p>
           <p>
            The logic behind is simple: If you look at wikileaks I feel it's crazy how many valid informations they have about anything and how few people seem to grasp it all. The reason is simple, if we want to convince as many people as possible, we need to have a user friendly website that breaks things open, basically adding a non partisan journalistic side to the "leaks" side is what will make us gain numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think we need to organize better, as in taking all of our skills into account and working on it rather than having everyone go to a different direction and come back later (though this can also create the noise we need to hide our most important efforts and results).
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean this going to be a long long ride, investigation will probably last for a few years so yeah, we need to have a HQ that is not public otherwise they will always be one step ahead of us as they will see all of our research.

            look pretty useful for having people anonymously submit info, and a Mediawiki frontend would likely be the easiest place to actually catalog everything. There'd be a good bit of work involved with setting up group permissions and public audit trails for everything, but it would be well worth it IMO. I work from home and have plenty of time to work on this, so feel free to PM me and we can get a line of communication going between everyone interested in helping out (once we have a domain, IRC or some other self-hosted chat platform will make everything easier).
