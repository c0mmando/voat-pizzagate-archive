            LITERALLY DAYS AGO THIS WAS DEBUNKED. MOVE ON TO MORE CONCRETE LEADS FFS.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1989 the Whitney Museum and its guest curator Marvin Heiferman asked Koons to make an artwork about the media on a billboard[8] for the show "Image World: Art and Media Culture". Koons employed his then wife Ilona Staller ("Cicciolina") as a model in the shoot that formed the basis of the resulting work for the Whitney, Made in Heaven (1990–91).[34] Including works with such titles as Dirty Ejaculation and Ilonaʼs Asshole, the series of enormous grainy[35] photographs printed on canvas, glassworks, and sculptures portrayed Koons and Staller in highly explicit sexual positions and created considerable controversy. The paintings of the series reference art from the Baroque and Rococo periods—among others, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and François Boucher—and also draw upon the breakthroughs of early modern painters as Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet.[36]
The series was first shown at the 1990 Venice Biennale.[37] Koons reportedly destroyed much of the work when Staller took their son Ludwig with her to Italy.[38] In celebration of Made in Heaven's 20th anniversary, Luxembourg &amp; Dayan chose to present a redux edition of the series.[36][39][40] The Whitney Museum also exhibited several of the photographs on canvas in their 2014 retrospective.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            TL;DR: Koons employed his then wife Ilona Staller ("Cicciolina") as a model.

             While it's a relief that it was explained, literally days ago?  Personally I would have looked into this myself but was too afraid to screenshot the photo and do a reverse image search thanks to the fact that it does look like a much smaller ass in the photo of the "woman"- I appreciate the information.

               I looked at this again and honestly, it's pretty pre-pubescent in appearance. Is there somewhere that has more of their pictures to confirm this? LIke a non cropped one.

             I'm not going to be able to screenshot this entire photo because, I believe it is child porn, albeit something displayed publicly... On the archive link I provided, if you scroll down, it's DIRECTLY between the photo of the day Caris James was born, and the one where she is standing in a basket and opening her mouth for an orange. It says it was taken at the Whitney Museum. I'm really not sure that even seeing that photo is a good thing. I didn't realize it was there when I started scrolling. Someone posted this somewhere before with the pornographic portion blacked out and the rest was enough to be able to tell the person on top is a child.

              My opinion is that is a child as well. A bunch of people claiming it's the dudes wife is not convincing. J.A. has a hardon for kids. His friends have a hard on for kids. Why would anybody be interested in a shot that can be found a million times over on the internet of two adults. It was posted because it was a child. Debunked? A bunch of words doesn't do it for me. I want photos of his 3 foot high wife. The hands clearly outsize the butt cheeks.

              For a moment there I thought you were speaking of the crying toddler in a museum pic on JAs IG. Don't think I've seen that one discussed.

                   Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City (2007-2015)[edit]
The Whitney Museum of American Art decided to move from its original building on Madison Avenue, constructed by Marcel Breuer in 1966, to a new location at the corner of Gansevoort and Washington in Manhatttan,
                   <strong>
                    a neighborhood once occupied by meat packing houses
                   </strong>
                   , next to the High Line, a riverside highway and
                   <strong>
                    park
                   </strong>
                   . The museum, with
                   <strong>
                    nine levels,
                   </strong>
                   has an asymmetric industrial look to match the architecture of the neighborhood. in addition to its interior galleries, it has 1207 square meters of open-air exhibit space on a large terrace atop one section of the building. It was built of steel, concrete, and stone, but also with pine wood and other materials recycled from from demolished factories.[41]. Jule Iovine, architecture critic of the Wall Street Journal, called it "a welcoming, creative machine" thanks to its "open, changeable spaces," and Michael Kimmelman, critic of the New York Times, called it "an outdoor perch to see and be seen...There's a generosity to the architecture, a sense of art connecting with the city and vice versa". [42]
