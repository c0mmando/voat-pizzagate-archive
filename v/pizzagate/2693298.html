            I find it fascinating that the MSM gets to decide when we're "internet detectives" and when we're "conspiracy theorists."

             The Internet detectives below understand that the web is more than just a tool for research, it can be used to inflict positive change on the world and solve mysteries that have long been forgotten, as well as new stories that seem hopeless.

             Then, the internet came along. Suddenly, everyone was able to communicate with other online sleuths and armchair detectives became a thing.

            Pizzagate is real and people who use their free time to investigate it should be taken seriously because we have an excellent track record, and this scares the shit out of them. Their slander of us is evidence of their stark, white knuckle fear of us.

             What we need to do is the opposite, make YouTube accounts and fight this propaganda back. Don't let the average person be fooled. Shit despite my channel "Operation Containment" not being related to Pizzagate at all I just left a comment on it. We need to let people know not to be fooled!

              This is true. I was alerted to creepy youtube accounts by a twitter account highlighting it that is now shut down. But the videos were of kids acting out role play to ' daddy finger' songs. The comments were full of strange stuff what seemed like coded communication, just random letters and full stops. Other videos included kids playing 'doctors' or baby dolls with insects all over them. I didnt take a note of the videos as i just wanted them deleted from my history but i remember one was from an account called Transylvania Family or something. I did search for them recently and they still have questionable vids but also  a lot that have been deleted so at least some people have been reporting them it seems. There was also a weird trend about colours and lollipops i dont want to try to figure it out.

             Exactly. We are watching a phyop in play before our eyes. Those video statistics and comments are all fake. 29 downvotes 273 uplikes?  379 comments with 99 percent of them knocking us? Other Pizzagate videos the MSM put up are majority downvoted with comments calling out the MSM. Take this CNN video for example.
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-VslYnrVWM">

             They have gone to the next stage now and that is fully taking over the ratings and comments.

            Ya know, it would be nice if the "investigative journalists" at NBC would actually go find out if it were true, rather than call us conspiracy theorists. We wouldn't be here if they did their job. Imagine going to school to get a journalism degree just to be a deep state shill.

             Their job isnt to report truth. Its to tell stories of propoganda to sway public opinion.

            </p>
            <p>
             Last point, if pizzagate is real (or some form of it) wouldnt it be better to fully investigate it and come to find out it isnt true, than to pass over it, calling it a conspiracy theory and potentially leaving helpless kids behind to suffer?
            </p>
            <p>
             By not looking into it, and trying to convince everyone its a waste of time, confirms their stance of suppressing it.

             Factfinder2 Yes- You are correct.... But can we all take a moment to accept the fact that THIS FUCKING NAME- Is not an asset. to be honest- This Sub shouldn't exist anymore. IT should ahve a completely different name- NOT ONLY did they discredit it the first time with this name.... THEY ARE LITERALLY USING It for something having nothing to do with pizza. Pizzagate 2.0 About Donuts.
            </p>
            <p>
             In full disclousre, I'm smart enough to know that I can't Be 100% confident in my opinion, with so many  "WHAT IF'S"  Floating around....
            </p>
            <p>
             Would We be at the stage we are at now (In my opinion- A really fucking good, Hard to believe stage) If it weren't for the retarded name?  Like- Maybe the stories would be ignored Completely if the Name were something More practical.... I honestly have no fucking clue....
            </p>
            <p>
             Which one could argue, Is enough basis for me to shut the fuck up and give the name the benefit of the doubt..... But I just can't. I hate the name.  There is evidnece TO suggest the name is bad- And the only evidnece to suggest The name is good, Is based on "What ifs..." In most situations, I would consider that enough basis for a good Benefit of the doubt.... But I Just can't with this name. It's horrible- for so many different reasons. The one that really Makes me hate it, Is that it limits the fuck out of the scope of the situation....
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not all pizza shops, It's not all donuts SHops- Its completely other industries- For example- There are Just as many- If not MORE, barber shops involved in this fuckery, than there are pizzashops.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could you imagine if someone posted About a sketch barber shop in this sub? They'd be gone so fast it makes your head spin.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I digress......

              Pizzagate is merely a vestigal term to honor the origins of the investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              The true name is Pedogate.

               I feel like there are multiple people with "Darkknight" in there name- so my apologies For not knowing if you're the dark knight I respect, Or- Not so much. But dude. Branding is everything. Trump is president- because branding. I think trumps a genius, And I think in a perfect world, trump would be a different person- but he understand branding, and more so, Reality. At this point- it's hard to justify Connecting NEW, ORIGINAl, DAMING INFORMATION- To the horid name- Regardless if the name Reminds people of how this all started.....
              </p>
              <p>
               This is real life- You honor Shit, After it happens.
              </p>
              <p>
               We're in the middle of A non Combative war.... You honor, AFTER VICTORY.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've made it clear in many comments, THat DESPITE my disdain for the name- From LITERALLY- DAY 1, of its inception..... That The name Might have been perfect. For Its role, At the time. But We are way past pizzagate- YOu either Think PG is fake, Or You understand the facts..... At this point, 2 years later, The name has run its course. Everyone knows the name. They either believe it, or they don't.
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                Who gives a fuck about honoring the name?
               </em>
               <strong>
                This is much bigger than honor-
               </strong>
               <sub>
                AT LEAST AT THIS POINT
               </sub>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               ##At this point- Tactical choices Should Surpass everything. Continuing to post NEW, ORIGINAL INFORMATION- in this sub, Which can be subsequently be attributed to "pizzagate Conspiracy...." Is a determent to the movement.
              </p>
              <p>
               Admittedly, regardless Of this name- And how long it continues to live, and "thrive"-We will win the movement. I'm simply saying,ATTRIBUTATING ANY SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION, TO PIZZAGATE- DOESN"T HELP THE MOVEMENT.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, I've admitted that Pizzagate might have been the perfect name- For the start.... I didn't think so, But fuck, I'm retarded. But at this point- my retarded ass is confident that ANY CONNECTION TO pizzagate DOESN"T HELP..... which you have Admitted yourself. Honor- Is Irrelevant In war time.
               <sub>
                (Metaphorical war time- for the Letter agencies that like to frame and entrap)
               </sub>
              </p>

               We don't have to worry about the people that believe it- WE should now foucs on the ones that don't.... THe Ones that DON'T - are less likely to be swayed, anytime PIZZAGATE is inserted to the conversation.

              <p>
               And listen- Find Rebelskum- The one who coined the name. "PIZZAGATE"  Ask him What he thinks should be done regarding the Name THAT HE COINED.

              I completely agree with you on every single point, and especiallly the limitations placed on this sub.  It's a mystery to me why we've perpetuated the word pizzagate.  But that word seems to have a life of its own and more fitting tags
              <em>
               are
              </em>
              being ignored.

              I have no clue either, and we'll never know.  What we can know is that

               something

              is working.

               It shouldve been called child snuff gate...
They use fronts like pizza parlours for a long time...
Go to kissinger files on wikileaks and search for pizza...
..
They r projecting at the same time they are trivialising the investigation on them..
              </p>
              <p>
               ...when james alefantis was rolled out by msnbc ..it was to underline this term..and associate it crazies going after child porn...when in actual fact ..the investigation was concentrated on child snuff...so they took the route of limited hangout with JA..
Then somehow the forums also ..even now are veering away from closing in on JA and Scott cummings and the connecticut logistics operation..
..it should be childsnuffgate and should be brought on track
              </p>
              <p>
               Rename pizzagate as childsnuffgate and concentrate on the connecticut avenue logistics hub ..and how it connects to the political class , cia hub of connectticut, and other state players like obama, pence, bush and the behind the scene zog players..like epsteim rahm emmanuel, 
..but always at the core should be the JA and scott cummings gang..
              </p>
              <p>
               Do the exact opposite of what knightofhubris user wants us to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               But this will fall on deaf ears..
              </p>
              <p>
               Another important move would be to reduce tge debt at the US treasury before any further moves..this will place the US and its insyitutions as ur debtors and u above it..
The deepnstate  cannot use tge US institutions and state powers to charge u or harrass u ..
But u can charge them in the name of reducing US debt..
This will also fall on deaf ears..
Protect urself first ...before u go into battle...
The US is us...
the deep state is us falling asleep. To this legal fact.
