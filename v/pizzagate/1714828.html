I agree the Podesta comparisons might be distraction, however the information of both e-fits being given by the same man of the same man are incorrect.

<p>Martin Smith, an Irish tourist, is alleged to have given the information to draw the e-fits when visited in Ireland by the McCanns\' private investigators, NOT the police. He was approached after he saw Gerry McCann getting off a plane on television when they landed back in the UK, and thought it could have been Gerry he saw that night.</p>
<p>Martin gave statements to the Portuguese police on the <strong>26th May 2007.</strong> Madeleine vanished on the <strong>3rd May 2007.</strong> He didn\'t make statements for 23 days. </p>
<p><strong>Let\'s look at the information he gave on the man he saw carrying the child, taken from his statements to Portuguese police:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Regarding the description of the individual who carried the child he states that: he was Caucasian, around 175 to 180m in height. He appeared to be about 35/40 years old. He had an average build, a bit on the thin side. His hair was short, in a basic male cut, brown in colour. <strong>He cannot state if it was dark or lighter in tone.</strong> He did not wear glasses and had no beard or moustache. <strong>He did not notice any other relevant details partly due to the fact that the lighting was not very good.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Does that sound like he would be able to provide enough information to draw an e-fit? Given the fact he couldn\'t remember hair colour, and that the lighting wasn\'t very good?</p>
<p><strong>Further on:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;States that it is not possible for him to recognise the individual in person or by photograph.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>How would it be that Martin Smith could provide enough detail for e-fits months later, despite it being dark, and him being unable to recognise this person again even some 23 days after the sighting?</p>
<p>I think it\'s plausible that the private detectives knew who they wanted to draw up, which may or not be the Podestas. If the McCanns are involved in a paedophile ring, as I suspect due to their connection to Clement Freud, and top-level help from the UK government, I don\'t think it\'s a giant leap to consider they might have released the e-fits of the Podesta brothers as blackmail, given no one really connected the fact that they look alike until the Pizzagate shit. </p>
<p>I think Madeleine is dead. I\'m pretty certain of it. I don\'t know if the Podestas were involved, but the e-fit information being of the same man might be a way to silence intrigue if it is repeated enough, when it could actually be an avenue to keep in mind. I\'m not saying the Podesta brothers snatched Madeleine, or that two men were seen, but they could be involved in a much bigger cycle, and were blackmailed, or had a falling out, etc.</p>
<p><strong>If Martin Smith couldn\'t remember who he saw that night, it means someone else decided who to draw, meaning they could be depictions two separate men.</strong></p>
<p>Worth noting that Martin Smith and his family declined to return to Portugal for a reconstruction like they had agreed to after the visits from the private investigators.</p>

           I was hooked looking into the Madeleine McCann case extensively a while back, and I just want to point some things out.

           Martin gave statements to the Portuguese police on the
           <strong>
            26th May 2007.
           </strong>
           Madeleine vanished on the
           <strong>
            3rd May 2007.
           </strong>
           He didn't make statements for 23 days.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Let's look at the information he gave on the man he saw carrying the child, taken from his statements to Portuguese police:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           "Regarding the description of the individual who carried the child he states that: he was Caucasian, around 175 to 180m in height. He appeared to be about 35/40 years old. He had an average build, a bit on the thin side. His hair was short, in a basic male cut, brown in colour.
           <strong>
            He cannot state if it was dark or lighter in tone.
           </strong>
           He did not wear glasses and had no beard or moustache.

           Does that sound like he would be able to provide enough information to draw an e-fit? Given the fact he couldn't remember hair colour, and that the lighting wasn't very good?
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Further on:

           <strong>
            "States that it is not possible for him to recognise the individual in person or by photograph."

            Lets not forget Podestas password was :password.. and I dont think hes a boss or even very high up in all this.. Those that are really high up in all this are not public figures Im willing to bet.. Lets be logical here.. Skippy is careless.. until this whole thing blew up he and his buddies thought they were untouchable.. They were very open and relaxed about their instagram accounts and all kinds of pretty open pedo-like photos, paintings and behaviour. Skippy is totally expendable. He might think hes hot shit but hes nobody if you ask me.
He can easily be the fall guy for all this.. I repeat hes expendable.. no one important to the real movers and shakers.

            Moloch requires kidnapped children, they also have some sort of changeling ritual that involves snatching children from Their beds. Making stupid assumptions about how this satanic religion works and what these scumbags will do for their god is stupid. Podestas are placed at the scene by a witness. The only thing that will put this to rest is an alibi. So far they have never submitted an alibi and instead resorted labeling this fake news. I am waiting to see where they were  on that night. Passports will document it very easily.

            The reason the McCanes were involved with Freud was because he called to befriend them and offer comfort thru cooking a meal for them at his house after Madeline was missing for two weeks....they did NOT know him prior to incident...there is no evidence they were in pedophile ring....terrible thing to accuse grieving parents of...just like was done to Jon Binet Ramsey's parents!! Probably real pedo members  making such awful  accusations!  Now Freud himself was looked at being involved and trying to source info from parents as to investigation findings, etc.

            If the Podestas were anywhere near the place then the e-fits are definitely drawn from stock images of the Podestas after investigators got an anonymous tip. The actual kidnappers would have called in the tip to ensure that there would be no real investigation.

             You are really creating a very complicated scenario that has zero basis in any sort of facts. Trying to create resonanle doubt by inventing someone else to blame is the oldest trick in the book. Yawn same tactic was used with the JFK magic bullet. Podestas need an alibi.....plain and simple! They are considered suspects and have not been ruled out until they can account for their whereabouts. I suspect Scotland Yard and Portugal police already know where the podesta brothers were. International travel is very documented through visas and passports.

              . And Yoichi Shimatsu goes further and purports that in the days following they flew to U.K. and visited Oxford University and namely, Jane Blumberg Thompson, wife of Mark Thonpson (ex BBC Director General during the Saville years who is now editor of NYT). Essay explores the links in detail but the aforementioned claim can be found in the paragraph 'Clem Freud, a friend of the Podestas'

               Lol which is why they keep attempting to create an alternate person of interest. Notice the shills want only to blame the parents, or they say that podesta would never do grunt work, such as carry the baby, they are trying to create reasonable doubt in preparation. The dots all connect even the attempt to put the evidence in question by labeling this fake news. These are all tactics used by defense attorneys when defending a guilty client.

               Let me list the facts: podesta brothers collect and DISPLAY artwork that depicts child torture and sexual sadism, one podesta even has a chain link cage  in his bedroom. The podesta brothers have multiple friendships with convicted pedofiles and sexual predators: Clinton, Hastert, Epstein, Tim Bean, Weiner also let us not overlook the friendship with alefantis who is also very very questionable reputation. Fact a witness placed them both at the scence scene of the crime. Fact they have not provided an alibi. Wikileaks emails expose the pedostas using known pedofile code words and the fact that his emails were scrubbed on the day of Madeline mcanns disapearence. These are all facts surrounding pedosta brothers and Madeline McCann. Have they provided an alibi? No instead they have hired hired David Brock's company to deflect  using tactics typically employed by defense attorneys when defending a guilty client: label the evidence false ( fake news), create an alternate perpetrator, (the parents did it or it was the person who tipped the police) This is all done with the goal of creating reasonable doubt. Reasonalble doubt does not imply innocence. Reasonable doubt is not an alibi. Stop being so naive and think critically. Without an alibi they should remain personas of interest and i for one, after personally listening to the skippy video believe he is involved in heinous acts with his pedofile elite friends. That is my very strong opinion and where there is smoke there is fire.

                Working on your theory of alternates. The kidnapping narrative is still being pushed. There is basically zero evidence of a kidnapping. The "forced window" was undamaged, Kate seeing "the curtain wave in the breeze"...of a shuttered window. Door was open but the 'kidnapper' forced a window...please...NO KIDNAPPER. Nobody could make a efit featuring a small mole on T.Podestas face in the dark from a distance, 23 days later, from memory. Witness is bullshit, e-fits are not. They seem like a warning or blackmail ploy. Podestas are involved in some way, e-fits are way too accurate to not be manufactured. What nobody discusses is the cadaver dogs. Blood and death in the closet, behind couch, in the McCann rental car. Dogs don't lie and Clarence Thomas(Blair spin doctor), the McCann PR man tried hard to discredit the dogs and handler, as did Kate. The dogs and handler  went to work for the FBI they were so "unreliable". An FBI case Thomas used to discredit the handler (when the perp got off initially), turned out to be shoddy police work. The guy later confessed and the dogs were correct yet again ( around 200 successful cases). So by the distraction theory. Maddie was killed in villa 5A, dumped in the McCanns hire car and the Podestas are involved. Everyone in the McCann touring party lied. Stories changed and contradicted each other. There is nothing to say she wasn't dead before the 3rd and the kidnap was an easy hoax to pull. My theory was ritual killing in the villa, possibly pay-per-view, body dumped by parents/Podsestas/Freud or possibly dissected for stem cells somewhere else. The kidnap theory is total bullshit. When the McCanns were named as suspects by Portuguese  police Kate refused to answer 49 basic questions about the night she had already described in detail. She replied yes to question 50. "Do you realise by not answering these questions you bring suspicion on yourself?". Feared implicating themselves but not the perps imo.

                 Everything you say is possible , I also think that there might have been someone else who was ritually killed. There might have been more than one victim. Was Madeline seen alive ? Was she drugged while the podestas were carrying her? Who was murdered in the villa? I will put it out there that it's easy transport a small child who is dead. So is there a reason they would transport a dead child out in the open, they could have fit her in a large suitcase for example? There is more to this case than meets the eye.  Someone died in that apartment, how many nameless unwanted children have been ritually murdered by these scumbags! I think there is more than one victim.

                  Good point. I think the kidnap angle is for suckers. The rest is a tangled web of lies. I trust the dogs and none of the humans.
