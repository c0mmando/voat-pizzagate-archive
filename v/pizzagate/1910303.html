            In last vid with Goodman - I don't see how he can be so upset.
The 2 files are long and he probably doesn't know how they differ except for the file size.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if he want his own file t called the authentic one he can find a place to upload it to. Getting domain space is cheaper then those hotels they have been staying at or dinner tabs (wine tabs).

             Wine isn't much better. Everyone's forgetting about George flipping out on Kim Dotcom, who won't touch these loonies with a ten foot pole now. Jason and the rest are lying about the files, and they pulled a psyop on people by suggesting there could be some problem now for anyone who has downloaded it. Further, the files are no big deal since they've been online since September.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jason admitted today he gets theatric because he wants to make the videos more exciting, though he claims everything is still true. Personally, I think he acted crazy last night so that his star would seem and reasonable in comparison, and win his fans back. Because Webb really blew it by getting drunk and flipping out. Now he seems Back in everyone's good graces just by having kept silent for a day.

            It's amazing how quickly the Webb-Goodman facade is falling apart. It's one thing to vlog and make constant assertions, it's quite another to involve other people who have sources and information of their own.

            The most entertainment available anywhere right now...so many weird twists and turns...and nwo with DeFango, whose live stream is crazy, also some good music. He seems sincere to me, but who knows. Jason is either in need of a long nap, or is doing some acting. GW playing many roles?

            HA Goodman wants to just all get along. That would be neat, if there was no such thing as disinfo agents and the CIA. He's sweet but we need people who will be more discerning and wise about the forces at play...

              George Webb is even worse. Total disinfo nutjob. He is reporting on stories published in fake news site whatsitmean.com. Yet he travels around acting like he's investigating something. Webb is actually lying b/c he knows Alpha Jalloh is not Seth Rich's murderer yet he reported it anyway. HA Goodman is saying he likes these guys because he hasn't really took the time to closely scrutinize what they're doing.﻿

I don't trust Jason Goodman or George Webb. They just feel off to me. The DNC is going to plant so much disinformation out there now to confuse people and lead them astray. Disinformation operatives are a thing too. You just can never be to sure on who to trust in today's world.﻿

              Yeah, it turns out I don't work for Mossad after all. I'm just a Deplorable Shit Lord who's so fucking poor I couldn't afford a staycation. I'm only here to do what I can to retake our government away from child rapists. Unlike you V__Z I'd like to keep my soul, it kinda helps in keeping one's sanity. And boy could I tell you about losing one's sanity. Being Irish a large portion of my Brain is taken up with the pursuit, consumption and processing of Alcohol. So when that drove me to the edge of sanity as most Irish will tell you it eventually does I had to seek alternatives. And for me that was to get sober and devote the remainder of my previously wretched life to making amends and doing whatever I can to help spread the Good News about

              So you deserve a heart felt thank you for giving me the opportunity to destroy yet another of your shill arguments in defense of the Deep State mother fuckers who think raping children and stealing the organs from the uglies was a good idea. Ready?
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              Yes George Webb is Mossad. But "Disinfo SHILL" implies he's lying. He's not lying.
             </p>
             <p>
              What George Webb and Mossad are doing is turning state's evidence against their co-conspirators. There's a big difference between that and Disinfo that I hope people are aware of.
             </p>
             <p>
              Turning state's evidence IS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT whereas Disinfo is an intentional act to hide the truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you doubt that then you need to explain how the current shit bird running the FBI at the moment was going to be brought down. The blackmail victims in Congress weren't going to do it given the what the Awan Brothers and their Deep State handlers have.
             </p>
             <p>
              Right? If you object to George Webb and Mossad then you have to explain who gives Andrew McCabe his walking papers. You have to explain who destroys the Deep State plan to use Guccifer 2.0 to plant a fake story about "Those fucking Russians!(tm)" killing Seth Rich and thereby impeaching Donald Trump.
             </p>
             <p>
              So yeah, shills and naive and gullible Americans who believe the Deep State's story..........tell us who takes care of business without George Webb and Mossad.

               <p>
                That's a great question and thank for asking. Why? I have two theories:
               </p>
               <p>
                1) Mossad sees the handwriting on the wall and realize the jig is up. If they don't turn state's evidence they're going to be brought down with the ship.
               </p>
               <p>
                2) Mossad is playing both ends of the table right now and George Webb is just them buying a Put Option on that Brownstone Operation. In other words if the Brownstone Operation is brought down then George Webb and his army of fans to which I belong will soften Israel's landing when the truth about 9/11 comes out. Yes Mossad played a part BUT they were 2nd fiddle. The prime actors were George H.W. Bush and the Military Industrial Complex.
               </p>
               <p>
                How about you? What's your theory?

                <p>
                 I can't fully agree, here's why.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To the first one. I believe Zionist Israeli leaders are still fully in control of their destinies, as they have way too many pieces in place to counter any public narrative that goes against theirs. Case in point? 9-11.  over 15 years later, no matter how many people worldwide have suspected their part in it, from Italian, German, Intelligence sources etc..it's been assured it has never gone mainstream. Too much audio visual control, from Hollywood film and TV to all the major news networks. George Sr and Jr and the rest of the players, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Rice, Guliani,Silverstein played a part for money and well to put it simply for some of them, 2 birds/one stone, a sacrifice to their cause/cult.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To your 2nd one, they
                 <em>
                  may
                 </em>
                 be playing certain cards. One noticeable change.Trump visited Israel recently, their leadership for some reason were delighted publicly with his visit. What really went on over there, we won't know. But if you follow the narrative since then, some of the tide has surely been changing, it's been much quieter on the bashing Trump front, and slightly louder on the pressure the DNC is under.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One thing I truly believe is that Israeli Mossad and CIA Internet operations have lost control due to the citizen journalist. It's like a virus has spread and it's attacking the vital organs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Considering that, one way to slow the virus down is that they may have internally decided to throw Trump a bone, but for that, there is
                 <em>
                  always
                 </em>
                 a price to pay. That price may be the citizen journalist. If it is? they regain full control.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We will soon see.

                  1) ".it's been assured it has never gone mainstream." That's because every president has been put there by the Deep State until Donald Trump. The Deep State was surprised Trump won and didn't really have a plan in place. In other words the Deep State got overconfident which as any European History major will tell you immediately precede's a return to Earth. Adolph Hitler being the most previous example. And Hitler may actually play a part in this as I'll explain lower down.

                 <p>
                  2)  "the narrative since then..........some of the tide has surely been changing"

                  I'm fairly certain what happened and that's to believe George Webb's version of events because it's the most rational explanation. The decision was made to officially throw Hillary Clinton to the wolves. Why? Because Hillary is psychotic and therefor unreliable. Psychotic? Yep,

                  In a strange twist of fate Adolph Hitler also had Parkinson's and was also bat shit crazy towards the end. Hillary is able to hide her Parkinson's with a Deep Brain Stimulator but Hitler wasn't so lucky. At the time it was well hidden but this clip should give you an idea of what he looked like in the end. He had to keep his left hand locked behind him at all times

             who thought eating them sounded like a good idea. Because the way this game works is the King of Kings forgives so long as you come around eventually whenever or wherever that may be.
            </p>
            <p>
             So you deserve a heart felt thank you for giving me the opportunity to destroy yet another of your shill arguments in defense of the Deep State mother fuckers who think raping children and stealing the organs from the uglies was a good idea. Ready?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Yes George Webb is Mossad. But "Disinfo SHILL" implies he's lying. He's not lying.
            </p>
            <p>
             What George Webb and Mossad are doing is turning state's evidence against their co-conspirators. There's a big difference between that and Disinfo that I hope people are aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Turning state's evidence IS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT whereas Disinfo is an intentional act to hide the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you doubt that then you need to explain how the current shit bird running the FBI at the moment was going to be brought down. The blackmail victims in Congress weren't going to do it given the what the Awan Brothers and their Deep State handlers have.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right? If you object to George Webb and Mossad then you have to explain who gives Andrew McCabe his walking papers. You have to explain who destroys the Deep State plan to use Guccifer 2.0 to plant a fake story about "Those fucking Russians!(tm)" killing Seth Rich and thereby impeaching Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yeah, shills and naive and gullible Americans who believe the Deep State's story..........tell us who takes care of business without George Webb and Mossad.

            I wouldn't agree that Defango is throwing them under the bus. He got used and is now being abused, for no reason. He's just getting stoned and calmly defending himself, and he is right, 100%. Jason is making something up about the files, and he's being caught in a lie. Defango still trusts Webb, but hopefully he's got the eyes to see, and will make a video outing the liars.

            Webb also threw dr Steve Peiczxnic (however he fuck it's spelled) under the bus today, or at least, he slandered him without giving any reason, saying Steve is an enemy of the truth. Steve has been most impressive in the little time I've been aware of him, calling out Hillary and ALL the recent false flags and hoax shootings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently today cernovich did a video calling Webb and Jason a psyop. He then deleted it, but people saw it and are talking about it on Twitter. The first hint that something like this happened was that Webb attacked cernovich and Infowars today, seemed to preemptively be defending himself against an onslaught he knows is coming.

            His new handler is also throwing people under the bus. This isn't going to end well.

           <p>
            HA Goodman had recommended his people to follow Webb, but tonight he was in the chat on Defangos Livestream, so hopefully he will educate himself and his viewers as to what's really going on. However it looks like everyone is saying poor Webb is innocent and was doing a great job until Jason took over, almost like Webb had no choice, and his inability to say no to an infiltrator was not a problem for his loyal fans. He is still a star to them, Mossad admission and all.

             So you deserve a heart felt thank you for giving me the opportunity to destroy yet another of your shill arguments in defense of the Deep State mother fuckers who think raping children and stealing the organs from the uglies was a good idea. Ready?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Yes George Webb is Mossad. But "Disinfo SHILL" implies he's lying. He's not lying.
            </p>
            <p>
             What George Webb and Mossad are doing is turning state's evidence against their co-conspirators. There's a big difference between that and Disinfo that I hope people are aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Turning state's evidence IS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT whereas Disinfo is an intentional act to hide the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you doubt that then you need to explain how the current shit bird running the FBI at the moment was going to be brought down. The blackmail victims in Congress weren't going to do it given the what the Awan Brothers and their Deep State handlers have.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right? If you object to George Webb and Mossad then you have to explain who gives Andrew McCabe his walking papers. You have to explain who destroys the Deep State plan to use Guccifer 2.0 to plant a fake story about "Those fucking Russians!(tm)" killing Seth Rich and thereby impeaching Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yeah, shills and naive and gullible Americans who believe the Deep State's story..........tell us who takes care of business without George Webb and Mossad.

              In the long run, yes. But he's been posted here for months, and now he is finally being exposed,so right now, IMO, is a very important time to wake people up, and that will destroy their psyop. Their psyop was meant to ruin this and the Seth rich investigation. I think it's strike while the irons hot time. In my mind, there is nothing more important than waking people up to the Webb Op &amp; stopping it entirely.

            Wow - I had no idea that Webb declared that he "loves Henry Kissinger."  Yet another HUGE RED FLAG that his fans "missed" (read: Overlooked).
           </p>
           <p>
            After realizing that he was a disinfo agent a year ago after GamerGate, I stopped following him.  It's astounding how many clowns are drinking the Webb Kool-Aid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Acton refers to Webb, Goodman, and Trish as "three goofballs," which is an apt descriptor.
