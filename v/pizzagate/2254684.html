            Nice touch by getting the Fiji conspiracy theory wrong at the end, and announcing that pizzagate was short lived, and debunked. Why would they care about what such a small group of people say on the internet, unless it bothers someone that three prominent people are all wearing the same silly looking boots, and we noticed? Now they print a newsweek Serbia. Seems IBT Media wants to sway peoples minds there for some reason. In this article there is a strange mention of child porn accusations that seem alinsky in nature.

            They want to embarrass people posting on social media - hoping making fun of them will stop them. Maybe the boot really is just a boot. I'd rather be the joke who questions it than the asshole who believes Newsweek.

            Newsweek jumped the shark on their own accord with the Manson thing - they're destroying their credibility, such as it is, by their own efforts
           </p>
           <p>
            Then consider NYT hit piece - all that did was bolster (
            <em>
             confirm
            </em>
            is not too strong a word here) the point that there is a behind the scenes civil war going on between the CIA and the NSA in general, and with the Q-group of the NSA specifically. Thank you very much CIA-Mocking-Bird-asset NYT for providing that confirmation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then WaPo reports the bombing of the poppy fields in Afghanistan - another hit, this time on a major asset of the CIA, thus another confirmation of Trump admin gradually closing a drag net around Deep State via the military (a straight on theme from QAnon postings).
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing of it is, what MSM says about QAnon doesn't matter a hill of beans. If it's real, then this quasi clandestine take down of existing nefarious power structures will keep happening. MSM can mock it, ridicule it, and eventually squeal about it, but they are helpless as to what it portends, because it is their sponsors that are being rolled up bit by bit.

            Can anybody here get to Sean Hannity?  Who is the LARP? Listening to his interview with Newt Gingrich last night, former Speaker of the House. While hamiti has been on it with us, nooch shut down the work and was a disaster for Sean Hannity in my view. It makes me hopeless after listening to Newt. On Hannity?
           </p>
           <p>
            Newt Gingrich continue to say that we need to slow down and stop accusing everybody and let them have their due process of innocent before guilty. There is just so much of this we need to back away. Why? Because they're not being treated fairly??
           </p>
           <p>
            Newt Gingrich went on to say that of course the people have a right to know how their money was spent in shutting down the sexual assault allegations in Congress. He then had the audacity to say our money shouldn't be spent that way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the heads up! New Twist speaker of the house. He knew about it then as he knows about it now. Congress had a certain procedure of compliance. Before any investigation you had to basically sign a gag order. This was the same when Newt was speaker! Remember senator Larry Craig? Trying to meet a boy for sex in an airport bathroom? Mark Foley running after pages and assaulting them? No one is bringing up the former Republicans involved not even voat. I see the bias here and with Hannity's guests. Ben Sasse of Nebraska involved in the page program elected to the senate. This is on both sides and Newt Gingrich knows this. But because it's spilling over and it's just the Democrats perhaps he's getting worried? Because his basic message on the show last night was we need to slow down and stop accusing everybody and making them step down as soon as somebody comes forward to make a claim. Really? Could he also be wearing we're getting close to the pedophilia could he also be wearing we're getting close to the pedophilia? Believe me Newt knows all about it! He also knows exactly where the 17 million dollars was spent and on who in Congress. This was not good on Sean Hannity's part. "We I'll need to take a step back and stop doing this".
           </p>
           <p>
            Newt Gingrich was a keeper of the gates as Paul Ryan is today. Why was Sean Hannity bother having him on. He's trying to destroy all of our work including Sean's. And we haven't gotten to the kids yet! That is their plan. Bury the evil pedophile rings and muddy the waters with sexual assault everywhere we already know it exists.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Conyers is also a pedophile. He's another keeper of the gate. He took care of the u.s. heroin rat lines allowing the international boats to come into the windsor-detroit port. While the drugs didn't stay there, a pile of money for letting it in did!

            Other interesting tidbits is they still call claiming Hillary was unhealthy during the election a conspiracy theory even after all her coughing fits and her collapse.  Claim Uranium One is not important, etc.

             I would love to believe that she will get her ass handed to her over that but she has so many powerful people blackmailed i'm not sure if they can really make her pay for that. I hope the Trump administration finds a way to strip every nickel of her blood money though. That alone would make all this effort worthwhile. I despise the whole Clinton/Bush cabal with a passion.

            The MSM won't buy in until the sheeple start pushing back hard(boycotts, ratings plummet, outrage).  The sheeple won't start buying in until the MSM stops feeding them the propaganda.  It is a vicious circle.

            What I've noticed is very effective against broadcast media are the "CNN Fake News" aka Baba Booeys.  The good news is print is dying. Old rags like  WCompost and NYTrash and forced online where comments can mitigate some of the Newspeak. I've noticed a lot of online newspapers have turned off commenting.  Wcompost hits you w a paywall after 5 visits.  Considering who it is owned by, I'm sure there is site scraping scripts running somewhere in its code.

            Point being is we, the red-pillers and Pizzagaters have to stay vigilant The DS is going to pull out every stop - like the pending Twitter ban.  I'm pretty sure POTUS can make things very, very uncomfortable for Twitter.  Like figuring a way to crash their stock into the ground - investigations, immigration, tax, FCC, lean on the banks, kill contracts.  USG could dry Twitter up in an afternoon.  Fucking do it.  Fuck Twitter and stand up POTUSTV.  Broadcast the truth 24x7.

             I think that's the point of Q's riddle-me-this Socratic Method approach. It's like bidding on EBay...the process creates a dopamine reward loop that engages people and overwrites pre-existing positions.

              I hadn't thought if it as something originating from the pleasure/reward center, but I can see how that is possible with "collecting" or "gleaning" new information (as opposed to data).

              It is definitely an iterative form of Socratic Method for many.  The unfortunate part is much of modern schooling has eliminated the innate desire to seek truth, as well as to question what you see.
             </p>
             <p>
              Something a bit stronger is going to be needed for the mouth breathers, however.  You could lid-lock half this country and show them a video of HRC eating a child and they would shrug their shoulders.

             I think it is interesting that this is happening after they arrested the biggest Twitter investor which was the "bad Saudi" Prince Talal. He invested 300 million in Twitter and might have been the biggest investor but not sure. If he was the "bad Saudi" I am curious why Twitter is starting this after he is knocked out of the loop. Maybe its not connected but its something I noticed.

              Considering the absolute ass pounding Trump gave them I'm sure that didn't help much. Trump has overwhelming public support and i'm sure that didn't help these fukn CIA mouthpieces they try to pass off as journalism and news.

               I don't even like Trump (or any politicians for that matter) but its funny that the MSM keeps trying to say he has a "36%" approval rating. I put that number in quotations because Approval Ratings are made up. Have you ever met anyone who was polled for one of those things? Of course not; its just a made up number to get people to either get behind a President and reelect him, or hate him so they can get someone else in there.

            This is a good sign.  I get worried when I agree with anything MSM is saying, so the fact that I don't agree might add some more legitimacy to the whole Q thing  :)

            I saw that yesterday.  Considering the magazine is is the size of a pamphlet now, I don't think the 12 people who still subscribe to Newsweek aren't going to amount to much.
