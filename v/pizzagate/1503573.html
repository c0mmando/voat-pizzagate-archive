<p><strong>Quick background:</strong></p>
<p>A poster on this voat named Ihatepizza2 (who I will from now on call \'OP\') made a paranoid thread yesterday saying his friend had some big information that he wanted to share, but felt very unsafe doing so: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502298">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502298</a> I left a comment on this thread advising OP on a safe method to get the info out.</p>
<p>OP sent me an encrypted message, and I expected a troll.</p>
<p>After unencrypting, I thought it was definitely a troll, since it was dense, and very poorly put together. However, I implore you not to judge by appearances. I think OP is sincere, and discovered some legitimate leads. I am including a pastebin link to the full dump at the bottom of this post, but I\'ve endeavored to summarize its most significant discoveries here so that it is not lost amid the noise.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting Stuff</strong></p>
<p>OP observes that Heavy Breathing made obscure references to &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;Rock Mountain&quot;, and believes this may be connected with the <strong>Rock and Roll Hotel</strong> in Washington DC. OP discovered a venue associated with this hotel called the \'Snowball Party\', promoted and hosted by <strong>The Party Liberation Front</strong>.</p>
<p>The organizer of this event has designed numerous posters that are almost undeniably associated with #Pizzagate:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/zmoY0">http://imgur.com/a/zmoY0</a>
(Barack Obama dancing on a pizza pie)</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/O6r8U">http://imgur.com/a/O6r8U</a>
(PLF poster reads &quot;Beautiful pizza - even if you\'re old, I\'ll still eat ya.&quot; PLF logo strongly resembles FBI paedo logo.)</p>
<p>(More links in dump)</p>
<p>OP also implicates a pizza restaurant recently closed in DC called <strong>Pizza Parts &amp; Service</strong>, and seems to imply that it was somehow connected with the hit PC game &quot;Five Nights at Freddy\'s&quot; which features a pedophile killer in a pizza restaurant as its main premise.</p>
<p>Check the Pastebin dump for full details. OP mentions a &quot;creepy as fuck&quot; Google group called <strong>freddy fazbears pizza parts and service</strong>, but I have not been able to find it. <em>I hope someone else may have better luck</em>, as I find this potential lead especially interesting. I happen to know that OP is wrong to assert that the pizza restaurant featured in the FNAF game is called &quot;Pizza Parts &amp; Service&quot; (It\'s simply called \'Freddy Fazbear\'s Pizza\'), but if this Google group exists, it might establish an actual connection between this real life establishment and the aforementioned game.</p>
<p>Finally, OP thinks the <strong>Pizzacat</strong> web series featuring Nicholas Cage may have a connection with #Pizzagate as well. This is where I find OP\'s reasoning difficult to follow, but he proceeds with tremendous conviction, and includes a number of links to support this connection. I am really not sure what to make of it, and think this may be more paranoid than factual, but it\'s worth looking into.</p>

            These is a sister location in the game in game 2 that is pizza parts and services the Google group is most likely just a gamer community. I do find it interesting however that while there is a pizza parts in service in the game there is also a now closed real world Dx pizza resturant. Other than that I'm not seeing anything other than the weirdness of the game which I have played and it is real boring and kinda disturbing.

            Still digging for what I can, but I did find an interesting fun fact on "Pizza Parts and Service". Apparently "Taylor Gourmet" (same owners and still around) has been used for catering by the Democratic Party as well:

            'Parts and Services' is simply the name of a room in the Five Nights game(s).  Just googling "parts and services" alone brings up images of the in game area. I seriously doubt there is a relevant connection between pizzagate and FNaF. As someone who not only plays the games, but also tried to keep up with their open-sourced investigation into what the game was even about, I think that the creator just noticed - like many - how creepy chuck-e-cheeses is. There really isn't any direct reference to pedophilia in the game. A portion of the robots in one game were equipped with facial recognition connected to a criminal database due to reports of missing children associated with the pizza chain. The main premise of the game is that you're an underpaid worker trying to survive shifts among haunted robots, often in a pizza place. The variably veiled plot line deals with a serial child killer associated with the pizza place and the souls of his victims - it can only be assumed that he raped the children. This isn't a lead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't doubt at all that the google group was creepy as fuck. Half the FNaF fans are fucking furries.

            More on the PLF. Found the guy who posted it. He doesn't have any other pedostuff in his profile but if you follow the "Drum and Bass Against Racism", you get linked to other, Burner, Leftist DJs, who probably just saw "heart", "drum and bass", and "against racism".
           </p>
           <p>
            I'ma put out feelers but the PLF thing... mmmm.... I'm not sure they're really involved or know it's a pedosymbol (cuz... hippies). Oh they'd better not be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further: PLF isn't what you need to be looking into (better not be), as they're just fire spinners, dj's, and party people.

            PLF, the Party Liberation Front is a massive theme camp that groups with other camps at Burns (Burning Man style regional events)
           </p>
           <p>
            There's fire spinning, a ridiculous musical venue that pops up, amazing DJs, Art, Artists... they throw a hell of a party.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I doubt they have a clue what that symbol means. They're party heads. Leftists... uuuuuber hippies and technojunkies.
           </p>
           <p>
            But oh my GOD if I find out they're diddling kids or are aware they're associated... mmmm.... I'll be very not pleased.

            I'm looking through the Pizzacat videos on YouTube now. First observation and question: there are numerous references to "red door" in comments. What does that mean? Anyone know?
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiASF6-j3Vg">

           </p>
           <p>
            Also, mention of Illuminati in comments:

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsEPEFtOnAc
            </a>
            Jet Crew also mentioned. Not sure what that means, but multiple references.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ah, wait, Jet's is a pizza joint in St. Joseph, MI.

            What is this store's return and exchange policy?

            I can confirm that this is basically a summary of what "OP" (by OP i mean ihatepizza2 - not veritas_vincit) wrote about. This is just a much more organized and easier to read summary of what ihatepizza2 originally wrote.

            He sent me he exact same dump via encrypted message. I did read through the entire encrypted message and I was definitely quite.... confused to say the least.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally feel that there isn't anything that stands out to me as being significant or relevant information - but, you never know what could end up being a key piece of information I guess.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Also might add - I haven't really had the time to go and really look into most of the things from his message, so my opinion is solely based off of my initial interpretation reading through his message. So I'm not necessarily saying to throw it off as irrelevant - because there could be something important within all of it somewhere - I'm simply just saying my first impression was just that there wasn't anything that stood out as relevent.

            I'll admit, the nick cage funny or die video is strange in light of this context.  "pizza affiliated" on his chin, and a pizza slice on his forehead.

            i got this dump too. and like you i originally thought it was trolling- but like you said- OP seems quite rattled and convinced there is something here. I dont have time to look into it tonight but I will def look more into it tomorrow.
Edit: Kinda creeps me out about the Freddy Fazbears Pizza thing- my little one used to love that game :/

             He does indeed. But more to the point, I'm fairly convinced there's something here as well, and it's good to see that others agree.

             I've long suspected that FNAF could have something to do with Pizzagate. It just seems too weird for a relative nobody to invent a sleeper-hit game based around the concept of a pedophile-infested pizza empire without any connection whatsoever to the things we are uncovering over here.

             Glad you feel the same way. I spent a long time on this before deciding he wasn't a psycho.

             The OP called him an Autist, and I think that may have been meant literally. Whoever found these connections has a paranoid mind, and made some good observations in addition to some dubious ones

            Maybe "the rock" is a reference to Peter (Petras meaning rock) from the Gospel of Peter in the New Testament? Maybe these Satanist want to build their own "church" up on a new"rock". Jesus famously told Peter as he held Peter's shoulders: "Upon this rock I shall build a church". Replace Jesus with Satan and replace Peter's "shoulders" with whatever Rock hotel/cult and you get the idea........That's it though, I know it's totally random but that all I could think of.

             That's a huge stretch, and also a dead end. First, the Satanists have already built a church. Second, we really can't prove anyone connected to this is a Satanist. Even Abramovic isn't known to be a Satanist. She's Satanic, but there's a big difference between being Satanic and being a Satanist.

             Still, interesting point.

                I believe I'm mixing your post with the original op after reading your post again, my appologies. The youtube videos are probably going to blasted by retards, so they will go poof if they're incriminating. Just concerned and tired.

            The Nicholas Cage connection is he has done a move about this very set up of compromising politicians. The movie was really good. It was called 8MM. Watch it. Cage has known about this for years. And whoever produced the movie, writer, etc.
