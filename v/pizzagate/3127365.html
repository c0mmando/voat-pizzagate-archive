Certainly adds circumstancial evidence to Spielberg whacking people to cover his tracks. He’s the Hillary Clinton of Hollywood.</p>

<p>Working Theory:
-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). 
Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge.
Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent.
Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. 
Timeline: February-May 1987
Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother</p>
<p>-The Murder:</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of loose ends is likely.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Sid Sheinberg, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.</p>',

           One of Spieberg’s first victims. Annisa Jones and her brother. Odd that many of the girls Spielberg targets share similar traits. Judith resembles Ariana Richards (JP). Certainly adds circumstancial evidence to Spielberg whacking people to cover his tracks. He’s the Hillary Clinton of Hollywood.

           Working Theory:
-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith's mother (accomplice). 
Witness: Clare Torao
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge.
Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent.
Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. 
Timeline: February-May 1987
Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder:
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of loose ends is likely.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Sid Sheinberg, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.

            George Lucas: Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it’s an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she’s sixteen or seventeen it’s not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he…
