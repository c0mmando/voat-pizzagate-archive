<p>James Alefantis linked to DC photographer Max Hirshfeld who mentions orphanages that he went to - orphanages that do not have an online presence.  As the author writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would expect the orphanages to have a good online presence to facilitate fund raising and get the attention of rich westerns who would adopt Haitian kids in need. However, the &quot;orphanages&quot; that Max Mirshfeld visited do not have any online presence. This needs to be investigated.</p>
