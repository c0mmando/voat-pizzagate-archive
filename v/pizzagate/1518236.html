            This is not a new video but I believe it is relevant to Pizzagate in the way that it shows just how progressive politics and culture has ended up as a perverse attack on children through the educational system.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I'm not mistaken this video was made by russians to draw attention to what's going on.

             A counter-argument is that "progressive politics," in other words sex education, helps prevents children from being victimized by giving them an understanding of gender, their own sexuality and sexual expression.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pedophiles prefer targets who are not informed about these things because it allows them to "teach" (groom) the child into thinking their behavior is normal.

              Sure teach kids about the birds and the bees.. That man puts sperm in woman to make babies. It's for adults and most kids don't even wanna know about it before they hit puberty.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you go over the material being taught to children these days you'd be very shocked. Very early they are even teaching them about thing like analingus... You know licking each others anuses.. I don't know about you but I really think that's outside what they need to know.

              Common core is implementing a lot of horrific 'sex ed' stuff that include the wildest perversions. I think people should be allowed to be as crazy and wild as they want, but that doesn't mean we have to aspire to it in society as an ideal or teach it to our children as something normal.
             </p>
             <p>
              It all really goes back to Aleister Crowley who believed that children should be exposed to as many sexual perversions as early as possible. 
Many in the elite glorify and worship the teachings of Aleister Crowley who himself claimed to be the antichrist.

              Praying on children's minds isn't anything new tho. The catholic church has famously said something like "Give us a child before they're six and they will belong to the church forever". They know because it is an age that imprints memories very vividly. In early years we form our framework for decoding the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you can get in at the earliest age you can implant things that will stay with a person forever. Especially through trauma.
             </p>
             <p>
              I honestly think the sexual education we see today is made to groom children
