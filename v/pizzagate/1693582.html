<p>I\'ve covered Mike Trimm on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC02QmY5tugzIHNThGyYI7RA">Youtube Channel</a>. Was following him for his insight (he\'s got an IT background) about HRC\'s server shenanigans. One day he was gone. Youtube and Twitter were scrubbed.

<p>================ UPDATE on August 21, 2016 =============</p>
<p>My email from Michael Trimm on August 19, 2016:</p>
<p>&quot;The videos have not been deleted; they are only private until such a time that it is safe to re-post them. I am fine but at the request of (((fill in the blank here))) they have been removed. My comments about Gulen+Soros+CF+9/11 were pretty accurate - I guess accurate enough that I was told I was publicly talking about &quot;classified&quot; material when I myself should not have that information. Honestly the entire channel was simply me reading news postings I found on Twitter and Reddit and then reporting on them with my commentary. Apparently I was putting the pieces together in a way that could possibly hinder something... I have no idea. I was told once the case\'s announcement matures I should be able to resume the channel. Remember she had Rich killed because of (((insert a theory here))) and there is evidence that she had the Ambassador killed because while her CF server was in Benghazi he apparently went through it and talked to her about it and was &quot;alarmed.&quot; He was later killed that night by the terrorists that she herself created. He knew the truth. The FBI now knows the truth. Remember, Gulen and Soros are only as powerful as they are because of the CIA... we\'re talking treason at the highest levels in government here... &quot;</p>
<p>You can contact him here. He may or may not reply *.

<li>In a worse case scenario, if he was mugged and forced to give up passwords (etc.), maybe that wasn\'t him emailing me at all, but one of Clinton\'s goons. Who knows, until he posts a new video.</li>

<p>I made a video covering Trimm\'s abrupt absence back in August. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOY1-3-E30">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efOY1-3-E30</a></p>
<p>In doing so, I caught the attention of someone who tried discrediting Trimm on Twitter, especially since I espoused neither of the mainstream candidates. The way this person spoke made me think he was an insider.</p>

<p>That was an interesting exchange. What was weirder, were all the hits to my blog from a small area around DC. They mostly went to a single post where I detailed a medically necessary abortion and it\'s aftermath on my reproductive health (after having dealt with a molar pregnancy)... I since made that post private because I only had so much tinfoil in the house.

<p>I believe that those who think Mike Trimm is full of shit are either ignorant or a shill. He is no David Seaman pushing gold and bitcoin. He has an area on his forum dedicated to Pizzagate. <a href="https://michaeltrimmshow.com/forum/62-pizzagate-pedogate/">https://michaeltrimmshow.com/forum/62-pizzagate-pedogate/</a></p>
<p>Let\'s not shit on those who are trying to help. Michael Trimm is why I\'ve started researching and writing about human trafficking and pedophilia in our elites.</p>

             I figured that if they were to attack me psychologically, they'd aim for the figurative nuts (or ovaries, as the case may be).

             It's why I document everything. Every post I make on steem regarding the pedogate I upload all images, no matter if they've been used before, that way if one goes down, they all don't. I've informed people around me of the suspicious activity. Those I trust most have my back, and backups of information I've collected. Have made several email accounts and created drafts of emails with various info and screenshots attached... if they don't get sent, they aren't going to be intercepted as easily by prying eyes. Those with backups also have the usernames and passwords to the various accounts... doing what I can to cover my ass should shit hit the fan.

            Well now I know this is bullshit, thanks for the confirmation. Everything he mentions in that email is pretty widely known in conspiracy circles on the internet. I know all of that, and more. I talk about all that stuff everywhere, and no one is out to get me.

            My guess is this guy is a Seaman wannabe. Throw him on the scrap heap with all the other shills trying to create "buzz". We'll see what he delivers tomorrow. He'll be a hero or a zero.

             Bingo. This guy could also be a CIA or Soros backed shill too, privy to maybe just a kernel of unrevealed truth to lure the masses and then feed them disinfo. The Roseanne/Thomas Wictor et al disinfo psyop is pathetic. Roseanne acts like Cathy O'Brien and then speaks highly of Wictor. Wictor is a LARPer shill. I think they both are Soros/Brock shills. Wictor lures people with his narratives about the Trump admin's chess moves against his political foes. He then shills for Hillary/deep state/etc. by claiming Trump is neutralizing the corrupt govt criminals in ways other than arrests, and that we shouldn't seek arrests because it will tie up the entire justice system for decades, among other things. Total bs, and when the guy is called out, he blocks you. He's fooling lots of people on Twitter.

            Mandi Rei, thanks for a reasoned and nicely sourced post. You may want to consider going into other threads and posting a link to it in the comment section (you can add a bolded headline to set it apart from the other comments using the "H" button). This time of night, everyone back East is asleep so you may not get many eyeballs. 8am Eastern time is the best time to post.
