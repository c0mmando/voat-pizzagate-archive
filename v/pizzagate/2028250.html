<p>Another busy day in Washington. Started early on at NCMEC with interviews from 6.15am for the five major US TV networks morning news shows. A very serious issues programme 20-20 was also recording our visit to the America, as they will also be producing a piece on the search to find Madeleine.</p>

<p>Dear John, I hope your Summer has been going well.</p>
<p>Attached is an invitation to a cocktail reception in NY on September 25th with Richard Branson and Virgin Unite, to celebrate the SDGs.</p>
<p>We hope you will be able to attend. It should be fun – especially celebrating an SDG entirely about the ocean.</p>

<p>A connection between the Podesta emails and the McCanns? Well, actually, just maybe, there is: Podesta&gt;&gt;Richard Branson&gt;&gt;Jeffrey Epstein&gt;&gt;Ernie Allen&gt;&gt;Gerry McCann

<p>Regarding Madeleine McCann There is another aspect that appears to have been overlooked. Not only are the emails prior to her disappearance missing (consistent with deleting to cover itinerary, travel plans, etc.) other than the email the next day from Elizabeth: ELIZABETH TO SANDLER six more weeks elapse until Podesta writes another email and resumes regular daily email flow, unless this six week period was also deleted.

<p>The coloboma is a genetic marking within the eye, which reveals certain transcription factors behind it\'s creation, namely the PAX6 transcriptor, which is responsible for the formation of the eyes, the pineal gland and the olfactory bulb. It is within the olfactory bulb that neurogenesis occurs, that is the creation of stemcells into adulthood, a process which is accelerated and intensified by tetrahydrocannabinol exposure. Such processes would be invaluable to scientists who wish to live forever, for if you are able to maintain telomere length, you can experience cell division indefinitely.</p>
<p>In extreme cases, mutations within the PAX6 genetics can result in the complete absence of the pineal gland. In it\'s fullest form, coloboma results in bilateral feline pupil appearance. 
It is a well known fact that Madeleine McCann possessed coloboma. <a href="https://jillhavern.forumotion.net/t3214-why-have-the-mccanns-lied-about-maddie-s-coloboma-for-4-years">https://jillhavern.forumotion.net/t3214-why-have-the-mccanns-lied-about-maddie-s-coloboma-for-4-years</a></p>
<p>George Soros also possesses coloboma. <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140312121128-george-soros-1024x576.jpg">http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140312121128-george-soros-1024x576.jpg</a>

<p>FBIANON said SOROS is at the centre of this whole thing (pizzagate).</p>
<p>Podesta brothers and SOROS are all connected via the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.</p>
<p>Soros shares his genetics with Madeleine McCann, as evidenced by the coloboma.</p>
<p>On the day before Madeleine\'s disappearance, Podesta deleted his previous emails. Was this in anticipation of a release? <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1453292">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1453292</a></p>

<p>12 days after Madeleine went missing an article in the times appeared: \'Would an implanted chip help to keep my child safe? - In the wake of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, every type of child monitoring device is in demand\'</p>

<p>This relates to pizzagate because the police sketches of the McCann case are thought to be the Podesta brothers. FBIanon said Soros is the centre of pizzagate, so I think Soros is involved in microchip technology.</p>',

           The coloboma is a genetic marking within the eye, which reveals certain transcription factors behind it's creation, namely the PAX6 transcriptor, which is responsible for the formation of the eyes, the pineal gland and the olfactory bulb. It is within the olfactory bulb that neurogenesis occurs, that is the creation of stemcells into adulthood, a process which is accelerated and intensified by tetrahydrocannabinol exposure. Such processes would be invaluable to scientists who wish to live forever, for if you are able to maintain telomere length, you can experience cell division indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
           In extreme cases, mutations within the PAX6 genetics can result in the complete absence of the pineal gland. In it's fullest form, coloboma results in bilateral feline pupil appearance. 
It is a well known fact that Madeleine McCann possessed coloboma.

            Lobbyist Tony Podesta and his wife, Heather, bought this eight-bedroom, seven-bath house in Kalorama for $3.9 million. The house has a pool and 12-zone stereo. Podesta, brother of former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta, heads DC’s Podesta Group. Photograph by David Pipkin.

            In DC: Journalist David Brock and restaurateur/art dealer James Alefantis bought a six-bedroom Federal-style rowhouse on California Street in Kalorama for $1.75 million. The house has a second-floor reception hall and three fireplaces. Once a right-wing journalist, Brock changed his politics in the 1990s. He’s the founder of Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, and author of several books, including Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative.
