I imagine it\'s because of the potential power to blackmail people with this sexual perversion that their handlers and masters would have. Anyway, so how do they find people to put as figurehead politicians and so on, even the people operating the child trafficking rings may themselves be manipulated, by an inner circle, with a separate motivation and shared identity, not simply perversion. </p>
<p>Anyway, I was wondering how this could work and a couple of things stand out to me, from leafing through a couple of relevant biographies and autobiographies:</p>
<p>Arnold Goodman, a man who was an extremely powerful lawyer in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, was an important childhood guest and family friend of (then) future prime minister Edward Heath. Another early visitor and likely mutual family friend, Royalton Kisch funded his university education.</p>
<p>Now consider two things. Arnold Goodman, a man long rumored to be homosexual, was behind the covering up of multiple scandals in Britain, usually involving sex and homosexuality He played a role in the Jeremy Thorpe affair, an incident in which the leader of the third party in Britain was said to have arranged for his former gay lover to be murdered to silence him from discussing their relationship. He also played a role in covering up the homosexual relationship between a peer and politician, Lord Boothby and the kingpins of organized crime in London, during the 1960s, the Kray twins.</p>
<p>Secondly, Edward Heath has been accused of being a Peadophile and abusing children on his yacht. There is in fact a book which purports to explain how this entire system was part of mechanisms which Germany uses to subvert foreign governments. I suspect this is misdirection and the author has since been convicted of making terror threats. </p>
<p>Another character, this time one which actually links to pizzagate, is Clement Freud. He claims in his autobiography, Ego,  that he was basically sexually abused as a child at two of the schools he went to. One in a kind of “usual” way, he was fondled while expecting to be birched. The other one, however, involved him being read sexualized literature in bed, by the “house mothers” and also apparently, expected to bathe with a girl, when adolescent, which seems odd, but may have been more usual in previous years. The sexualized literature though, is reminiscent of the goings on in American phony religious cults which were cantered around child abuse; I remember that being brought up in a documentary. The school was called Dartington Hall School, it was founded by radical liberals and many radical liberals sent their children there. Clement Freud actually makes specific mention of the fact that the schoolchildren were targeted by Peadophiles, with them even waiting in train stations for the trains that would be carrying the children. The school closed in the 1980s, in a mire of scandals, including head teachers posing for adult magazines. </p>
<p>Anyway, again, this Clement Freud went on to be a powerful figure in the UK media in the 1970s, the time the likes of Jimmy Savile were doing what they did. And later on, eventually, after he died, he came out that Clement Freud was also a Peadophile who had abused young girls.</p>
<p>So the point I’m making here, is that while there is not clear evidence, there seems to be some grounds for at least entertaining the possibility that the Peadophiles within the elite are kind of specially sought out and perhaps even created through classical conditioning, so an association with love and sex with children is kind of wired into them. </p>

               yeah and it's reasonable stuff, numerology and that ritual video, but there is a lack of a direct link between that and what I have written about. It's disappointing, because what I researched is important and it's sad to see no one gives a shit.
