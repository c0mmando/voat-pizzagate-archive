</p>
<p>Good friend of Italy\'s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Rodolfo Fiesoli, ran a child sex ring and labour camp from Forteto, near Florence.  Children were sexually abused and used in backbreaking labour. They were beaten and forced to have sex with even their foster parents. Homosexuality was encouraged and heterosexuality was opposed.  Child slaves were adopted through the Juvenile Court until 2009, when the first complaints started to surface.  Fiesoli was first charged in 1985 with maltreatment and lewd conduct. In  2000, the European Court of Human Rights sentenced him and his partner to pay a fine of 200 million lire (about 135.000 USD) for moral damages suffered by the two children of a couple of immigrants in Belgium. But the adoptions continued, even though doubts were being raised, and despite the protests of the inhabitants of Dicomano (nearby village), irritated by the forced removal of two little girls from their families. The result was an order not to shop for children at Dicomano.  
</p>
<p>M.G., born in 1985 and taken to Il Forteto at the age of 5:
 &quot; I used to bring breakfast to Rodolfo Fiesoli (Founder of the community, called &quot;The Prophet&quot;) and then... hands in his underwear, kisses on the neck, even in front of my foster mother. She was actually the one that used to take me to him. She used to say: &quot;Just let youself go! Rodolfo does it to everyone, it\'s normal!&quot; </p>
<p>M.C., assigned to Il Forteto in 1983 at the age of 8 talks about when his foster parent adopted a little girl with down syndrome: 
&quot;She was younger than me. I slept in the bunk bed above her, and in the evening when he (the foster parent) came to say goodnight I heard strange noises. One evening I looked down and say he had lifted the sheets and was masturbating her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beatings, slaps, hair pulling...&quot; says one of the victims: &quot;Once I missed school for three days because they beaten me so much... I had marks here on my neck, and on the fourth day E. put makeup on me.&quot; S.P. remembers: &quot;the son of a judge, who was disabled, used to eat a mix of hay that is used to feed ruminants. Rodolfo gave him portions of corn silage, he ate it, puked and was the forced to eat his own vomit.&quot;</p>
<p>Locals are fed up because authorities have failed to do anything. Local and national politicians would often visit Forteto and a list of those who have visitied has been obtained.  Fiesoli offered votes in the elections and jobs to the Left wing party of Vicchio, whose  mayor and social administrators have failed to act. The abuses are most likely continuing as the 23 people under inquiry are still living there and haven\'t been thrown into jail yet.</p>

            Actually had to stop reading this and will have to come back to it later.
The Vatican from day #1 has been sexually abusing children and also sexually abused and destroyed the lives of native American children for the US government in its Genocide which killed 112 million natives in order to steal their land.
Both the Catholic Church and the Vatican ran the US government's "Church Schools" where the children of native Americans here were held, after being kidnapped from their parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, if the Vatican can't control governments, then they will surely put their own "Catholic" members into government to do it for them.

            I had to stop.  I could not finish beyond the slaps.  It is too hard.  What horrible things children must endure at the hands of adults.  It is beyond heartbreaking.  What to do?  How do we stop these horrible people.  It is in every country.  The holier they act they worse they are.

            The European Court of Human Rights decided that a fine was in order. That is in it self a human rights violation, in my mind. 
Europe always turns a blind eye when it comes to pedophilia, even when the subject is raised in parliament infront of everyone. It's heartbreaking.
