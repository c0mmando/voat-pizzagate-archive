Let them die in their sleep, and they will feel nothing. Is it right to cry out, to rouse the light sleepers among them, causing them inconsolable agony before they die?&quot; Qian replied that it was, because if the sleepers were awoken, &quot;there was still hope – hope that the iron house may one day be destroyed&quot;.

            The television crew discovered that the make-up of the pills they bought were between 97 per cent and 99 per cent human. And they all contained high levels of harmful bacteria, many of them of a type that could only have come from decomposing bodies.

            Angela, good to see a new post written by you!
           </p>
           <p>
            The story by the Chinese writer is very interesting for sure. Would you have the link to the Wikipedia article about him that you cited,  by any chance? ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, while I'm sure that 95% of all pizzagaters know the movie 'Eyes Wide Shut' by Stanley Kubrick, would you please be so kind as to also link to the Wikipedia article about the movie and add it on top of your post (after mentioning Kubrick)?
           </p>
           <p>
            You might of course, add a link any other article that would provide a short summary of the movie instead. (Maybe on Kubrick's IMDb page?) There may be some people who don't know the movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you! :-)

           <p>
            In the meantime, I'll have to give you one of our new flairs, i.e. per rule 2:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I'm gonna remove the flair as soon as you will have edited the body of your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please don't misunderstand this: this is our new mod policy, so posts don't have to be taken down, but can stay and get edited. Please edit within 24 hours. Thank you!
           </p>
           <p>

              Hi Angela, I respect this.
             </p>
             <p>
              We now have
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Blacksmith21">
               @Blacksmith21
              </a>
              and

               @Carmencita
              </a>
              who can help you finding these links.
             </p>
             <p>
              They take care of posts that have been flaired with an edit warning.
             </p>
             <p>
              They will get pinged and read this comment, and I would like to ask them to help you.
             </p>
             <p>
              You would only have to copypaste the links, when these two have found them and sent them to you. But, please take your time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately (you know - rules ;-) ), I would have to take your post down after 24 hours, so that the same standards will apply to all users.
             </p>
             <p>
              If this should be the case,
              <strong>
               please do a repost
              </strong>
              !
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you, it is a very interesting post, I didn't know this Chinese writer. This definitely should be discussed here. :-)
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep up the good work!

            I have not looked at the baby flesh pills article yet.  I just can't.  After doing the post on SRA I need to wait.  Later today or tomorrow maybe.  Sometimes I can read all kinds of things and keep going.  Sometimes not. But thank you for submitting.  I am sure it all ties in.  They are the Masters of Evil.

            I think your post and deductions about Lu are Spot On.  Most def is it right to always warn in the Face of Danger.  Yes, I believe others have also tried to warn us.  They are out there.  Thank You  for finding one of them. Amazing.

            The solution is to switch to a system where an iron house couldn't be built around you whether you know about it or not. IE: constitutional money that can never be printed and taxation systems that don't tax you first and decide what to do with it afterwards.

             Here is about Roman emperor Tiberius...
            </p>
            <p>
             “On retiring to Capri he devised a pleasance for his secret orgies: teams of wantons of both sexes, selected as experts in deviant intercourse and dubbed analists, copulated before him in triple unions to excite his flagging passions.” To top it off,
             <strong>
              he got blowjobs from babies
             </strong>
             : “Unweaned babies he would put to his organ as though to the breast, being by both nature and age rather fond of this form of satisfaction.”

              It's almost as if giving someone a position of power and telling them from birth that they're better than other human beings is a bad idea.
