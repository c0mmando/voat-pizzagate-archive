            This has been known pretty much since the beginning.  The Bronfman women are exceedingly rich due to the Seagram's money and they were the ones funding much of NXIVM.  Apparently one of the ways the cult leader got to them was by working on their bad relationship with their father.

            Edgar Bronfman called NXIVM a cult
            <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/1013/088.html#32ecb3191853">
             in this Forbes article from 2003.

            One of the ways cults work is to isolate you from your family and friends, so you can't get an outside perspective.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             But some people see a darker and more manipulative side to Keith Raniere. Detractors say he runs a cult-like program aimed at breaking down his subjects psychologically, separating them from their families and inducting them into a bizarre world of messianic pretensions, idiosyncratic language and ritualistic practices. "I think it's a cult," says Bronfman. Though he once took a course and endorsed the program, he hasn't talked to his daughters in months and has grown troubled over the long hours and emotional and financial investment they have been devoting to Raniere's group. One daughter, Clare, 24, has lent the program $2 million, at 2.5% interest, the senior Bronfman says (she denies this).
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The Bronfman daughters  starting giving Keith Raniere more and more money including covering his losses in stock and commodities trading.   He conned them that their father was behind the losses and they tried to hide from their family how much money they gave to Raniere.  This article on the split in the Family and Bronfman's legal battles is from 2010.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             People at nxivm were stunned. Expecting a positive story, the top ranks had spoken to Forbes, including Raniere, Salzman, and Sara Bronfman. What upset them above all were Edgar Bronfman’s remarks. “I think it’s a cult,” he told the magazine, going on to say that he was troubled about the “emotional and financial” investment in nxivm by his daughters, to whom he hadn’t spoken in months. Sara and Clare were shocked. Their father had given them no warning, people say. “I don’t think he addressed this with them, and they were deeply hurt by that,” says a friend, adding that especially for Sara, who had been made to look slightly ridiculous in the article—caressing her yellow nxivm sash and gushing that it was “the first thing that I had earned on just my merits”—“this resonated as a betrayal.” Within nxivm, word went out that Edgar Bronfman had encouraged the article, perhaps even feeding Forbes information “because he wanted to destroy nxivm.” If this was true, it backfired.
             <strong>
              “That,” says one woman, “was when Edgar Bronfman became nxivm’s enemy.”
             </strong>
             .....
In early 2005, they began covering Raniere’s losses in the commodities market. According to Bouchey, Raniere believed that he had come up with a mathematical formula that would enable him to make a killing. He’d already lost nearly $7 million on his commodities bets several years before. But, according to a declaration by Yuri Plyam, Raniere’s Los Angeles–based commodities broker, with the Bronfmans on board he began to trade “with the same extreme pattern” except that the trading positions were much bigger.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Raniere’s losses soared, he would tell people that Sara and Clare’s father was responsible. According to Bouchey, he said that Edgar Bronfman “had figured out a plot with the commodities clearing firm” to steal Raniere’s money. From January 2005 to late 2007, according to court filings, Raniere, trading through First Principles, a company registered in Nancy Salzman’s name, would lose close to $70 million—and the Bronfmans would cover $65.6 million of it. Between them, they would also spend close to $1 million to buy and refurbish Salzman’s house in Halfmoon; Clare would pay $2.3 million for a 234-acre horse farm outside Albany that nxivm would use; and Sara would buy a $6.5 million apartment in the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower in Manhattan that Salzman would use. They would also “lend” about $1.7 million to buy nxivm’s headquarters.

            " A person who was close to Edgar Bronfman, but did not want to be identified for this story, said it's very likely that Clinton and Edgar Bronfman communicated through email. They became friends after meeting in the late 1990s when Bill Clinton was president, the person said, and Hillary Clinton supported Bronfman's successful efforts with the World Jewish Congress to get Swiss banks to pay billions of dollars in restitution to relatives of Holocaust victims.

            Bronfman, who was 84 when he died, was a financial supporter of Hillary Clinton's candidacies, including her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign.
