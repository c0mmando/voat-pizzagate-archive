<p>Connected to both James Alefantis and the Rockefellers, there\'s no question that the Luzzatto family represent a powerful element of the DC pedophile ring. I have recently <strong>uncovered evidence that the Luzzatto family are both linked to occult kabbalah worship and the Black Nobility, a globalist faction based in Northern Italy and Switzerland. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was a messianic cult leader accused of promoting black magic through a secret cult during the 18th century</strong>, and his descendants have included freemasons, Club of Rome members, zionist bankers, international art collectors and of course, Rockefeller foot soldiers like Tamera Luzzatto. </p>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>Maeve Chaim Luzzatto, daughter of Alexandra Tydings-Luzzatto and possible victim of pedophilia and ritual abuse mentioned in Wikileaks, <strong>is named after the leader of a secret cult</strong> who were based in Venice and Padua, Italy. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yveMtSc.jpg">James Alefantis is her godfather.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto">Moshe Chaim Luzzatto</a> was a child prodigy who learned about the esoteric secrets of Kabbalah at a young age, and as early as his 20s, was the self-proclaimed leader of a messianic group who conjured the spirits of the dead called &quot;maggids&quot;. He soon gained a following among local jewish youth, but was soon accused (by other Jews) of performing black magic and &quot;black magic&quot; rituals involving elements of Luciferianism. I have collected quotes from a well-researched book called &quot;<a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Pursuit_of_Heresy.html?id=N7PQjAl8ugMC&amp;redir_esc=y">The Pursuit of Heresy: Rabbi Moses Hagiz and the Sabbatian controversies.</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after receiving the maggidic confirmation of his unique mission, Luzzatto joined a secret circle, Hebrah Mebakshei ha-Shem, in whose confines he would conduct his intense spiritual life. The special vision which informed the structure and activities of the circle contains the key to integrating the various aspects of Luzzatto’s legacy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book also confirms they would perform rituals quite similar to modern-day &quot;spirit cooking&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luzzatto would apparently communicate with apparitions called ‘maggids’ that prophesied events and offered the visionary hidden knowledge. But his ceremonies were small and were convened only between a secret cult that summoned the dead and performed Kabbalah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as Luzzatto gained popularity, detractors accused him of running an evil sect, and when other Jewish leaders confronted him and confiscated his stuff, they found evidence that he dabbled in the occult: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition they had found a book of magical oaths, including one which bound the evil Samael [an archangel represented as a goat] to reveal secrets of the Torah.  They also claimed to have found the appurtenances of occultic practices: a mirror with a black frame, a knife with a black handle, and a candle of black wax. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let\'s go back to the creepy Luzzatto website, <a href="https://archive.is/JGhR6">Evie\'s Crib</a>, and the article where it shows Alefantis acting as godfather to the new daughter. Notice how Tamera says <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CzagGDwUkAEsj4q.jpg">&quot;take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you&quot;.</a> She is referring, unbelievably, to her &quot;raw and uncut&quot; babies, one of whom is named after an <strong>occult messiah.</strong></p>
<p>Moshe Chaim was part of the Padua clan of Luzzattos, which eventually included a man by the name of Samuel David Luzzatto. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/98aggWe.jpg">It just so happens that Samuel was a major contributor to the plans of the Venetian Black Nobility, who were (1) major funders of the Zionist project, (2) Freemasons linked to Britain\'s Quator Coronati Lodge and (3) part of a secret group who wanted to rebuild &quot;Solomon\'s Temple&quot;</a>. Moses Chaim Luzzatto is also accused of <a href="http://www.phoenixsourcedistributors.com/html/j043/">Venetian Nobility ties on this website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most powerful families of the Venetian Black Nobility joined in the plot to rebuild Solomon\'s temple. Among these were the Luzzattos, Byzantine Jews, headed by Moses Haim Luzzatto, who moved the family from Venice to Safad in Palestine in the 18th century.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All speculation aside, the established link between the Italian Luzzattos and the American family shows that Tamera\'s position at the Pew Trust and as a member of the Rockefeller faction shows that her importance in Pizzagate can\'t be ignored. And given that she runs private events involving the alleged prostitution of her granddaughters with the Podestas and Alefantis, we need to see her as a major piece of the puzzle in the emergence of the Global VIP pedophile ring. </p>
<p>But there\'s so much more. During World War II, the Luzzatto family emigrated to the United States after fleeing the Nazis. But unlike most Italian immigrant families, <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=zr_c6moHNC4C&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=Danielle+Almeida+Luzzatto+Gardner&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V_7wzzbLGa&amp;sig=z4qvigBIEqdFmIX1wz5qTAgsir4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv_bWz5ZfTAhVB74MKHdlUBhkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=luzzatto&amp;f=false">the Luzzatto family immediately contributed to the war effort by working with the Marshall and the Roosevelt administration</a>, the latter which is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770143">still connected to Alefantis</a>\' and the progressive elite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bruno [Luzzatto], trained as an engineer and economist, worked in President Roosevelt\'s Board of Economic Warfare, helping with a small group of gifted Italian émigrés in the identification of italian bombing targets for the American Air Force. He went on to work in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), in Marshall Plan missions in Paris and Rome, and in the World Bank in Washington and Brazil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then we can\'t forget that Tamera was connected to Venice through the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1999/10/22/aid-official-francis-a-luzzatto-dies/617956d2-3cd2-4d4f-9172-640a257b9aa8/?utm_term=.201f49251e84">Franz Bader Gallery</a>, run by her late husband Francis Almeida Luzzatto (A former Corcoran School of Art faculty member like Amanda Kleinman). There is also <a href="https://i.sli.mg/2ReTob.png">the photo of her with four kids in Venice</a>, likely during the <s>art event</s> globalist meetup called the Venice Biennale. This pattern is in line with Tony Podesta\'s ownership of the &quot;art blu&quot; restaurant in Venice and his mysterious residence in Lausanne, Switzerland, a location I have confirmed is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1738543">directly tied to actual Illuminati members</a>. </p>

            Blow my mind! I have so loathed this woman, but to take this glimpse into where she comes from, the reality on some level is she is just another 'dead robot' that grew up to repeat the patterns she was taught. Sometimes it feels like the majority of the world has been in on this sick 'joke' forever,

            Marisa Luzzato is connected to Evie's Crib also and I am trying to remember her husband's name, trying to connect some possible dots here... She's associated with the parents that run a blog associated with Evie's Crib.. Marisa is friends with Tamera Luzzato on Facebook... I feel this is all connected somehow. We were discussing in a different thread Evie's Crib and an associated blog Jack's Place. Maybe someone can help connect some more dots?

The skinny: The Jewish Day School is not affiliated with any synagogue or movement, so its students cover all ranges of Jewish thought and practice. The curriculum includes Jewish history, Hebrew language and literature, and religion, as well as a typical high school course of study. “Other than prayer in the morning, if you walk through the halls it's the same as any other school,” says Roslyn Landy, the interim principal of the upper school. In high school, students choose how they wish to spend their morning prayer time, so some even participate in a group that focuses on spirituality without prayer… The school built a high school building just five years ago, so its classrooms, labs, sports facilities and art studios are all new… Seniors finish school after one semester, and nearly all of them spend the second half on a trip to Eastern Europe and Israel.

The skinny: Georgetown Prep is the oldest Jesuit school in the country, founded in 1789. The school has a traditional curriculum, including religious courses and a Latin requirement, but also utilizes new technology. “It’s very high-tech here,” says Admissions Director Michael Horsey. “You can teach a traditional curriculum but involve the high-tech aspect without the high-tech becoming the end in itself.” … Prep’s huge campus in Bethesda is undergoing a $35 million construction project. A new athletic center, scheduled to open next fall, will include a regulation indoor track, a 1,000-seat basketball gym, a 6,000-square-foot fitness center and a 10-lane pool. The school’s old field house is being converted into a learning center, which will house a new library, classrooms and space for student organizations… Prep is also redoing its on-campus golf course, which will use three fairways with eight greens to create a nine-hole course.

The skinny: Bullis has over 70 years of tradition and more than 80 acres of land at its Potomac campus. The sprawling campus makes Bullis very much a suburban prep school, known for solid academics and athletics programs. With the addition of a brand-new performing arts center three years ago, the school's reputation in the arts is improving as well, according to one education consultant. The arts center contains a 750-seat theater, practice rooms and music and art classrooms, including a dance studio, multimedia lab and photography studio… Bullis was founded 75 years ago as a school to prepare boys to enter the U.S. Naval Academy… Bullis, now coed, is also updating its athletic facilities, including the recent renovation of its stadium, part of a long-term effort to increase the enrollment at the school.

            Who said they did? I remember when I was studyingMedical Genetics the populations look at were all isolates. Generally Ashkenazi Jews with 4 gens or more of pedigree though I do remember some Sephardi subjects. There were different diseases for different inbred pops as would be expected.

            This is a big jigsaw puzzle. David Icke's theory about a gigantic network of pedophile elites are looking valid. And just think about it, these monsters are in charge of our entertainment, education and news. And we wonder how in hell we went from clean cut 1950's Christian values upholding culture to a nation of narcissist, immoral sociopaths - the arw reshaping the world in their own image.

             Maeve is one of the kids that was the entertainment in the pool for Podesta et al. I believe that qualifies her as "possible victim" of pedophilia and ritual abuse.

              It's my understanding as well that she joined the pool party (the evidence in email is quite strong), but that doesn't yet qualify that much. More evidence needed for that claim.

               But OPs claim is just that she is the "possible" victim of pedophilia. I think there is enough evidence for that weak assertion. In fact I believe that the claim exactly fits the evidence. How would you characterize Maeve?

                As very possible, so agreeing. The only problem currently is we haven't found more on this. Also the connection to Alefantis is problematic. Just must do our stuff.

            Nice post... crazy if true. Seems like quite a bloodline/breadcrumb trail. If it helps, I tracked down the archived version of the Wikipedia page that referenced the "Illuminati Bloodline". It is archived and still on Wikipedia, here:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Tydings&amp;oldid=749129219">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandra_Tydings&amp;oldid=749129219
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks like the user made the page edit without a username, but Wikipedia still tracks the IP:
            <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=ptr%3a+79.21.58.45&amp;run=toolpage#">
             https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=ptr%3a+79.21.58.45&amp;run=toolpage#
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Source was Italy. It looks like the edit was made about one month after the Podesta leaks hit in mid-October.

            We had a Luzzattopalooza yesterday, with Marisa-Paul-10 month Evie staying 
with us already while their house gets painted, and Ben-Alex sledding their 
3 over to "help" us decorate the tree. When the parents got back to 
retrieve children, they threw in the towel (and about 19 pieces of winter 
clothing) to stay for tortellini and an overnight. So, 6 grownups with 2 
toddlers and 2 infants spread throughout the house, and sure enough one of those 
toddlers was rubbing my nose at 5:45.........."

            Some passed this off as an innocent after shoveling dinner amongst friends but there was something about it that didn't seem right. It was curious to me how specific she was in mentioning numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            She says one child is a 10 month old but no mention of the other children's ages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throwing in the towel and about 19 other pieces of clothing. Why be so specific? It's an odd number at that. I think most people would say, "about 20 pieces of clothing" or "a big pile of winter clothes".
           </p>
           <p>
            "one of those toddlers rubbing my nose at 5:45am" Again, she's giving a specific number.
           </p>
           <p>
            What capped it off for me was the tortellini for dinner. Obviously, and by OP's info above there is an Italian connection. I looked up tortellini on Urban Dicitonary. This is the 5th definition

            tortellini
a sexual practice in Italy in which the male wraps his penis in pasta dough before sex
My man and I did tortellini last night and it was orgasmic

            Just some thoughts, but after I read that front page to her blog, I trusted nothing she wrote to be "innocent".

             6 grownups + 2 toddlers + 2 infants + 545 =  555.

              I wondered if 555 was some sort of code, but got sidetracked with a stock phone number (555) 555 5555 in a reply box on the autotrader site.  Something to watch out for?

               That is an extraordinarily creepy advert.  Wow.  And a Chicago area code, too.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have no clue what any of this might mean, but it will definitely make my antennae go up in the future.

              <p>
               My speculation re: number 32 is that it is a +1 from 33 (significant masonic number, but also a pictogram for anal sex).
Following that pattern, 555 is a +111 from 666.

              <p>
               Again, no idea what, if anything, this may mean....

              Zachary Hubbard in his Youtube channel goes into gematria overdrive - too bad he dismissed pizzagate on the basis of Laura Silsby smuggling 33 children - he thinks that 33 is a code of deception. At any rate, I have learned a lot about gematria in the last yeat or so, and these pedo occultists sure like to use them.

              I'm not necessarily saying the gematria aspect is the inference here. I'm more wondering if there is some type of message she is sending JP with the numbers used.

            Nice work! Makes more sense why Luzzatto would write what she did about her grandchildren.  God protect those kids.

             No wonder the panic from fakestream media. I remember Jesse Ventura on The View, openly discussing and exposing 9-11 as inside job while with pizzagate - absolute panic and white wash!!!
This is big. This post opens avenues and connects so many dots. I heard that the elite are in a panic mode, pushing Syria war as a diversion ( Chemical attack was a oure BS - Assad is not that dumb)

            Great post. Also of significant importance are the Pilgrims Society, the Knights of Pythias, Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission, Council of 13, Agenda 2030 and the United Nations. Paul Wellstone knew all of this and was murdered for it. He was standing up against the global conglomerates that are hellbent on destroying the world and enslaving the population. They have continued moving forward with their agenda since.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ashton (Chris) Kutcher, John McCain and others involved in the Kabbalah, Freemasons and related groups are actively working to cover up Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. All of these elements, including the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Clintons, Bushes, and other power players all have direct links to Racine, Wisconsin which is an experimental epicenter for global initiatives from vaccines and viruses to community policing and private prisons to insurance and banking to water and energy.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Trump or anyone brings down Racine, Wisconsin, it will set off a chain of dominoes around the globe. It is something that can be done today that will make a difference. The FBI and DOJ know all about it and are corrupt at the top. They are doing everything they can to stop investigations into Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Trump needs to go around them and go right to the people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's own daughter and family may have been targeted as part of the operation. It seems he is either compromised or paralyzed.

             It goes back to Saint Simon of Trento - a two year old boy discovered butchered in a Rabi's house in the middle ages. Famous story that confirmed the rumor about Jewish Talmudic Rabis sacrificing christian children to Moloch. (key word is Talmudic, corrupt oral interpretation of Torah)

             There is a video about Maurice's telative Tony Grewnberg and how Tony is an actor who posed as Shoe Bomber, David Rotchild and as Islamic Cleric - mocking the viewers. Whole media is a mockery.

            Something weird seems to be afoot between Qatar royal family and a Greek American owned Intel firm who they've decided to pay $2 million upfront for acquiring proof of life and returning a kidnapped royal family member.  I think the CEO was honored by pres. Clinton in 1999

            It’s unclear how Al Thani came in contact with the Global Strategies Council, which lists its director and CEO as Miltiade “Miltos” Goudamanis, a Greek national who now holds U.S. citizenship. Goudamanis works as international sales director for House of Brands, a San Diego-area shoe company, and is associated with a website called Naughty Monkey, which sells women’s shoes. He and a lawyer listed for the council did not respond to requests for comment.

            Emerson, Ruby and Maeve's mom is Alexandra Tydings (The aunt of Evelyn showcased in Evie's Crib.) When I originally researched this back in November 2016 I was able to find her on Wikipedia, including the note that she is of an "Illuminati Bloodline." I saved a screenshot on my phone, fortunately, because I went back to Wikipedia shortly thereafter and the "Illuminati Bloodline part was missing from her profile. I also have noticed some strange things with my phone, including that I am unable to do any type of copying or sharing of some of my screenshot photos. Long story short, I was able to print it, though, and took a screenshot of that, so my apologies for the quality here:

            this is an amazing compilation. If you choose to research Alexandra Tydings, I was able to find some images of her with one hand in a "claw" pose, which has something to do with the Illuminati, and judging from your research I'm confident you'll find so much more than I did!!

             Many Jews became Satanists, occultists, Magik practitioners.  It's not condoned by the Torah is why the Jewish religion is split.  Babylonian magik and Egyptian magik had a lot of influence on them throughout history &amp; everytime it did, according to scripture, they were then punished by God for dabbling in witchcraft.  Many times the occultists are the ones to escape the genocide while the innocent Torah Jews take the heat. The Tamuld is also not so great in some ideas it promotes.  Not all Jews subscribe to the Tamuld though.

              Judaism is Satanism, and the Kabbalah is black magic--there is not other kind. It is all to circumvent the will of the True God.

              Guess How Many Nations In The World Do Not Have A Central Bank?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Central banking has truly taken over the entire planet.  At this point, the only major nation on the globe that does not have a central bank is North Korea.  Yes, there are some small island countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia that do not have a central bank, but even if you count them, more than 99.9% of the population of the world still lives in a country that has a central bank.

              I believe Syria does not have a central bank as well thus the need to invade it. Also kaddaffi in Libya was overthrown for this reason. Russia got free from the central bankers under Putin I believe. Correct me if I am wrong.

               Before the destruction of Syria, and theft of it's oil and gas by the Jewish owned Genie energy company, the Syrian national bank, which offered interest free loans, paid 11% interest on savings accounts. Syria has free medical care for all, and free higher education including graduate and medical schools. It is the only truly secular govt in the Middle East, and religious minorities are protected. The Golan, large parts of Turkey and most of Lebanon were all part of Syria until they were stolen through war.
              </p>
              <p>
               Syria has significant Christian population; remember Antioch is where people were first called Christians. Over 600 churches have been destroyed as well as ancient monasteries. Certain villages which were primarily Christian were destroyed; villages in which Aramaic is still spoken (Aramaic is the language Jesus spoke).
              </p>
              <p>
               Libya had all the same benefits as Syria, and they Ghaddafi was minting a gold currency to be used all over Africa as well. He also made the desert bloom with his water engineering projects. This is why he was bumped up on the list of countries that Israel/USA have slated for destruction, as Wesley Clark pointed out many years ago.

               You can now see why the Rothschild and their minions are doing what they are doing over there.

             On Kabbalah connection, this pretty much confirms that even further
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Luzzatto's Messianic Doctrine: When Luzzatto formulated his messianic doctrine, the circle around him began actively to seek messianic redemption. The first "code" of the group, which has survived (signed by the members in 1731), includes ten laws, dealing with the methods of study, the relationship between the members and Luzzatto, and a declaration of the group's aim: "That this study [or speculation] will not be regarded as a private tikkun of the members nor will it be atonement for personal sins, but its only kavvanah will be wholly dedicated to the tikkun of the holy Shekhinah and all of Israel." Seven members had signed this "code," including Jekuthiel Gordon. Other members joined later, among them Luzzatto's brother and Moses David *Valle , who became one of the group's leaders. He was the writer of the group, author of a voluminous commentary on the Bible, which is extant in a few manuscripts. The members of this group believed that the process of redemption had already begun, and that it was going to reach its culmination in a few years. Their saintly way of life and kabbalistic speculations were intended to facilitate this process. Moreover, they were sure that they, personally, had an important part to play in the process.
             </p>
             <p>
              The writings of Moses David Valle seem to hint that Valle saw himself as the Messiah, son of David. Jekuthiel assumed the role of Serayah of the tribe of Dan, who was to be the commander of Israel's army in the messianic era. Other messianic roles were distributed among the other members. Luzzatto's own role becomes clear from a unique document preserved in his own handwriting – his commentary on his own ketubbah, which he wrote at the time of his marriage. This document proves that Luzzatto understood his marriage to signify a mystical event in the heavenly worlds, the union between Moses and Zipporah (which happened to be the name of his wife), who represent the elements of masculinity and femininity in the divine realm. The earthly marriage ceremony he understood as only a symbol of the redemption of the Shekhinah and her union with her divine husband. It is evident, therefore, that Luzzatto saw himself as a reincarnation of Moses, the man who rescued his people from the exile in Egypt and would redeem them from this last galut as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Luzzatto's opponents understood the messianic nature of his circle, and were afraid of the Shabbatean overtones which such activity might contain. The problem of whether Luzzatto's ideas and activities can be called "Shabbatean" or not is unsolved. Luzzatto himself admitted to being influenced by the writings of *Shabbetai Ẓevi 's "prophet," *Nathan of Gaza . However, he maintained that the good element in them should be separated from the heretical context. In some of Luzzatto's kabbalistic ideas, elements of Shabbatean influence can be found, for he maintained that the Messiah must descend to the realm of Satan, the Shabbatean explanation for their Messiah's conversion. However, Luzzatto insisted that this should not involve the Messiah's earthly body; it should be a spiritual experience only, involving no sin. Luzzatto was also moderately inclined toward the Shabbatean idea that a sin might serve a holy purpose, but he always made radical changes in the Shabbatean ideas which avoided their heretical and antinomian nature.

              How the heck did it lead them to use of SRA in pedophilia sipping blood of tortured children is why I guess we need to call for safe passage on our final return of our soul to the place of the source of Love when we die. I don't mean to be obscure but I'm not sure language has words to describe eternal life. The whole sacrifice rituals probably has everybody here having been reincarnated at cleanup time, from a past life experience of it. It is time.

              The holy royal houses of stratospheric wealth are mean, are mad, and we are fools to follow their lead. Until I knew about the real work of the realNikolaTesla I didn't see another matrix to imagine. But I imagine his Dynamic Theory of Gravity everyday by watching the waves birds flights carve because then I can see their shapes. Common shapes, hexagonal beehives, flutes of a whales tail, and the popular vortex, the gyroscope portals etc. Yes, we need a true paradigm shift. Oil is utterly unnecessary but their alt fuels are money scams for them. General Dynamics (General Mattis' friends) would have the stolen files, because of course his science has been weaponized. We have been educated with the marketing scheme using relativity and newton apple gravity.

             This is unbelievable!  Someone could really make a name for themselves. Daniel Estulin, Nick Bryant...  That level of people.  Maybe they don't want to end up like Danny Casolero - in a bathtup with both wrists slit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been reading about these people for over 10 years:  Eustace Mullins, Webster Tarpley, Dr John Coleman, Lyndon Larouche, Daniel Estulin, and a few others.  The Luzzatto family comes up in all of their histories.

             This is getting real close.  No wonder the MSM is trying so hard to discredit this.
