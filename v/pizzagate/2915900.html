           <p>
            Medina is best known for managing actress/singer/dancer Jennifer Lopez. Along with Lopez and then-head of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola, Medina launched Lopez's pop music career in 1999, after which he and Lopez worked intensively together building a dominant film, music, fragrance and clothing empire. In 2003, at the height of her popularity, Lopez and Medina had a public falling out, and split. They remained in contact with each other, and unofficially reunited during late 2007. As of 2008, Medina officially resumed his role as Lopez's manager,[citation needed] and is also a godparent to her twin children.[citation needed]
           </p>
           <p>
            Other clients were also managed by Medina to lesser extents, including Tyra Banks, whom Medina helped to create a largely successful television and fashion career. Medina managed Sean "P. Diddy" Combs and aided in the launch of the Sean John apparel and fragrance empire. He has also managed singer Mariah Carey, one of the biggest stars in the world of Tommy Mottola (his close colleague while working with Lopez) before being let go in September 2008. Medina was also dismissed by actress/recording artist Brandy (fired him in 2004), and R&amp;B singer Usher (who fired him in 2008)

            I think this guy is a Disney shill or he has a brain cell missing.  Believe it or not Many years ago I visited my friend who lives in Illinois.  She 
was taking her grandchildren to Santa's Village and I was not nuts about walking around all day in a Christmas Village in the middle of summer.  Well, guess what?  I loved it.  The Children were bedazzled and it was so magical without the glitz of Disney.  Disney had the help of the movies to help their popularity and that was going on for decades.  I went to Disney too many decades ago and was goo goo gaga there too.  But there was something very special about Santa's Village.  To me it seemed like it could actually be real where the other we all knew it was put on by someone with big pockets.  The Children knew too.  All 3 told me they loved Santa's Village more.  Santa had a special place in the heart of all Children.  That's my story for whatever it's worth.  Still think Mick is a shill.

            Santa's Village Re-Opening  and it looks like you people in  Illinois can visit too, the old one has been re-opened as well.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Santa's Village AZoosment Park (formerly known as Santa's Village) is a theme park in East Dundee, Illinois. It was originally built by Glenn Holland, who also built two other Santa's Villages, in California; one located in San Bernardino County and the other in Santa Cruz County. The Illinois park, the third to be built, was intended to be the flagship of a chain of Santa's Villages across the country. However, parks planned for Richmond, Virginia and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, were never built, and the park in East Dundee became the last of its kind.
           </p>
           <p>
            The park operated as Santa's Village from 1959 until 2006, when it closed. After extensive rehabilitation, it reopened in 2011 under new ownership. Renamed Santa's Village Azoosment Park because of the shared focus on both rides and animals, the Azoosment Park has nearly twenty rides and attractions, and hundreds of exotic and farm animals in an interactive environment. For a short time in 1972 the park was named Worlds of Fun. Because of confusion with other parks with similar names, the name was changed again to Three Worlds of Santa's Village.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, I remember the Reindeer.  This was something special that the Children really loved.  Me too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mick says
Another stupid fake blind. Do some research. This one does not hold up to any scrutiny. Santa's Village was never a better park. It was out in San Bernandino and never going to get the traffic of Disneyland. Check out the pictures from back in the day. it was never even close to Disneyland in scale or quality. EVER!
           </p>
           <p>
            You are full of baloney Mick, and something else.
