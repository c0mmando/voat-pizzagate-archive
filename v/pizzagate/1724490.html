<p>Has anyone seen the full video of this? I didnt even know this video existed.
Im looking for the date it was made.
The full video.
Any other information that you have about this video.</p>
<p>He mentions the emails and Podesta by name. </p>
<p>The videos were posted around Nov 4, 2016</p>
<p>I assume Breitbart has the full video as they have their logo on the video.</p>
<p>I think the full video has been suppressed. This video cuts out before the QA that Milo is famous for. Only bits and pieces of this performance are available even on his official youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0aVoboXBUx2-tVIWHc3W2Q">account</a> </p>
<p>The banner on his FB wall is a pic from this speech. Yet no video is to be found there either.</p>
<p>What date exactly did the character assassination take place? (milo responded to it sometime in february, I cant find the original attack on him) This information is important in this timeline. Please help find the source video that was originally posted attacking.</p>',
