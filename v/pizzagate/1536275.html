            This is a misleading post. There is nothing in the article that even slightly alludes to her being raped. In fact, she seems to be about as far from victim status as possible. She says:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Lanier said she didn't realize at the time that her future could be at risk. She was just a normal kid, she said, too dumb to think about consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The good part and bad part about being a teenager is you're stupid," Lanier said. "I realized after I dropped out of school and got married that things were different. I didn't go to proms, high school games. But I never thought of it that way before."&gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>

             see KingKongisCTR' comment below. The head cop who smothered that 11 yr old girls allegations, wilfully fucked up her investigation and fucked with the evidence - and charged her with malicious complaint when she turned 18 - that cop was recently at Comet ping pong in a 'show of solidarity' for Alefantis or some shit
            </p>

             you can betcha that department of police is part of 'their kulture'

              That's truly fucked up. But we need links to that. We need to clearly distinguish between the two police chiefs. And we especially need to NOT say someone was raped without citing sources that support it. Baseless smears and innuendo is how the elitist media operate. We can't defeat them by doing the same thing.

               There is no such thing as sex with a 14 year old that is not rape. I don't care if Pakistan or something has laws that you can have sex with a six year old. It's still rape as far as ethical people are concerned.

                That depends on which state you are in, and the age of the other person involved. I don't think it's rape in any state if two 14-year-olds or a 14 and a 15-year-old do the naughty. In my state, the kid has to be under 14 and the partner has to be more than three years older, IIRC. Otherwise, every pissed off parent would be throwing their kid's high school boyfriend in jail.

            Was her future husband labeled as a rapist because she was a young teen and he was an adult? Meaning was it actually "statutory rape?" Apparently her marriage lasted at least 3 years after which she moved in with her mother and grandmother.

             A 14 year old girl becomes pregnant and you're asking me to prove it wasn't a legitimate sexual encounter? What the hell is that? If you want to play jurisdiction statutory games about legitimacy, it is YOU that has to make the argument for its legitimacy. I know you want to and I'm giving you the floor to do it. In fact I need you to do it to open the new can of worms for where I want to go with my next post.

              If you can't distinguish between a girl smiling and moaning "ohhh, baby, Yes, YES!! YEESSS OHH GOD YESSS" and the exact same girl crying "NO! STOP! NOOOOO!!" then there is something wrong with you.

              That is NOT to say that statutory rape is OK.  It isn't.  But it's a very different experience from forcible rape.  Each has its own aftereffects, and there's good reason why we say underage is not OK even with the kiddo's permission.  But to simply say "she was raped" is misleading if she was wanting it and enjoying it at the time.  No amount of righteous indignation can alter that natural fact.

              I came here expecting to read about a forcible rape, but there's no indication that that was what happened.  This was apparently, at worst, statutory rape -- which, again,
              <strong>
               is still bad
              </strong>
              , but it's not the same thing.  I advise making the clarification to avoid people feeling (as I do) bait-and-switched.

              Look up definitions of rape -- legal, moral, whatever you like -- and then tell us which applies here and why.

               Why are you making me do the work? Where I live, sex with a 14 year old is rape. If you have a case to make against my definition, then make it. If you want to claim that what is rape in my state is totally legitimate in the area around DC where all the pedos have migrated to and created the climate for pizzagate and instances of children disappearing, then make the case.

                Assuming the person she had sex with was her age, which of them was the rapist? Were they both guilty of statutory rape for having sex with the other? In most (if not all) states, there is no statutory rape between two minors of the same age or within a certain range of each other.

            Just on the hunch that these brazen pedos in DC feel like they have nothing to fear from local law enforcement, I thought I'd check out the bio of the Chief of Police. Not exactly what I was expecting to find, but does show either promiscuity in youth or victim of pedophilia. Of course it could have went the other way and they promoted someone who would be especially tough in regards to something she endured, but I see no evidence that local DC law enforcement is concerned about the kids.

            Looks like she just took a job to be head of security for NFL.
