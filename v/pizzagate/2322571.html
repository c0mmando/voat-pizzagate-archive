            : So basically the thesis here is that some nail bars have been connected to prostitution, there happens to be one across the street from CPP, and therefore it should be investigated? Pizzagate isn't about Asian prostitutes. It's about children being raped and filmed by the rich and powerful to blackmail the slightly less rich and powerful. If you can make a plausible argument for a direct connection, please elaborate and repost. If not, this belongs in

            Nail Salons are often used just for labor trafficking with no prostitution involved.  It's involuntary exploitation, but in most cases, it is just doing nails and this is why they were in the DHS video.  In one case, you have almost an exclusively male clientele and in another you have an exclusively female clientele. It's a way to profit from two markets. Nail Salons are a labor intensive business and cheap labor improves your profits.  Some are also involved with prositution, but that would most likely be places that offer massages in addition to mainicures.

           <p>
            This is not true on several levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            First off this is Terasol's logo
            <a href="http://www.terasolartisans.com/bg-5-575466.jpeg">
             http://www.terasolartisans.com/bg-5-575466.jpeg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, the heart image they used is different is several ways from the FBI logo. (And the fbi never said that iconography was exclusively used by pedophiles.)  The pedophile logo is intended to be something you draw without taking your pen of the paper it seems to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.place4free.com/Watamula/Assets_Watamula5/Pizza21.jpg">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The hearts are different.  The hands are completely absent in the FBI logo.   This appears just to be a piece of clip art they used.   You can see this exact same design used by a few other organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hearts with hearts and hands with hearts are pretty stand design ideas as you can see by the many, many clip art variations.

            I heard this years ago.  The girls can then be put to work in two different markets.  Also if a girl can't do sex work for say medical reasons, she's still able to do the nail bar.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once stuck at traffic lights close to the city, I noticed a shop where a new nail bar was being installed.  I watched two middle-age, somewhat paunchy Chinese guys inspect the work with satisfaction.  These guys appeared to my eyes like gangster types.  The gangsterishness of these two made me really believe for the first time the rumoured nail bar connection with brothels and human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always wonder would the mostly white (at least in my city), all female customer base of these nail bars care if they knew how dodgy the business was.  Women's strong need to look as good or better than other women might be just as strong as men's need for sexual relief.

             Yes not all trafficking is sex trafficking.  Labor trafficking is also a big business.

            Dude, stay with me here, but I'm starting to suspect the Asian massage parlors are fronts for prostitution too.
           </p>
           <p>
            As usual you dolts are a good eight months behind.  I identified salons as fronts adjacent to pizza shops in addition to what...?(this is a quiz). I've accumulated quite a library of screenshots.  I could post them but I don't wanna clog up the forum you know and distract from the QAnon jewsfeed

                  Noticed the (((MSM))) talking a lot about Iran and the evil Muslims?  Ready for your brother to be deployed to a country three times the size of Iraq to fight another war for Israel? People as naive and stupid as you may not deserve death, but you absolutely don't deserve to vote and we can all agree on that.

            In large urban areas I'd say yes. They charge soooo little for mani/pedis in those areas that they have to be making the money up somehow

             See this is why women are so valuable here. Without the knowledge of comparative prices of fingernail decorations no one would suspect such an exclusive and prestigious business could in fact be a front to launder money and legally employ sex slaves.
