<p>A limited liability company called Viente-Siete/Charlie\'s Wings LLC at 1471 Route 9 Suite 202 in Halfmoon, the same address the Bronfmans used as their address as donors to the Senate campaign fund, made the in-kind donations.</p>
<p>An organization with a slightly different spelling, Veinte-Siete LLC, is listed as the owner of a Canadair 1995 jet, with a Manhattan address that is the same as that of the Bronfman family\'s accountant, Holtz Rubenstein Reminick. The firm did not return calls this week.</p>
<p>The 1,200-square-foot office, located down the corridor from Executive Success Programs in the Rome Plaza, was vacant on Thursday. It has been rented to Barbara J. Bouchey Asset Management, a financial planning firm that advertises to &quot;affluent individuals, families and businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>Bouchey, who has been associated with Nxivm for years, declined to discuss the donations made from the office she rented. She said other registered financial advisers have been allowed to use her office to do business. She added that she is not political and was unfamiliar with the LLC.</p>
<p>I have heard that Sara and Clare Bronfman for some time have been making donations to political campaigns in the hope of ultimately ... garnering influence for their mentor, Keith Raniere and his organization, Nxivm.&quot;</p>
<p>He said providing the Bronfman jet to Nxivm is not uncommon, but using it for politicians is a new development.</p>
<p>Senate officials say the most likely user of the LLC\'s in-kind contribution of air transportation is Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, R-Brunswick.</p>
<p>Bruno\'s use of state aircraft for meetings in Manhattan on days of Republican political fundraisers and of private jets arranged by a suspected lobbyist have come under scrutiny by state investigators this year. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said Bruno did not violate the state\'s policy on state aircraft use. Investigators have not accused him of any wrongdoing in accepting the private rides, but the person who arranged them, businessman and Bruno friend Jared Abbruzzese, could face stiff fines if he violated a ban on expensive gifts.</p>

            Trudeau must be in deep with Bronfman .  I have read they own Canada.  They call the shots while Justin runs around in his kilt.

            Obviously, NXIVM tried to play both sides. They even donated slightly more money to the Republicans, and if you take the plane trips into account, the total donations to the Republicans double the amount of donations to the Dems.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump associate Roger Stone even worked for them for two months. There was also a Republican named Casey who worked for them, IIRC, we never looked into him.
           </p>
           <p>
            But all in all, the connection to the Dems seems to have been deeper, due to the Bronfmans and their role in the CGI.

            <p>
             A simialr conpartive study needs to be made on the bearacracy such as SEA...and their placement in republican and democrat govt..
In position such as deputy assistant secretaries , and other upper mid level influence positions...
            </p>
            <p>
             A time line ...database ...should be set up..

            <p>
             Where the bronfmann sisters the republican equivalent of the awan brothers...?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there a NXIUM blackmail operation acting on the republicans ...
The trudeau assocuation with aga khan might give some leads into whether 
Awan brothers or some pakistani/ saudi equivalent were running child rape bkackmail ops..
            </p>
            <p>
             The aga khan with child foundatiins in thirld wotld countires and their connection to the saudis could be the pizza waiters for the republican side of the equation..
Saudi association with nazi bush and nazi muslim brotherhood is well established...
Aga khan has the networks the saudi need to run a thirld world source for child rape rings..
            </p>
            <p>
             The recent rescue of children from oil tankers in iran , kidnapped from afghanistan and pakistan , wad made at the ancenstral hometown of the aga khans ..
            </p>
            <p>
             People in this forum seem to be afraid to touch the saudi connection to connexticut avenue..and aga khans connection to clinton foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway , all thsi info is collected by the NSA..
When universal jurisdictiin is activated by indivuduals not comprimisied public officials..via debt reduction of the US treasury...its only a matter of time ..

              Apart from that, the Aga Khan has connections to Justin Trudeau, who is a liberal / globalist. So I don't see a Republican connection here?

Free trade for this conglomerate...of satanists..using legalese as their code language..
They do not want any competutiion from strong countries...it expalins the cia program of europe..and the time has come to break it up...
The only country where there is. No chaos is business as usual london corporation

Aga khan is the puppeteer for deep state axtivities...hence his associatiin to children foundations and war zones and opiun trade routes set up by the deep state..
Left wing is cover for right wing deep state...
And Right wing republican is cover for left wing deep state.
Eg rockafeller medical foundation is the cover for left wing mass culling using vaccine, western diet high carb causing lifestyle disease, statin drugs caausing kidney failures, organ failures and thus organ trafficking..

                Formally, Trudeau is a liberal, and he is also clearly a globalist.

              Well, maybe they were blackmailing people. Remember that one of the Bronfman sisters allegedly hacked the computer of her father, Edgar Bronfman. He was president of the Jewish World Congress. He exchanged emails with a lot of people, the Clintons were among them.

                 Study the bronfmann criminal network ...its xonnection to the mafia...and mafias connection to the counternazi machinations of the OSS...and FbI..
The eugenics networks are defintily run by right wing and left wing ...of the same roman eagle..
                </p>
                <p>
                 The bronfmann probably have a hidden network in the form of mafia ..
There is a utube video showing honeybee zacharia connection to mafia...
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is no left wing ,liberal, right wing , republic...
The elephant in the room is us being a jackass about the truth that there are only sociopaths and us that fuel and fund their credit card agreement with us known as the constitution..
The word cinstitutor meqns someone who shifts debt into the surety..
Ie ..they ask us to vite them in to shift debt into our heads...
There is no lert or right ..its us vs sociopaths
Dumb and dumber

                  I don't know exactly what you're trying to say. But I think the idea that criminals have no loyalty but the dollar bill comes into play. Why wouldn't they "form connections" to both sides if they could?

                   She doesnt give solutions...so i dont give anyone the time...
..
Hours and hours of interviews , not one solution..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   She will not touch the arab connections...she came on the scene around the time besta pizza was on the radar....and then hours and hours of distraction from investigating the shipping companies , attached to besta pizza..
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There was as usual a british muslim connection..connecting the shipping company to besta pizza..likely the aga khan connection
Honey bee was part of the destractiin maze created as  soon as Besta pizza was being investigated..
Same with this forum..
The pizzagate lead to besta pizza...and this forum never update the research leads or concentrates on aga khan and his shipping companies...
Thr kids in iran were being transported to thr ports of irsn from thr strongholdnof aga khan
