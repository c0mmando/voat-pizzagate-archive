            Madeleine is 13, going on 14 now. She was sold to people with money. Try crossing a different ocean.

            Right now, after Vault 7, I'm not believing anything negative about Russia.  There seems to be a disinformation campaign against the nation by Western Press.  This may just be an atrocity committed to gin up hatred toward Russia.  More may follow and I'm just not going to buy it.  But I am still Upvoating this because it's important to know this information.
