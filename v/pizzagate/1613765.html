            I always wondered if there was more to the Scott Peterson story than just some doofus fertilizer salesman cheating on his wife.

           <p>
            In the light of now knowing what we all now know, I wonder how many other famous murders had satanism at their core? Laci Peterson had her limbs chopped off and her head was missing. Scott, although a prize prick, just seemed too stupid to truly be that evil.

              Could it be that high level political and or civic leaders in California are involved in practices as has been found in other states in the U.S?  Could it be that they are using as their agents people like those in the brown van known to be involved in the other numerous crimes occurring around the same time and in the same location as Laci Peterson’s disappearance and subsequent murder?  Could it be that California law enforcement personnel are involved in the cover-up?  Could it be that a high profile attorney such as Mark Geragos could also be shielding the involvement of prominent people by withholding evidence at trial and assuring the conviction of Scott Peterson?
