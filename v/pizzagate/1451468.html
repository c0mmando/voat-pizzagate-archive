            The thing is we have people with an IQ of 80 mixed in with people with  IQs of 120+.  The dumb people outnumber us and impede progress.  The smart people need to split from the average dumbed out fool which comprises the majority of society.

            The site is compromised.  I try telling people, showing them, explaining it, and yet they don't care.  You will one day learn that people virtue signal and don't really care about truth.

             The MODS are the shills, everytime anybody posts any thing that doesn't fit the Alex Jones narrative they delete it..
A few days ago the asshole was kingkong, today its millenial-falcon, I think they're all the same person 'david seaman' who is behind this entire meme.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             what the fuck is a shill? To me its somebody on the HASBARA payroll, nobody pays me and my message is that there is pedophilia, its real and its from our own government.
            </p>
            <p>
             the problem is the MOD shills have an agenda, only discuss clinton, cf, her friends ... fuck that 
pedophilia is a right-wing domain, most liberals are in to consensual sex, right wing assholes like J Edgar Hoover or BUSH/RAYGUN are sodomists, real pedophilia is a right-wing religion
            </p>
            <p>
             donald Trump is one of the biggest PEDO's in NYC 1980-1999 running the epstein/trump teenage modeling company making little girls into professional whores
...
notice 3 days ago king-kong was the problem then for 2 days no delete, and there were only two mods, now there are ten mods and they'e all assholes, just like 3+ days ago
            </p>
            <p>
             The common is king-kong sems to be ass hole leader, most likely all same person, and that be david seaman, as the mods follow his meme

              It's controlled opposition.  Like I said, people are too stupid to realize it and even if they do many people just don't care. They'd rather lie to themselves for security and tell themselves everything is legit.
