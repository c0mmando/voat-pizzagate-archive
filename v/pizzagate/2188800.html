<p>Some of the movies he helped get child casting for are Super 8,” “Cheaper By The Dozen 2” and “School of Rock.” All movies that came out way after 1996 when he raped that 8 year old. Our other big child rapist is Martin Weiss. Martin is also a child casting agent. He continues to work on the biggest shows like &quot;Grim&quot;  and has worked on huge shows from the past like Law and Order and the Golden Girls. He raped an 11 year old up until the boy turned 15 and reported him. He has also worked on Shows such as ICarly, ParentHood, and even the Muppets Movie.

Almost any producer, casting agent, production crew or staff connected could or are in on it. Child actors are raped by the dozens all for wanting to follow their dreams and be a star. We see a sick web of lies and they continue to get work even if they are caught and convicted. How monsters who have raped 11 and 8 year olds continue to work is beyond appalling it\'s the failure of our whole society. Even adults working in the industry are now coming out saying they have been molested as well like Rob Schneider, Terry Crews, and all the woman molested by Weinstein. This industry is one big rape induction on both adults and children. You must be raped and/or molested to get work. They are all connected and all known names. </p>

            This is truly sickening...like there arent so many other agents that arent PREDATORS?! Seriously Hollywood you really need these guys soooo bad that you are willing to allow them to work post conviction? Is finding talent that tough? Signing contracts takes some kind of special skill?? I mean what in the fuck?

            The core alter is the child alter. Around this core alter the rest of the programming is built. This is the child alter of Anna Nicole Smith. What you are about to see is a person's core alter. This guy trigger her child alter, filmed it, and planned to sell it to sickos for big money.

            Wow, very well done in terms of compiling all of this... the Twitter bans that are happening to the victims are going to add fuel to the fire. If someone comes forward with hard-hitting evidence and they all band together to name-names (especially if those names are not limited only to Hollywood). The dominoes will begin to fall.

             Verifies everything I said in response to those of you who said victims need to speak out and to tell someone. Right. Like who? he had a lot more power and credibility then newer, younger talent. Still she was not believed nor taken seriously. Neither police, State of CA, nor unions care whatsoever of you have any complaints of any kind re the industry.

              Note that the very well-made "Open Secret" by a woman director with a top rep didn't ever get more than a couple independent theaters to show her film. Nor did she ever receive the normal press coverage. Earlier "The Franklin Scandal" Documentary was completely pulled from the TV schedule despite written announcements of its coverage. Wonder why?

              Trauma based mind control splits a person's personality into multiples which can then be programmed by placing subconscious triggers in order to manipulate them.

              And to add, as they strip a person of their soul, will, and drive, the victim becomes "the empty vessel." Then the Monarch programmers "fill the vessel" with whatever they want their victim to become, which will be some type of servant to the cult of the abusers. That might be a sex slave, manual labor, assassin, spy, or simply a victim they plan to sacrifice in a bloody ritual to traumatize other victims.

              One of the main functions of Monarch Programming is to totally strip the victim of their own sense of will and direction. Sexually assaulting and dominating a person that young strips them of their own will and makes them submissive. Sexual assault is a HUGE factor in making a person helpless.

               Sodomy is one of the main factors in trauma based mind control Evev for girls sodomy is repeatedly used because it put pressure on the base of the spine which in turn opens the Pineal Glan (third eye) acsessing the unconscious state. During the sodomy children are further torchered with Satanic ceremonies, human sacrifice, intense pain, watching other children being raped, etc.

               They must get to the child prior to age 3 to create most damage.

              <p>
               How do they get them? They kidnap them, breed them, buy them, etc.
