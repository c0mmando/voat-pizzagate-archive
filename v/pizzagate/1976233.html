             Yes.  John F. Kennedy and Jackie's son John Jr.  also known as John John as a little boy.  The one that died in a plane crash with his wife.  He had promised to release the name of the person who was behind the assassination of his father.  He came out with a magazine and it's name was George.  George, just plain George.  I had a copy of it and I wished I had kept it.  Did not know then what I know now.  A pity.

            Could it be that Pell is being set up in a way? He was reforming the financial side of things at the Vatican. Imagine what he's seen. Image where he's seen the money go to and come from. "Follow the money", as they say.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are and has been different factions in the Vatican, fighting against each other. The power that institution wields has been very sought after from people within and from the outside.

            Lets hope that the righteous ones stick it out.

             I believe that Pope Francis (the Pope like no other) works for the NWO. 
Cardinal Pell being thrown to the wolves will hasten the demise of the RC Church - the Pope like no other isn't planning on sticking around for long. He's keenly aware he has a job to do and once it's done he's gone.  Cardinal Tobin has risen rapidly as a Champion of George Soros and Sons' LGBT(PQ and whatever else) push in the RC Church.  Interesting times indeed.

              This Pope is the one who disbanded the Roundtable of adult victims and decided to do nothing. In the end they were disappointed and then more were caught. This is a part of it.

            He said "bishops should rethink their stance on abortion, because Trump can't be trusted." I have to say that is some really twisted thinking right there. It sounds like he is basically saying well get the kids, one way or another.

            Welcoming our sisters and brothers in Christ
Extract from Cardinal-designate Joseph W. Tobin, Archdiocese of Indianapolis, 7 October 2016 
During the past year, we’ve heard a lot about immigration. Since this is a major issue in the upcoming elections at federal, state and even local levels, I want to take this opportunity to state as clearly as possible our Church’s position on this very important matter.    Here is a summary:                                  The Gospel mandate to “welcome the stranger” requires Catholics to care for and stand with newcomers, authorized and unauthorized, including unaccompanied immigrant children, refugees and asylum-seekers, those unnecessarily detained, and victims of human trafficking. Comprehensive reform is urgently necessary to fix a broken immigration system, and should include a broad and fair legalization program with a path to citizenship; a work program with worker protections and just wages; family reunification policies; access to legal protections, which include due process procedures; refuge for those fleeing persecution and violence; and policies to address the root causes of migration. (U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, “Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship,” #81).              In my recent columns, I have made the statement that no individual candidate or party platform conforms perfectly to our Church’s views on the major issues being discussed in this election. Immigration is no exception.        That means that when we examine what the candidates and political parties are saying about this issue, we must be especially careful to understand both the moral principles involved and the practical implications of the views being espoused.....(more).

            The Catholic Archbishop of Newark slammed U.S. President Donald Trump Tuesday, painting him as a fear-monger who appeals to the “dark side of Americans.”
In an interview with the French Catholic newspaper, La Croix, Cardinal Joseph Tobin said that the current climate of insecurity “has caused an exaggerated patriotism in the United States,” suggesting that Trump plays on Americans’ fears and desires to see America “great again.”

            “I think President Trump appeals to the dark side of Americans,” Tobin said. “He speaks to fears, to insecurities.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In last November’s election, Catholics voted for Donald Trump by a substantial margin over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, with 52 percent voting for Mr. Trump and only 45 percent voting for Mrs. Clinton, the Pew Research Center reported. The victory for Trump among Catholics represented a significant 5 percent shift away from the Democratic Party in the four years since 2012.

            Catholics were undoubtedly swayed, at least in part, by the vocal support of various bishops who openly declared that the platform of the democratic party was unacceptable, especially because of its hardline pro-abortion position.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Catholics in good conscience cannot support candidates who will advance abortion,” wrote the Archbishop of Denver, Samuel Aquila, in his diocesan newspaper.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nonetheless, in his interview, Tobin suggested that these bishops should rethink their position, because Trump is not to be trusted.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Donald Trump is a businessman. He says he’s always looking to close a deal,” the Cardinal said. “The bishops must beware of him, because he tells them that he will be against abortion, that he won’t force them to pay for contraception, and in return, he asks for silence concerning his disrespectful remarks toward others or on the deportation of migrants. It’s dangerous.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “We, American Catholics, are a Church of migrants. We have always pleaded their cause,” he said.
           </p>

            Although his words targeted President Trump, Tobin has a history of conflict with Vice President Pence as well. As Archbishop of Indianapolis, Tobin openly defied then-Governor Pence concerning the reception of Syrian refugees into the state.

           <p>
            Despite Pence’s objections over settling a Syrian family, which he said had not been sufficiently vetted, Archbishop Tobin went ahead anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I informed the Governor prior to the family’s arrival that I had asked the staff of Catholic Charities to receive this husband, wife and their two small children as planned,” Tobin said.
           </p>
           <p>
            In his interview with La Croix, Cardinal Tobin said he is aghast at the level of polarization in the United States, even among Catholics, “as if we had imported the divisions of the political world into the Church.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He said the situation reminds him of the way communism affected religious communities in Eastern Europe, making them suspicious of one another.

            “Here in the United States it is the same: we run the risk of being influenced by models, without questioning them or assessing whether they are coherent with the Gospel,” he said.
           </p>

            First Lady Melania Trump is the first Roman Catholic to occupy her post since Jackie Kennedy.
