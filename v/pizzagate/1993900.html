<p>First, I\'ve been getting weird stalker phone calls from unknown numbers for months. They would call at the same time every day. I finally changed my number but someone soon got my number. I wasn\'t sure if this was my ex, or an FBI related stalker. I changed my number again. Last night within 5 minutes of posting to Voat about the channel ToyFreaks and then submitting a tip online to the FBI, I received another stalkerish seeming phone call. It was 12:45 am so way too late for someone to be calling. I rejected the call immediately, but the person then immediately called back. </p>
<p>In the past, the phone company hasn\'t been able to tell me who was calling because it was an unlisted / private number blocking the caller ID. This was an actual phone number on the caller ID, so it could have just been the wrong number since I recently changed my phone number, but it was still weird. The phone number links up to a hispanic man whose facebook page seems to be near where I live so it may have been a wrong number. However, I was stalked in public by a hispanic man recently.  
</p>
<p>Whoever it was that called me for months every morning at the same time would just stay on the line after voicemail picked up, but not say anything. Very strange.</p>
<p>Other things that have happened to me to make me a little bit weirded out include - randomly being fired soon after reporting a person I know who is a mutual acquaintance of people who know my former employer. This person is someone I believe to be involved heavily in trafficking. </p>
<p>Soon thereafter I also got a threatening message online regarding having reported him. </p>
<p>Weird stalking by that person\'s acquaintances and associates on Twitter. Weird cyberstalking on Facebook by mutual acquaintances.</p>
<p>I have reported some of the stalking to the FBI after it got a little too scary. I received that death threat and a few days later, I was stalked in public while I was alone with my child, soon after my mother had gone inside. The person waited for my mother to leave and then drove right up to me. When I alluded to this online under an alt, someone mocked me and I\'m pretty sure wanted to know if I was armed. I took a break from Pizzagate when that started happening and tried not to post for a while as a test, but the stalking has continued, so fuck them. </p>
<p>My husband had to leave a couple of times, and someone came to my door at 8:15 am. Nobody ever comes to my door. Yesterday someone else came to my door, also after my husband had left. My husband is usually home. </p>
<p>The public stalking was a little scary, but on the same day, a man with a knife was spotted in my neighborhood, and I live way out in the country. </p>
<p>I realized that I live not far from about 5 convicted pedophile sex offenders which makes me feel pretty cautious about who I open the door for. </p>
<p>I began submitting leads online every time I was harassed to the FBI. One day, a woman tried to hit me with her car and then followed me around for an hour or so in her car and I started to feel like  maybe I was going nuts so I bought a dashcam to prevent people from doing this to me. I sent out a life insurance doc to some of my friends and posted a warning on twitter that I had done so.</p>
<p>In addition to this, my husband and I have been followed around a bit by the local police, so I\'m not sure if they are targeting or protecting us. </p>
<p>One day soon after I got the dashcam the local PD seemed to be going into my neighborhood as I was leaving but then showed up at Walmart minutes later after we left and went to Walmart, they parked outside the front door, went in and got a man and came back out and literally stood there pointing at the parking lot in the direction in which I was parked waiting for my husband. When I left I was feeling paranoid by their pointing but I noticed several creepy looking men in parked cars throughout the parking lot so I am hoping that they were there to investigate that, and that the creepy men weren\'t there to follow me around. </p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago also, I was nearly hit head on on the highway by a person who intentionally came into my lane and there would have been no avoiding it if I they hadn\'t swerved back over. They swerved back into oncoming traffic again after that -not sure if high or what... I called and reported it to 911 and the person on the line said they would alert local PD but I don\'t think he was ever caught. Another man was caught the same day in another high speed chase in a different location so I know that they can track people down, but I guess they just missed him.</p>',

             He didn't work there. If he had worked for the company I worked for, I wouldn't have been able to stomach working there for years. I actually still have nightmares about him to this day after what happened with him, but thanks for the comment.

            Not to be an alarmist but it sounds like classic Targeting. Just you must be on their list now. Read up on targeting and also understand that some people that consider themselves targeted are just plain nuts but many are not. Keep good records of everything that happens and stay close to those you trust

            Everyone who has a phone gets those calls. You don't have to turn anything in to the FBI. In fact, the best way to make sure  to be ignored completely is to actually report something to the FBI, who will  then put you on a "list". And go back to doing whatever it is they do. Once you are on a "list" whoever you have reported then knows that they are perfectly safe, and can go on about their business without ever giving you a second thought. I can assure you from extensive personal experience that this is exactly how law enforcement functions in America. Don't call back again, whatever you do, or the FBI may arrest you. Since you've shown yourself to be harmless, you obviously would make an ideal private prison inhabitant. If you really want to make sure you are ignored, try submitting

            The police and fbi are comprimised. They are not here to help you. Do not report anything. Get some cctv around your property and have backup files at undisclosed locations. Arm yourself and your family, join a gun club. Wear a body cam and have backup files of footage. Stay safe

            They use local police for gangstalking. Just video tape them and let them know you are 100 percent aware of what is going on.... You're either telling the truth or 100 percent schizophrenic and need a Jew to prescribe you some seroquil... I haven't made my mind up yet

            I've never been in a situation anything like that but my first instinct is that you should retain a good lawyer immediately.
            <br/>
            They can help you protect yourself in a legal sense which may end up being very valuable.  Also get your concealed-carry permit and get real good at handling whatever weapon you are comfortable with.

            what everyone else said. get a dog, guns, surveillance cameras. Take pictures of all weird incidents &amp; put them online on a twitter or other blog.
           </p>
           <p>
            also, get copies of all your important documents and put them in fire safes. If you've seriously pissed someone off, there is a possibility that they could burn your house down. I don't want to alarm you but make sure you have smoke detectors and exit plan in case this happens. Depending on who you pissed off the fire department may not rush to save your house so get fire insurance, especially if they think you are planning to move and they won't get another chance at you. Sorry to add to your concerns but this is what they did to me and it wasn't even pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            and don't count on FBI, they are a joke, or local police. If they are following you after you've turned a few times, call their none emergency number and ask  why.

            Awful stuff.  Scary.  I don't want you to say what state you're in or anything.  And I know you said you have a family.  But, wherever you are, if you qualify to get a license to carry firearms I suggest you and your husband do so.  But join a local firearms group, too.  Connect with others in your area who know your particular state laws and live the 2A life with children, etc.  Everyone legally qualified should exercise their 2A rights, IMO.  I don't know anything about the reports you've been making to the FBI but perhaps you should lie low.  From what I know, there are some excellent people working there.  In my experience they take reports seriously and they investigate tips and act (to the extent they can).   Maybe y'all will give me grief for that statement but it's based on experience.  Not all of them are bad,  by any means.  People don't typically keep making reports to them.  I've seen them take action based on just one tip.  Maybe it's time to back off, rather than keep reporting things.  From what I've seen, they take action on reports.  Why keep going back to them?   My main point is that only you are responsible for your personal safety.  When your safety is on the line and seconds count, the police will be minutes away.  So learn how to stay safe.  Connect with others who know how to stay safe.  There's safety in numbers....

            Your account is interesting and I don't get the immediate sense that you're a delusional or attention seeking person. I hope you aren't offended that I bring that up. Many people are prone to poor discernment or have psych issues of some kind. Even they are in a difficult situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might help myself and others if you shared exactly what you did that you think attracted this unwanted attention. I'm not sure if it was reporting possible crimes to the FBI, but I could accept that given my view of the FBI which I'll summarize next. You can also get more accurate theories and suggestions by including a quick bio of your basic demographics, occupation, associations like church, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been involved in independent investigation and limited reporting of a few controversial topic in recent years, so I'm at least familiar with accounts of Harassment and worse. I've been very fortunate myself to have avoided that kinda stuff except for 1 brief encounter with some men who were obviously agents of some kind. It happened over a few days and was confirmed to be focused on me, but they never communicated with me beyond a few waves. So I have no good sense of what the problem issue was. That's similar to your account and might mean the issue is more serious. Harassers threaten or encourage you to do or not do something. They are usually specific enough. Finding out what the issue is might be a good goal for you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd also suggest not further contacting any official agencies or any more reporting of independent crimes or those targeting you. I'm no expert on the FBI but I'm qualified to be very sceptical of them. Regardless of any good work they do or value they possess, there are numerous and serious problems. Here are just a few to consider.
           </p>
           <p>
            1.) Dubious origins - They are essentially a less capable and no less ambitious version of the Pinkerton company, originally. 
2.) They are, no doubt very involved in the 9/11 events and cover up. Complicit people at low and high levels. 
3.) They are key promoters of the terrorism program which promotes belief in false threats and fake history. 
4.) Related to above, they participate in staged or deceptive acts of terrorism. 
5.) They have an ongoing program of fostering mentally challenged or compromised men of mostly Muslim faith into becoming terrorists. They then frame these, mostly men and give them steep sentences of decades or life. 
6.) Their infamous internal review of shootings by agents found not one was unwarranted or even in error. 
7.) Their long - heralded and worlds only complete crime lab has been revealed to be horribly corrupt. They've admitted recently that all of their hair analysis testimony in convictions and blood spatter analysis as well is basically flawed and unscientific. It seems they were the main promoters of forensic science, now being discredited more and more. 
8.) Despite having a charter as only a domestic crime agency, a few years ago they established an international terrorism response unit. They essentially took over the missing Malaysian airliner investigation a couple years back.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on , but that should suffice to show that on some levels the FBI is corrupt and even criminal. Maybe you could limit your efforts and defense against any Harassment by working with only trusted individuals, relatives or insiders. If anything, consider all those who have very likely done the work you've done. How far did they run with all those reports? Not very. It's almost like they invent a criminal enterprise and fantasy bust and then mold a scenario to fit. Some horrible crimes simply don't fit their narrow storylines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, stay objective, humble, sceptical and don't be discouraged by the ridicule from trolls.

              I wouldn't give out specifics, to someone on voat you don't know. But, playing off that idea, go on Stephan Molyneax or/and some other very high profile youtubers, and get your message out. A
              <em>
               high
              </em>
              degree of visibility, naming names (never threaten, just do), that seems to keep ppl safe along w selfprotection.

            DO NOT TRUST FBI! Fuck's sake. They were some of the ones to help cover up the franklin scandal. Sure the ones working at the lower end of the totem are simply useful dupes, but it is the key people in key places that one needs to be aware of. Most of those alphabet gangs are controlled anyway.

            An easy way to protect yourself is to make your identity public. John DeCamp wrote the franklin coverup book because he said William Colby told him to gain enough fame to where they can't kill him. They can't kill you if they know we're all watching out for you. But I understand if you want to protect your identity.

            You should pack your stuff and move asap as far away as possible.
If you have "5 convicted pedophiles" near you and really "live way out in the country" that is... 
Your town is infested. Seriously if all that happened to you just move!
They know your phone number because they either know someone at the phone company. Or maybe have access to gsm catcher just for stalking and surveillance purpose.

              Get an RV. Around here, older but good condition ones routinely sell for 8 grand. Sorry you own property (i assume). Don't know to deal w that unless you sell it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most of this area is armed and christian. Like other posters said, get a small sidearm for concealed and learn how to use it. Kimber makes a micro.
             </p>
             <p>
              6 camera security systems that are not net dependent w a recording system (like a dashcam) run around $250.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police, records, etc are only second as good. Survival skills, being armed, that's what counts.

               No I do not own property - just that it's hard to rent a new place without a steady job... so I'm just looking for work right now. My husband doesn't have one I was the breadwinner, so losing my job because of this shit would have been especially hurtful if that was the reason behind it.

            Wow.  That is really scary.  I admire your courage and that you still continue.  Some of it sounds pretty spooky and dangerous but some of it like the police cars may have been asked to tail you for protection.  But that is not always the case, as we know from reading many stories on here.  So proceed with caution.  Can you call the FBI back and ask them if you are being tailed for safety.  If they say no, I would report each and every one of these incidents and all incidents thereafter.  Maybe some members can advise you on how to protect your living quarters and proof your residence.  Please keep us informed we care for all that have helped our cause to protect the children.
