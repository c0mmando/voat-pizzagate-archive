<p>Entry in Adam Gottlieb\'s <em>Legal Highs</em> (1973):
ADRENOCHROME SEMICARBAZONE -- 3-hydroxy-1-methyl-5,6-indolinedione semicarbazone. 
Material: Oxidized epinephrine (adrenaline) with semicarbazide. 
Usage: 100 mg is thoroughly dissolved in just enough alcohol, melted fat (butter), or vegetable oil and ingested. Because of its poor solubility in water these must be used to aid absorption. 
Effects: Physical stimulating, feeling of well-being, slight reduction of thought processes. 
Contraindications: None noted. 
Acts as a systemic hemostatic preventing capillary bleeding during injury. <em>Adrenochrome causes chemically induced schizophrenia</em>. Its semicarbazone does not. 
Supplier: CS.</p>

Connection To Schizophrenia

            Interesting info.
Anecdotally, my partner (who doesn't know much about P-Gate) told me recently that he met a man 20 years ago in Idaho who had been a part of (and escaped) satanic rituals/cults in the San Francisco area, and adrenochrome was one of the things he talked about being commonly harvested during their rituals.

             No shit? Wow, I’m glad he made it out alive. That is so incredibly scary. Do you think you could convince him to type up a post about what he’s seen and been through? If not, that is completely understandable.

            From my understanding and research, this stuff can be purchased legally in vials... first question is, how is the synthetic version of this stuff made. 2, does the synthetic version produce the same effects as the natural version, and 3., how is it legal? If mj is a schedule 1, then why is this hallucinogenic legal?

             I am not qualified to fully answer that. As for legality, you’d be surprised how many illicit drugs were completely legal until relatively recently, MDMA (molly, X) is one prime example

            SC, thank you for taking our research requirements seriously. Dialing back the headline claim and just presenting the material that can be sourced made this a much better post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would point out that the portion you are referencing as causing a high is not adrenachrome. It's adrenochrome semicarbazone, and has to be dissolved in butter or alcohol in order to be absorbed by the digestive system:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Adrenochrome causes chemically induced schizophrenia. Its semicarbazone does not.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's also a synthetic substance; not one that fits the PG theory about torture and blood harvesting that has been pushed so hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've done a good job proving adrenochrome is a real substance with real effects. But not that it is something that could be "harvested" via torture like milk from a cow, and still have a desireable effect worth kidnapping and killing kids for. That is all still speculative.
           </p>
           <p>
            The material you've added makes this one of the better threads that's been submitted on this topic, though. You've moved the ball down the field. :-)

             So you're trying to dismiss that they even do this?? Why not state if YOU know it all, that you might just not know it all, or even have any proof to dismiss it so easily.

             I think this is not for taking it, but for storing it.   If you have it water solution or by itself, I think it breaks down very quickly.  Even a water solution in a freezer would break down.

              This is correct. From continued reading it appears that androlutin is a much more stable version. Adrenochrome May just be the name that “stuck”.

            I don't think your posts give any evidence about its extraction.  Adrenochrome can be made it a test tube by oxidizing adrenaline.  You can just mix it with something like silver oxide.   It's also widely available in the medical research market. Here's one of the places that sell it

           <p>
            Adrenaline was synthesized in a lab well over a 100 years ago.  It's a myth you need to extract it from the human body and it would be very difficult to do.  It breaks down very quickly when exposed to moisture or heat or light.  If you have a solution of it and you have it in the freezer, it lasts about half a day.

            is a derivative of Adrenochrome.  it's different from pure adrenochrome. Semicarbazone has a specific meaning in chemstiry.  This substance is also known as Carbazochrome.

            On the same site you link to other folks detail their experiences with it  and it's not really a good high.  There are much more widely available drugs you use and get a better experience from.  Mescalin, LSD, Peyote, etc all come to mind.

             The thing to keep in mind is that the hypothesis is that these are related to rituals much older than the last century.  Even if it could be created artificially today, that doesn't mean that the mythos behind the rituals doesn't still enthrall the devotees.

             You're an ass kicking shill. But, don't you think it is odd that you know so much about the subject? Like knowing that skippy was a common nickname in the 70's. A trivia expert you are.

              Don't you get that I'm a good researcher?   I am good at trivia, but I can't say I knew much about adrenochrome before this, except that Hunter Thompson was consciously reaching for the scariest drug story he could think of.   I'm surprised people believe that is supposed to be real.

                Who is the more interesting character; Sherlock or Moriarty? Personally, I identify more with Mycroft (from the old series with Brett, not the Kareem Abdul Jabbar stuff).

                 more an opinion than a trivia question and I have to say I'm only up on the recent reboot of Sherlock, never read the originals.  Thought just last month of listening to the audiobook of one.

                  As to the trivia, it’s partly due to the miracle of the tech that puts all human knowledge at our fingertips. However, your comments seem to go past what one would expect with recently google searched knowledge. Also, the snarky manner in which you regularly debunk the weaker arguments attracts a response. From what I’ve read, you are likely an extreme skeptic. I am not prepared to consider you a shill or a troll. I seem to remember that I have even read a couple things from you that one would call ‘contributions’. I’m not sure if you’re part of the team or not, frankly. I’m willing to give the benefit of the doubt, though, knowing I am equally open to being judged. Your space to speak is equal to anyone else and subjec5 to the same rubrics. The fact that you have not been repeatedly been down voted to oblivion speaks to the fine tuning of your writing and to the discernment of the general voater. Don’t be too hard on us. We are trying to do what we think is right.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, we ARE opposed. I truly believe we have powerful enemies, and that we are exposing real depravity. I’m open to hear and adjust the errors found here, and there is a need to eschew the elements that don’t comport with the justice we seek... there is a fine line on the approach to that task. Not many are up to it. Not many are mature enough to look so closely and own our errors. The obvious shills and trolls don’t get close enough to cross it.

             It is very hard to prove you can get high by scaring someone to death and then drinking their blood. OP proves that adrenochrome, at least the synthetic version, has a high. I think the organic version is much more potent, cleaner and better, no wonder the elites live so long.

             Great post OP, thank you for getting what I tried to tell you. Your research might be used in future by investigators and the post needs to be correct and top quality.

              Well, we know they admit to the benefits of drinking blood, and it is obvious they are evil. I have no idea about adrenechrome and think it is not so relevant. But what is with being incredulous? They rape torture murder children  and remove the organs for sale. They drink blood. You are trying to say the crazy part is that they may "believe" it is an evil aprhodisiac? That's where you put your foot down? This thread is bizarre for unexpected reasons.

               I agree which is why censorship of any kind imo is bad. It really doesn’t matter if they become high as a kite drinking it. What matters is that’s that it has been done and continues to be done.

               When adrenochrome got mentioned on /x/, maybe a year ago, the thread 404'ed, no 4plebs and archive links got scrubbed (last part is allegedly). Some anon posted a theory about elites torturing children to harvest adrenochrome. No evidence or leaks, only a theory, I found it very interesting but unbelivable at the time.
