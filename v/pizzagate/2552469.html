             Ok s point 4 in that it CLAIMS:
Southern District of NY issues warrant to search and seize from Granite Intelligence laptop and other electronic devices that were transferred to Granite Intelligence by Anthony Weiner, NYPD/SVU execute search warrant seize laptop, cellphone, and other devices used for Twitter, Skype and other digital platforms that were used for "sexting", rape talk, showing the 15 year old victim porn, and having her masturbate for him.
            </p>
            <p>
             BUT  that seems to make an ASSUMPTION that the 26/10 warrant was given to and executed by NYPD
            </p>
            <p>
             but wasnt it FBI?
in late October we have the Washington Post etc running stories that the FBI have the laptop and Hillary's emails
            </p>
            <p>
             it remains a claim, and not in evidence, that NYPD ever had the laptop in its keeping

              Also the point remains unknown entirely which agency executed the 9/26 Granite Searh problem is the first agency being reported as having investigating Weiner was not the FBI by NYPDSVU done 9/21/9/22 Daily Mail their dates aren't the original so we cann't be positive ALTHOUGH the release of the Daily Mail info that is tied to the accuser info(accuser told them or hinted at it)means the NYPD/SVU was contacted before the media, they didn't and interview had 62 images ready to go a full long ass mega article implying they had been working DAYS on this to write an article with a team screen it double check it proofread get it cleared takes days. So
              <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html">

              </a>
              Read all of this article, this stuf was published all the DM articles 9/20-9/21 in the UK....understand? She stopped talking to Weiner in July the possibility of July even an NYPD/SVU investigation being done IS HIGH, also beyond that point the likelyhood of it at least starting in August is extremly high considering the ACS investigation. That 3 week period is critical. If the NYPD had done everything beforehand released nothing then allowed the media to pick up on the August story, then the September story it establishes an alternate predicate. If Weiner co-operated whatever beforehand he played it through hence no arrest(the corruprt feds and SDNY didn't want one neither the presumed NYPD/SVU team first on the trail well before any of them)
             </p>
             <p>
              Think did the girl first contact NYPD? North Carolina LEO's etc.? Or did she contact the media...there is a high chance this was all done at the low level and the higher ups kept in the dark specifically if she was smart enough to CONTACT NYPD/SVU first when is very, very discreet....Loose lips sink ships? The "reporting" of something is not the timeline btw its what really happened OTG with LEO's back in 2016...and there is a good amount of indicators that something was weird as hell going on before 9/21/2016....BTW I don't by the media they lie, obfuscate, they don't investigate anything correctly, and they ignore and cover up/smear.
             </p>
             <p>
              One last point, the FBI/NYPD executed the search warrant a FEDERAL SEARCH WARRANT OF Michael Cohen

              <p>
               thanks for that daily mail article, it adds to the puzzle
              </p>
              <p>
               it confirms the girl weiner was sexting gave a shitload of HER phone related data to the daily mail. I presume that's what put the law enforcement agencies in high gear. and its remarkable how much phone data she gave them.
              </p>
              <p>
               BUT
              </p>
              <p>
               that being the case, we still have no evidence of any agency issuing warrants for equipment prior to the 9/26.   You cant really speculate that somehow the NYPD took them, because there's the 9/30 articles in washington post, nypost etc saying 'FBI has the laptop of weiner and it has hillarys emails in it'
              </p>
              <p>
               i think its fanciful, and not in evidence anywhere, to speculate that the hardware seized from Granite was seized by anyone other than the FBI. If you're to claim the NYPD took it and only had it between 9/26 and 9/30 when the media stories about the FBI /hillary emails came out
              </p>
              <p>
               you remain in the realm of speculation, and the window of speculation is thinner and thinner. Occams Razor has to come down some point, my man

              Problem based on this new claim of theirs and unsealed docs, granite Intelligence magically pops into play why were they never mentioned? Considering the ACS/SVU investigation predating Weiner and him giving them as of the 23rd the laptop. you aren't tracking are you? There is a good possibility considering the sheer lack of detail...the entire thing has been hit with a wall of bullshit and not reported on in detail or accurately since the Daily Mail in September 21 2016. There is still a big chance the NYPD saw the laptop and inspected it via yet to be unsealed search warrant going all the way back to July or later 2016...anything further back I don't know about....what would that imply? The July 2015 baby briefs photo was the one that began the ACS investigation. Also the retaliation against the NYPD since then confirms this highly likely. Its been hidden this long "Granite's" role in the timeline which still is irreleVant since NYPD was investigating first PER THE 15 YEAR OLD...GET IT..SHE WENT TO THE MEDIA AFTER GOING TO THEM. The girl said she continued to talk to Weiner until July

              She admits not talking to him "AFTER JULY" was disgusted by the baby picture while sexting....she had all the evidence then....between then and there She more than likely spoke which means a quiet investigation was done...also She only speoke of immediate timeframe or allured to it while talking to the Daily Mail. Timeline now starts at 9/20 due to "date" shifting done by the media or whatever else.

              I changed it but of course Local law enforcement usually execute Federal Warrants. BTW there was not even a hint or clue or any opublic knowledge of the "arrest" of Weiner" or the search warrant execution. Talk about special treatment....but See I left all of Princes claims out but of course still to this day all the "media reports" are based on "anonymous sources".

            Honeybee is wrong.   Yet again.  She's very shaky on any legal issues.  Here's an example of her not understanding what is going on in legal documents

           </p>
           <p>
            In this thread she confused a civil lawsuit brought by a private citizen (one that will be tossed by the judge) was an
           </p>
           <blockquote>

           <p>
            She wasn't wrong by a small amount.  She was wrong by miles.   And when people tried to correct her, she never seemed to get it.  She stuck to a premaid conclusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            That seems to be what is going on here.
           </p>
           <p>
            She examines the recent warrant and see that it plainly says that the FBI took possession of Weiner's laptop not the NYPD.    This has been confirmed elsewhere on VOAT and I showed this over a year ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1812845">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1812845
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She seems to understand that this means the TruePundit/Erik Prince claims of the NYPD had the laptop saw a bunch of horrifying evidence and then had the FBI take the laptop from them couldn't have happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            She seems to recognize that this story is fake, or at least that part of the story is fake.   She still seems to be clinging to the other part of the story.  The premade conclusion that horrible, horrible stuff implicating many people must be on the Weiner laptop, rather than just evidence of his known crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            She doesn't get that the evidence of this horrible and horrible stuff is supposed to come from the NYPD who didn't have the laptop.    She doesn't seem to get that this blows the story of this horrible stuff on Weiner's laptop to pieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            So she moves on to complete speculation that Weiner wiped his laptop and it was Granite that did the wiper.
This is completely unfounded.  What most likely happened was the Weiner hears about the federal subpoena....it was published in the NY Times and elsewhere the US Attorney filed a subpoena and he talks to his lawyer who says he can be charged with other crimes if he tampers with the evidence so they turn his electronic devices over to a neutral party.  The US Attorney obviously knows about the transfer, because that is on the warrant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, she has absolutely no evidence for her claims.  And a much more, plausible and likely scenario is likely what happened.  Why is my suspposition more likely?  Because the FBI has incredibly good forensic teams that would be able to tell if someone tried to tamper with the laptop.

             It seems plausible that Granite were given the laptop to perform a wipe. But they only had it for 3 days before the FBI warrant so it looks like they didnt have the time to do their assignment - and the washington post story among others tells us the FBI did get a bunch of Hillary emails on it
            </p>
            <p>
             so the laptop in and of itself containing Hillary emails seems to be solid evidence of her Felony unsecure handling of classified info (assuming they are work emails not exclusively personal ones, but who sends 65 000 personal emails, that'd take a lifetime of leisure she doesnt have), but you are correct, it remains speculative to say whether they have any corroborating evidence of human trafficking /paedophila

            Sorry got interrupted. So my other comment confirmed that Weiner turned his iphone, laptop, etc. over to  Granite on September 23, 2016. Then on September 26, 2016, the FBI seized possession. That's when Clinton's emails were discovered. Now this is where i'm confused about Honeybee's claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NYPD was investigating the sexting claim. To investigate, they HAD to have at least a partial viewing of said evidence. We know they did because charges were brought against Weiner, and he was sentenced to two years in prison. So the NYPD HAD to have had access to some part of the electronic material. Here's proof of that assertion:

            <p>
             Prosecutors in US Attorney Preet Bharara’s office have issued a subpoena for Anthony Weiner’s cell phone and other records, law enforcement sources said.
            </p>
            <p>
             NYPD detectives and the Manhattan DA’s office are also “looking into” allegations that Anthony Weiner engaged in a months-long sexting relationship with an underage girl, sources told The Post Thursday.

             The NYPD’s Special Victims Unit is investigating the matter after a 15-year-old high-school student released a trove of sick texts and photos she allegedly received from the disgraced politician.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’re looking to see if a crime was committed in New York and if there’s a complainant,” an NYPD official said.

            Again, this story was on September 22, 2016. The FBI seized the electronics on September 23. There was a trial, there was evidence presented, so the NYPD HAD to have seen something and been in possession of files.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the unsourced comment of an NYPD officer who viewed the files is unconfirmed. That's up-in-the-air as far as it being truthful, but the story of NYPD having viewed files is true. There has to be discovery and an evidenciary listing so perhaps that would tell what was recorded in the trial, but whether there were other things not pertinent to the case that were viewed, we don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            I tend to think the FBI seizure was a way of keeping a lid on the investigation, and why the records were sealed in the first place. Clinton's emails may have been Confidential and, therefore, not to be disseminated to anyone without clearance to view. It's why Comey reopened the email probe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still not clear as to why anyone would think the NYPD did not have the evidence in their possession. No, they didn't have the laptop because of the complications, but a viewing of the subpoena might help nail down what was turned over.

            <p>
             You are making an assumption here.  This is not a fact.  Lawyers call this "Assuming facts not in evidence."
            </p>
            <p>
             You are doing the same thing here

            <p>
             In fact, in this case, you seem to be drawing an usupported conclusion.  First to start with Weiner did not have a trial. He plead guilty before a trial.
             <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/anthony-weiner-sentenced-to-21-months-in-federal-prison/2017/09/25/ad4165f4-a1f4-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html?utm_term=.5c90ca954eb6">
              He plead guilty in May and was sentence in September without a trial.
             </a>
             Secondly, he plead guilty to federal charges and was sentence in federal court.  The NYPD would not be involved here.   He has never been charged with local crimes that would involve the NYPD.  So all we know is the NYPD opened an investigation. That investigation could be open or that investigation can have been closed when he pled guilty in federal court.

             Again this here is unsupported.

            <p>
             There's simply no independent evidence that points to it.  There's just these claims of the FBI ripped the case and the laptop away from the NYPD.  We know now those claims to be false.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since many of these assumptions are unsupported, let's lay out what we do know.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The NYPD opened an investigation.
The FBI got the laptop.
              <s>
               The NYPD was investigating the sexting claim. To investigate, they HAD to have at least a partial viewing of said evidence
              </s>
              .  For the NYPD to view the evidence they would have to make a request to the FBI
Shortly after the FBI got Weiner's laptop, they realized it would also apply to the Clinton case.
              <br/>
              The FBI eventually got a warrant to read the Clinton emails.
              <br/>
              An intensive effort was made to review the emails before the election.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Is there any other known evidence that is missing from this?
            </p>
            <p>
             Conclusions/Questions
            </p>
            <p>
             Could the FBI have allowed NYPD to view the evidence?   Certainly possible.  I think the NYPD would need a warrant.  Otherwise they would not be entitled.  If we find the NYPD had a warrant, that would be
            </p>
            <p>
             Could have the FBI have given the laptop to the NYPD?  I doubt this. I think they would have kept possession and let the NYPD review evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another possibility that is less secure would be they let make a disk image give the image to NYPD.    I think if many people were reviewing evidence on the laptop and we know they were with the emails, they can't all be working on the same laptop. I think they would have loaded an image on to a secure network and had many people review at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would also think this secure access would be READ ONLY.  No editing or copying or saving locally. This is my assumption.
            </p>
            <p>
             But in all this scenarios, I see nothing that supports the Erik Prince TruePundit versions.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far I have seen no evidence the NYPD ever saw any contents of the laptop, in a secure setting or not.  However, when the guilty plea was announced, the justice department said
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              We work every day in the FBI and law enforcement to stop adults from preying on vulnerable children. Our partnership with the NYPD cannot be stressed enough in this case, and we would like to thank the Special Victims Unit for all the work and effort they put into this investigation.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             But what that work or effort was is unclear.

                One if Weiner was so compliant with a subpeona and not afraid/acting through whatever why was there a warrant needed?(You can forego that)
Also typically a warrant is served cold first, witnesses are subpeona'd/ Subpeona's come last. Most people and 99.9% of the time in the media there is no mention of warrants for arrest/search before served, they are kept secret its illegal to leak to such things. Even for traffic tickets etc. it gives time for escape, destruction of evidence, and skull duggery. So why are you ignoring the blatant facts of an attempted coverup?

                Everything and also you claim that Local authorities don't execute federal search warrants, they can and do...even arrests in fact the feds are so lazy, stupid, and corrupt they aren't capable of doing anything real arrests...the can only stage fake ones aka perp walks. Also search warrants subpeona's etc. in an  NYPD/SVU investigation in NYC because of confidentially aren't broadcasted out there....but with the Feds because of leaks always right before at the time information was coming out. You clearly don't even grasp the idea of what happened. According to the Official story and the official agencies NY  ACS and the original texting scandal beat the Feds by 22 days....that is a lot of damn time for casually 2 ACS workers and NYPD aren't too unfamiliar with each other. Also considering all the evidence showing pre-July cause for investigating Weiner are so sure the "Women" didn't contact authorities before then?

                 Do you really think seized a phone, a tablet and laptop requires a task force?   You can't really be making this argument can you?   Also you are merely engaging in a hypothetical without providing evidence.  The evidence is the FBI executed the search warrant.

                 There could be a few reasons for this, but I would just be speculating.  One might be they wanted to avoid the appearance of going easy on him.  But in the end this is irrelevant.  It doesn't matter one whit to the argument we are having, that it is now confirmed the NYPD did not get the laptop before the FBI.  I'm arguing timing and possession, this is an attempt to argue how it happened.  How it happened is irrelevant to this discussion.

                 You claim these are facts.  I disagree.  It might be true that this is the typical method, but again it's irrelevant.  You have zero evidence of a coverup.

                 This alternate history says nothing about how Law enforcement got Weiner's laptop. It seems to me you don't wish to actually engage in the facts of the case.

                 When the sexting with the underage girl broke. Weiner had his laptop.  NYPD didn't have it.  ACS didn't have it.  Weiner turned it over the Granite.  The FBI got it from Granite.  You are trying to wish these facts away.

                 This is irrelevant.  Sexting with Women is not criminal.  Sexting with the girl was.  It doesn't matter what evidence existed before hand we know when the warrant was signed and how the FBI got the laptop.

                  Youa re a dumb freak show that hasn't the clue about local distinction or chain of custody Fed warrants are routinely executed and Local Leos the ones doing the primary arrest/search. Local authorities because of a pre-existing investigation can push for priority over evidence....You do know that right? You clearly don't have a fucking clue as to what could/can happen with the "official storyline" which I never bough before and know after seeing this new injection don't buy at all....

                    Have fun ignoring all the facts I provided based on MSM that shows NYPD still having the capability of knowledge of possession of the laptop, under a covert operation way before ACS in August, during that, leading up to the Daily mail article, the blow up in the media, and while Granite intel had it with its many ex NYPD/FBI/etc. contractors prowling around :) You clearly haven't done any investigation into this are left holding a big bag of shit. Robert J Strang, Granite, Stone, Key...hmmmm Giuliani giving Strang's PI firm the same attributes and motto of GRANITE when Granite was made. Seems to be a pattern. Funny former TWA 800 cover-upper FBI jackass is telegraphing Giuliani being involved in the Clinton FBI email stuff considering it all relates....hmmmm interesting. Considering the facts...you just got btfo AWS.....and its because you are incompetent.

                      You have no evidence to prove that, Also little cowardly liar NYPD more than likely executed the federal warrant with the FBI as is protocol in damn near all federal search warrants...You clearly are unintelligent and have no grasp of fact or timelines....The fact is as claimed there was a pre done counter intel op on weiner, Could have gone back to July and done hush hush or during the ACS investigation as is common(parellel construction) also the fact the devices were handed over to Strang's cre at granite either means something bad or something good. IMS has a shit ton of NYPD/FBI/and leos/military they have contracted with for decades, GI is a front for IMS I proved that conclusively in the article. "Mueller" owns Decision LLC Bloomberg admits Strang is the Head of Office at Decision, Mueller is listed as working for Strang Hayes consulting. My article is fatc based unlike your crazy unintelligent rambling.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I exhaustively search for a confirmation photo on Muelelr found none, Strang is most like Mueller, SH=IMS=Decision=Granite Intel. Thats what I discovered...You and your lies are fucked up one way or the other. Hell even Strang's employees one way or the other could have 180'd and given NYPD the devices...remaining the storyline or copies or whatever. Fact is you have no clue what occurred and are constantly sperging crapping out false information that a 5 year old would laugh at...claiming NYPD never had contact with the copies, devices, is absurd the same media that never reported on Granite's role until now could have very well buried revealing details of the story for obvious reasons. You got mega owned shill, totally owned....IMS/Decision/Gi are the same thing and I have found nothing showing anyone claiming other than the heads to have worked for GI, no employees EVER no resumes nothing, its a front for IMS...and its fucking hysterical. Strang did this with the medellin cartel luring them to NYC to arrest them. Same hand and glove mo, You are fucked AWS.

              @urbanmoving/anthony-weiner-s-labtop-phone-electronic-devices-and-granite-intelligence Lies AWS thats all you spew NYPD got the warrant before the FBI warrant, and executed the search probably same day 9/26/2016, 2-3 days or 72 hours roughly after Weiner attempted to obstruct justice in a ACS/NYPD/SVU investigation. You can't even get the facts right NYPD had their warrant and executed it, the FBI had to wait until the NYPD handed over the devices which they did later...the FBI didn't go into Granite Intel.

             yup, i think your onto it.  We have independent confirmation NYPD had the offending iphone, but only Eric Prince's claim and derivatives of that unubstantiated claim suggest the NYPD had a laptop
Unless Weiner had 2 laptops - one in the nypd's possession, one he gave to Granite then recovered by FBI ?  Because otherwise, the existence of the FBI warrant for Granite seems to rule out it ever being in NYPD possession
            </p>
            <p>
             someone mentioned that Loretta Lynch made a statement asking NYPD to hand over elec devices - but I cant find record of that. You?

              Yes, the laptop didn't seem to be compromised because the WSJ confirms the avalanche of Clinton emails to be accurate:

             <p>
              I don't have an account with WSJ, but there's a curious lead-in that says:
             </p>
             <blockquote>

              Oh, here's the story on another site showing the entire article:
             </p>
             <blockquote>

              <p>
               Investigators found 650,000 emails on a laptop used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, and underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter.

            Not sure if I'm understanding what you want confirmation of or what Honeybee's point was other than the NYPD never had possession. That I get. But, no, Granite did not have sole discretionary possession since ''Carlos Danger'' Weiner turned everything over to them on September 23, 2016. The FBI did obtain possession on September 26, 2016. Here's a sort of reliable source. At least it's ''mainstream'' news:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/17/search-warrant-for-weiners-electronic-devices-unsealed/">
             https://nypost.com/2018/05/17/search-warrant-for-weiners-electronic-devices-unsealed/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            A panicked Anthony Weiner gave all his electronic devices to private investigators two days after he was exposed for engaging in lewd, online exchanges with a 15-year-old girl, court records revealed Thursday.
           </p>
           <p>
            A newly unsealed, search-and-seizure warrant obtained by the feds shows that the disgraced ex-pol
handed over an iPhone, iPad and laptop computer
           </p>
           <h1>
            to Granite Intelligence on Sept. 23, 2016. ...."
           </h1>
           <p>
            Now as to when it changed custody to the FBI:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Federal agents got permission
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <h1>
            to seize the electronics on Sept. 26, 2016,
           </h1>
           <p>
            and a search of the laptop turned up e-mails between Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, and her boss, then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The discovery led the FBI to re-open its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while she served as secretary of state under former President Barack Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clinton has blamed the reopening of the probe, which then-FBI Director James Comey revealed to Congress 11 days before the 2016 election, for her loss to President Trump.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Hope this directly solves and confirms that the FBI had possession and not Granite Electronics.

             Strozk texts on the 28th regarding the emails and SDNY,  U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York

            <p>
             On Sept 28th Strozk says the FBI is sending "a team" tomorrow (Thursday the 29th)  to review the hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner's attorney "to SDNY" via Granite Intelligence on the 23rd.  (because of sexting investigation.)
            </p>
            <p>
             SDNY was seeking warrants for Clinton related emails?  (Comey mentioned that on Fox News interview I believe), DOJ didn't want to give them?  (was this the dragging the feet process?).  Everyone knew Weiner was being investigated by the SDNY as well as the NY Special Victims Unit (since the 21st in some accounts), and as well as NYPD.  An ACS investigation came first however.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On Aug. 31, Bill Donohue of the Catholic League filed a formal complaint against Weiner with the city Administration for Children's Services. On Sept. 15, the Daily Mail reported Weiner had been sexting with a 15-year-old girl. On Sept. 21, the NYPD Special Victims Division opened its investigation.

            <p>
             I haven't seen a Sept 15th Daily Mail article so far (possible typo?), just the one on the 21st.

             Bill Donohue comments on his role in the FBI probe of Anthony Weiner:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Two months ago to the day, I asked for an investigation of Anthony Weiner on suspicion of sexually abusing his four-year-old child, Jordan. I was subsequently notified that my complaint had been honored: a formal investigation was underway.
             </p>
             <p>
              Never did I think that my call for a probe might evolve into an FBI investigation into electronic devices belonging to Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin. I will explain my involvement in this matter after I offer a summary of recent events as reported by Yahoo on October 28 in an article (also found on people.com) titled, “Everything You Should Know About the Anthony Weiner Sexting Investigation—And Its Impact on Clinton’s Campaign.”
             </p>
             <p>
              My role in triggering the investigation is as follows.
             </p>
             <p>
              On August 31, the same day that the most explosive story on this issue was published in the New York Post—it showed Weiner using his son as a “chick magnet” to lure sexual relations—I filed a complaint with the New York City Administration for Children’s Services (ACS), the New York branch of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services.
             </p>
             <p>
              That same day, Daily Mail Online, a British media outlet, reported that “a ACS spokesman said: ‘In order to protect children and their privacy, ACS does not comment on specific cases of allegations of child maltreatment, regardless of whether or not allegations have been reported, are being investigated, or have not resulted in an investigation. It came after Bill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, urged the New York State Office of Children and Family Services to investigate Weiner for sexually abusing his young son.'”
             </p>
             <p>
              On September 26, I received a phone call from ACS. I was told that my complaint has been accepted and that Weiner would be investigated. The next day, the same ACS official called to question me further. A week later, on October 3, FBI agents seized Weiner’s laptop, phone and tablet.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Account of the letter sent to ACS
             <a href="http://archive.is/woJra">
              http://archive.is/woJra
             </a>
             Huma was listed on complaint.  Might the ensuing events also have to do with protecting Huma?  Just a thought.  The Trump hit piece I referred to above was about the infamous Billy Bush 'Days of Our Lives' leak.

               Great thank you!  "Days of Our Lives" leaks... any leads to NXICM???  purely a thought exercise at this point, wouldn't surprise me if GOP bad actors were involved too (Friends of Franklin case, etc.)  George Bush dynasty and Clinton machine, "Better Together"?

              Obviously, NYPD had the damn files, BUT I'm starting to believe insurance files were kept because  just fell through another rabbit hole ... I swear I wasn't even looking for anything other than to prove the NYPD had those files. And now ... another post ... more people calling it a shill post ... repeat ad infinitum ...

               Not going into an expose about it now, still to many unanswered questions.  I don't trust Alex Jones as reliable, he may say truthful things, mixed with so much BS... His lawyer is using the "performance actor" defense for him now.  Enough said.
              </p>

               Then we have the NXIVM in NYC angle which has yet to fully be exposed imo.

               So would it surprise me to learn that one of Anthony's acquaintances admonished him at some point during the summer/fall of 2016? "Anthony you moron!  You weren't supposed to keep NXIVM 'Fright Study' videos on your iPad, what were you thinking?!"  /s  I don't think it would.

                How does this work?  Weiner had the laptop at home.  The Story breaks.  The US Attorney issues a subpoena, the next day Weiner gives the laptop to Granite.  Three Days later on Sept 26th the warrant is issued and its lists Granite as the holder of the laptop, so the FBI comes gets the laptop from Granite on that day.  So how does the NYPD get the laptop?
               </p>
               <p>
                Evidence of FBI seizing laptop on the 26th comes from this ProPublica/New Yorker investigation.  This matches up with the dates of the texts Kestrel9  points out.

                But POTUS plays the long game, and anticipated the NXIVM trial. I just posted the submission about the former US Attorney. This is just frightening and showing that this is really not a game. These reprehensible maggots are trying every which way to subvert the justice system.

            Either that or they stole it. But why hasn't this criminal company that illegally obtained evidence come forward? Why did they do destroy the evidence and replace the Computer, go look at how the ADL/creeps planted evidence at the original murder scene of Frank.

             You bring up a good point about stealing.  Although I don't believe a bleeping word that comes out of Eric Prinze's mouth, but as soon as I read "they stole it", it popped into my head that there was a laptop that was stolen.  Something about a motorcycle.  It's pretty fuzzy in my brain, it's been a while now but I know there was a laptop stolen.

               Thank You and Yes, rumored to have plans for Trump's hotel, well, why not?  Of course, they would.  But they are not going to tell us what else was on there, are they/  Sick Sick Sick.  I totally believe this Co. would strip the laptop.  But then again, I would totally believe somebody is lying about that too.  Again.  I am so over this.

                The whole thing with it being stolen out of a SS agents vehicle was shady. Either she left it there on purpose or, she was a piss poor agent. I wonder what info was on there about the Pope too. It's unreal that information that's classified can be left anywhere unsecured. We will never know the real story of who took it.

                 You are right.  Evidently something is wrong with that story. Things just don't add up especially now that we are questioning whether a Co.  stripped the laptop of serious evidence.  A HUGE obstruction of justice, if true.  Lately I feel that laws just don't matter to these people that were in power, the Deep State.  They have thumbed their noses at us just way too often.  They have no respect for our laws. None.  Only if they work in their favor.

                  The corruption that has gone on in our country and other countries for decades is sickening. I have to say I don't ever remember it being so in your face as it is now. Maybe I was just young and naive. I really hope we see an end to some of it. I don't expect a perfect world, just a some what better world.

                   Yes and I totally agree.  There is and are so many things wrong that none of us suspected.  A lot of things were started decades ago and were in the works quietly while none of us suspected.  That is how I see it.  I grew up really in a very safe environment, or so I thought.  We had comforts that we needed and my parents worked hard and we had a nice middle class life.  School friends, playing, shopping with my mom and really I don't think there was as much violence as there is now.  Yes we had violence and Black people suffered, but they and other minorities have not achieved equality and are worse off for jobs.  TPTB have strung all of us along.  All I wish too is for it to get to a point where the Key People that have caused all this harm especially to our children world wide, get their due punishment.  I don't think I could sleep nights if I knew they never had to suffer for their horrid misdeeds.  Yes we do deserve a better world and they do not.

                    I grew up sheltered in a lower middle class household. It wasn't a typical family situation for reasons I won't go into, but it was a calm, loving environment. I remember when I had my first job and quickly found out people could be nasty human beings. It was funny that I didn't know this. I was shocked at the reality of the real world. I do remember racial tensions in high school. It would be mild for the most part thanks to us having 2 VP, one white and one black. I also once saw a KKK cross burning. This was right after my husband and I first married. They were trashy people and had even attempted to kill own members of their family. So I have seen the reality of racism. Like Rodney King said "Can't we all just get along".

                    I agree that it's TPTB, and the media, that stir the pot to keep everyone hating on everyone. If people would learn to realize that is the biggest reason for the hate we might get along better. Also, social media is another issue. As my husband has said when they created the internet they opened Pandora's Box. I hope we see some justice in this world, esp for the children.

                     I think of that all the time.  How they are running us against each other.  Constantly they are getting us to hate each other.  Also how many are selling out their own.  So many poor Blacks and Whites do not realize how their own race is selling them out.  Same with Mexicans and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I also think like your husband, yes the internet has opened a nasty can of worms along with our being able to find the truth. Also I believe they are planning to use the internet against us. They will start saying there is Fake News on what WE are finding, but of course not what they are finding. We are seeing this already.  Also Soc. Media needs to be reigned in for the children.  I am already finding when I bring up what we have discovered, that some are saying that the red pillers are believing anything they Google is Gospel.  So now I realize how they will turn info on the internet against us.  This is scary.

                     The children are the most important part of our reason for being here every day.

                      It is scary that they can and will use it against us. They will put their false truth up on a platform and say we are right and you are wrong. Just more lies and coverups to push their agenda. So many are brainwashed and may never wake up to their manipulation.

                       !t is about as frustrating as it gets.  This happened within my extended family.  It makes you feel like pulling out your hair.  Or possibly pulling out theirs!!!

                        You can't make someone see what they refuse to see. You have to be open minded, which many are not.

                         I guess we have open minds.  Thank God.  I am glad I did not turn out the other way, as we have discussed before, this stuff is horrid, but I would rather know than not.

                          It is difficult knowing, and sometimes I wonder if it's a blessing or a curse. Like you though, I believe it is better to know than not know. Glad we have each other. At least we can talk to others that get it. Talk to you later.

               Yeah, it's coming back now but not completely.  A laptop was reported stolen I believe and there was really quite a bit of it on reddit at the time which is when they were still covering pizzagate.  Hopefully those that were there hop on here and contribute.  Either that Co. had it stolen because the Cabal wanted it erased, or as usual Prinz is lying.  Or both.  I go with both.

                 TY.  But I don't see Wiener's name on it.  Also the Wa-Poo is the enemy now that they have hired JP.  Unless I am mistaken, do you see a name?  It seems to be blocked out.  We have been lied to so many times by so many.  Sigh, how many times have we been through this.

                   I so much more can believe that these perverts that were trying to get power to get their hands on our country once again, will do what they can to keep that NSFW material a secret.  Away from the eyes of their donating sheep.  This is not play.  They have everything to lose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also believe the FBI and DOJ and some in JY were obstructing justice.  Look at that game B Clinton and L Lynch played on the tarmac. Blowing smoke in our faces and in the face of justice too if they knew about those emails. That shows how the DOJ respected justice.  B C was on the Hot Seat.  Everyone in Wa and NY are covering their rears.

                   By any chance do you know if we can find out the name on that warrant?  Will a FOIA  produce it?

                     Hah!  They don't release anything they don't want us to know.  We always find things out way after the fact.  Nothing shocks me anymore.  This should not be a surprise.  But really we don't have proof of it happening, only that they are not to be trusted, which of course is a good reason to keep checking and possibly obtain the FOIAS.

                       I's sad to say that I and probably many now are feeling bad vibes when they see "children's books".  It's bad when we start feeling the itch to research when we see those words.  But there have been so many that have been using good terms and habits to pose as the Pied Pipers and pretend to be "do gooders" when they are the exact opposite.  They are hijacking the world of our children.  So very sad.   What you have described is a tip off to suspect his wife.  Off the Rails.

                    FOIA first the ACS records then the NYPD records then the local NYC DA offices....thats the only way to get a real timeline all this is SDNY releasing their shit which interestingly enough just made the case an attempted full blown coverup attempt THAT WAS NO RELEASED DURING THE THE ELECTION....that btw is insane. Amazing they could leak subpeonas when filed warrants 2 days before the judge granted it etc. But NOT THIS?

                     Well, let me tell you that since I was in Philly for the Dem Convention, there was all kinds of Illegal stuff happening.  They threw the Robert's Rules out of the window.  When they had the LV Convention, they tested what they were going to do in Philly.  So, really they have no problem with going the Illegal Route on anything.  They pulled a really fast one during the DNC voting and they took an Illegal vote in order to test the waters.  Yes, and that btw Was Insane as well.  They saw that people were falling off over to Bernie's side.  You really should not be surprised at how they run the show.  There are still many of those people in place in NY at this time.

                     Judicial Watch should be contacted.  They have done a really bang up job in getting things done.
