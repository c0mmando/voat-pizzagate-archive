<p>First notice what Andrew Breibart said: &quot;we are playing to win&quot;, also even more relevant is the Fox News Interview at 15:51</p>
<p>Notice the Host of Fox News mentions Ping-Pong and acts like he has inside information about the actual meaning of it, even though he mentioned it apparently out of the blue.</p>
<p>But the mention of Ping-Pong had a very specific purpose, and he used meaningful parallels to hint some relevant apropos to the protocol behind it. </p>
<p>The reason he did that was to intimidate Andrew Breibart, who already knew about the Ping-Pong protocol, to scare him by making him think these corrupt people using the ping-pong protocol are everywhere he goes (including the Fox News), to make him feel surrounded so he would back off.</p>
<p>Also notice another thing the Fox News host said: &quot;it\'s hard to play ping-pong when you don\'t have any opposition&quot;, this is also very meaningful to uncovering the protocol behind it. </p>
<p>It would seem that the whole idea of playing ping-pong is to beat your opponent, but that\'s not the case for these corrupt individuals, they don\'t play to win but instead they use it as a way to collaborate into perpetual corruption, without ever being punished for it because they only play with other corrupt individuals that are guilty of the same crimes. This should bring into the spotlight all the other people that are involved into this international ring of corruption because the only way you can get to hang out with these people is if you share their lack of morals and principles. Another thing to realise it that because they were exposed, they can never go back into the shadows where they came from, they are stuck into the light, that means they are desperate, like a cornered animal that\'s scared for his life. They will try to do everything in their power to intimidate the population of the globe into fear so they stop focusing on them, the COVID virus is only the first of their methods, and because of their recklessness and arrogance it\'s also going to be their last.</p>
<p>Comet Ping-Pong isn\'t just a \'random\' name, but instead it\'s the place where the people involved in all corrupt activities get together to discuss their next steps of their agenda, and finish the meeting with a degenerate and immoral celebration.</p>
<p>The Ping Pong protocol has two purposes, it\'s the initiation protocol and also a synchronization protocol. Using the Ping-Pong protocol the members of the corrupt group get together to reinforce their commitment to each other, and their pact of non prosecution and cooperation.  
</p>
<p>When they initiate new people (usually people that they consider weak and predisposed towards being corrupt) they first hint to corrupt activities ( it starts with drug use, and evolves to pedophilia and child sacrifice at later levels).</p>
<p>The evolution in the next levels of corruption is being negotiated using the Ping-Pong protocol where every 2 players, although from the outside look like being opponents, they play the game in such a way that neither of them lose. And during this Ping-Pong protocol they prepare each other with what they are going to do and say, and how they expect the other person to respond. After the protocol is over they give into complete debauchery, orgies, drugs, and all sorts of activities like the ones we discovered through the #pizzagate leaks. </p>
<p>Another important thing that can be noticed about these people is that they felt very confident that their protocol can not be breached (because of dirt they have on each other) that they acted completely arrogant and reckless based on a false sense of security.</p>
<p>What these people didn\'t understand and now they never will because it\'s too late, is this Bible verse:</p>
<p>Revelation 11:15: &quot;“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.”</p>
<p>They use many means of monitoring and controlling the population, mind control, control through technology , but ignore the fact that behind every living being is the pure consciousness of God, which themselves discovered through the work of the CIA experiments, like the Gateway Process. </p>
<p>God shared the truth with all people on Earth already, because it\'s enough for one person to share the truth, for all of us to share the truth. And the sharing of the Truth started with Jesus, and ends with each and every one of us. </p>
<p>Psalm 37:7 Be still before the Lord</p>
<p>    and wait patiently for him;</p>
<p>do not fret when people succeed in their ways,</p>
<p>    when they carry out their wicked schemes.</p>
<p>8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;</p>
<p>    do not fret—it leads only to evil.</p>
<p>9 For those who are evil will be destroyed,</p>
<p>    but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.</p>
<p>10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more;</p>
<p>    though you look for them, they will not be found.</p>
<p>11 But the meek will inherit the land</p>
<p>    and enjoy peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>12 The wicked plot against the righteous</p>
<p>    and gnash their teeth at them;</p>
<p>13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked,</p>
<p>    for he knows their day is coming.</p>
<p>These wicked people are all exposed, mostly because of their arrogance and recklessness, and secondly because it\'s a law of nature, more specifically Newton\'s third law: If an object A exerts a force on object B, then object B must exert a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction back on object A.</p>
<p>Applied to our scenario: If Object A ( wicked and corrupt people) exerts a force (of enslavement and oppression) on object B, the spiritual entity that represents B exerts a force of opposite direction and equal magnitude and enslaves object B.</p>
<p>Because object A has no concrete truth of their own, wicked and corrupt people being united only by their dread of imminent perdition that they feel in their putred bones, they don\'t have any unitary spiritual entity that can fight for them (like God), it\'s everyone for themselves, that\'s why they need protocols to coordinate with each other. Instead object B, being united around a concrete and eternal Truth they are represented by God Almighty Himself,  which exerts a spiritual force through nature itself, through you and me, at the same time, to annihilate the oppressive forces of the wicked and in turn enslave them into the eternal personal hell of their own making.</p>',

            , please have a look at our submission rules in the sidebar (again). All major claims need linked support. There is nothing in the video you linked about a "ping pong protocol". As currently presented, your submission is almost 100% speculative. While the video itself is excellent (I would have given this our "Share!" flare, had you accurately summarized it) you head off in a direction well beyond it, yet supply no additional linked sources supporting your theories. We have a subverse specifically for this type of submission:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . Please repost this there, or link so some additional sources supporting this "ping pong protocol". I will give this the 24 Hour Grace flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, this is the second submission you've made in a week ignoring our submission requirements. We ban those who repeatedly do that.

              , since instead of editing this post with supporting evidence you opted to make a new post in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              reeeeing about the moderation of the board -- which users voted three years ago was not allowed on the research-only main board -- I have banned you for repeatedly disregarding subverse rules. And since you cannot edit this submission now to fix it, I am removing it as well.

            I don't know. The interviewer could have dirt on Breitbart concerning ping-pong and is using it to pressure him. Breitbart would obviously know that the interviewer can't spill the beans totally so says "why did you change the subject to the "sport" of ping-pong?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't remember any of Breitbart's freinds or colleagues helping out with pizzagate and I don't know if he would either had he been alive. He most likely would have tried to diffuse it into a partisan distraction like Q.
