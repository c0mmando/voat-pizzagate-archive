            In every corner of Colorado, from the Front Range to the mountains to the plains, prosecutors found enough probable cause in more than five years to charge 369 people with crimes related to sex-trafficking children. Rocky Mountain PBS continues to investigate. A special episode of "Insight," Traded and Trafficked, airs November 16, 2017.

            In every corner of Colorado, from the Front Range to the mountains to the plains, prosecutors found enough probable cause in more than five years to charge 369 people with crimes related to sex-trafficking children. Rocky Mountain PBS continues to investigate. A special episode of "Insight," Traded and Trafficked, aired November 16, 2017. Also was a newspaper article publicizing program.

             Maybe Use the actual title In the future...
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess you don't see it as a big deal- And technically Its not. But Lack of self awareness going on here(voat), is quite Detrimental. Maybe not this one Example- But it's an accumulative  affect.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're title Is false. So there's Literally know reason to say 100 percent- When it's obviously not 100 percent. I mean..  I get what you mean...You're saying it's in every corner of the state... But saying "It's in every corner of the state" makes sense.. Because you're basically just saying it's "Everywhere" WHich again- Makes sense...
            </p>
            <p>
             But you go out of your way to not make sense. It's Not 100 %.. And people don't Say things Are "100%"as a way of saying
             <em>
              "A lot"
              <em>
               OR
              </em>
              "most"
             </em>
             ... I mean 100% is
             <em>
              100%
             </em>
             ... that's what it's used for. Using It describe anything that's not
             <em>
              100%
             </em>
             -*Literally * makes no sense. And I only Use literally, literally.  So just don't say it is.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have to realize that It can literally only hurt you- or rather, your credibility, Or rather the Movements Credibility...Again-
             <strong>
              This is just one very small Example-
             </strong>
             and I'm sure More people will get mad at me- Than they did at you... But They're wrong too. It's accumulative affect.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Listen about half way through typing this I thought "Jeez I'm being way to much of a dick over this issue."  But realized I had to. It's really fucking annoying. It has zero positive benefits. It hurts this place.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              TLDR: Don't say something is 100% unless It's 100%...That's the point of 100%.
             </strong>

              Is there a way to change the title of the thread? I thought the title as it was originally written was too long and unnecessarily so. To me they WERE saying everyplace of 100% coverage. Unless I didn't really understand the original meaning. Weird expression.
