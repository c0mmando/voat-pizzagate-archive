            is a shill. I would never upvote anything of his. There’s a reason he can’t post his own stuff and why people downvote him.

             and that was precisely the attitude I had towards him.  But on this one he got me - the evidence he provided is independent and credible, there's an innocuous explanation that seriously weakens the $65k Obama argument
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, it doesnt rule out Obama as one of the pedomafia, it just means the sum total of evidence we have that we can unequivocably pin on him is lesser

             seriously, all you guys coming at me talking up OTHER evidence and OTHER incidences.  Not one of you yet has commented specifically on the evidence at hand. Can you not shoot the messengers for one moment and be clinical fucking investigators.   Are you all that locked into a railroad thought pattern that you cant even say 'Are We Sure talks shit 99% of the time but on this 1% he might have a point'

            Are_we_sure also "debunked" the Tamera Luzzatto blog, claiming it was totally innocent and a witch hunt and that we were crazy for thinking otherwise. I'll never forget it, don't waste your energy on that fucker.

              Just because a news article says that doesn’t make it so. I’ve always heard that all meals there have to be prepared by the White House. Who knows. I won’t spend hours researching trying to debunk posts like he does. I don’t do that for a living.
             </p>
             <p>
              Besides, Obama was the president. Not a celebrity. Why would he be paying all that money to fly a pizza chef there for a party? AWS always has an excuse for everything.

               The contention is it was prepared in the whitehouse, he just shipped a celeb chef in to the WH for the cook-up (expenses of which contribute to the ridick figure of $65k)

              Because AWS's only contribution here is to discourage people it seems. This was only a month or two ago AT MOST that AWS claimed that about the blog, after being here for 2 years or however long. That's pizzagate 101, one of the best pieces of evidence we have and AWS "apparently" thinks it's literally nothing.

             Actually, the joke is that their company is being so cheap, getting pizza for the office means getting a single slice and splitting it.

                 I don't know if the nonsense is based on the inability to recognize humor or the belief in the nonsense comes first and the obvious humor is just ignored.

                <p>
                 I know that the evidence for this "code" is extraordinarily weak and comes from the 4chan meme "Post CP" or post "Child Porn." (Yeah, it comes from the same website where QAnon started.)   From this people starting joking and posting other CP items like chocolate pudding, copy paper, Captain Picard, compter processors and the one that became most popular, "Cheese Pizza."  In this case Pizza would equal Porn.  I also know that there's scant if any evidence of pizza by itself being some pedophile code.  I know that "Cheese Pizza" is never used in the Podesta emails which contain zero code.   I also know that the pizzagate code list was faked, because there's no evidence of existing on the web prior to the Podesta emails being leaked.

             that's a Stratfor email. It certainly is a suspicious email, as are a whole bunch of Stratfor connections. But that doesnt implicate Obama. This evidence appears to credibly provide an alibi for the $65k pizza/dogs  email that we once assumed implicated Obama. Maybe Obama is implicated, but in light of this, the $65k email is no longer a smoking gun.

           </p>
           <p>
            The more you downvoat shills, the more you silence them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides, I hate that commie fucker Obama PERSONALLY given how Obama care RUINED my life by crashing job hiring in my field shortly after graduating from college (in addition to the economic crash doing the same). Of course I have reason to want him to hang high from a tree.

              Do you trust his motives? Given what is known about his motives, how do you know he's not bull shitting you with fake news?

              Well since that jackass donkey is back, I decided to lift my mood up a bit by sharing one of his posts in which he defends Mohammad's pedophila with donkey's belief that "women are legal for sex when they have their first period" (ie donkey himself is a pedo or a pedo defender) with a cyber group that seeks out and punishes pedophiles. They also have his post in which he threatened a female poster with being kidnapped and repeatedly raped (remember that donkey is on record believeing that rape is morally acceptable).

               The EVIDENCE. I've been persuaded by EVIDENCE, not by Are We Sure
              </p>
              <p>
               Clear as day, a Daily Mail article talking about a famous pizza chef being invited to the Whitehouse to do a cook up there. A secondary minor local news outlet article also talking about it, both a month before the infamous $65k email
              </p>
              <p>
               ignore everything else. I can be unhinged sometimes, that doesnt mean everything i submit is without merit. So too with everyone here. Fuck me even that Wisconsin is Corrupt guy , he only talked cryptic shit for 6 months. Turned out he was RIGHT, he just had some perverse aversion to supplying EVIDENCE
              </p>
              <p>
               address the evidence. In what capacity does this not provide a potentially innocuous explanation for the $65k email ?

              lol cant you see they are incapable of that?  women especially depend on groupthink -- just look at how important they see keeping up with changing fashion trends.  countless studies show their intellectual insecurity.
             </p>
             <p>
              he said it: "(ie downvoat just for being a known shill)."  "known shill" because that faggot and a group of women think so.  of course the "shill" can simply use alts or ask someone else to post their shit, as I have done, and it's pretty funny how differently they react to the same information depending on messenger.
             </p>
             <p>
              another reply to you from a woman is highly familiar: "When you call everyone "bitches" in your first sentence you have a weak shit argument."
             </p>
             <p>
              not only the messenger's reputation but his word choice will influence a woman's evaluation of the factual content

The meanie women are just too much for your to handle so you run away like a bitch. Unfortunately you're so easy to spot because of YOUR style of writing and idiotic logic that you SUCK at hiding who you are! 🖕🏻

                Uh oh. That little faggot replied to you and pinged me. Somebodies triggered! 🤣😂🤣😂 I love it because no woman triggers him more than I do, That’s why he’s so obsessed with me. Why? Because I put the little bitch in his place. Opposite of how he thinks the woman’s role should be. 🙄
               </p>
               <p>
                So... it cracks me up because you came along and tear into him like I do. Together, you and I are his worst nightmare!! 😂😂😂😂😂 I swear... You’re my kind of woman friend HAHA.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you really want to trigger the insecure little excuse for a man, bring up a big tall alpha male. 🤣 It drives him nuts because he wishes he was masculine and manly like that. He’s only macho behind his keyboard. In real life, he wouldn’t dare treat people the way he treats them here. A real man would lay him flat!
He’s so intimidated by REAL men. He hates women because nobody wants the little piece of shit. Hmmm I wonder why. 🙄
               </p>
               <p>
                My first time meeting Donkey was because I had made a comment saying that George Webb used his charm and personality to make women fall for him. It was during a time when he was supposedly harassing this woman named Wendy. Well Donkey, who I had never even caught my attention yet, lost his shit!
               </p>
               <p>
                He’s so triggered by George Webb, that I was forced to to take precautions and give him this...
                <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/26ub.jpg">
                 http://i.imgs.fyi/img/26ub.jpg
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                So whatever you do, don’t talk about big tall strong sexy strapping men with deep voices and a full head of hair!! 😂 Especially not George Webb. 🙄 He will just talk about how American women are whores and superficial. 😁 Then he’ll get triggered when we aren’t bothered by it and put the little wannabe in his place. In real life, he knows we would bitch slap his ass and bruise his bruise his ego even more.
               </p>

                Feel free to ping me anytime you have to deal with the scrawny little queer.
                <br/>
                2 babes are better than 1. Especially since in real life he can’t get ANY!

                 I really can't get over how he slithers back here with his new stupid name pretending to be someone else! 😂. It just shows how young and stupid he is that he acts so impulsively by telling everyone repeatedly he was "done with this place" but doesn't have the balls to keep to what he says! His utter hatred of women (and everything jewey) along with his inability to refrain from telling everyone to do something nasty with his pee pee makes him easy to spot.

                  You’re right! He loves to tell us how he’s uncircumcised too. I don’t care to know anything about his little noodle. LMAO

                   He's probably lying. I'm sure mommy got him circumcised but he's so overly concerned someone might accuse him of being Jewish he has to always put that out there

                     I didn't know that! His self hate is pretty obvious. I just didn't make the connection that it was due to his jewness. I just thought it was because his moms a crack ho and he's pasty and obese! 
 He reminds me of those guys who continually have to tell you how not gay they are because they really have sex with dudes 😂

                How did I spot ANY of you dumb bitches in the first place,  bitch?   You don't just come out and declare it randomly.  It is just OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE.
               </p>
               <p>
                For example,  since discussing ideas on forums is a male thing,  clearly it must be a woman like you who doesn't understand how they work:  user names get BANNED or disabled due to downvote bots.  So I simply make new ones with zero attempt to hide. It is impossible to "chase" anyone off without a full IP ban.

                I generally ignore your retarded screeds but here I choose to correct your misunderstandings of basic things only to point out that they prove you want to ride my dick just like

                 Thanks for the laugh you fat little slob!😂😂😂😂😂 only on your DREAMS does any woman want to "ride" anything remotely near you let alone your tiny ass little dick that stinks like funyons from your two favorite past times- shoving your face full of food and jerking your teeny weenie to anime.

                 You're a really pathetic excuse for a person let along a so called man. And what's worst is you're a cowardly little liar! We could all believe that you were changing your name to avoid your deserved downvoats (by humans, not by bots!) then you were making slight changes to the donkey moniker, but then it's just by confidence after your "srayzie is mean to me" tantrum you come back with this pathetic new identity 😂😂😂😂. Fuck off!

                 Donkey, anyone who isn’t a shill, KNOWS that you are a shill. You don’t make the rules around here. Even if your little fantasy were true, you don’t qualify as a man. Having a little noodle may make you a male. But doesn’t make you a man. 🙄

                <p>
                 You’re blaming downvote bots? 😂 Are you a full blown liberal now? 🙄 Are they Russian bots? 🤔 They just randomly choose YOU and your alts to downvote? LMAO. No, it can’t possibly be because you have nothing of value to add to a conversation and you treat everyone like shit. 🤨

                  every sentence to a woman should begin and end with bitch until you get in line.  saying a particular word doesn't affect a message, bitch.  here you are admitting you think it does LOL.  "2+2=4, cunt."  see?  logic is about causality.  it's a scientific fact that women don't think logically as much as it is a scientific fact that they have smaller brains than men regardless of body size.

                  it is the deepest fantasy of every woman to have a strong fascist man ravage her.  that's another fact it is useless to deny. so of course you wouldn't ride it because no woman ever wants to be above a man, not in sex or job position or anything else.

                    yeah Jews have bot armies and shill armies and train jews to scour and edit Wikipedia.  basic facts in the "truth community."  they even make the top programs for hacking major infrastructure and cars, which they recently bragged and demonstrated for Vice news.

                    of course real men are fascists.  what's RIGHT doesn't depend on how many retards and cunts will vote for.  why do you think Jews love 'democracy' so much.  cuz they can 'inform' the most people thru their media monopolies.  btw it is a proven fact that women are far less informed on even basic political matters (like who's secretary of state etc) than men, Pew just came out with yet another set of quiz results showing this.  women shouldn't be anywhere near a voting booth, ever.

You're the one who has to live the shitty life you have created. I hope I never encounter you in real life! You're a sick disgusting person!

              I mean, does this conclude 100% that Obama is not part of the Pedostocracy? No
Does it mean pizza is discredited as a code word? No.

              All it means is that the sum total of evidence in the public domain pointing to his participation in the same sick shit as Epstein, Hastert, Silsby, Saville is thinner than we in this community would often like to assert. It means anyone who is yet to be convinced of Pizzagate who knows about this Missouri pizza chef gig who hears us bang on about the $65k is gonna roll their eyes at us with good cause in the light of plausibility the Daily Mail article seems to provide

            When you call everyone "bitches" in your first sentence you have a weak shit argument. You write that Obama paid 65k for pizza/hot dogs from Chicago, but the daily mail article you use as your proof states the chef was from St. Louis! And it only discusses pizza. Zero mention of hot dogs in either article. This whole post is garbage.

            And you seriously tell us to upvoat that dick bag are we sure? I know it's Saturday night an all but damn, don't make posts when you're drunk!

             i, too told Are We Sure that the st Louis / Chicago discrepancy weakens the argument a little. But come on. Read the link. Daily Mail - large online media, mid April 2009, explicitly bangs on about Obama bringing in a pizza chef.

            One powerful tool to research an item like this is to limit your google search to just the dates when the event happened.  If you google Obama and $65,000 pizza all you will get is references to the false story that was built up around this email.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if you just search for item from around the original time, you will see this story about obama and pizza was written about in tons of different MSM articles.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+pizza&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS746US747&amp;tbs=cdr:1,cd_min:3/1/2009,cd_max:6/1/2009&amp;ei=MGbAWrHIFK2k_QbN4qaIDQ&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1163&amp;bih=536">

           </p>
           <p>
            And you could find articles like this that were determined to attack Obama for this story.

            You can also do time specific searches on twitter is is particularly good for something like this which is a faken interpretation of  the news.
