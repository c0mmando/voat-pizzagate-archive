            I hope you mean "these teen 'victims' agreed to massage nude old men for money knowing it was sexual, and deserved what happened to them"

            I could find random teen girls to do the same in half an hour. I got $200.  This is 2019, boomer. Get a fucking clue.

            How about some emphasis on the fact Epstein is a MOSSAD KIKE and we're gearing up start another war for Israel, as JewAnon wants?

            The dude with Trump in this picture just got arrested for transporting child porn.

            George Nader, a long-time wheeler dealer who was representing the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia during several secret planning meeting with the Trump team. Nader was arrested and his indictment unsealed today

            He was caught with child porn on his phone in January 2018 and became a cooperating witness for the Mueller probe. The indictment is just about the porn though, not the Mueller case

            <p>
             A man with citizenship in Lebanon and the United States was arrested this morning after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on charges of transporting visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to court documents, George Aref Nader, 60, was charged by criminal complaint after he arrived at Washington-Dulles International Airport on Jan. 17, 2018 from Dubai in possession of a cell phone containing visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. The charges were unsealed after his arrest this morning.
            </p>

            News of his cooperation came out in early March, this means he could have been gathering information for 6 weeks.

            In related news the NY Times just did a massive story on the head of UAE, describing him as one of the most powerful men in the Middle East.  He maneuvered to replace the crown prince in Saudi Arabia with the current crown prince because the other guy was an enemy of his.

              That's absolutely NOT the George Nader pictured with Trump and NOT the George Nader who just got arrested.
             </p>
             <p>
              The George Nader who got arrested is a Lebanese and US Citizen.  The George Nader who is in the photo is a citizen of the Dominican Republic.  He's a big businessman down there and is younger and taller than the Lebanese guy

             <p>
              That photo was NOT taken on Epstein's Island.  It was taken in the Domican Republic.  One of the men in the photo went to college with Bill Clinton and that's how he knows them.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Nader who did get arrested has some Clinton ties, in fact, he has served an go between for several governments and several US administrations.  He used to run a think tank/journal based in DC.

              You always need an escape plan and a go bag. Also don't drink with people who are mentally ill. Just walk away and it will hurt them more than fighting because they have abandonment issues. Abandoning them will force self reflection. But if you don't have an escape plan you can't get away. Goes for all abusive relationships. Bag with clothes, cash, burner phone, toothbrush etc.
