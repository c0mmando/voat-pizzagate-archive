"Records: NXIVM hacked billionaire's emails with Hillary Clinton, world leaders
Former member alleges computer spying, plot to imprison foes
In the telephone conversation last March, Keeffe claimed Clare Bronfman's initial attempt to hack into her father's email account failed after she sent him an email that had a digital photo of a bear attached and which contained a computer-hacking virus. The photo was meaningful because Clare Bronfman's father called her "Clare-bear" as a nickname, Keeffe said. The digital photo of the bear held a key-logger virus that would have infiltrated Edgar Bronfman's computer if he opened it, Keeffe added. Key-loggers are used to monitor the keystrokes of a computer, enabling someone other than the computer user to access personal account information, including passwords.
           </p>
           <p>
            "But he never opened the picture," Keeffe said in the telephone call with Bouchey. "So she went down to his office and met with him, and specifically said, 'I want to show you this picture' and went on his email with him and downloaded the virus onto his computer herself.""
