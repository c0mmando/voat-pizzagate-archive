<p>The body of the email reads:
“-should take major clients taskforce brief.

<p>Apparently, EJK stands for Extra Judicial Killings. Why would they need to get money to Pakistan for this?</p>
<p>The email was sent January 20, 2011 - 2:50 am which is interesting because it is well before the sexting scandal broke on May 27, 2011. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/politics/weiner-timeline/">http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/politics/weiner-timeline/</a></p>
<p>This article from October 22, 2010, references that the US was to CUT funding to the Pakistani Army BECAUSE of ExtraJudicial Killings by the Pakistani Army.

<p>To note, Huma is of Pakistani and Indian descent. </p>
<p>The only result I could find for January 19, 2011 of importance regarding Weiner is “Anthony Weiner lashes out at Republicans over Obamacare”

<p>If Huma had a Google Alert set up for the terms &quot;Anthony Weiner&quot; why does the content of the email relate to him?</p>
<p>Only newsworthy event that happened in Pakistan on Jan 20, 2011 was an earthquake without fatalities.

            Huma definitely has ties to Muslim Brotherhood. She's linked to Sheik Qaradawi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Her mom is part of the Muslim sisterhood and also under  the umbrella of Qaradawis "Union of good." He finances Hamas in Palestine. It's all linked through NGOS. Sheik Qaradawis daughter won the State Department scholarship in Qatar to study chemistry? WHOA!!! This dude is a known terrorist leader who promotes jihad. This is seriously fucked up shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            NGOS worth looking into: IICDR, IICWC, CAIR

            No I think it is actually EJK, but also has to do with the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. According to the Leahy Law, the US is not allowed to provide civilian or military aid to human rights abusers, which includes extra-judicial killings.

            The big question is though, if Hillary was providing money under the table to someone, which group is it? Is it the Pakistanis, or maybe trying to cause civil unrest in Kashmir by funding them against India?

            ExtraJudicial Killings ,
An extrajudicial killing (also known as extrajudicial execution) is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kill the kids/humans that was or will be trafficked. No Questions asked get rid of them.
