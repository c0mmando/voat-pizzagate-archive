            Had to go to a Mormon church for many years and later worked for a personal friend of Mitt Romney's. What Cathy O'Brien said was true. I don't know about the vibrations and technology, but the LDS church
            <em>
             does
            </em>
            have an organized plan to get Mormons in key positions in government, entertainment, and education to systematically "Mormonize" the world. Not just the US, but the world. They see this as saving the world, helping people, bringing joy and goodness to people's hearts. Being a Mormon is great, so why wouldn't everyone want to be one? That's the idea. Most of the Mormons I knew I actually liked a great deal and I found that I shared all of their values. I just thought their cult-like way of going about it was weird and creepy.
           </p>
           <p>
            My employer was on this mission trip with Mitt Romney that was mentioned in the link. My employer said that the other people on the mission stopped obeying the rules of the mission and he and Mitt were the only ones still being godly and they "had to" report all the others. He said it was a like a coup against he and Mitt and they had to turn it around to save the mission.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Mormons like to be from "original Mormon families" but Mitt's family went to Mexico not long ago so they could keep legally being polygamists and he still has cousins over there fighting the cartels. Kind of embarrassing for him. Here's a Vice story about it:
            <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-mexican-mormon-war-part-1">
             https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-mexican-mormon-war-part-1
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So it's not too far afield to suggest that Mitt has ties in FLDS (fundamentalist mormon) lifestyle choices, which might include human trafficking and abuse. He is definitely part of their MWO. Mormon World Order.

            I did a huge post about Romney coming out of nowhere even though he knew he couldn't win the presidency along with Jeb giving it a try and losing....they were just trying to stop Trump #NeverTrump and lots of info and connections to look into....and my post got....deleted. There are some others if you do a search of the sub for Romney.

            By coincidence I was just listening to MK Ultra survivor Cathy O'brien's talk here:

            .  She has some interesting information about Mitt Romney's father George.  Start at the 16.30 minute mark.
