Those who see him work the breakfast rooms and drinks parties of St James’s and the City with a conspiratorial air have barely noticed the difference.

             The switch meant a fond farewell to blockbuster City deals such as Royal Bank of Scotland’s takeover of NatWest and Vodafone’s hostile move for German rival Mannesmann. In their place, he installs the people with their grip on such multi-billion-pound moves at GlaxoSmithKline and insurer Prudential. Those who see him work the breakfast rooms and drinks parties of St James’s and the City with a conspiratorial air have barely noticed the difference.

             Jenkin was born on 9 April 1959 to Patrick Jenkin (later Baron Jenkin of Roding), the life peer and former cabinet minister. He is a male-line descendant of the scientist Fleeming Jenkin. He worked for Ford and the private equity company 3i as Manager of Legal &amp; General Ventures from 1989–92. From 1992–95, he was an advisor to Legal &amp; General Group plc

             Jenkin is the Vice-President of the UK charity Combat Stress, which offers residential treatment to ex-servicemen and women suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jenkin married Anne Caroline Strutt in 1988 and has two sons. He is the UK parliament's best known naturist.[16][17] He is a long-time acquaintance of screenwriter Richard Curtis, who typically includes a character named 'Bernard' in everything he writes.

            This video seems like it is tries VERY hard to PROVE that the Hampstead Cover Up was a HOAX - I have seen all the interviews with the children, including the police ones, back in 2014/15 when it came out on the internet......I 100% still believe them! Their comments, gestures, emotions and memory are phenomenal, very intelligent little children and this is not stating the obvious: This BBC Sham Interview with their dad 'proving' the children are liars and 'nothing to see here'. I used to like Victoria Derbysire, but after this could not watch her again without disdain at her part in the Cover Up! - can you see his body language when hes trying to conger up tears?  and he is supposed to be an actor. Laughable if it was not so serious! - BBC Interview SAR Father in the Hampstead Cover Up:-

            Aldous Huxley’s Dianetic Utopia

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             n 1950, shortly after launching the dianetic movement that would eventually become known as
             <strong>
              Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard paid a visit to the house of noted English author, Aldous Huxley
             </strong>
             , who at that time was living in Los Angeles. To many, it would appear that Huxley was being rather generous with his time by meeting with such an obvious crackpot and conman. However, Huxley was very interested in fringe science and odd religious or spiritual movements, and despite an apparent distaste for Hubbard as a human being (“rather immature… and in some ways rather pathetic”) Huxley was impressed by his work and his new book, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huxley, naturally, was devastated by the loss of the woman he had loved for thirty years. However, shortly after, he married his second wife – a family friend who Maria most likely groomed to replace her as Aldous’ wife.
             <strong>
              Laura Huxley had been following the dianetic movement since its inception, and not only took over as Mrs. Huxley but also as Aldous’ processing partner – “my dianetic operator,” he called her.

            Many do not want to have children and many say they do not have any when asked.  But they do.  Each and everyone of us has a duty to make sure they are protected.  When others are too weak or evil we must pick up the torch and do what we can.  These little beings are all we have.  We must not let them take away Our Future and Our Children for if they kill them, We will no longer be.  Our presence will no longer live or be felt. They will have Our Children and Our Souls too.
