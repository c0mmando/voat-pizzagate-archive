<hr />
<p>The claim that the Podesta brothers, John and Tony, closely resemble the two mystery efits drawn up by ex-MI5 Head of Covert Intelligence, Henri Exton, in spring 2008, continues to circulate around the internet. These two efits are supposed to be ‘Smithman’, a claim I have tried to debunk on the Smithman threads here. No serious Madeleine McCann researcher thinks that the Podesta emails and the photos of the Podesta brothers have anything to do with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. </p>
<p>But thanks to Wikileaks and other researchers, all sorts of connections are now coming to light. And perhaps there is a connection of sorts between the Podesta emails and the Madeleine McCann case. </p>
<p>If there is a connection, then it might be via Ernie Allen, the Chief Executive for many years of the U.S. equivalent of ‘Missing People’, NCMEC and also Chairman for many years of ICMEC – a powerful interrnational missing people’s organization. </p>
<p>Most here will recall Gerry McCann’s rush to visit Washington – centre of the Podesta email scandal, of course, in July 2007 -where he actually spent 5 whole days (22 to 26 July) . Here is Gerry with Ernie on that visit:</p>

<p>The personality and background of Ernie Allen, and his sources of funding, have been of concern to some on the forum, especially sharonl.       
</p>
<p>Here by the way is one of the blogs Gerry wrote from his Washington trip, on 24 July. As can be seen, it’s full of his meetings with NCMEC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another busy day in Washington. Started early on at NCMEC with interviews from 6.15am for the five major US TV networks morning news shows. A very serious issues programme 20-20 was also recording our visit to the America, as they will also be producing a piece on the search to find Madeleine.</p>
<p>Late morning we had a visit to the White House to meet with the First Lady’s deputy chief of staff Sarah Armstrong. This visit was facilitated by Lady Catherine Meyer, founder of the British charity PACT, which is an affiliate of ICMEC and has done so much to raise awareness of missing children in the UK. Mrs Bush is a strong supporter of child welfare issues and is in fact an Honorary Board member of ICMEC. They were already aware of Madeleines disappearance and I took the opportunity to fill them in on my visit to Washington, particularly the work we are doing with ICMEC and the meeting we had with the attorney general. We finished with a very quick tour of the public areas in the White House which is a very impressive building and we also met one of the Presidents Scottish terriers! Immediately following the visit I did a few interviews for the British Media in front of the White House.</p>
<p>After a very brief lunch it was on to Capitol Hill for meetings with politicians who have been instrumental in getting the Adam Walsh BIll and others passed. We met with Democrat congressman Nick Lampson and Republican Senator Robert Shelby who both know the board members of NCMEC very well. They were both very keen to do what they could to help find Madeleine and the support during the visit we have received has been tremendous.</p>
<p>I spoke to Kate and the kids, whose telephone skills are developing very quickly which is nice for me when I am away like this. Kate has stayed on in Portugal and has been keeping in touch with the police but there are no major developments to report. In the evening I managed to meet up with a friend from Glasgow who is also a cardiologist and working in the Washington area. We went for a bite to eat and it was good to sit down quietly with a familiar face for an hour or two.</p>

<p>This invitation is basically from Richard Branson to John Podesta. </p>
<p>Some researchers have noted the close connections between these four people:</p>
<p>JOHN PODESTA
RICHARD BRANSON (Virgin Group, Necker Island etc.)
JEFFREY EPSTEIN (Paedophile, close friend of Prince Andrew) and
ERNIE ALLEN – Head of international missing persons organisations and friend of Gerry McCann.</p>
<p>All I can offer for the moment is a few links. It may be that the Podesta-Branson-Epstein-Allen-McCann link amounts to nothing at all. But here are some starting points if someone wants to look further into the links:</p>

            Isn't the eternal presumption now that many or even everyone appointed or employed in these "missing children" organizations and any of their contacts are involved in this.  Same for any other institutions working to "help" children.  None of them seem to be trustworthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though I don't mean a parent like McCann seeking the help of what should be a legitimate "missing" organization.
Caution:  it would be dangerous to presume that every father of a kidnapped child is involved in setting it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course we can't dismiss parents as a link to kidnappings because that has proven true in many of these cases -- from Johnny Gosch where Noreen Gosch (his mother) discovered a number of years later that her husband was involved in setting up the kidnapping.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, as Kathy O'Brien and other MKULTRA victims tells us their fathers were their first sexual abusers and that the fathers were either approached by someone connected to CIA to arrange deal making and the fathers were said to have succeeded thereafter in employment and earnings.  Perhaps this info circulated in pedophile circles at the time?   Actually, rather likely, imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we do know without question is that males are our sexual abusers of children.
And that officials in our government have to be involved (as do various government agencies) in order to protect this activity.

            The level of cover up from British government and the bizarre behavior from the parents is what makes this case so controversial, its something worth looking into as it is something clearly involved on a higher level pre-pizzagate. Even if it is not anything to do with podestas , the truth will uncover something big. If the black child had compulsive lying creep parents with deep connections and government level of mainstream shilling, then yes she would matter.

            Honestly the only thing convincing about John is the emails and possibly the "fatherhood" video. I'm more convinced his brother Tony is the real creep.

            WTF!!! I checked Podesta emails to see what he was up to during the time that Gerry McCann was in DC. This is the only email from June 17, 2007 to September 18, 2007.

             Currently, I have several primary areas of interest: identifying genes associated with normal variations in cognitive function and relevant to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, developing an account episodic memory impairments in schizophrenia using genetic dissection, fMRI, cognitive science and computational models, understanding the cognitive underpinnings of thought disorder in schizophrenia in mechanistic terms and assessing cognitive enhancing drugs in schizophrenia.

            I'll guarantee McCann wasn't abducted by anyone. Not the Podestas, not the 'faceless' man Jane Tanner saw. No-one. Her parents killed her through neglect. This is a blind alley.

              No serious Madeleine McCann researcher thinks that the Podesta emails and the photos of the Podesta brothers have anything to do with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             If being accused of not being serious about McCann or PG is the price to pay for seeing a potential connection between suspect photos and JP emails, I'll wear the badge.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Podesta's Chief of Staff in for Hillary 2016 was Sarah Latham.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/AskPizzagate/1528806">

             </a>
             She was former communications director at public relations firm Freud Communications. That would be Mathew Freud, son of Clement Freud, known pedophile with a villa 1/3 of a mile from where Maddie was taken. McCann's were guests of C. Freud not long after the abduction. By my reckoning, that's three narrow degrees of separation down to a four minute jog from the hotel to Freud's villa.
            </p>
            <p>
             Coupled with Wikileaks Podesta emails starting two days after Maddie's disappearance (one can infer all previous emails may have been deleted to cover travel/itinerary history, hence they were unavailable to Wikileaks) and the great lag of another six weeks until he makes another email and resumes anything that could be considered regular email traffic (one can infer several suspicious things here) a more direct connection cannot remotely be dismissed out of hand. If these are just coincidences, J &amp;TP have to be considered two of the unluckiest men alive to have such coincidences befall them. If there is any information that disproves the possibility of the more direct potential connection as just outlined, kindly respond with same.

              I'm totally with you that the Podesta bros took Madeleine.  I think every single point you make above is valid, and helps prove the case.    I just think that the OP here is making the theory look silly because his argument is so easily dismissed.

             Not in a crime ring. aka in the world of hard drugs, you always score by knowing a guy who knows a guy and so on. I'd imagine child sex trafficking would be similar, Unusual coincidence for someone like Gerry Mccann.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: In saying that would make sense if Jeffery Epstein acted as the middle man and Richard Branson/ Ernie Allen were ones who knew the "customers"
Also since Ernie Allen is involved with NCMEC/ICMEC this makes a link to the recent development with Brian Podesta.

Office of Children's Issues
The Office of Children's Issues is an agency of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which in turn is part of the U.S. Department of State. The Office of Children’s Issues was created in 1994 under the leadership of Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Mary Ryan and that of her successor Maura Harty. The Office of Children's Issues develops and coordinates policies and programs related to international child abduction. In this respect, it is the U.S. Central Authority under the terms of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.

Anon broke down a few things on Amb Elizabeth Frawley Bagley &amp; ironically I was researching her deep/longtime ties to the DNC &amp; Clinton Cabal a few months ago. Her husband Smith Bagley died in 2010, was an heir to RJ Reynolds fortune, a prominent Democratic fundraiser &amp; DC/Georgetown socialite (Tobacco). The couple has two children Vaughan Elizabeth Bagley and Conor Reynolds Bagley. Elizabeth Bagley is on NDI (National Democratic Institute) Board of Directors
           </p>
           <p>
            Within a few years, the headlines were less flattering. In 1980, Mr. Bagley settled a civil suit with the Securities and Exchange Commission over government charges that he and others artificially inflated the price of the stock of the Washington Group, a North Carolina textile and food conglomerate he led.
           </p>
           <p>
            Months earlier, a U.S. District Court jury in Richmond had found Mr. Bagley and four other defendants innocent of all criminal charges in a related stock manipulation and conspiracy case. The company went bankrupt in June 1977. Both the judge and Mr. Bagley accused the Justice Department of overzealous prosecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            His marriages to Sandra Peabody Robinson and Vicki Bagley ended in divorce.
           </p>
           <p>
            Survivors include his wife of 26 years, Elizabeth Frawley Bagley of Washington; a son from his first marriage, Walker Bagley of Lexington, Ky.; three children from his second marriage, Nancy Reynolds Bagley and Nicole Ladmer Bagley, both of Washington, and Brett Dylan Bagley of New York; two children from his third marriage, Vaughan Elizabeth Bagley and Conor Reynolds Bagley, both of Washington; a sister, Susan Bagley Bloom of Vancouver, Canada; and five grandchildren.1

           </p>
           <p>
            Over the years, the Bagleys frequently opened their homes to fund-raising events for Democratic candidates, including Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry. Last year they raised $600,000 to help pay for events celebrating President Obama’s inauguration.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among his civic activities, he was president of the Arca Foundation, which focuses on social equity in developing countries

            "After all these years -- decades of friendship -- this is the first event I've attended for him," said Bill Clinton, who delivered the closing eulogy at Georgetown's Holy Trinity Catholic Church. "This man, notwithstanding the circumstances in which he was born or the wealth he generated for himself, always found a way to give more than he took."
           </p>
           <p>
            The church was packed with family and friends: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former DNC chair Terry McAuliffe, former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, members of Congress, and plenty of people who benefited from Bagley's deep-pocket, behind-the-scenes generosity.
