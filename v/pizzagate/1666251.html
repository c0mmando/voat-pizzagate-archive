            With the abject horror of PG, and the realisation of how truly insanely fucked up this planet is, I will gladly clutch at any straw. Nothing can ever be more fucked up than PG, and we see those cunts showing their wares in daylight. Why is it impossible to believe that some good guys might be showing their wares too? I for one would genuinely like to hear why

            If you ask me, those who think "channeling" the galactic federation of light or those who think praying to God will help us in any way are just as crazy as the ones who think sacrificeing children helps them in any way...
           </p>
           <p>
            It doesn't help. It doesn't help to kill a child and it doesn't help to pray.
As long as people do nothing but praying or channeling, the ones who kill people will be just fine.
Actually I think they really hope we will do nothing but praying. I think that is even the reason why they try to make us believe in all those demonic satanic stuff using Hollywood only so people think it's all about "the good" vs "the evil" so the people think praying is the only solution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why else would they spend so much effort into making us believe in the devil using theire Hollywood brainwash movies?

             I genuinely wish it was that simple. Since PG broke, and we see the most powerful people in the world up to this stuff I have to give it credence. These people don't do this for shits and giggles. As I am a normal, non power hungry, human loving human, I must therefore conclude that whatever they are doing, I must do the opposite. I believed in a Universal consciousness before PG, now I'm certain of it. There are "good and evil' forces at play, I choose good. (My only problem now is how far I have to stretch this being good malarkey. I'm no samaratin)

             <p>
              Yes yes yes please. I would welcome everyone doing the opposite of what they are doing, but you arent't doing the opposite.
They believe in imagenary supernatural beings that they have to satisfy for reward and so do you. Only difference is, that you choose one a little nicer imagenary being as your master. That makes you less of a thread for society, but not less crazy.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do the opposite of what they are doing. I don't believe there is any supernaturall being, which I have to follow. I decide what is right and what is wrong for my self and that is the one major difference between them, you and me that counts.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are not pure evil, they are CRAZY and you don't fight crazy people, by becomeing a somewhat more friendly crazy person as well, you fight crazy people by being rational.
             </p>
             <p>
              You say all this evil stuff they do kinda proves that "the pure evil/ the devil" exists, but aren't we pass that point where we asssociate "demonic" behavior with actual demons? The catholic church practiced excorzism on people who suffered from epilepsy or tourette syndrome because yeah they acted like they are possessed by a demon, but now we know, that wasn't true, so why are you doing basicly the same now again?
             </p>
             <p>
              God wont help, Jesus wont help and the galactic federation of light wont help as well. We have to do the work on our own.
As long as people spend all their time praying, there is no chance for us to win this battle, so please forget about all this fairy-dust magical bullshitery and concentrate on what is called reality.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not like against everything, that has to do with spirituality, but I know, that what we are dealing with here hasn't anything to do with these kind of things.
