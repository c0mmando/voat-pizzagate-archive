<p>With all the talk about Bennington, the name Kurt Cobain popped into my head today. Why it ddn\'t before is because I\'d always considered him what the media wanted me to which was that he was some sort of tragic victim.

<p>I did some dumpster diving and it wasn\'t long before I found a pretty good article on Mr. Cobain. Not surprisingly, it leveled the pretty serous charge of him being a pedophile. I\'d like to point out the article was published on September 26. 2011 so no one can accuse the blogger of being influenced by the Great Pizzagate Scare of 2016. By the way, that debunked conspiracy is still going on today ...  wink wink. </p>
<p>Here\'s a bit of the article: </p>

<h1>Nevermind That Kurt Cobain Was a Psychotic Drug Addict Pedophile</h1>
<p>In a way Kurt used a weak excuse on why he was too lazy to deal with his personal problems and his embarrassing love for kiddie nudity. Oh, you don’t think he dabbled his sin staff in underage imagery of naked newborns? Than why was their most popular cover that of a fleshly exposed babies twiddle rompus? This was Kurt’s way of letting people know he had a sick and twisted problem. How do you think he thought up the name for the band? Kurt has been reported to call his pre-tween self demon whacking sessions to put him in a spiritual Nirvana, as he drifted into a euphoric climax. Now remember, the Atheists and Liberals will jump on and point fingers anyone who is religious that is accused of kiddie fondle touching, but how dare anyone say anything about a socialist man who actions screams “ice cream” van driver or lost puppy flyer poster.</p>

<p>Okay, so call me ill-informed, but I did not know Cobain was a cross-dresser or that he was signaling he saw anything other than innocence in a baby\'s naked bottom. I think it was because I was innocent when I first saw the cover. Now? Now I see the <s>artwork</s> trash through older-and-wiser eyes. And because I\'m not quite sure what\'s done when the babies are thrown in the pool for entertainment, I begin to toy with the idea that they do somehow incorporate money into the guileless baby\'s water acrobatic act. I mean, do they dangle money and have the kid grab at it? Swim towards it and snatch it back until the kid cries? I remember JA\'s numerous pics of the kids and money. Was there a separate meaning to it that we missed. And Skank Whore Satanist Angelina was shamed for engaging in something very, very similar in an audition with Cambodian orphans.

<p>Our September cover story, “A Life in Bold,” a portrait of actress Angelina Jolie by contributing editor Evgenia Peretz, has been the subject of some controversy, specifically the paragraph that follows, which describes the casting of Cambodian children in Jolie’s upcoming film, First They Killed My Father:</p>
<p>“To cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. ‘Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,’ Jolie says. ‘When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.’ Jolie then tears up. ‘When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn’t have enough money for a nice funeral.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has Whoreangelina ever met a child she didn\'t want to torture or abuse? Methinks not, but let\'s go on the evidentiary part of the hearing and establishing what went on with this cover. I thought it was important to find out who the hell was behind it? Lo and behold, Cobain was signed with GEFFEN\'s DGC Recods. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.burntout.com/nirvana/articles/article5.html">http://www.burntout.com/nirvana/articles/article5.html</a></p>
<p>But for all that, the mood in the studio was generally upbeat. &quot;Kurt and Chris were really happy that Dave had joined the band,&quot; says Vig. &quot;They were in L.A., they\'d just signed a record deal with Geffen, they had a bit of cash, so they\'d go out and do a little partying. ,,, &quot;A couple of times I went to pick them up at the Oakwood Apartments and they had definitely turned their place into a bachelor pad. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did they say Oakwood Apartments? I recall that name. It came up in connection with Bryan Singer and child actors. Found this link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-pedophilia-epidemic-exposed-in-an-open-secret">https://www.thedailybeast.com/hollywoods-pedophilia-epidemic-exposed-in-an-open-secret</a></p>
<p>Drive over the hill into Burbank and you pass the Oakwood Apartments, a sprawling 1,100-unit haven known for housing out-of-town child actors, wannabes, and their families. I always wonder how many ghosts of dreams past must still haunt the hallways at Oakwood, where a recent Deadline Hollywood investigation discovered two registered sex offenders convicted of crimes against minors were living this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it\'s a known pedo hangout? Wonder if Cobain &amp; Co. knew this? Certainly seems they\'d been around the block a few times and should. It\'s then I took a look a look at more connections and wondered who signed the Nirvana front man in the first place? Almost fell over when I found out it was Gary Gersh. Gary Gersh was involved with DEN, the music company co-founded by Mark Collins-Rector., a convicted sex offender. First a link establshing Gersh\'s connection to DEN: Note that Beastie Boys manager John Silva is also mentioned. Pointing this out because a Voat member had a thread about a questionable Beastie Boy lyric. </p>

<h1>Ex-Capitol Boss And Beastie Boys Manager Form Internet Label</h1>
<p>On Tuesday, Gersh and Silva announced that they had become co-presidents of the den.music group, a new division of the Internet entertainment company Digital Entertainment Network (www.den.net). DEN has begun creating youth-oriented television programs for viewing on the Internet. ...</p>
<p>DEN was co-founded by Mark Collins-Rector, who launched one of the first Internet service providers, the Concentric Network, eight years ago. Software giant Microsoft is among the companies that have invested in DEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of links to the story of Mark Collins-Rector: </p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Pedophile ring” DEN was founded by an abuser, his former victim, and a well-known child actor</p>
<p>Brock Pierce, a frequent Villard subject who appeared in “The Mighty Ducks” films, was introduced to Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Shackley by “The Usual Suspects” director Bryan Singer. Collins-Rector and Shackley met in a chatroom, began dating, and moved in together when Shackley was 15 and Collins-Rector was 31. ....</p>
<p>Pedophiles will pay hundreds of dollars on eBay for child actors’ headshots</p>
<p>Mother of child actors and co-founder of the BizParentz Foundation Anne Henry explains how she and her fellow concerned parents worked backward through eBay’s purchase data to identify the most prolific buyers and sellers. To their dismay, they found that friends of youth talent manager Marty Weiss were auctioning their children’s photos to convicted sex offenders (the film includes audio of Weiss confessing to giving clients blow jobs). Bob Villard — who acted as a publicist for minors Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire — would also upload his own candid snapshots of young actors, without consulting their parents. One of Villard’s former underage victims recalled spending a weekend at his home, where he was served beers and persuaded to pose shirtless and submit to inappropriate touching. Henry said that Villard’s photo trademark was having “the children are looking up at the camera as they would be looking up at the predator in an abuse situation.”</p>

            “Pedophile ring” DEN was founded by an abuser, his former victim, and a well-known child actor
           </p>
           <p>
            Brock Pierce, a frequent Villard subject who appeared in “The Mighty Ducks” films, was introduced to Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Shackley by “The Usual Suspects” director Bryan Singer. Collins-Rector and Shackley met in a chatroom, began dating, and moved in together when Shackley was 15 and Collins-Rector was 31. ....

            Pedophiles will pay hundreds of dollars on eBay for child actors’ headshots
           </p>
           <p>
            Mother of child actors and co-founder of the BizParentz Foundation Anne Henry explains how she and her fellow concerned parents worked backward through eBay’s purchase data to identify the most prolific buyers and sellers. To their dismay, they found that friends of youth talent manager Marty Weiss were auctioning their children’s photos to convicted sex offenders (the film includes audio of Weiss confessing to giving clients blow jobs). Bob Villard — who acted as a publicist for minors Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire — would also upload his own candid snapshots of young actors, without consulting their parents. One of Villard’s former underage victims recalled spending a weekend at his home, where he was served beers and persuaded to pose shirtless and submit to inappropriate touching. Henry said that Villard’s photo trademark was having “the children are looking up at the camera as they would be looking up at the predator in an abuse situation.”

            Also, as far as the cover....it's usually the label that creates the covers, media and videos for the artist, not the artist itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is occult symbolism in most art of alubums, videos and lyrics ...because horrible people involved in the creation..that dosnt mean the artist itself is involed, although would not doubt them to be used or abused..

             Did you read the links? Maybe I didn't post the one concerning the albums creation, but it all Cobain's idea and concept. He's the one that got it made and brought it to the record company. That right there is unusual as you just stated yourself. It is the record company that does it, but not in this case. Also the record company wanted to put a sticker over the baby's genitals, but he fought to leave them exposed.

             Cobain was pure evil. Courtney isn't much better.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, she's part of the Cannibal Elite. When asked about her childhood, she said in her household that nothing was:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <h1>
              gender specific.
             </h1>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             GENDER SPECIFIC?!!!! No one used that word back then! It meant she was in on the narrative and normalizing this transgender agenda. Cobain, too, with his wearing dresses. Cobain and Love were up to their eyeballs in it. Love has been called out for being a skank/whore, but Cobain has not and he's worse than her.

            This is what the baby in the pool means to me. A metaphor for the way they see us, farm us, and treat us.
           </p>
           <p>
            The water is the "Sea Of Humanity" and we are the fishes in the sea. They bait us to do their bidding in all sorts of ways but especially with a few dollars with is something we never have enough of but they have plenty of. The carrot and the stick principle. When we chase their shiny trinkets (bread and circuses) we "take the bait" and are now "on the hook" and cannot get away/out from under their control. We are in debt, have to have makeup, the right clothes, junk food, shitty jobs, television, internet, fashion merchandise, etc....They bleed us dry.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the picture it says "nevermind" which I take to mean their perception of our "ignorant child like mentality" compared to their vast superior sophisticated knowledge and power. We "never know" whats really going on and they like it that way.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Cobain is making a parody of the way the "elite" see us and how they feel about us. I actually don't see the pedo reference to the Wikileaks email at all in this particular instance.

             I always interpreted this cover as a commentary on capitalism but in light of pizzagate, the nakedness of the baby is disturbing especially if, as mp says in another comment, Cobain fought the studio to keep it that way.  I'm pretty sure that NO ONE gets fame or opportunity unless they pass the test.

            That's how they use to teach babies to swim. What's more provocative about the cover is that the baby looks to be chasing after the "bait" of cash on a fishing line. It seems the message being conveyed has other meanings than pedophilia

            You did a nice work here, but I am not sure, if we can draw the conclusion out of this that Kurt Cobain was a pedo himself. 
maybe he knew something or was involved...somehow... in that whole scene? 
but maybe he was disgusted and did not join the club...? 
And then was killed?
           </p>
           <p>
            I always thought, that the cover of "Nevermind" was a kind of "accusation" against the materialistic world we are living in, where we are trained to run after money from the day we are born. You can see that the Dollarnote is attached to a fishing hook.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, about "Babies in pools" - I know that about 20-30 years ago it was not un-common to go swimming with little new born babys. Some young parents  thought it would be good for them.  Don't know if this still is done.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name of the boy from the cover is
            <strong>
             Spencer Elden
            </strong>
            , and 20 years later he recreated the cover again (now wearing shorts ;)). 
The name of the photographer was
            <strong>
             Kirk Weddle
            </strong>
            . And Spencer's Dad was called
            <strong>
             Rick Elden
            </strong>
            .  Maybe we should include these two guys in the research?

            But even if the cover was meant in the Luzzatto- way, it still could be an accusation against the pedos who are "making money with kids". 
(if pedo knowledge is implied)
           </p>
           <p>
            Cobain had his problems, drugs, depression and so on.....   and, yes, I think the band "Nirvana" was much overrated.
            <br/>
            But I do not yet see enough proof, that Cobain was a pedo.  Also "crossdressing" or being homo-  or bisexual isn't a crime. 
Or maybe he was abused himself as a boy?  And then maybe groomed into the "business"...?   (just a thought)...
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, but maybe you are right and he was a pedo.  I don't know, but  I just wanted  to point put,  that we have to be careful with accusing someone of being pedo, just because he knows the wrong people or has some psychological problems or a strange lifestyle or a bad taste in art...
           </p>
           <p>
            I always thought  that
            <strong>
             Courtney Love
            </strong>
            was the shady person in this relationship, but I don't know...
           </p>
           <p>
            What about their daughter?
            <strong>
             Frances Bean

            calls herself on Instagram and twitter "spacewitch" and   "space witch666". Ugh.

             I respect you opinions. That cover to me shouts: PEDO! Especially now that we know what we know.
            </p>
            <p>
             Courtney Love is a skank, a whore, a liar, and pretty much anything else you want to call her. However, we were groomed to believe she was the bad guy. Kurt Cobain is the real whore ... the real evil. Since this has gotten such major pushback from shills, I decided to follow up on this. I would have just left it alone as a one off, but now? No way. How do I know the pushback is from shills? Well, because the bulk of the posts I didn't get notifications about. That means I already had the pegged as shills. Yours I did get a notification about so that should tell you something.
            </p>
            <p>
             I really don't think there's anything wrong with you disagreeing about this. After all, it can only go two way: (1) I'm right about this or (2) I'm wrong about this. When I saw that article, things popped. I was like, holy shit! That cover! I'm especially glad I posted this because of what I found and what will be included in Part II. I was pretty much like you. I thought Courtney love was The Devil and Kurt was some tragic druggie that had a harpy for a wife -- one that spent all his money, but, man, was I wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             The really curious thing about what you said and the points you made are two-fold. The first is that the baby in the picture is grown up and recreated the pic. Well, good for him, but it has nothing to do with what the purpose of the shoot was. And even if he were a victim (and whether he was an unwitting victim is up in the air -- or in the water hence this debate), it's not as if victims stand up for themselves. Remember, Roman Polansk's thirteen-year-old victim forgave him.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             Does that mean we all should, too? Or does it mean that she's been under inordinate pressure being in the middle of this thing, and she's been victimized and is not necessarily thinking clearly about what happened? And, as stated above, we don't know if this baby was victimized.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second point is the normalization that's occurred since that album was produced. You give this very logical opinion of the cover in terms of what you think it means. But the fact remains that Geffen DGC Records wanted to use a sticker to cover the baby's genitals. Why do you think that is? Because usually ... photographing a baby's genitals and sharing said photo would be considered CP, but that's where ART comes in. And forget about parental consent. It's what allowed Brooke Shields to be paraded around in Hugh Hefner's Sugar n' Spice. She was TEN-YEARS-OLD, but her mother allowed it and it was ART and there was Brooke's mom allowing it to happen.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

             </p>
             <p>
              The most surprising detail to emerge after Hefner’s death was that Brooke Shields had featured in a Playboy publication called Sugar and Spice when aged only 10 years old in 1975. Photographer Gary Grosse received $450 to take the photographs of the heavily made-up Shields posing naked in a bathtub. The Sugar and Spice series of books in which the images appeared promised “surprising and sensuous images of women” from contemporary photographers, coding them as “artistic”.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So Brooke Shields survived the photoshoot and later posed for the cover of Playboy when she was twenty so was she victmized by Hugh Hefner? Was she taken advantage of? Was it right to parade her around in the nude at TEN YEARS OLD because her mom said she could and because she later did business with Hugh Hefner?

              Let us not forget the movie "Pretty Baby" where Brooke Shields, as a child, was carried around the room naked with some lace wrapped around her on a silver platter for men to bid to take her virginity. A child prostitute. What mother would allow her child to act in such a film? It's a pedophiles dream!!!!

               Oh, let's face it, Brooke Shields was on the receiving end of monumental abuse and grooming by her alcoholic mother. Nobody's really done an in-depth investigation into Terry Shields connections to see who her associates were, but they should. I'd be curious who her friends are. I do remember reading that as a teen Brooke was flown to the Middle East often. I'd like to know why. Could be she just had a lot of friends there. Could be something much worse. I feel very sorry for that girl because the authorities should have stepped in and prevented her mother from whoring her out.
              </p>
              <p>
               And the sad thing is that even when Brooke did wake up and realize what happened, a judge refused to order that those nude pics be taken down and her being given control of them. She didn't consent to them -- her mother did. Now that she's an adult she was asserting her rights, but that goddamned judge denied she had any.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. Exploited because of her beauty -- the beauty that was sexualized when she was a freakin' minor!!!

             holy crap, what if you are right that it happened to him too as a kid and he was slowly revealing it through lyrics as other people made money before and after his death, because that was plan all along? but no one planned on him covertly red-pilling a nation through songs and lyrics. david bowie is a questionable pizzagate star. cobain decided to cover the bowie song, "the man who sold the world" on the MTV unplugged series. perhaps, the MTV unplugged nirvana series triggered the group he was trying to expose, and they had him executed, because of the unexpected success? i feel as though all of us are on to something with this, but we are missing the target but are very close.

                If I could only tell you... there would never be a movie or book like it. I can’t believe I have survived it all this long. Underground, under the wire, hiding 40 years+. Can’t give you exact because it might be a give.
I spend hours each day studying this blog for clues just in case I might become free again.

            It reminds me of the Beatles Butcher Cover ( Yesterday and Today 1966) . I tried to post about that once and got a great thread about Paul being killed and replaced by Faul and all the Paul is dead rumors. deleted by M_F of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also suspicious is INXS Michael Hutchinen's pantsdown hanging and all the other dead people surrounding SIR Bob Geldorf. Every time I hear "Don't they know its Christmas Time" I cringe.

            To be really creepy, google the lyrics to Elvis Costello's song "Pills and Soap"

             Thanks and it's so funny you said that.

             I was just thinking of that cover and comparing it to NEVERMIND. What a difference a few decades make. While the Beatles had to apologize and have a redesign, the NEVERMIND album stayed and became "iconic". Iconic what? Iconic pedo collector's items?
            </p>
            <p>
             The examples you gave just means that The Cannibal Elite are rampant in the music biz. Makes me question every single person that's involved. I doubt they even let someone that isn't willing to sell their soul to The Devil now, but imagine a few years ago. Would imagine those that made money and wouldn't go along were broken. Like Whitney Houston. Probably passed lots of handlers before her, but Bobby Brown it was. Whatever button she had, he pushed and kept on pushing it.
            </p>

             Geldorf's name has come up a few times. He deserves a forum of his own, forget about a thread. Same with Geffen. And Cobain was dirty, dirty, dirty ... wish I'd known, but I do now.

              I think there is definitely an initiation required to make it big...and the ones that balk end up dead, drug addicts or in hiding. Same as Hollywood.

               Absolutely. I remember reading somewhere about the initiation. Oh, it was in a book about police and FBI investigations. They didn't say what was required, but they said the initiations involved acts that a quote good unquote person wouldn't do. And think about it, if it's illegal, they could blackmail you for that alone.

              You have to go much further back to connect the dots.... think Laurel Canyon ... late 60’s through 70’s
I can’t say much more because they have caused me to hide for over 40 years. 
Dear God let them all be exposed. They ruined my life because I said no to the wrong person.
My life and my children’s lives have been threatened and my hands are tied.
Born in the San Fernando Valley. I’ve seen too much to get away.

               Wow sounds shotty. I agree that laurel canyon is a good topic, needs more research, and this is a pretty detailed post. I listened to that Joni Mitchell song California,  with a whole new understanding....after learning about laurel canyon.  "...these people are stupid"

                Absolutely not... watered down crap to appease the minds that just don’t want to go “ there”!
Go to Illuminati News and pull up Dave McGowans pieces on inside the LC it’s four parts... every name in there has been attached to everything that has happened to me. I never was interested in Hollywood or the music industry yet .... magically... my live was taken over by their obsession with me since a small child.
Too long and scary a story... before I was born even. Who knows what links were formed in your family when their lives revolved around lodges and secret societies...

                  Better to go to conspirazzi.com because the Illuminati News has been hacked... he is an early truth teller and I looked to see what you would get and much was “wiped”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Put in Dave McGowan... inside the LC... conspirazzi.news... pdf around 226 pages.
Read it carefully and note the names... lay them against today’s news and you’ll understand my”silence”.’
I firmly believe they will all be caught/neutralized/ brought to justice with my focused intention...God knows I’ve paid enough for just growing up knowing people I had no choice except to know... neighborhoods... schools. 
I didn’t deserve what has happened and my creator knows this... the sorting out is His!

                   I want to thank you for steering me to Dave's work.  I did read what the Illuminati News still had available and then went searching here and there for the rest over the last two days.  What an eye opener.  The gut-wrenching story of Godo Paulekas...really, really tough to read...the hell that the other children must have lived through unimaginable.  So much evil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I suspect the trail will lead back to the psychopaths who conceived of and carried out Project Paperclip after WWII.  Probably the roots stretch back even longer.  I too believe that the ones who are alive now will be caught and dealt with--even that they're being neutralized behind the scenes right now.  Our collective focused intention is key to this, yes, without a doubt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   God bless the souls of the innocent children, including the one who still lives in you.

                It never ends... I am still going through it! It’ll never end until I die or the perps do. Just one moment of feeling safe would be heaven. But PTSD forever seems to be their goal... I won’t back down. 
Just to be able to tell my story would bring such relief... but I can’t, not yet.

                 Maybe you should contact Ronin Farrow and tell him about your situation.  It's worth a try. He's a Rhodes Scholar, an attorney and a respected journalist. A real journalist. The last of a dying breed.

                  All you had to say was “Rhodes Scholar”.... you don’t understand the connections.
He’s part of the problem by virtue of fellowship.

You will see. Who you think is really good can be the opposite. 
The oaths are the same... no matter what a brother does you cover for him.
I trust nobody who claims fraternal organizations by any name.
Remember this... the most important part of your resume is that little box where you are asked about your social life... what your interests are and what clubs you are in. It’s always about connections... not education or job experience!
That uneducated asshole boss that you hate working under and that new guy who passed you for that promotion? There’s your answer and no amount of hard work is going to change it... ever!

              I see this, the album cover with the Dollar Bill and the Baby similar or the same as the Doll with the Money Picture on the CPP Instagram.  If people saw that, I don't understand how they can not See The Light on CPP and Alefantis and not this Pic and Cobain,  Another Hiding In Plain Sight Message and Very Disconcerting, imo.

               You got it the first time around. It is disconcerting. Think there are a lot of people that want to bury the truth and keep it hidden.

                  They will all be as quiet as mice for they fear his wrath.  But it is of no use.  Others that are wise to it will speak out on blogs on social media, everywhere.  CDAN will come forward and the Daily Mail will follow.  Tongues will start wagging.  Yes, it is true and I believe also too late.

              you are welcome. it is courtney love on the howard stern show. so now, that means, essentially howard stern and the rest of the crew there knew about this and didn't bring it to the public's attention. also note, ted nugent is a guest on infowars all the time, and a really big part of the nra. so what does the nra and alex jones know or not know about ted nugent? what does the president know about nugent, he posed with him?

               One of the problems is that this is Courtney Love. She lies about everything. She went on this huge rant about nothing being gender specific in the household she grew up in and then pictures emerge showing the exact opposite. And didn't she say she was in juvenile detention at 12? Does she really look like she was in juvie?

                There seems to be some similarity to me.  Cobain and Love.  Cornell and Vicky.  Hmm.  What person could possibly be involved in both of these stories.  I propose it is DG.

                i agree she is whacky. i can't tell if she's messed up because of what ted did or because of what kurt did, or something else. it's just a strange link between kurt cobain and ted nugent, since ted nugent has questionable songs.

                 Neither. If Kurt was a Satanist, no doubt she's one, also. Think about it, she started talking about quote gender specific unquote items? Who the hell talked like that way back then? It's recently a narrative which means she was clued in on the normalization and narrative before anyone else which means she was working for the Cannibal Elite. Cobain also. He's a whacked out mess. And the Huffington Post wants to take down Nuget for being a staunch Repub. The thing is he's far from perfect and also whacked out. But HuffPo says this:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Instead, Nugent is embraced as some sort of down-home firebrand. He’s a redneck rock star; sex with kids is just part of the package! Sarah Palin says that if a candidate “is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!” Congressmen invite him to the State of the Union. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is attacked (in a fairly convoluted way) for associating with Ronan Farrow.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 You see, they're trying to somehow build a case for Killary by denigrating Nugent? I don't think so.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the first place, Killary is not attacked for associating with Ronan Farrow. She's attacked for associating with Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Hastert, Jeffrey Epstein, and too many others to mention.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've never heard that song so I don't know if it's tongue in cheek or what he thinks. The lyrics are disturbing if it's not meant to be making fun of someone who really is a pedo because that's pretty much how pedos think.

                  i ain't disagreeing with you at all. it's just craziness that doesn't make sense to me. kurts suspicious suicide, teds insane comments about kurt after he died, and courtney love alleging ted nugent abused her when she was younger to howard stern. this was all pre-pizzagate but sounds connected to pizzagate, after the deaths and suspicious suicides of chris cornell and chester bennignton.

                   Absolutely correct. It is connected. It's what predated what we know now.

                   This has been going on for a long time. But they didn't have everyone in place. They still don't, but they had enough to keep their butts safe -- especially in California. Bet anything goes in SF and PedoWood. Nobody's gonna do anything to a pedo that's a member of the Cannibal Elite. But everything would have been cemented in the last electioin.

                 kurt was "suicided" just like bennington and cornell. there seems to be an indicator that it may not just be a small group doing this, this is very large and may also be a mind control program where they allow the artists to finally have a normal life, but a truth is a discovered, that their wife was involved in something fucked up, and they discover that at the same time when they discovered about the this underground "satanic" network. i learned this from the movie "9th gate" by roman polanski feat johnny depp. it's a small scene, looked over. a very wealthy elite, who has everything, couldn't handle the knowledge of his wife being involved in something so fucked up so he hung himself.

                   i can't find the clips on youtube anymore, they have been hit with copyright strikes. i found a quote, that may or not be accurate, but this is what i remember. the movie starts out with a man writing a suicide letter and then hangs himself. he sells his copy of a luciferan book (which was suppose to be a gift to his wife) to a wealthy investor. later in the film, while the main character finds another version of the book, and the elite woman who owns that copy, she says something " "That creature Liana married him for his money. If he ever finds out what his wife is up to at these gatherings (of the Order of the Silver Serpent), he'll probably kill himself.""

            Alot of fighting. Hit a vein. Well just saying the people I know personally that were into him are few and are gay as fuck and one has been called out as a pedo...it's not about them. This is a great post because it's about the ALBUM COVER.  don't argue just look at the cover. It's not a code. The baby's dick is out.bthats fuct up shit, and it's his album. Mr. Kurt or Curt cobain. Mr. Guy with the album with a baby with it's dick out. Don't bother going on. Don't be brain dead anymore either. Fucking vegan excuses out. It's baby dick out is offensive say the least to a mom, but normalizing that shit here, when it's a baby dick next to a dollar, ok anymore. Braindead activity.

             I know. Definitely hit a nerve. It's why they're downvoating and keeping it off the trending page.

             It's all good because that's instant validation. I'm going to do some digging because that article said something very strange about David Groh of the Foo Fighters carrying on the "spirit" of Cobain. Now what in hell does that mean? Musically? Branding wise?
            </p>
            <p>
             Luckily, I have all the shills blocked so I'm not bothered by their bleatings. And I just found something else out about Cobain. Part II is coming up. Thank you, shills for inspiring me.

              This is pretty gross and going to afront allot of old punk rocker types. Who cares. Get the message out. Punk Rockrrs may be atheists but they are not baby fuckers or at all turned on by that photo. That photo sexualizes that innocent baby because there is a dollar next to the childs penis. What doesnt anybody understand? Just don't take it personal.  It's gonna sink in. He's dead he can't speak for himself but as of printing that material who cares what curt Conan says. Just watch your babies.

              Courtney Love, interesting too as far looking at these people, my crew was more influenced by her in Straight to Hell. And she was pregnant there too. In any case yes.  What a sick little time in music. So glad it's over. Keep shining a light on it.

                Weird how dark some of the total blatent cultural icons r. In 83  I was attracted to Boy George for his music, I was so young, I feel really stupid now, duped. When I said these people are stupid I was just repeating Q. But like boy George kidnaps and tortures people, then you go oh yeah he does kinda writel about that in his music.

                 And it is very foolish to idolize these clowns. If you want to appreciate someone's talent ... fine. And if someone does lead an exemplary life ... someone like Gandhi ... fine. But someone that wallows and lives in the deepest, darkest part of the swamp? Nope!!!! Not anymore.

                   There'll be more about it if this amounts to anything. I believe Q is just bouncing off the threat that some group of other was stepping up in attacks on Christmas. I know there was one such attack thwarted in California ... at a pier. Hopefully, everything will be kept under control and no one will be hurt. But arrested? Okay, I could go for some arrests. It would be lovely seeing Killary, Pedosta, and JA wearing orange jumpsuits.

             Cobain was obviously degenerate trash -- idk why she didn't mention his personal connection to his idol the faggot beatnik druggie and suspected CIA man: William s Burroughs.  Oh it's because she always misses the most consequential leads, and apparently YOU are wrong even when you're right.

            I think Kurt was f-ed up and bi-sexual, and likely hung around sickos, as does anyone in the industry who does drugs, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was a pedo.

             This is a classic example of why the Cannibal Elite use star power. People are so enamored with these people who possess this X factor that all logic falls by the wayside. But on the other hand, I know the feeling. I had to be redpilled, but I will never turn my back on evidence again. I won't necessarily believe everything, mind you, but it'll stay archived in my brain for later use.

              Idolize him? meh, I rarely listen to Nirvana. Rejecting everything? Lol no, not even remtoely accurate - I just wholeheartedly reject any accusations that Kurt was a pedo. We don't have to argue about it, I'm in no mood to do so - I am confident enough in my own research, to flat out call this bullshit and move on, without it being a matter of idolization or rejecting something which you think I can't handle.

              If a baby in a pool is what you want to focus on, that's your prerogative. I mean no offense or hostility towards you, but, again, this is bullshit.

                Oh I get that, really I do. I've often pinged you to my research, I've no beef with you :)

               <p>
                Honestly though, I'm still sitting here saying that I have no reason to believe Kurt was a pedophile or an enabler thereof. I have my reasons and research, which many are incidentally attacking on an ad hominem basis - typical and even a little ironic given the subject matter, but, oh well... still plenty more to come and the petty efforts against me are of no major concern.

                 its not against you, but the evidence that MP has presented doesn't warrant attacking her post. I think her evidence is compelling.

                  I meant no personal attack, just a conflict of opinion based on previous and ongoing research. Others are definitely trying to target me, though. I dunno if that necessarily includes MP, but she(?) has decided I must be a shill, which is a shame, but, 'tis what it is...

              Would his journal lead you to believe he was an alcoholic drug addict? Or that he was a cross dresser? Here. He admitted it himself:

               MM: Why did you wear a dress in the new video for "In Bloom"?
              </p>
              <p>
               KURT: I really don�t know why. I like to wear dresses because they�re comfortable. If I could wear a sheet, I would. I don�t know what to say � if I said we do it to be subversive then that would be a load of shit, because men in bands wearing dresses isn�t controversial anymore.

              Yup, in with the normalization. Where in the journal does he talk about wearing dresses?
