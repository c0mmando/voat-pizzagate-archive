<p>Laws governing pedophilia are being scrutinzed in our country and internationally.  There is a hotbed of activity going on, and we are not hearing a thing about it.  It looks extremely grim.  The purpose of this post is only to focus on Letourneau\'s involvement in this entire mess and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>On 11/01/13 A Brief of Appellees was filed in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court holding that PA\'s Sex Offender Registration Act (SORNA) was unconstitutional as it applies to juveniles.</p>
<p>Prior to 2012, children convicted of sex offenses in PA were not required to register as sex offenders.  With the adoption of SORNA, PA now requires children adjudicated of certain sexual offenses to register as sex offenders for the rest of their lives.  Appellees successfully challenged the constitutionality of SORNA as applied to children.</p>
<p>This case was before the Court as a matter of exclusive jurisdiction on appeal from an Order of the Court of Common Pleas in York County, PA, Juvenile Division.  The Trial Court held PA\'s SORNA statute unconstitutional as applied to children, both retroactively and prosepctively.  Appellees were adjuducated delinquent for qualifying offenses when they were children and retroactively registered as sex offenders under SORNA.</p>
<p>Enetr Elizabeth Letourneau whose name and &quot;expert&quot; opinions are all over this brief.  It is obvious that her &quot;expertise&quot; and God knows what else influenced the change in laws and will continue to do so in the forseeable future.  What she had to say will more than make your stomach turn.  Here is a preview:</p>
<p>&quot;As is all too common with juvenile sex offenders, lives have been marred by tragedies, traumas, addictions, abuse, and personal victimization.  Fortunately, as is also common with juvenile offenders, they have demonstrated a great capacity and willingness to rehabilitate and make better lives for themselves.  While the Commonwealth\'s Statement of the Case offers stipulated information about Appellees and the case\'s procedural history, it falls woefully short of setting forth the full range of undisputed facts in evidence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Children who commit sex offenses are different from their adult counterparts.  The belief that \'sex offenders are a very unique type of criminal\' is false as to juveniles.  Unlike adult offenders, children\'s motivations are rarely sexual in nature.  Rather, children \'tend to offend based on impulsivity and sexual curiosity...\' With maturation, a better understanding of sexuality, and decreased impulsivity, most of these behaviors stop.&quot;

<p>As a result of ongoing legislation, on 08/16/16 a PA law was passed stating that two or more sexual convictions must stem from multiple acts to trigger lifetime registration requirements.  This doesn\'t single out just juveniles and children.  It looks all encompassing.  Plus, the same general ruling was made with respect to the &quot;two or more convictions&quot; language included in Megan\'s Law II (pre-SORNA).

<p>Lastly, on 10/31/17 the PA Superior Court ruled that the methodology or &quot;framework&quot; used to designate individuals as Sexually Violent Predators (SVP\'s) under the State\'s SORNA laws was unconstitutional.

<p>The same arguments used to convince society to embrace homosexuality are now being used to normalize pedophilia.  The situation is a million times worse than what we thought.  The world is corrupt.  The world is evil.   Let us hang on to our goodness and spiritual beliefs that so many of us have here on this forum.  It will benefit us in the longrun.</p>',

            I do think that juvenile offenders should be treated differently. Some have themselves been victimized and are "acting out" their trauma. With the right care, they can be rehabilitated. They should be treated on a case-by-case basis. I agree with the rest of this post.

             .  I believe that no infant is born evil.  A juvenile becomes an offender based as a result of their home (or lack of) environment.  The external causes for a juvenile committing heinous crrimes have to be horrific, aside from the rare occurrence of a specific diagnosed organic neurological disorder/disease that could predispose a person to possibly commit such crimes.  Ruling out a  medical-pathological condition, the key players involved in the child's upbringing should be held accountable.  I would swear on a stack of bibles that not one single heinous crime-committing juvenile had a home-life that would even be considered below average.
            </p>

             What is happening now is endorsement of pedophilia based on junk science used to convince the masses that these academics are trying to prevent it.  The wool is being pulled over the eyes of many.

              Yeah, I don't have Twitter.  Someone should send her the FBI pedo symbols and ask her if she knows what they are.  She is another False Flag. Another Fake Defender.

            Let's not forget that it began with heterosexuals. The City of London sponsored "hippy" movement pushing drugs and "free love" corrupted an entire generation. Just look at the damage Devilina Jolie has left in her wake. Adultery, out of wedlock kids, and promoting 3rd world "trafficking" orphanages. The children always suffer.

             I was part of that generation and enjoyed every minute of it in a middle class family, a busy neighborhood, good public schools, part-time job at 15, and furthered my education on my own.  No matter what generation you experience, it comes down to values that you learn at home, at school, and at church.  Values provide you with the strength and fortitude to make more right decisions than wrong ones.

               That is true, and that is what our world has become.  Government, MSM, and Hollywood are to blame. 
People have become immune to a good, decent life.  The changes over the past 15 or so years have been drastic.  I did not really start noticing how screwed-up everything was becoming until about 8 or 9 years ago.  I had no idea it was this bad.  These past 15 months have been an unbelievable experience.

            Thus far, I have been unable to find a connection between Elizabeth J. (Looks like that is what her middle initial is) and Mary Kay Letourneau.  There are a ton of Letourneau's out there.  Personal info on Elizabeth is essentially non-existent.  I can't even find her CV which is odd based on her position, the clout she carries, and her numerous academic publications.  Here is a small tidbit about her education.

           </p>
           <p>
            Mary Kay Letourneau's surname is from her first husband, Stephen Letourneau.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unable to determine if Elizabeth is even married or ever was.

            Wow 13Buddha, great post! I'm flairing this "Important". Maybe Ginsberg will go on to her final reward and we'll be able to get another conservative Justice on the SC to protect against this. Something to pray for.
