<p>SPOTTED at Tony Podesta’s house last night for his birthday party: British ambassador Sir Kim and Lady Darroch with private secretary to the queen Sir Christopher Geidt, former Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Miguel Basáñez Ebergenyi, Italian Ambassador to the U.S. Armando Varricchio, Septime Webre, Chris and Lorraine Wallace, Justin Smith, Jay Newton-Small, Ward Sloane, Phillips collection director Dorothy Kosinski, Melissa Moss and Jonathan Silver, Margaret Carlson, Kevin Sullivan and Mary Morgan, Sachiko Kuno, Sandy Ain. Pic of Tony with fellow birthday boy James Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong and their massive cake </p>
<p>Here\'s  a pic of Tony and James  from that magazine article - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/HFm3mp.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/HFm3mp.jpg</a></p>
<p>Here\'s a pic of James setting up the cake (from his Instagram) - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ossGyc.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/ossGyc.jpg</a></p>
<p>Here\'s a close up of the cake along with a comment from James saying &quot;Family birthday tradition&quot; -  <a href="https://i.sli.mg/nzRPEB.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/nzRPEB.jpg</a></p>
<p>Ok that cake is fucked up.  We all know it looks like a baby\'s willy.  Or a very cold guy\'s willie.  Or a micro-willy.  Or the willy of a classical sculpture back when they thought small willies were better. </p>
<p>Whatev, it\'s a very strange willy and it\'s their freaking  birthday cake.  I can\'t read the blurbitt comments if anyone has the original, maybe it can explain this embarassing willy cake.  Anyway, it\'s strange - family tradition?  Are James and Tony Family?  Tony\'s mother was greek (Kokoris) and Alefantis is a greek name.  Is that what he means?</p>
<p>And here is another birthday they shared, I presume from last year - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/7ERolV.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/7ERolV.jpg</a></p>
<p>There\'s Tony with his spiffy red handkerchief to match his usual spiffy red shoes.    It\'s obviously the same event where this took place - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/9GZxYI.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/9GZxYI.jpg</a></p>

            What is that Helen Keller style cake? Not the phallis, the one that looks like a drip sand castle. I have a theory, but I'd like to know if there is a better explanation.

            Creepy cake is creepy...uncircumsized? Odd for Jews. (just sayin', cause Jews genitally mutilate their boys). *so do others but observant Jews always as far as I know.

             Who are you saying is Jewish?  The Podestas are Italian Jesuits (although we know they're actually Satanists or some shit).  At least that's what I heard.

At closer inspection it certainly looks that way (there seems to be a horizontal fold in the middle).

            WTF! No sane person probably will believe that without seeing this with their own eyes and verifying the Wikileaks source.
