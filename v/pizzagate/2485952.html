<p>Zsusanna Budapest’s family had escaped from Hungaryafter the uprising against the Soviets in the 1950s. Z, as she later came to be known, had been one of the teenagers throwing rocks at Soviet tanks. In 1971, after studying and thinking about religion for many years, Z collected some friends and began holding Sabbats for women only in Los Angeles. At the winter solstice in 1971, she founded the Susan B. Anthony #1 Coven, named after the leader of the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
<p>Word of mouth quickly drew more participants, and the group was moved to the beach, but there it drew too many onlookers, and so moved to a mountaintop in Malibu. For ten years, Z led sabbats and full-moon circles, teaching women to connect with the Goddess through Mother Nature. Among Budapest’s pupils were Starhawk, Ruth Barrett, and Cerridwen Fallingstar. Budapest also opened a shop, The Feminist Wicca, in Venice, and self-published a book that became a basic text of Dianic Wicca, The Feminist Book of Light and Shadows. It was later expanded and published in two volumes as The Holy Book of Women’s Mysteries.&quot;</p>

            Still looking for more links with Zsuzsanna Budapest. Found this Abramovic-style tidbit:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Some of her ceremonies were essentially recreations of the shamanistic rituals of old Europe, and some of them have been quite contentious: she has conducted ceremonies where aborted foetuses were offered to the Goddess (which she argued was a way of reclaiming abortion from patriarchy), and she has occasionally used menstrual blood or animal blood obtained from butchers in her magical ceremonies."
           </p>
           <p>
            Where does one get aborted foetuses?

             It's just a rumor without evidence, but the Susan B. Anthony coven seems like a likely candidate as the west coast coven Larry Nichols alleged that she visited back in Arkansas days. Of course, west coast doesn't have to be California; also it could be some lesser known coven.
            </p>
            <p>
             What's notable about this coven is their anti-male views and willingness to resort to black magic of some sort.

            I have seen this before this alleged wiccan retreat Bill referenced one time. My take on this is that Hillary was simply paying homage to another lesbian cult and maybe recruiting or grooming for her own because she belongs to a much higher up organization of sister 'witches' that date back to the puritan days and beyond claiming what lineage she has and the group she belongs to is involved in MAJOR world espionage acts outlined by
            <a href="http://www.abeldanger.org/">
             Able Danger
            </a>
            here:
            <a href="http://www.abeldanger.org/">
             http://www.abeldanger.org/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Able Danger CONTENDS that his sister Kristine Marcy turned the Con Air network into an international crime scene spoilage and espionage outfit that supplies PRISON CRIMINALS as mercenaries and conducts deep state operations using the TOR network and the presidents (at the time obama) red switch emergency channels that also places REAL TIME BETS ON INTERNATIONAL TRAGEDIES for the elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do believe Hillary Clinton saw and sees herself as the risen Isis and was devastated and shocked like the witch crone when she lost, the deep state is not done causing it's havoc.

             Abel Danger is kind of out there, interesting, but extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Anyway you link to the main page, I could find anything about Clinton's witch lineage specifically.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my opinion, Wicca is a bit of a scam, mostly 'revived' by one Gerald Gardner, who was initiated into the OTO by Crowley. I found an occult source that claims 80% of Gardner's early Wicca was actually Crowley's OTO rituals:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Doreen Valiente, an early collaborator of Gardner, would later write that she had a confrontation with him about the use of Crowley material in Gardner’s Book of Shadows:
            </p>
            <p>
             He explained this to me by saying, firstly, that as the holder of a Charter from Crowley himself to operate a Lodge of the OTO, he was entitled to use it; secondly, that
             <em>
              the rituals he had received from the old coven were very fragmentary
             </em>
             and that in order to make them workable he had been compelled to supplement them with other material. He had felt that Crowley’s writings, modern though they were, breathed the very spirit of paganism and were expressed in splendid poetry."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In their study of the early witchcraft movement Wicca: Magickal Beginnings David Rankine &amp; Sorita D’Este show conclusively that much of Gardner’s original Book of Shadows was derived from Crowleyan and O.T.O. sources, particularly the Gnostic Mass. For example, the ritual of Drawing Down the Moon, written in 1949, contains these lines spoken by the Magus:" ...gives examples I'm not going to quote.

             "There are innumerable other excerpts from Crowley’s works included within Gerald Gardner’s other early rituals, particularly initiation rituals; so it appears clear that when Gardner was first formulating these rituals of his early witchcraft movement, the influence of Crowley and O.T.O. was a considerable one. O.T.O. scholar Bill Heidrick has alleged that as much as 80% of the text of Gardner’s early witchcraft rituals may have been derived from Crowley’s writings."

             So I'm dubious about Clinton's lineage all the way back to Salem, but who knows. Zsuzsanna Budapest of the cult I mentioned claims lineage from old Hungarian witches (she also claims 'immaculate conception').
