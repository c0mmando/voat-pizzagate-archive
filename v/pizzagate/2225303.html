<p>&quot;<strong>Not Shown On TV - The Strangest Tie In Of All Time</strong>
&quot;</p>
<p>Back in the 80\'s, there was a very powerful record executive. He was part of the day to day group of people managing the careers of this Spanish speaking boy band. He was also the first in that group of people who said the boy band members should be rotated frequently. Why? There was the story for public consumption and then there was the truth. The men all liked having sex with teen boys and rotating them kept them fresh and also kept them on edge when they would be leaving. It was during this time period that the executive started working on some soundtracks for movies. </p>
<p>At the label where he worked, he had to do more than deal with the boy band and rape their members. The label had been big in Old Hollywood with soundtracks but was not having much success in the 80\'s One notable exception was a soundtrack from one of their own artists who was also making a movie. Anyway, shortly after that movie came out, our executive was talking to movie producers and seeing how this label could be a part of their movie. At a party he was introduced to this actor who was foreign born. He had just started making his second movie after starring on a television show for tweens. Our actor would go on to be A list and was a definite heartthrob of the decade. At this party, the movie producer offered up the actor to the record executive. Apparently the two had sex. How do we know they had sex? Well, a few years later, this record executive made the news in a very big way. Not the way he probably would have hoped. His wife probably hoped not to make the news in that way either. The husband and wife are pretty big again this fall. </p>
<p>Anyway, when the big news happened, our actor said to more than one person that he had hooked up with the record executive in a cabana next to the pool at the movie producer\'s house. Oh, and that movie producer who is permanently A+ list was passing off this actor when the actor was 14 or 15. Yeah, and also having raping him on an almost daily basis.</p>

            Being "famous" nowadays is more about how much torture you can take, how much dick you can swallow, and how much you can act like you're enjoying it all.

              a VERY popular Band of the 70ties...  they came from Scotland and were wearing checkered clothes and all teenage girls of the 70ties loved them... well, nearly... .
Tam Paton was their Manager. He had a mansion, which was torn down few years ago, after his death, because they thought, no one would like to buy a house with THAT history. (just like Savile's penthouse, also has been torn down )

Imagine titles like TMNT, Gumby and A-titles from MGM, being duplicated along side Debbie does Dallas, Swedish Erotica #29 and Porn of all flavors. We'd go into stealth mode with alternate feeds into the monitors for the untrained eye and tours.

            These guys were fully vilified in the msm because they were spending money ect...THEY WERE FREE FOR THE FIRST TIMES IN THEIR LIVES....Their parents being dead reminds me of the joke about the lawyer at the bottom of the ocean being a GOOD START....Keep em coming! Anyone that can do such horrific things is NO PARENT!! The mother may have been an abuser or may not but she still enabled the dad so she is just as bad! Good riddance abusive scum!

            I was fascinated with the Menendez brothers' trial and watched pretty much the entire trial on Court TV.  I didn't know anything back then about the level of evil that exists in Hollywood, but I felt empathy for those brothers and could not understand why.  After all, they murdered their own parents.  I believed they had been through something very dark, though, at the time.  This would certainly explain it.

            Start a campaign to Ricky Martin asking him to come forward with his rape by Jose Menendez... Ricky is already gay and this will not hurt him to come forward. The Menendez brothers need to be FREE! They could lead us to other abusers in the record industry.

             It might explain why they murdered their parents, but doesn't excuse the fact that they did it. However, your idea is good because it might help raise awareness of what's really going on in the world. If people aren't aware of the abuse happening, the abusers will continue to get away with it.

             Worse, rumors are at that level and in the music industry the brothers were passed around to many others in orgies from before they were toddlers. Assuming their mother didn't ever try to protect them.

            I did a little research on the Bros. and came to the conclusion that they had no choice and this is a personal feeling, that their father was probably still sodomizing them when they committed the murders and also at one point one of the Bros. said the mother was abusing him too.  This was never brought out in the trial.  Think about it, this disgusting father (I hate to even call him that) was not sodomizing these boys once a week, probably many times a day.  It is not only about the sex, it is about having the power and control over the person.  What a mean piece of vermin scumbag Jose Menendez was and so was his wife Kitty.

             <em>
              During the trial, the brothers claimed that the murders stemmed from years of sexual and psychological abuse that they had suffered at the hands of their parents. The juries deadlocked in both trials, but in their retrials, the juries both rejected the defense's claim. The brothers were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

              Would you like me to link one of the many videos explaining the realities of the music industry? It's a lot more brutal than what you've described. The equivalent of being gang raped on repeated occasions, in front of TPTB who are watching, and realizing you are being filmed the entire time for potential later blackmail. It's never being able to say "no" anytime TPTB ask for you.
             </p>

              Then it's being used as a drug courier and a "porta-pottie" in the Mid East to investors, or whomever else in the world wants to pay to degrade you. Notice how many singers have tattoos? It's a way to control the pain.
             </p>
             <p>
              None of the above is the worst you'll experience either. Recall why Justin Beiber insisted on walking out on his planned tour dates. "He didn't like some of the rituals."

               A lot of people on Voat are pretty red pilled already and know,  or at this point, a lot of us can guess.

               You need to work on Middle America....and those guys are not on Voat because they're too busy watching Kardashians or being brain washed in some way

                  lol I thought thats what voat was all about.  I am just copying what others do, pretending to know what I am doing!  I know there is horrible stuff here in UK and I hope the dominos fall here too with BIG connections to USA.  I just love the way the USA deals with things like this quickly, here the judicial system does things behind closed doors, maybe after many years, the quietly let them go when everyone has forgotten all about it.  VERY SAD.  Looking forward to the Epstein connection since PrinceAndrew was 'cleared' of any charges.....for now! imo - I remain hopeful that justice will be done.

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZpmRcS9MDI">
                     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZpmRcS9MDI
                    </a>
                    When this happened I remember people laughing about it, but knowing about pizzagate now, this could literally be a youth trying to escape, I remember there were rumours by one of the male staff that there was raping going on there. shame I wonder what happened to him. Muuuuust sleep now though. Night :) -

                     What about the man that was "found" in the Queen's bedroom decades ago? Was he the Queens lover or some guy trying to escape a Buck Palace satanic ceremony and found himself in her bedroom by mistake?

              Remember how I got on to the Menend -
              <s>
               oh fuck it. I'll just pop a couple of links here but I really am not trying to poach.
              </s>
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               <em>
                On second thought, they need cleaning up before being linked here
               </em>
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              (I was made aware of the Menendez case when I heard about the tv series you mentioned here, weeks(?) ago, peculiarities were noticed with regards to hurricane naming and that of Jose and 'Kitty', botched trials and appeals, etc... in short, I was talking about how I felt that the Menendez brothers were telling the truth when they say they were driven to murder after a lifetime of abuse)

            Makes you wonder just how many of the young entertainers  became gay because of going through this stuff
           </p>
           <p>
            Or how many get themselves beards to cover their gayness
           </p>
           <p>
            Lou Pearlman, manager of many boy bands, was notorious for this
           </p>
           <p>
            Thinking, Lance Bass,  Neil Patrick Harris ( Doogie Howser),  Mitchell Anderson ( also Doogie Howser) Ricky already mentioned
           </p>
           <p>
            Think I'll add this to the look up list
           </p>
           <p>
            Also want to point out, a lot of the kids in MTV shows have died of drug overdoses
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing on the list

             Many have already been sexually, physically and/or emotionally abused before hitting the casting couch. Others are well aware of their gay or bi nature. However being a "passed around toy" as a child and subjected to sadistic, physically painful and damaging power games is a whole different situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Heroin is often used to mentally block everything out. Then the child is in a more difficult predicament as drug addiction destroys one's physical appearance. Hence the demand for a continual supply of fresh, new victims.
