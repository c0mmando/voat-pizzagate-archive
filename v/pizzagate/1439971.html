            look I really don't know much about Judaism, but it seems to me like you're jumping to conclusions by saying "this subverse is compromised and they're censoring us". the wikipedia article YOU cited specifically says the following:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The supposed torture and human sacrifice alleged in the blood libels run contrary to the teachings of Judaism.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            yet you continue to essentially imply this is a practice that many of the Jewish faith engage in. from an outsiders point of view (I'm not a mod or anything like that, just a dude who has been the following this since the story broke, and came over here after the original subreddit closed, trying to contribute where I can) it seems to me that the reason your posts are getting deleted is because you're making implications that all members of a major religious faith are into this shit. I understand you feel that this is simply censorship of the truth due to non-political correctness, but you need to keep in mind that clearly not everyone who is jewish supports this stuff, and that this is a large crowdsourced investigation which I'm sure many jews are part of, which they have as much of a right to be as I do (raised hindu, now consider myself buddhist). Do you see the problem now?

            Quit trying to muddy the waters of this investigation. I'm more convinced that you're posting this stuff just to make our community look bad while also scaring away new people. Post this stuff in the conspiracy subverse if you want to discuss it
