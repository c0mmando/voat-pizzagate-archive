<p>Watch as <strong>Jason Mamoa</strong>, star of the <em>occult</em> <strong>DC Comics Annunaki</strong> production of <strong>AQUAMAN</strong>, as he  gropes a young Hawaiian female who <strong>OBVIOUSLY gets  very upset.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/m0GGvgcCJg4">Jason Momoa Caught fondling Young Girl  [pizzagate]</a></p>
<p>Like <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, these men think they can just get away with this behavior with cameras rolling, <strong><em>now that\'s some audacity.</em></strong></p>
<p>Ah but look who his best buddy is here in this video as well, <strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong>.  Of course we know that he married Lenny\'s ex <strong>Lisa Bonet</strong> of <strong>The Cosby Show</strong> fame so I find it quite odd that they can hang out like they do. It is also ironic that <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> from <strong>Eyes Wide Shut</strong> stars as Mamoa\'s <strong>mother in Aquaman.</strong> </p>
<p>And, as we all found out from a previous article I wrote that <strong>Lenny</strong> is involved in <strong>PIZZAGATE</strong> from many different angles, <em>least of all being his out of the way tropical paradise in</em> <strong>Eleuthera, Bahamas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eyes Wide Shut Are Open; Antony and Nicole Kidman, Kravitz, Zampolli and MK-Ultra Sex Slavery; Maccoby, Comet Ping Pong</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mamoa</strong> seems to certainly live up to his <strong>Annunaki</strong> and bad boy counterparts, on November 15, 2008, Mamoa was slashed in the face with a broken beer glass by a man during an altercation at the <strong>Birds Cafe</strong>, a tavern in Hollywood, almost taking out his left eye (Osiris one eye symbolism) where he still has a scar in the left eyebrow. In 2011 he was accused of making light of his characters ability to rape women indiscriminately on his role in <strong>Game of Thrones.</strong></p>
<p>Noone else thinks that it is odd that all these superhero and comic based movies like Aquaman, The Black Panther, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, The Avengers, The Justice League are all selling the Annunaki god and goddess programming?</p>
<p><strong>There are common threads and themes that connect all of these personages and the ubiquitous element in all of this is PAGAN GOD WORSHIP and the activities that encompass and surround that aura of activity.</strong> These people are all to be watched in their little water playgrounds like the <strong>Bahamas, Caribbean and Epstein\'s Virgin Islands.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>They are centers for MK-Ultra indoctrination, shock therapy and sex slavery.</strong></p>

Don't any of you have children? Don't any of you hold them when you're emotional? On top of that, I'm an islander too, I have cousins and family with massive hands, lol.

             Make some fucking sense first of all and just because my initial premise was wrong about this particular incident and video doe NOT mean Momoa is not a creeper, in fact the other blinds from Crazy Days and Nights implies that he cheats on his wife any time he gets who knows what he is capable of or what will be coming out in the future. This also does not discount the research following the mistaken presumption, which is as valid as anything else.

              Sorry, A Solo, I didn't address the other things because I largely agreed with them. I thought it was clear on my note of showing affection to children that I was referring to the video, and not necessarily what you said about it, but the commenters here with
              <em>
               "Wow that video footage is the nail in his coffin. You can’t deny that."
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              When you demand me to
              <em>
               "make some fucking sense"
              </em>
              , I'm only tempted to see the kind of accusing temper I was referring to. I didn't mean to rile you up. There's a lot of body language interpretations of celebrities and public figures lately, and while I'm completely on board with Joe Biden as the vilest filth alive, even before getting caught by a hot mic, I've also been around enough PR stuff to know how easy it is to perceive ill intentions when you're looking for it. There was nothing
              <em>
               "OBVIOUS"
              </em>
              about her getting groped &amp; upset, and cultural differences in Hawaii, Tonga, Samoa, NZ are very much worth keeping in mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              It goes without saying; we don't know he
              <em>
               isn't
              </em>
              a creeper, sure, and this applies to everybody else, including you &amp; me. This obviously isn't a good line of defense. While CDAN is probably right about him having affairs, I've also heard his wife is a crazy dominant drunk who referred to their status as an "open marriage". Believe the worst of his infidelity, it's still a catastrophising step towards child molesting paedophilia. Personally, I think so is conflating the interest in fictional super heroes with
              <em>
               "PAGAN GOD WORSHIPPING"
              </em>
              . The problem with trusting CDAN is that, by your own admission of corrupt superhero comic actors, you have to contend with Robert Downey Jr. being one of the biggest informers of CDAN's worst Hollywood stories. Scandals are everywhere, but there are plenty of good people, according to him. Please don't take this the wrong way, I mean the utmost respect and just wanted to clarify the context of my post. There's a lot to be explored around executive agenda in Aquaman and Annunaki influence in pop culture, and I didn't mean to take away that.

               See, there we go, we got you to be more concise and explain yourself instead of a one paragraph quip that would illicit such a comment from me. Here I get to see your motivations and reasons for such a base statement. I have a very short temper for people that don't explain themselves and your detailed input might have curtailed that reaction. I enjoy putting time into my work and explaining my position if you would have done so initially we could have gotten somewhere with a conversation like we are doing now. That's all I ask for is putting some time into your responses and I'm sorry if your short answer fired me off. If you would have taken the time to explain then maybe I would have caught on quicker that it was his daughter lol. It's all good thanks for the contribution.

                My bad, man. I totally respect you for that, and especially appreciate your honest response. To be frank, I've lost my cool many times and I'd be going crazy over this sick stuff if I ever stayed here much longer. At least people like you are always honest. I'll do better next time. I don't hold anything against you. Peace!

            I appreciate your update to this post. To be honest, when I saw this I didn't believe what I was being told about it. The only thing that irks me though, is in his daughter's movement away from him, he looks to the cameras, not to his daughter. I think if i had my arm on the shoulders of a child and they pushed my hand away I would instinctively look down to see whats up. Perhaps that's just me.

            I also notice that for many the video link is broken, please excuse me for this as well, see I cannot even see it after it posts on the PC I am using, for some reason the link and the text just disappear off the template page once it's posted and I cannot figure out what is going  on it so I don't even know if it posted until I look at my phone where it does work, so I really don't know what the problem is there.

            PLEAE READ EVERYBODY:  I don't usually scream out in caps at the beginning of my comments, but I dug deeper into this.  Look at the actual uncut footage:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Ntg58uKvc">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Ntg58uKvc
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They are his kids, the one on the left is a boy, when you see if uncut you can see he's more touching their stomachs, and you can see that the girl actually doesn't get upset but moves in to ask him a question, which is what causes what we see in the edited clip which is where is looks like he's moving even closer to her nipple.
           </p>
           <p>
            everyone here knows I do NOT excuse pedos.  Please watch the full video.  I'm pretty sure this is innocent.

             Aha. I do see. My mistake my initial perception was wrong, I didn't realize it was his daughter.

             It does seem like it would be more of a fatherly gesture however too personal it might be, that in itself does raise the question but I do admit my original premise is shot. It is a decent enough segue into the material covered but thank you for bringing this to my attention.

              no worries, I was totally creeped out when I saw the video you posted.  The way it was cut made it look nefarious.  The full clip shows the truth.  I do think the touching is a tiny bit weird, but they were standing there for a long time, he was holding them close, maybe even to protect them, and she's probably not hit puberty yet, and he's so tall he doesn't know exactly where he's touching, or he might think he was a little lower on her stomach.  he seems really caught up in the emotion of what they are watching, as he's crying in the end; he may have been holding them close cuz he was getting teary eyed.

              , since your headline can't be edited, I have to remove this per Rules 1, 2 and 3. We can't be spreading fake news; it'll undermine our legit findings.

                Actually, this has been up long enough that I think we'd better flair it Debunked and leave it up. That way we'll be on record as getting to the truth. Thanks for editing in your updated view of the situation.

            Can't see the video.

           <p>
            But the one where he's openly molesting two little girls, allegedly his own daughters, I'm sickened by the Twitter comments that "it's a father expressing love", "he's in a state of bliss over the cultural stuff going on around him and he's showing that love to his children".  Um, that look on his fucking face while fondling his (alleged) daughter is that of a PEDOPHILE.
           </p>
           <p>
            The males in my family will only rest their wrists on niece/granddaughter shoulders, with their arms and hands positioned in such a way to not make them uncomfortable.
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy is an A-grade pedo.
           </p>
           <p>
            It being excused as some creep showing affection to his kids is WHY there is so much rampant pedophilia and sexual abuse against kids by their dads, step-dads, uncles, family friends, ETC.

            That's awful. And sad. Why does a rich, handsome man with no trouble getting chicks have to grope innocent young girls like that? Because he can get away with it.

            Wow that video footage is the nail in his coffin. You can’t deny that. Everyone just thinks he’s the greatest thing alive right now posing for pics and autographs with this clown like he’s someone so down to earth and normal. They have no idea what these people do to get their status. This man clearly has no integrity, morals or loyalty cheating on his wife and acting the pedo in public. That little girl looked 7 years old. EVERYONE in Hollywood actors and musicians are compromised by doing evil sick shit.

             🔱 Poseidon
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Poseidon
           </p>
           <p>
            Poseidon is the violent and ill-tempered god of the sea. One of the Twelve Olympians, he was also feared as the provoker of earthquakes and worshipped as the creator of the horse. A hot-blooded deity, Poseidon had many disputes with both gods and men, most famously with Athena and Odysseus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Poseidon was the second son of Cronus and Rhea (after Hades) and their penultimate child (before Zeus). Hestia, Demeter, and Hera were his sisters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like all of his siblings aside from Zeus, Poseidon was swallowed by Cronus at birth and, thanks to Zeus, afterward disgorged unharmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ánäkes; The Hǣvenly Twins:
From Poseidon-Wanax and Zeus-Anax we also get “Anäke,” ancestral spirits worshipped in Attica and Argos, with a direct symbolic connection to Greek Mythology as heavenly twins who suckle the milk of a wolf, with associations to the moon and the planet Venus, as well as, in reference to the twin sons of Zeus. The archaic plural “Ánäkes” (Kings) is a direct reference to the “Dioscuri“ or “Hǣvenly Twins” (Castor and Pollux; “Polydeuces”), whose temple was called the “Anakeion Sanctuary,” where the Dioscuri twins were honored and celebrated annually in an ancient religious festival of the Athenians called “Anákeia.“

             I beleive these astrotheology stories that u find all actoss cultures...are similar and in their anthromoporphic rendition of constellations..the elite priesthood have programmed their version of lolita programming , incest and perversion in it...no different than the modern day preists of hollywood and their idols convey to the modern public....

             In ancient and modern times they r culture creators to farm human energy ...
The stars and idols and stellar performances in a separate galaxies milking the sea of debt privided voluntarily by the human spirit...

            Blind Items Revealed #2

            This very large married actor is probably A- list. Still waiting on the huge box office popcorn superhero movie to be released to take him completely away from the television character that made him famous, he continues to constantly cheat on his wife. Apparently he also has no problems with the person he is cheating on also being married or having a boyfriend which is causing issues.

            Speaking solely from the idea that it’s hard to imagine why they would hang out together, there are kids and exes involved, so I figure they have to at least be civil toward each other.

              Wow, A Solo, I have to defend Thorshamster here for his entirely rational comment. You can't demand that people "Get The Fuck Out" because they don't agree with you. That's not an argument. He made an argument, and I agree it's important to consider both sides of a controversy, not just one, especially if it concerns marriage and family relationships. Again, doesn't anyone else have a big family, with children, with infighting, with a need to
