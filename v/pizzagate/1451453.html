Worse than foster care: Scandal at America's most famous orphanage
Last April, I noted on this Blog an excellent series of stories in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the problems plaguing many of that state’s latter-day orphanages.   As one story reported:
           </p>
           <p>
            Fights. Sexual assaults. Consensual sex between young teens. Abuse by foster parents and group home employees. Escapes. Suicide attempts. All occur with regularity at many of Georgia's 336 private foster care agencies, the Journal-Constitution's examination found.
                But it’s not just your obscure, run-of-the-mill orphanages that are plagued with problems.  Every few years, a newspaper reveals big trouble at one of the model institutions – the very places orphanage advocates point to in support of their calls to warehouse children.
           </p>
           <pre><code>            ● In 2001, it was SOS Children’s Village in Florida.  The South Florida Sun-Sentinel revealed that between 1999 and 2001 33 reports were filed with Florida’s child abuse hotline alleging abuse of children at the 50-bed facility; 21 were "substantiated" or "indicated."  During the same time period 13 "house parents" and 14 "parent assistants" quit or were fired.  (So much for that argument you always hear from orphanage proponents about how the places provide “stability.”)
