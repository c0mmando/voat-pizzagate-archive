<p>Yes, you heard that correctly.
If abortion became illegal, the current FULL CDC childhood vaccination schedule (which HB 1312 would mandate) would be IMPOSSIBLE to fill.</p>
<p>The original vaccine was a LIVING organism. Many still are. They need a home and food to multiply, JUST LIKE YOU AND ME. The laboratory virus\' home is called a &quot;petri dish medium.&quot;  In the early \'50\'s, &quot;vaccinology&quot; was primitive, and most of the ad hoc techniques were fueled by the government\'s biowarfare department. Time was of the essence to develop certain vaccines. Originally, cells taken from the organs of African Green monkeys became the &quot;petri dish medium&quot; to grow the polio virus in.  OOPS! The cells were contaminted by numerous Simian Viruses originally thought to only infect monkeys, NOT humans. Unfortunately, SV40, one of them, was found to be CARCINOGENIC in HUMANS. If you had the sugar cube polio vaccine up to 1957, your body might harbor SV40 in tumors.</p>
<p>If you can\'t grow viruses safely in monkey cells, what can you use? Unborn baby tissue. Fibroblast cells.</p>
<p>According to leading vaccine shill and vaccine patent owner Paul Offit, who reviewed the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Varicella (chickenpox), rubella (the “R” in the MMR vaccine), hepatitis A, one version of the shingles vaccine, and one preparation of rabies vaccine are all made by growing the viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells. Fibroblast cells are the cells needed to hold skin and other connective tissue together. The fetal embryo fibroblast cells used to grow vaccine viruses were first obtained from ELECTIVE TERMINATION (emph. mine) of two pregnancies in the early 1960s. These same embryonic cells obtained from the early 1960s have continued to grow in the laboratory and are used to make vaccines today. No further sources of fetal cells are needed to make these vaccines. (Comment: THIS HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO THE PUBLIC. Cell lines evolve and change. This is why Merck is being sued by 2 of its own scientists. They claim the Jeryl Lynn mumps virus strain has evolved and weakened since it was licensed in the \'60\'s.  &quot;Former Merck Scientists Sue Merck Alleging MMR Vaccine Efficacy Fraud&quot;  <a href="https://ahrp.org/former-merck-scientists-sue-merck-alleging-mmr-vaccine-efficacy-fraud/">https://ahrp.org/former-merck-scientists-sue-merck-alleging-mmr-vaccine-efficacy-fraud/</a>)</p>
<p>The reasons that fetal cells were originally used included:</p>
<p>Viruses need cells to grow and tend to grow better in cells from humans than animals (because they infect humans).
Almost all cells die after they have divided a certain number of times; scientifically, this number is known as the Hayflick limit, and for most cell lines it is around 50 divisions; however, fetal cells can go through many more divisions before DYING. (EMPH. MINE)
As scientists studied these viruses in the lab, they found that the best cells to use were the fetal cells mentioned above. When it was time to make a vaccine, they continued growing the viruses in the cells that worked best during these earlier studies.&quot;

SOUNDS LIKE THE CELL LINES WOULD DIE OUT.</p>
<p>Vaccine King Dr. Stanley Plotkin was directly involved with working on aborted babies\' tissue to create a &quot;suitable, safe  medium&quot; to grow the viruses in.</p>

If you want to know the true history of modern vaccines, watch the 9 videos of top vaccine expert and inventor Dr. Stanley Plotkin\'s SWORN testimony. He wasn\'t expecting a 9 hour &quot;discovery&quot; under oath. Watch his expression and hand gestures. If you watch beginning to end in order, it all falls into place.

<p>&quot;Dr. Plotkin, who was an instrumental figure in the development of rubella, polio, rabies, varicella, rotavirus, anthrax, and other vaccines, traces the serendipitous beginnings of vaccinology in the 1700s to its flowering in the latter half of the 20th century. Additionally, he highlights the relationship of vaccinology to industrial and technological developments, as well as the special role of Philadelphia institutions and researchers in vaccine development. Especially interesting is a description of an exchange with Albert B. Sabin, MD, at a scientific meeting in the late 1960s, when Sabin objected to Plotkin\'s (and others\') use of cell lines derived from human fetal tissue. Plotkin replied, &quot;I must say that despite my great and sincere respect for Dr. Sabin, I think the statements he has made are strictly ex cathedra and without a factual basis. So my conclusion is that what we are dealing with here is theology, and you see, in theology it is very difficult to disprove the existence of ghosts. But this is not, to my mind, a basis for making intellectual decisions.&quot;&quot; <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/video-four-centuries-vaccinology-stanley-plotkin-md">https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/video-four-centuries-vaccinology-stanley-plotkin-md</a></p>

           <p>
            Thank you Ginger Taylor, MS for standing against a forced vaccination bill in Maine!
Ginger sent every member of the Maine Legislature this letter:
           </p>
           <p>
            Dear Representative,
           </p>
           <p>
            The religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions exist for very good reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a vaccine conversation that is upsetting for many, that must be had now.  It is a discussion that the sponsors of vaccine exemption removal bills are unlikely to even know of, and is easily dismissed as internet rumor.  I myself avoided this topic for the first 10 years of my 15 years of vaccine safety advocacy because I simply didn't want to face the reality of it.  However, the topic is central to your deliberations on the removal of the religious and philosophical exemptions proposed by LD 798.  Because some of those testifying on Wednesday will broach the subject, it is incumbent upon me to prepare you with the clinical facts at this time.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are vaccines made with, and containing, materials that are morally and religiously objectionable to many Mainers.  At the top of that list are the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have included the clinical information from the distributor on these two products in the links above.  Please review the "General Information" carefully.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am also including a video by Paul Offit of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, so that you may have confirmation on this matter from the principle vaccine industry spokesperson.
           </p>
           <p>
            These WI-38 and MRC-5 cells are used to grow viruses in, and are destroyed in the manufacturing process, however the residual human blood products (human albumin) and DNA fragments remain in the final product as delivered.  The passage of LD 798 will mandate the purchase and intake of these human derived products by Mainers who are vehemently opposed to this practice and who do not wish to do business with the industry that supplies these types of cell lines, in order to fully participate in society.  (These cell lines have a shelf-life, so research into new cell lines, such as the new WALVAX-2, is ongoing.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, there are other morally and religiously objectionable materials in vaccines that Mainers will be forced to inject to become educated Mainers.  I have attached the full CDC vaccine ingredient list for your review.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I am sure you can understand, many Mainers will find the use of bovine serum and porcine tissue religiously and ethically objectionable, and I hope you can agree that they have the right to refuse products using and containing human and animal biological material without coercion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because the MMR and Chickenpox vaccines contain all three of these substances, the purchase and injection of these objectionable materials will become required for full participation in public life.

            "M-M-R ® II 
(MEASLES, MUMPS, and RUBELLA VIRUS VACCINE LIVE) 
DESCRIPTION 
M-M-R ® II (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live) is a live virus vaccine for vaccination against measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles).
           </p>
           <p>
            M-M-R II is a sterile lyophilized preparation of (1) ATTENUVAX® (Measles Virus Vaccine Live), a more attenuated line of measles virus, derived from Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain and propagated in chick embryo cell culture; (2) MUMPSVAX® (Mumps Virus Vaccine Live), the Jeryl Lynn™ (B level) strain of mumps virus propagated in chick embryo cell culture; and (3) MERUVAX® II (Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus propagated in WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts.{1,2}
           </p>
           <p>
            The growth medium for measles and mumps is Medium 199 (a buffered salt solution containing vitamins and amino acids and supplemented with fetal bovine serum) containing SPGA (sucrose, phosphate, glutamate, and recombinant human albumin) as stabilizer and neomycin.
           </p>
           <p>
            The growth medium for rubella is Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) [a buffered salt solution containing vitamins and amino acids and supplemented with fetal bovine serum] containing recombinant human albumin and neomycin. Sorbitol and hydrolyzed gelatin stabilizer are added to the individual virus harvests.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cells, virus pools, and fetal bovine serum are all screened for the absence of adventitious agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reconstituted vaccine is for subcutaneous administration. Each 0.5 mL dose contains not less than 1,000 TCID50 (tissue culture infectious doses) of measles virus; 12,500 TCID50 of mumps virus; and 1,000 TCID50 of rubella virus. Each dose of the vaccine is calculated to contain sorbitol (14.5 mg), sodium phosphate, sucrose (1.9 mg), sodium chloride, hydrolyzed gelatin (14.5 mg), recombinant human albumin (≤0.3 mg), fetal bovine serum (&lt;1 ppm), other buffer and media ingredients and approximately 25 mcg of neomycin. The product contains no preservative."
So a central question that will be posed is:
           </p>
           <p>
            How do the sponsors of LD 798 justify removing First Amendment rights of Mainers to the free exercise of their religion by abstaining from the use of medical products made with WI-38, MRC-5, Bovine, Porcine and other objectionable materials?
           </p>
           <p>
            These are just a few of the reasons that the removal of non-medical vaccine exemptions is unacceptable.
           </p>

Wow really. I”m appalled at the ignorance on this article and the responses so here’s your example. More than 6000 people are diagnosed each year with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (that’s just one type and they are mostly children). My husband is one of them. Most of those go on to receive bone marrow transplants. Those transplant patients go through a rigorous amount of chemotherapy that essentially kills off everything within their body and their ability to fight infection such as the measles outbreak. They are unable to at that time to go on with vaccines despite your theory that people can get them whenever they want. Their bodies are not strong enough to take on the vaccines. All vaccines they had as children will be readministered after they are recovered from the transplant. Their bodies are essentially that I’ve newborn babies only much weaker. For my husband that was about a year and a half after his bone marrow transplant. That means that during that year and a half, we had to be extremely careful not to expose him to any illnesses. Because you choose not to vaccinate against things like measles are putting these patients at risk. Measles spreads very quickly because it is so highly contagious and it is lethal to immunocompromised people such as my husband. Do some research."

I feel for your husband. Think of this though. Society is not your personal gate keeper. Sorry to be harsh but I’m tired of people like you who want others to sacrifice for them.

             Immunocompromised people didn’t just smurf out of the blue in the last 20 years. There have always been people who immune systems have been weakened for one reason or another. The whole pro-vaccine agenda of vaccinating to protecting immunocompromised is just another con. Like the mythical Herd Immunity. Do you have any idea just how many COMMUNICABLE DISEASES there are that have NO vaccines for? Do some research on that. You think you’re worried now? If your husband is so medically fragile-getting a bad cold could kill him. There is no vaccine for the common cold. Norovirus- very common, more than 3 million US cases per year, spreads easily-No Vaccine. Strep throat-No vaccine. The Flu. There are over 200 flu strains in the labs at the CDC, flu shot has up to 4 and they have been wrong for the last decade. But if it makes you feel better knowing your husband is sitting next to a person vaccinated for the Flu shot-bless your heart.

             MMR tells you right on the package insert this: “Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination.”
-Journal of Microbiology: During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccinees (3). Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences (R. J. McNall, unpublished data).
Plain English, measles outbreaks were occurring among children who were already vaccinated with the measles. If you do the math, nearly 38% of the genetic sequences that were conducted on supposed “measles” cases turned out to identify measles strains that originated in the vaccines themselves. Thus, more than one out of three cases of measles in the United States was actually a reaction from a measles vaccine, not “wild-type” measles.

The measles vaccine has failed, he explained two years ago in a prescient paper, “The re-emergence of measles in developed countries.” In that paper, he warned that due to factors that most haven’t noticed, measles has come back to be a serious public health threat. Poland sees the need for a major rethink, after concluding that the current measles vaccine is unlikely to ever live up to the job expected of it: “outbreaks are occurring even in highly developed countries where vaccine access, public health infrastructure, and health literacy are not significant issues.

Thus, the vaccine strain was transmitted from the vaccinee with zoster to his sibling. Vaccinees who later develop zoster must be considered contagious.

             -Whooping Cough: The study, titled: “Acellular Pertussis vaccines protect against disease but fail to prevent infection and transmission in a nonhuman primate model,” used infant baboons to test the hypothesis that “current acellular pertussis vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission” of B. Pertussis. (there is no vaccine for Bordetella Pertussis virus)
Lead author Tod Merkel did comment to the New York Times that when exposed to B. Pertussis after recently getting vaccinated, you could be an asymptomatic carrier and infect others, saying:
            </p>
            <p>
             “When you’re newly vaccinated, you are an asymptomatic carrier, which is good for you, but not for the population.” According to Tod Merkel of the FDA, it has now become clear that the vaccine does almost nothing to prevent the spread of whooping cough. Although it does seem to prevent about 80 percent of people from showing symptoms of the disease, it does not prevent them from catching it or spreading it.
            </p>

Study: Whooping cough resurgence due to vaccinated people not knowing they’re infectious? From study/article:
“a detailed epidemiological model of whooping cough transmission to conclude that acellular vaccines may well have contributed to — even exacerbated — the recent pertussis outbreak by allowing infected individuals without symptoms to unknowingly spread pertussis multiple times in their lifetimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             ‘There could be millions of people out there with just a minor cough or no cough spreading this potentially fatal disease without knowing it,’ said Althouse. ‘The public health community should act now to better assess the true burden of pertussis infection.’
            </p>
            <p>
             What’s worse, their model shows that if the disease can be spread through vaccinated, asymptomatic individuals essentially undetected, the level of vaccination needed to protect those that are unvaccinated
(so-called ‘herd immunity’) is over 99 percent, impractically high at a time when anti-vaccine campaigns are turning people away from vaccination.

• Some vaccines are made from live viruses, which can pose a threat to the health of St. Jude patients. Visitors should not enter the hospital:
•	If they have received the oral polio or smallpox vaccine within 4 weeks; or
•	If they have rashes after receiving the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine.

It’s mind-blowing reading the CDC’s recommendations that all these fragile immunocompromised children receive all these vaccines. It becomes absolutely obvious that they only care about pushing maximum vaccines rather than looking out for the health of our people. My guess is that they want to make absolutely sure that no doctor can give a medical exemption to an immunocompromised child.

             SV40 AND THE POLIO VACCINE
            </p>
            <p>
             "SV40 was the 40th virus found in rhesus monkey kidney cells when these cells were used to make the polio vaccine. This virus contaminated both the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) created by Dr. Jonas Salk and the Oral or “Live” Polio Vaccine (OPV) created by Dr. Albert Sabin.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1961, SV40 was discovered by Dr. Bernice Eddy of the National Institute of Health, Division of Biologics when she took the material used to grow polio vaccines and injected it into hamsters. Tumors grew in the hamsters. Her discovery was subsequently validated by Drs. Maurice Hilliman and Benjamin Sweet of Merck.
            </p>
            <p>
             Upon the discovery that SV40 was an animal carcinogen that had found its way into the polio vaccines, a new federal law was passed in 1961 that required that no vaccines contain this virus. However, this law did not require that SV40 contaminated vaccines be thrown away or that the contaminated seed material (used to make all polio vaccines for the next four decades) be discarded. As a result, known SV40 contaminated vaccines were injected into children up until 1963. In addition, it has been alleged that there have been SV40-contaminated batches of oral polio vaccine administered to some children until the end of the 1990’s."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Creation of the Oral Polio Vaccine
            </p>
            <p>
             • In 1941, Drs. Francis and Mack isolated the Mahoney poliovirus “from the pooled feces of three healthy children in Cleveland.” Dr. Salk then subjected the strain to passages through fourteen living monkeys and two cultures of monkey testicular cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
             • In 1954, the strain (now called Monk14 T2) was given to Drs. Li and Schaeffer who subjected the virus to nine more passages through monkey testicular cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
             • Next, the strain (now called Monk14 T11) underwent fifteen more passages in monkey testicular cultures, eighteen passages in monkey kidney cells, two passages through the skin of living rhesus monkeys, and additional passages through African Green monkey skin and monkey kidney cell cultures. This strain was now called MS10 T43 or LS-c.
            </p>
            <p>
             • In 1956, Dr. Sabin took this virus and passaged it through seven cultures of African Green Monkey kidney cells.
            </p>
            <p>
             • That same year, the pharmaceutical company, Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme, passed the strain (now called LS-c, 2ab/KP2) through a rhesus monkey kidney cell culture.
            </p>
            <p>
             • The resulting material was called Sabin Original Merck (SOM) and was provided to Lederle in 1960 as the seed material to manufacture its polio vaccine."

              The virus was contaminated so when the Children were vaccinated was it possible that some got polio from the vaccine itself?  This would be frightening.  If this was the case, the person I know of was born around that time and probably did receive that vaccine.

               I am referring to the Rhesus monkey CELL MEDIUM the polio virus was grown in. The medium itself was infected with SV-40 which ended up in the vaccines along with the attenuated polio virus. This is a separate issue from the polio virus itself.
              </p>
              <p>
               "I began speaking and writing about monkey virus contamination of polio vaccines ten years ago when questions were raised in the medical literature about whether the use of monkeys infected with monkey viruses to produce oral polio vaccines was responsible for HIV and the AIDS epidemic. [ii] Between 1994 and 1997 I submitted several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the government regarding testing of certain lots of oral polio vaccine for monkey virus contamination.  During the course of my research I discovered that it was well known that the first polio vaccine produced in the 1950’s – the inactivated polio vaccine created by Jonas Salk – was made using rhesus monkeys that were infected with a monkey virus called simian virus 40 or SV40.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was in 1960 that an NIH scientist named Bernice Eddy discovered that rhesus monkey kidney cells used to make the Salk polio vaccine and experimental oral polio vaccines could cause cancer when injected into lab animals. Later that year the cancer-causing virus in the rhesus monkey kidney cells was identified as SV40 or simian virus 40, the 40th monkey virus to be discovered. [iii]
              </p>
              <pre><code>Sadly, the American people were not told the truth about this in 1960. The SV40 contaminated stocks of Salk polio vaccine were never withdrawn from the market but continued to be given to American children until early 1963 with full knowledge of federal health agencies. 

Between 1955 and early 1963, nearly 100 million American children had been given polio vaccine contaminated with the monkey virus, SV40. [iv]
</code></pre>
              <p>
               Today, U.S. federal health agencies admit the following two facts:
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Salk polio vaccine released for public use between 1955 and 1963 was contaminated with SV40; and
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 SV40 has been proven to cause cancer in animals.
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               In fact, at a conference on SV-40 and human cancers held by the National Institutes of Health in 1997, which I attended, there was no disagreement among both government and non-government scientists about these two facts.  The only disagreement was whether SV40 was actually being identified in the cancerous tumors of children and adults alive today and, if it was, whether the monkey virus was in fact responsible for their cancer.  Non-government scientists working in independent labs around the world said, “Yes.” But the scientists connected with the U.S. government said “No.” [v]"

                 Obviously, not everyone got cancer from it. However there were cancer cases where SV40 was fond in the tumor and the adult had had that particular polio vaccine. Cancer is almost epidemic now. We don't know how many cases may have been related to SV-40, because officially, THEY AREN'T LOOKING FOR IT. The SV-40 was enough of a recognized problem, however, for them to switch to using ABORTED human babies as a cell line growth medium source BEFORE ROE V. WADE WAS PASSED.

                  We know they have been operating experiments on people for decades, at least.  Tuskegee Henrietta Lacks, Thalidomide, so I am not surprised.  I have not had a shot, since I can't even remember. Probably the 80s. I am taking care of myself.  Have not seen a Dr. since my Integrative one couldn't see me anymore because I am now on Medicare.  Medicare frowns on Real Medicine.  I have friends taking the shingles shot after I have begged them not to.  One got a horrid case of it.  So bad she had bad rashes all over her back and horrible pains.  What did she do after months and months of getting all kinds of natural curing?  She got another shot.  I give up.  Even after vacs are down now, she is not listening.  The worst news is, she is a Nurse!  Picture me throwing up my hands now.  I hope to God she does not get cancer.  Yes, so many have cancer.  Especially Children.  Very rare when I was little.  Now you see it on the news almost nightly.  Let's face it, it is a huge moneymaker for the Medical Community.  My father who is in Rehab right now always said stay out of the hospitals.  They will kill you.  He has no choice at this point he is 92 and we know he will leave us soon.  He does not have cancer, never did.  He has dementia.

                   Yes, the aging and elderly are now big targets for vaccines. An elderly relative died within 2 weeks of getting their  flu/pneumococcal  shot. They died of flu/pneumonia. What a coincidence.....

She thinks I am talking CT when I do.  I think people just don't want to admit they did something dumb.  But then to do it again?  SMDH.

              I feel as though they already are.  I abhor them.  I was present at a birth of a girl born to a cousin and they took this baby out of the room quickly late at night to vaccinate her.  I forget what it was they gave her but an Integral Medicine Dr. told me that they are giving babies a huge amount of this vac and they don't need it.  This just plain sickened me. I happen to know that the Mother of this girl has kept her from getting vacs up until now.  The fight continues.  Thank you for your posts on this.  They are so very important.  I also knew someone with polio.  Another story.

               Its the Hep B vaccine. Instead of testing the mothers to see if they are carriers, they just inoculate every baby born unless the parent is informed and specifically tells them not to.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hep B is mainly sexually transmitted.

                Oh Thank You.  That's it!  This Dr. said they gave a huge amount totally unneeded.  Imagine those poor little babies.  Kind of reminds me of the HPV one as well.  Let's just pump them full of poison whether they need it or not.  This Dr. also said this about the HPV vac.  He said there is NO known cure for cancer.  So basically they are telling us to give this shot to Our Children and it will keep them from getting certain cancers when there is no cure for cancer.  Yup.  That about sums it up.
