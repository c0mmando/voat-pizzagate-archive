<p>Not only this, but one person is claiming that the baby defecated on the floor. <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelmillman/status/883020871220301824/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">https://twitter.com/rachelmillman/status/883020871220301824/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc</a></p>
<p>Yeah, not normal behavior. Considering the owners are saying that the child is 22 months old, you\'d think the child should know better than to do anything like this. To add to all of this, the owners are saying it\'s perfectly normal and natural for a baby to be running around a restaurant without a diaper on and those who have a problem with it shouldn\'t visit their establishment. </p>
<p>Just creepy, in my opinion. </p>
<p>Here\'s a bit about what their webpage says:

            If I had to guess we have stumbled upon more MKULTRA families.....the parents are likely rape victims and they are raising their kids the same way.  Probably pass them around at parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reminds me of when Trump won the Pedophiles all rallied at Comet and got their kids to dance on the tables.  I bet in their private rape parties they get the kids to dance on the tables naked to get the visiting VIP Satanic kid fuckers all warmed up.

            I would avoid this place like the plague. There's nothing worse than trying to eat a meal and converse and having feral children screaming and running around the place. Also, imagine ALL the fecal matter that ends up on the food you're eating if toddlers are defecating on the floor, babies are crawling over it, wait staff are cleaning it up and then not washing their hands properly.  A great way to get very sick. No thanks.

            When a kid comes up and offers his anus to an adult, what does that say?

           <p>
            An offer of an anus  is not the natural action of a human child unless  they have been taught that is something an adult would  want.

            There is nothing FORMAL about Googling and then posting here.  A FORMAL investigation is STRUCTURED and occurs in a STEP-WISE FASHION.  That DOES NOT OCCUR HERE.

            Thank you for making my point!

            Health department might have something to say about feces being in a restaurant seating area and a baby running around naked spreading it everywhere. I would imagine a health inspector could shut the place down on sight.

             Restaurant owners I know once got shut down in California for just having their kids in the back prep area, so yes this violates all sorts of code.

             And you would be wrong....before this became a big deal I would imagine the local politicans all loved this place.....probably eat lots of pizza and hotdogs there......cleaning themselves off on hankerchiefs.  Any legit health inspector would of found this place amazingly hard to serve notice on.

             <strong>
              Vegan
             </strong>

            Most vegans are liberal idiots.  The behavior you describe -- allowing their children to run "free range" -- is typical libtard behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please don't use "investigate."  This is armchair research, not "investigating."  It's a slap in the face to real investigators to have the meaning of the term watered down.  Thanks.
