<p>Breaking: Sept. 5! “New revelations from a Friday FBI document dump show a Clinton Foundation laptop containing Hillary Clinton\'s personal email server archive was &quot;lost&quot; in the mail after a staffer sent it to the former Secretary of State and current Democrat presidential nominee.

<p>Apologies in advance and will delete forthwith if this has been posted. I admit, my loyalty is to Weinergate. I am a pre-Weinergate groupy, so a possible origin of the &quot;laptop&quot; is key. Sept. 05, HRC\'s CF Laptop is reported lost, ... and ... then. In early October, &quot;a laptop&quot; surfaces in the home of america\'s favorite kinky kouple. Officer arrives. Huma to officer: &quot;It\'s his laptop.&quot; Weiner: &quot;What? No, what? You know that belongs to, ... oh, ooohhh, oh yeah, yeah, it\'s mine, officier. Yep that\'s mine alright, yeah, my laptop, every single bit of it, yep.&quot; </p>
<p>Or are there two different laptops? … If they are the same, and it was at Huma’s, then it wasn\'t &quot;lost:&quot; and so it is an open and shut purgery, obstruction, ........... against HRC…….. right? (no, i\'m not a brain scientist.) </p>
<p>With all the talk about the search warrant, and inevitable attempts to legally neutralize the laptop\'s contents, doesn\'t the search warrant at this stage lose some strength in light of a pretty fucking good fact that Hillary-Huma were hiding something the FBI wanted a couple months before the election? That the search warrant would seem kind of trite now that we know HRC was blocking access to it all along? It seems the NYPD/FBI had some reason to believe it belonged to Weiner? Then Huma? Seems like a conspiracy of lies to me! The computer in September is “CF property.” By knowingly doing that, doesn\'t the warrant’s authority weaken as a preventative to have full and unfettered access to that hard drive? Or do we just have to continue praying and hoping for thumb drives from heaven? And be grateful to Weiner\'s weiner that we have gotten this far.

              if the computer’s number has been redacted, that just keeps either argument open for the time being, unless that has since been resolved.  For the time being, let’s assume it’s two separate laptops. There could be a third computer for all we know.

              Second, Weiner’s Laptop could prove to be the Holy Grail and the Rosetta Stone all rolled up in one.

             <p>
              we are dealing with constitutional scumbuckets, re HRC, DoJ, et al; remember when the two HRC staffers testified, and part of the agreement was that their laptops would be incinerated, immediately, duly reported by the media without batting an eyelash? ]]

            Klinger above, re: Weiner’s Laptop
           </p>
           <p>
            “This was the same laptop that had an email folder on it called "Life Insurance" that had damning Hillary emails so I'm quite sure Hildabeast or her ilk were not aware of it's existence. After it was discovered, Huma said she had NO idea how the stuff got on her husband's personal laptop.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The scenario built up from this foundation is that the hubby’s computer included an automatic back up system set up sometime in 2009 or thereabouts (?), re SoS, and the separate servers, etc. (Was it also a server?) They just forgot about it when the foundation got new laptops a couple years later; in the meantime, Weiner got it second hand, but folks forgot about the autosynch hookups? While he was whacking himself off online, was the laptop also receiving emails from the King of Morocco?
           </p>
           <p>
            Were the emails being received “live,” during the course of Weiner’s ownership of the laptop? Do the dates on emails conform to the same timeframe as Weiner’s ownership? Or, …
           </p>
           <p>
            A tweener scenario also assumes two separate laptops.
When CF's laptop went ‘lost’, it went straight over to Huma's home and at least parts of the hard drive were transferred to Weiner's? The dates of the transfer should be somewhere between Sept. 2 (lost) and the Equinox when Weiner was busted. Early October is when the first NYPD comments of disgust about some of the content.
           </p>
           <p>
            Was all that information just dumped onto Weiner’s laptop as an emergency measure, and then the CF laptop was destroyed? (HRC: “Nobody will think to look on Weiner’s laptop, not in a million years.”)
           </p>
           <p>
            { Whatever happens, we are pretty much guaranteed a “–gate” name for this scandal that is much, much more fitting of its subject matter. }

            They are not the same laptop.  The "lost" laptop is the lost laptop that legally had information on it but was somehow "lost."  I don't believe it was ever recovered.  The Weiner laptop was not authorized to have ANY secret/confidential information on it and was personal (this is confirmed via the warrant).   This was the same laptop that had an email folder on it called "Life Insurance" that had damning Hillary emails so I'm quite sure Hildabeast or her ilk were not aware of it's existence.  After it was discovered, Huma said she had NO idea how the stuff got on her husband's personal laptop.

             that's what i remember. what was said at the time was that first it was his, then it was speculated to be Huma's w/ back-up emails and that he was just using it. But HRC loses it around Sept. 2, and Weiner is busted on the 21st (headlines).

            TLDR: Clinton gave her laptop to Huma/Weiner while being investigated. Weiner's house was raided for a separate/related investigation, and laptop was recovered.

            I believe there were certain details about the laptop that were redacted. Such as serial number and people were wondering why it was redacted. This might explain it. I don't have time to search through the search warrant but  maybe someone else can post the link? Upvoating

            Congratulations - good connection - you may well be right.
I was wondering why a whole bunch of Humas emails were alleged to be on 'her husbands' laptop.
Of course, if it is Hillary's laptop it would explain perfectly why there are lots of Huma's emails on it......

            The warrant is QUITE explicit in describing the make, model, and ID number of the laptop, as well as the hard disk drive within it.  I wonder if Platte River Networks would recognize that identifying information?
