<p>Megan Rouse is the daughter of JP.  Dublin, CA is where she was appointed to a school board.  She appears in WL emails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WikiLeaks released another document showing that Rouse’s father asked big-time Washington lobbyist Jim Davidson in an email to contribute to his daughter’s 2014 school board campaign. Davidson’s clients include the likes of Disney and CBS.
“While you probably aren’t too vested in the outcome of local California school board races, we hope you can support her candidacy, even at a modest level, as she begins her career as an elected official. 
Similar email blasts titled “Our Daughter’s Fundraiser” were sent out to many others to encourage donations.

<p>I found this campaign pre-election form for a City Councilman candidate, Joshua Fryday.  Megan Rouse had contributed, as well as a lot of other East Coast folks. It’s from Nov 2015. (California Form 640). What interest does the East Coast have in this city?</p>

<p>Here is a little information about Novato   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novato,_California">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novato,_California</a></p>
<p>Here is some of the local economy:</p>
<p>•	Buck Institute for Research on Aging, (Buck? Aging Research?)</p>
<p>•	Biotech and Pharma companies, (Medical Connection)</p>
<p>•	A former AIR FORCE BASE decommissioned in 1974, and designated historic and zoned for single family homes (Who occupies these single family homes now? Would there be tunnel or underground access built right into the foundation of the homes?.  
</p>
<p>•	Relationship to video game development.  (The symbols keep showing up in games/apps)</p>
<p>•	several small tech companies, including parent companies of Rockstar Games. </p>
<p>•	The school district is the largest employer, followed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical. (Education 1st, Drugs 2nd, wonder what’s 3rd?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Economy[ (a few companies are named…toys, distribution, gamemakers) </p>
<p>The city is home to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and several biotech firms, such as Biosearch Technologies and BioMarin Pharmaceutical. Several small technology companies are also based in Novato, such as 2K Marin, Radiant Logic,Toys For Bob, One Legal, International Genetics Incorporated, Channel Management Solutions, Enwisen, Sonic Solutions and DriveSavers. It is also home of a development studio for Take Two Interactive, parent company of Rockstar Games.</p>
<p>The former Hamilton Air Force Base is also located in Novato, but was decommissioned in 1974 and designated a Historic District in 1998. After lying stagnant for many years, major renovations were pushed through by then-mayor Michael DiGiorgio. As of 2008 the base has largely been redeveloped into single family homes. The former hangar buildings were gutted and redeveloped into two story office buildings. Hangar tenants include 2K Sports, Sony Imageworks, Visual Concepts,The Republic of Tea, Toys For Bob, and Birkenstock Distribution USA.</p>
<p>In Novato for many years (from 1983 to 1998) was headquartered, the iconic[23] developer of video games Brøderbund Software known through games Choplifter, Lode Runner, Karateka, and Prince of Persia, and others.[24]</p>

<p>I found Gabe Podesta’s name on the contribution list too. He is JP’s son, Megan’s brother.
There is some discussion of Gabe P here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1526753">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1526753</a></p>
<p>And it appears that Gabe and Josh Fryday (the Novato City Council Candidate) know each other. </p>
<p>Here is a wikileak email that included a lot of Podestas and Josh Fryday, discussing Afghan Commerce. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54217">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54217</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I learned that I was deploying to support a contracting command, I figured I would learn about the Afghan economy. What I hadn¹t figured was that those lessons would have nothing to do with my official duties. When I stepped off the helo pad at Camp Phoenix and into my office for the first time I was immediately introduced to GS-15 DoD employee. She asked me how many ³cartouches²I wished to purchase. A cartouche, I learned, is a cheap pendant necklace engraved on one side with an English name and on the other with the same name in Dari (or so they claim; it may well say Go Home American Swine for all any of us know). I initially demurred but eventually relented and agreed to purchase three. Even that compromise was met with an incredulous look and a puzzled ³just three?² The interaction seemed odd but I figured that I just happened to arrive as a bulk order was being placed and that purchases like this were atypical. I was wrong. My coworkers spend multiple duty hours each and every day shopping at the bazaars. They buy jewelry. They buy rugs.</p>

<p>I found this site familytreenow.com and found some JP addresses.  There were two in California: one in Truckee, and one in Novato.  Both addresses contain the word Hidden in them.</p>

<p>They host summer camps too</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children’s Summer Camps
For our younger horse lovers, nothing is more fun, challenging, and rewarding than spending a full week perfecting one’s riding skills while learning from each other. Day camps are offered two to three times a year, typically in June and August. Each one-week session generally runs about four hours per day, Monday through Friday. 
Sessions are limited to a maximum of eight students to ensure individual attention.</p>

<p>Sounds good. Btw, we had a good chat with Ginny Erlich last week re childhood obesity and I had great meetings with Neera in DC re the kids campaign ... Will give you the update on that and the book stuff. </p>
<p>And my bro is potentially interested in chatting about collaboration with the Clinton Foundation... He may be in NYC on Feb 16th. Good luck and we will talk very soon. Jim</p>

            Children’s Summer Camps
For our younger horse lovers, nothing is more fun, challenging, and rewarding than spending a full week perfecting one’s riding skills while learning from each other. Day camps are offered two to three times a year, typically in June and August. Each one-week session generally runs about four hours per day, Monday through Friday. 
Sessions are limited to a maximum of eight students to ensure individual attention.

            Aquino owns property in Marin and Sonoma counties, including a historic San Rafael house that he inherited from his mother, Betty Ford-Aquino.
Ford-Aquino, who died of cancer in San Francisco in 1985, was a temple priestess. She left her son a $3.2 million estate, including a house at 828 Mission St. in San Rafael, which is leased by Project Care for Children and the Marin County Child Abuse Council.
Built in 1880, it was the residence of the first mayor of San Rafael, Edward McCarthy.
Aquino also inherited a professional building at 914 Mission in San Rafael and another professional building at 1212 Fourth St. in Santa Rosa.
Officials of Project Care for children expressed shock that the building’s owner was linked to the Presidio molestation case. They emphasized that Aquino has nothing to do with the operation of the center, a private non-profit organization that assists parents in finding daycare.
“This is the most ironic and bizarre twist of fate, said Daria Seivers, past president of Project Care.
Lynn Butch, who also used the name L. Darlene Butch, is the daughter of Harry H. Johnson, a wealthy Mill Valley developer who was allegedly kidnapped in September by Kenneth R Russo. Russo contends that Johnson swindled him out of more than $500,000 in a business deal. The case is now being unraveled in Marin County Superior Court.
Dark Star 9 Pylon, which is filed under the corporation name of Temple of Nepthys, lists an address on Indian Valley Road in Novato. The house was occupied by a former friend of Lynn Butch, Patricia Lillie, now of Sonoma County. Lillie was unavailable for no.

            Each one of these deserve their own voat thread! This was fantastic digging, I'm running through each one myself, especially the Napa connection, extreme corruption and child trafficking and abuse cover ups dating back decades within their police departments.

            A sheriffs office death investigator from Marin county, California was arrested for sex abuse. Novato is in the county of Marin. A photo album was also included in post. I will talk about some of the photos here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this a death scene photo?  Is it legal to post this?

            Shower thought: you know how are you are always seeing those ads depicting dental implants? What if dentists are stealing authentic teeth to implant into elites needing replacement teeth? Who really knows what they are doing in your mouth?
           </p>
           <p>
            And have you considered how all the elite have very nice smiles? All the mk ultra potentials would need nice teeth. And it seems a lot elite kids wear braces.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just some random thoughts provoked by the dentist photo.

             This is whats creepy. She was actually going between bolinas and sausalito doing farm work out in bolinas so alot of peopke knew her.  Called her Lee. Cops have bern less than help ful they coukd have used tracking stuff fron sattelites. Or something. The boat she was last seen leaving is a multi million dollar boat owned by a drug lord in bolinas called The Andora, that's where she was last seen leaving. It's pulled in toward the harbor and situated next to another boat also connected to drug and sex trafficking called the Taj Mahal. People say there is a cop in sausalito, facilitating illegal business out in Richardson bay drugs prostitution etc..its very very suspect she go missing so close to the harbor. 100-200 feet, but the two boats are next to each other the most criminal boats in the harbor, right by where she went gone.

             Creepy. I think teeth are a whole other story cause they have to be alive to be healthy....anyway..i don't know what the photos are about but the tree lined driveway is in West Marin out past Inverness. There are white vans because there are so many federal agents. Be it trash men or armed feds in patrol cars but they got vans out there too. Also there are alot allot of dips up an down out there and small side roads near that driveway. It's federal territory. We have state county and federal parks in marin.

             Regarding Navajo I posted several comments on your original thread and have provided info to others you have named that was written up and submitted to a location where it will not be deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Still shocked these get deleted with "what has this got to do with pizzagate" This Doctor it seems is actually a Deputy coronor. This would be why he has pictures of cops in his photography. Coroners and cops are often friends escpecially deputy coronor's.
            </p>
            <p>
             This might sound disturbing on its face but it is not normally. Many people do not realize police officers (of certain rank &amp; specialty) have to attend autopsies frequently. If a crime has been committed or suspected of being committed. This is part of the job. Coronors are the ones called to the scenes by officers when death has occurred this is also part of the job they spend much of their time together around death &amp; trauma. Deputy Coronors are also sheriffs deputies on occasion or "deputized"
            </p>
            <p>
             Specifically to the picture that definitely looks like a post mordem picture (after death) This looks like heroin OD possibly. She has a belt tightened around her upper arm and some type of port or entry into the major vein in the crook of the arm. The skin discoloration on other parts of her body also indicate this is Post Mortum. If there had been any attempts at rescue even with Narcan this picture could not have been taken. If there had been an attempt to start an IV this picture could not have been taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             These facts are odd but little else is known. A first responder whether medic or police would have immediately placed her flat and tried a variety of things if only to call death. If death was a foregone conclusion which it seems to indicate (such as rigor) had set in then that picture could have been taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             Next why does this coroner have it posted on his Flickr. That would be illegal under any circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>
             This place you are speaking of is in SF or Marin County. Very frightful things have happened there. Will go into more later.
            </p>
            <p>
             The teeth issue regarding the elites has several factors. Number one most if not all of elites &amp; Hollywood have implants. That is why their teeth look perfect. This has been going on for close to 30 years but now it is a one day process where you go under anesthetic and after surgery your entire mouth has been given perfect permanent teeth that never been treatment again.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the recent past it was discovered that children's teeth contained stem cells that could be harvested. The market for children's teeth then shot through the roof and now their is another insidious practice involved.

            Novato charter school reviews. It's a Waldorf school.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This school, coming from a student, is a good school, teaches good material, but
is stuck in the 60's. Any use of cell phones, gaming devices or any other
technological thing is forbidden and, if found, confiscated. In the kindergarten
kids get in trouble for, and I quote, "TV Talk". Yes, thats right, even the mere
MENTION of the word "Spider-man" is punishable. Other than this and the issues
with budget (the school seems to be getting poorer and poorer every day) it is a
good school. Worries about kids being teased/bullied, begone! The school has a 0
tolerance policy for things like this. The school is a raffle school with a long
waiting list, so you might need to wait to get your kid in. One of the teachers
(who I will leave unnamed) has an obsession with making kids pick up trash,
which is very annoying. Also, the teachers tend to favor girls a LOT more than
boys, so be prepared if your child is a boy. Last but not least, it has "main
lesson", which is where you learn something, write a draft, draw a final (needs
to be neat, have a nice border, etc.) then draw a picture. Very boring, takes a
long time. Overall, its a pretty good school.

This School is a racist, homophobic cesspool located in modular buildings arranged like a trailer park. The "Director" Rachel Bishop stonewalls all complaints and tells everyone "Gee, thats the first time i heard that issue" when in fact harassment, bias and favoritism has been rampant. Since the State Dept of Education visited last year, they finally drafted the "uniform complaint process" other schools have had for years and now must keep records of incidents going forward. This is NOT anything like a Waldorf school. In the past several years, the teacher turnover is astonishing with very few veteran teachers remaining. If your child is lucky enough to be in one of the many cliques...you will LOVE it here.....if not your child would be better served attending school elsewhere.

              fairies, gnomes, and other stupid fairy tales
             </strong>
             was absolutely horrific. All kids were forced to learn violins, or other high pitched instruments. Believe it or not, there was something worse. We had to sign in to go to the bathroom. Yup, the school had to know when and what you were doing in the bathroom. I wouldn't recommend this school to my worst enemy.

            For those who do not know the area Dublin, Novato, are part of the "Bay Area" These cities all connect together with San Francisco to form Silicon Valley.
           </p>
           <p>
            The home of Google,Facebook, yahoo, &amp; every other high tech agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cost of living is so outraged because of this the billionaires live high end and are surrounded by devestating poverty &amp; homelessness.
           </p>
           <p>
            They would have you believe this can't be true. Stunning that they all ignore it when they have to drive amongst homeless shelters to eventually get to their
Billion dollar companies.

            Also, this Cazadero place is in Sonoma County - along with Bohemian grove as OP mentions. Sonoma county is right next to Napa Valley, where the Rothschild's Opus one is.

            Donner party email. Insert here. For those that do not know about Donner Party it is destined Ag nausea in historical contexts. Happened where Truckee, Ca is now located. In North Ca. Mountains people were trapped and resorted to cannabilism to survive once their families and friends died and froze.
           </p>
           <p>
            Horrible story but happened during gold mining
Days of covered wagons and exploration. So taboo to speak about many did not reveal this truth.

           <p>
            JP &amp; friends are talking in emails about this referencing cannabilism and property in Truckee
