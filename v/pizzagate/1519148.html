            It is surprising how much actual evidence they included in this article, but there are numerous significant omissions, and also numerous fibs or errors regarding what they do say. One of the most conspicuous omissions is the absence of any mention of spirit cooking, which is perhaps the main catalyst for the pizzagate investigation. This is a definite link between the Podestas and Satanism. In the flow chart at the top of the page, the factual elements (according to the NYTimes) are in black, while the "false" or unfounded elements are in red. Both "secret code language" and "Satanism" should actually be in black, because both are definitely real in relation to the Podestas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their description of the use of "cheese pizza" is not accurate, as, for years, pedophiles have used not just "cheese pizza" but "pizza" or a "slice of pizza" to refer to their activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another reason for omitting anything about Marina Abramovic has come to mind which may be further explored in the near future.

             Yeah I didn't even think of the spirit cooking when I read the article. They didn't include pictures of Abramovic's bizarre rituals, or the emails about spirit cooking probably because it would be much harder to "justify", like they tried to do with the less obvious evidence.

            Excellent journalism, NYT. Y'all deserve a pulitzer! (not.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Several problems with this article exist. Some notable ones:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Point #8 under "How the #PizzaGate conspiracy theory evolved" section says, "On Dec. 4, Edgar M. Welch, a 28-year-old from North Carolina, arrived at Comet with a military-style rifle and a handgun. The police said he fired the rifle inside the pizzeria, hurting no one, and
            <strong>
             surrendered after finding no evidence to support claims of child slaves being held there
            </strong>
            ." Ok, let me get this straight. This dude was crazy enough to walk into CPP and start shooting, and then rational thought suddenly prevailed when he found "no evidence to support claims of child slaves being held there"? (btw this dude is an actor with an IMDB page and the whole thing reaks of being a false flag)
           </p>
           <p>
            2) I'm surprised--they actually showed some of the emails! Even the one that mentions "a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related"! But, there is no discussion or analysis of this quote. Who the fuck talks like that? Is there any way this is just casual emailing? That email is very suspicious and it does appear they were talking in code.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) They post the creepy freezer picture! Except, there's no discussion of the fact that #killroom and #murder were commented on that picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of what they left out:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Picture of the girl taped to a table on James Alefantis' instagram:
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/FnGuyR.png">
             https://i.sli.mg/FnGuyR.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Picture of the man holding a young child with #chickenlovers:
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/zMTnzm.jpg">
             https://i.sli.mg/zMTnzm.jpg
            </a>
            chicken lover is code word for gay pedophile:
            <a href="http://archive.is/o2KkB">
             http://archive.is/o2KkB
            </a>
            (this used to be the a definition on urban dictionary also but has since been deleted. BTW if anyone could find an archive of that, it would be great)
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Tony Podesta's creepy artwork that featured pictures of naked teenagers, from the article deleted by The Washington Post:
            <a href="https://archive.is/tAaFN">
             https://archive.is/tAaFN
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Wikileaks email with subject, "Last night was fun" with body "Still in torture chamber":
            <a href="http://archive.is/9PcWi">
             http://archive.is/9PcWi
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Wikileaks email that says, "I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch":
            <a href="http://archive.is/lYbsS">
             http://archive.is/lYbsS
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There's way more, but you get the point. I'd love to see what bullshit they pull out of their asses to justify that stuff!
           </p>
           <p>
            Nice try, New York Times. We know your CEO, Mark Thompson, helped cover up the Jimmy Saville case. But we also know your reporters read this site to see what the "crazy conspiracy theorists" are up to. Some are probably even reading this post right now. You are the worst excuses for reporters I've ever seen. I'm doing a better job of reporting than you, and I'm an anonymous person on the internet without my bigshot Ivy League English/Communications degree. If you have any sense of humanity left in you, DO YOUR FUCKING JOBS AND DO SOME ACTUAL FUCKING REPORTING!
           </p>

             What "counter evidence" are you referring to? All I saw was the less damaging evidence that was presented without any serious thought, as well as some misrepresentation of the investigation.
