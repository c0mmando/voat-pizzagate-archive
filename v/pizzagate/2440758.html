            A couple of points I haven't seen made: U2's first and third album's ('Boy' and 'War') featured a shirtless boy on the cover. It was the same boy, Peter Rowen, according to this
            <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/child-appeared-u2-album-covers-boy-war-grown-31-years-article-1.964294">
             brief article
            </a>
            pictured at 5 and 8. The album cover of 'Boy' was banned in the US and Canada because of fears it would appeal to paedophiles (so if you live in the US you may not have seen the European version). Looking at it now, you would have to say it seems suspicious. Rowen was selected because he was the younger brother of Derek Rowen, who was a member of another Irish post-punk band, The Virgin Prunes, and part of a strange gang called 'Lypton Village' which also included members of U2. 'Bono' and 'The Edge' owe their nicknames to membership of this gang.  Something which probably gets filed under 'things that make you go hmmm' is that 3 of the 4 U2 members were part of a cult called 'Shalom' (or 'The Shalom Fellowship'). This was a non-denominational Christian group, which the drummer, Larry Mullen, later compared to the Moonies. The band members were connected with Shalom around the time of their first two albums.

            Great find! Bono and Jimmy Kimmel hosted the Red Cross/Obama fundraising video which Q focused a lot of attention on in November and early December.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Nov. 25 Q posted the RED_RED "Freedom" stringer which was a series of codes. On Dec 4 Q said this in reference to the Freedom stringer:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              34663
RED CROSS RED RED.
NK.
Hussein.
ASIA.
Why was that STRINGER sent out?

Where is the RED CROSS?

Q
             </p>
            </blockquote>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            On Dec 4 Q also said that Obama made
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoqYd39wkZs">
             a Red Cross fundraising video
            </a>
            on Jimmy Kimmel's show in response to the RED_RED Freedom stringer on Nov 27 and suggested that we cross reference the Freedom stringer with Obama's Red Cross video:
           </p>
           <p>
            Re-review RED_RED stringer.

Q
           </p>
           <p>
            BONO co-hosted the Obama Red Cross video with Jimmy Kimmel. Obama talks about finding a  cure for AIDS and raising HIV-free kids. He also promises people who participate in the RED shopping experience a ride on Air Force One. Someone off camera says he can't do that anymore, so Obama promises to show his "files on the aliens" which he says he keeps in his desk, but the same voice says he can't do that either.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Dec 5 Q says this:
           </p>
           <p>
            RED Haiti.
Children.

Since POTUS elected what changed w/ RED?
Since POTUS elected what changed w/ CF?
Since POTUS elected what changed w/ Mc_I?
These people deserve …. . .. …….
Q
           </p>
           <p>
            And then Q makes the most interesting revelations:
           </p>
           <p>
            RED RED stringer 25th.
Hussein RED video 27th (response).
Hussein in Asia on 28th post stringer.
Analyze.

Q
           </p>
           <p>
            In conclusion: BONO appears to be deeply connected to the RED CROSS, Obama, North Korea, Haiti, Children and AIDS. I've been puzzling over this for months. I have a theory what this might mean, and it isn't pretty. My hypothesis also include aliens, MARS and the Jesuits, but I have no proof, just speculation at this point. My suspicions about what might be involved were confirmed by this creepy video of a musical number that was aired on the Jimmy Kimmel show on the same day as the Obama Red Cross video, entitled "We're Going to Hell":

           </p>
           <p>
            What does "HELL" refer to? Is this metaphorical or a real place?

            He seems to also have hooked up with Bobby Shriver and a Charity called RED.  No wonder.  He was Co-founder of RED. “The $350 million (RED) has raised is important — particularly to the people who are alive because of it — but (RED) isn’t just about cold cash, it’s about political heat,” said Bono, cofounder of (RED). “When Bobby Shriver and I started (RED), people said we were mad. We were mad, we were outraged that where you lived would decide whether you lived – and that’s exactly what was happening with the AIDS crisis. But this isn’t a last decade fight, it’s the next decade where we really need to show up and see this off. I’m really touched that in this next year what we raise will be matched by the Gates Foundation. Let’s make sure we get to $100 million.”   WOW.  $100M.  Imagine the damage they could cause.

             Let me get out my hanky.  Boo-Hoo.  Sexual Misconduct and all he is going to do is give a Wimpy Apology?  Not good enough.  Millions of dollars given to his found.  and he has been looking the other way.  He has been busy tooling around the world with BC and BG and on DG's Yacht with the Rich and Famous.  I don't believe one bit that's really sorry.

             HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Let me read that again.  He's gonna rewrite the Bible?  While people in his ONE Found.  are guilty of sexual misconduct?  What he is going to propose in his new version of the Holy Book?  Sodom and Gamorrah?   I wonder what the pope thinks of that.

             I never liked them.  I can't even remember one song.  Now I know why, I guess.  I always thought that all the ones running all over the world were trying too hard, like the World Ads Concert.  Where did all that money go.  Where has All the money gone collected for Aids and Haiti and Africa?  To buy GSK Pharma Vaccines?

               How so?  I don't favor him one bit.  Never cared for him.  The group and Bono never interested me.  But now, his org. that is another story.  He is also the Co-founder of RED.

                I was being sarcastic.  Apologies.  Bono is as dirty as the rest of the elites.

                 It's funny.  Really though, that someone mentioned they didn't hardly remember much of him, I don't either.  What is his charm anyway?  Just that he hobnobs with the rich and famous.  Those kind of people are a dime a dozen.  This happening, the news coming out, it has to make a difference.  Hopefully it will grow.  Bill C.  Warren B, they are all involved.  WB has been flying under the radar.

                  As Q has alluded, and I think this will be the case - perps will slip through.  Rich and powerful like Bono, WB and others may not be big enough players (think dealers vs users) to be worht the headache.

                  There will be a natural backlash against the MSM and Hollywood - which we are CLEARLY seeing already.  At some point - a year, five years - many of the popular entertainers will become irrelevant.  Suicides among the famous will become more and more common as the MK programming breaks down without their handlers.

             I cant stand this Bono face. It screams hypocrite all over. People who help the most don't really talk about it. But the ones who always talk about usually don't care.

             looking back, it's clear how full of shit they were..  they borrowed a political slant because The Clash made it trendy and then sold out faster than any other band in history.

               That must have been Toddlers and Tiaras also starring Ron Howard.  What really made me sick was the Sexy Baby Sexy Baby part.  I will never be able to watch Polar Express again.  Nor can I watch Opie any more either.  Huge letdown actually, but then all of them have been.  No longer.  I have no feeling about or for any of them.  They are all nothing to me.  There are a couple, but I will cope with them too.  They all threw us under the bus.  Now it's their turn.

             some person posted a few days ago another story was about to break in Ireland, it appears there was mi6 connection?? a global problem and...one poster wrote 'Kincora' was a deep story. Both the Irish national State media and British BBC media have been caught with pedophiles. A lot of charities were all Fronts for fake smuggling and money moving.

               That sure sounds possible.  They have done this stuff to us before.  Chris Dodd left Congress and  went to work there. Obama surely had connections to Weinstein getting Malia a job there.  Someone is pulling the strings.
