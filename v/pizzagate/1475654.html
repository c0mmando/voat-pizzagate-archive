            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring.   Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle)     YWCA  Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ )
            <br/>
            This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">
             http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php
            </a>
            Interestingly this place was opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandrea on 27 sept 1984
This is the sign I seen from the street

            Hope someone with more know-how then me be able to dig some more, little children could be at risk now.Thank you.
I would also like to thank Victurus Libertas VL, for recently making this video about this matter

            I caught them red-handed removing pedo stories from their search feature. 
Use a search engine from a different newspaper and you'll get old NYT stories. They are archived ... just hidden from their search feature.

            I have decided to still read here but take my investigation alone with my two other friends that work in Law enforcement, The immature behavior ,needless rants and name calling are not for me. I know so many of you have good intent but when young adults become power crazy and condone behavior that is not conducive to good working relationship and camaraderie I am not good with that. Camaraderie is how you can stand to work sexual abuse cases,without comradery  you go crazy. I just am seeing so many personal attacks that make this  a bad working environment.  I know younger unhappy anti-establishment kids may not like it but average people like me add to the legitimacy of this movement . But we are not wanted.
How this appears to mainstream people that want to help is not good or professional. People that come here to see what this is about will think that we are crazy and leave. then they will say maybe MSM is right.
I wish everyone the best. I think I need people that are even-tempered and have a professional manner that treat each other with respect and go about research in a calm manner ,not blowing everything out of proportion.

Here are details of their scrubbing Hollywood pedo, Sid Kiwitt, story (2nd half of the post)

            This tells how they can legally use propaganda and fake news against American citizens. It tells how they can use any form of implementation, including up to rewriting history, and the manipulation of archives.  Watch the video about this amended Law.

            The NYT has a paper edition, a digital tablet edition, an online subscriber and free edition, a search service for online subscribers to look up past articles (and where they rightfully expect to find all past articles) and their content is archived in many national and academic newspapers databases. This publication model is not at all compatible with time-limited content. Obviously they can't remove content from the paper edition and the tablet edition (it's a downloaded document) and that would make things really confusing if they pulled things they have published from archives and databases which purpose is to retain the history of published articles. This would also break the references of all the websites and other articles who use the NYT as a blueprint for fact checking. Not to mention search engines (a big part of their incoming traffiic) that would get dead links. Wikipedia is a prominent example of such website that is chokefull stuffed with references to the NYT and other mainstream newspaper.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've never seen that happening, and I have been landing on NYT articles from search engine queries and Wikipedia very often. What are the chances that the first instance of that I ever see would be about an article with strong connection to #pizzagate during the most intense wave of censorship the web has ever known.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm very skeptical of your hypothesis. Can you point us to the section of AP licensing terms where they describe this limited time license? And show a handful of other non-pizzagate and non-election related articles of the NYT where this happened so that we can confirm this isn't an isolated case and not caused by a political bias?

            Since the article is from AP, and ABC, WP,  NYT and some other sites I checked no longer have it, seems maybe the AP pulled the story? Not saying that makes it any less of a find.

            The NYT and MSM suddenly deciding to remove these articles shows that they're trying to wipe off traces of this bust in Norway. Since it involves politicians and elite members, one has to assume that a crucial piece of evidence linking the Norway bust to Pizzagate lies in it somewhere. The most likely scenario would be proof of CF involvement in relation to this child pedophilia ring. We need to dig on this Norway bust and find the smoking gun asap.

             Foes of Russia Say Child Pornography Is Planted to Ruin Them

Hmmmm so one story deleted, and one about Russia planting child porn added. Interesting.

             You know what. We need to call for a complete removal of the CIA. They are planting these mind games. David Brock Just uses the same argument against you. CIA uses counter psychology. That's exactly what this is.

             But one thing always looked suspicious to me with that childporn-thing:
That they were not going for the producers, but that viewing was already a crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now with #pizzagate we begin to understand how deep the hole is. How many politicians, lawyers, business people, journalists must be involved, if they can even attack the US constitution instead to allow an investigation.
Now imagine if the hole is that deep, what would be the ultimate tool, to destroy anyone? Upload CP to his computer and give a tip to police. He is finished. And this could happenj to everybody.
            </p>
            <p>
             We must keep the eyes and spirit open in all directions and planting CP on someone's computer indeed could be an extremely powerful weapon.

            <p>
             The MSM think they're so smart. Let's say for example that Russia did plant CP in certain DNC members' emails... It doesn't explain the Podestas' pedophilic arts found in their homes and offices. Nice try MSM, but not quite. We won't be fooled again. And the more they try to put the blame on Russia and try to debunk and wipe old articles, the more it seems they are drowning in their own shit.

              Good catch. They obviously try to distract, but nevertheless it's important to understand, that planting CP on someone's computer and give the police a tip, is an almost ultimate weapon to destroy well known people - or the ultimate instrument to put the person under extreme pressure (if there is nothing else to blackmail them).

             Unfortunately , This is already in the DSM-5 and is currently being taught in all psychology  Classes world wide.
             <a href="http://jaapl.org/content/42/4/404">
              http://jaapl.org/content/42/4/404

             Many in society are likely to equate Pedophilia with child molestation. They are not the same. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)1 may be contributing inadvertently to the misconception that they are the same, for the following three reasons:
            </p>
            <p>
             First, DSM-5 states that an indicator of a Pedophilic Disorder would be that an individual has “acted on” his sexual urges (Ref. 1, p 697). “Acted on” could mean that he has actually molested a child. On the other hand, it could also mean that he has masturbated to pedophilic fantasies or that he has viewed child pornography. The current criteria for diagnosing a Pedophilic Disorder place some persons who have never molested a child into the same diagnostic category as those who have done so. That could cause confusion, suggesting that the current definition of a Pedophilic Disorder may lack adequate diagnostic specificity. As a consequence, the distinction between being sexually attracted to children in some fashion (e.g., experiencing urges to view child pornography) and experiencing urges to act on that attraction with a child can easily be lost.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, at present, in discussing Pedophilia, DSM-5 makes reference to the term Pedophilic Sexual Orientation. Sexual Orientation is ordinarily used to designate the category, or categories, of persons whom a given individual finds to be sexually appealing. Those who are heterosexually oriented are sexually attracted to adults of the opposite sex; those who are homosexual, to adults of the same sex; men with a heterosexual pedophilic orientation, to prepubescent females; and men with a homosexual pedophilic orientation, to prepubescent boys.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the face of significant criticism of its inclusion in the DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) has stated its intention to remove the term Pedophilic Sexual Orientation from the diagnostic manual.2 Removing that term in response to public criticism would be a mistake. Experiencing ongoing sexual attractions to prepubescent children is, in essence, a form of sexual orientation, and acknowledging that reality can help to distinguish the mental makeup that is inherent to Pedophilia, from acts of child sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Third, in discussing the nature of a Pedophilic Disorder, DSM-5 has done little to characterize the multitude of psychiatric burdens associated with the condition, burdens that are frequently present, even in the absence of any acts of child sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             JUST IN CASE ANY OF YOU ARE TOO DENSE LIKE GORILLION TO UNDERSTAND THIS POST&gt; WHAT I AM SAYING IS: THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE NOW TEACHING IN PSYCHOLOGY WORLD WIDE PER THE DSM-5 &lt; OF COURSE I DO NOT AGREE WITH IT AS I AM A RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT PUT THESE SHORTEYES AWAY.  SO PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME ANY NASTY GRAMS LIKE GORRILION &lt;WHO CANNOT READ.

              Fuck off with your "Burdens". Like they're some kind of tragic heros. This is a clear attempt to claim "victim" status for them, and the attendant "special considerations" victim groups  are afforded in our society. This is just the pedophilic syndicate trying to ride the identity politics gravy train while it's still running at full speed. This allows them charity status and to have out and proud lobby groups representing "their rights" in public.

             <p>
              Fuck them, fuck you. You can fucking suck it up. You don't have a right to "realize your perversion" and sexual kinks. I bet it must kill you creeps to see muslims getting away with their "sexual emergency" defenses in the EU. "It's their culture!" "It's not their fault!"

Maybe they want to scrap it because they know it's bullshit but someone with more power and connections than them forced it in there under great protest? Just from your post alone we know that pedophiles are fucking tireless in their campaign to normalize and legitimize their self-serving perversion. All the while crying "understand us!" and "we're victims!" and yet never once coming to the conclusion that you're clearly more concerned with your own imagined "rights" over the
              <em>
               actual
              </em>
              rights of children not to be classified as "legitimate" targets of sexual attraction.
             </p>
             <p>
              I agree with Angry Mob, it would be healthier for society to purge you, than to "tolerate" you. We've seen pretty clearly the damage the identity politics "tolerance" movement has been doing to our culture. And if things like Pizzagate are so wide ranging and heavily financed while considered absolutely taboo in our society, what in god's name is it going to be like once you creeps feel like you're "legitimized"? You think that's going to stop child rape? You think we believe that?

               Hey there, Chance903 didn't write all that out, its a quote from the article he linked. Sounds you like you have beef with the way its written. Fred S. Berlin wrote that entire article.
              </p>
              <p>
               I found some interesting information about him you might want to look into:

              </p>
              <p>
               In the article above, Fred Berlin says:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                “The overwhelming majority of people who view child pornography … aren’t interested in consummating an involvement with a youngster,” he added.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               odd.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's another article where he defends the actions of a possessor of child porn:
               <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2007/06/18/Wife-s-illness-drove-man-to-child-porn-lawyer-says/stories/200706180186">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               here's some quotes from that article:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                In his report, Dr. Berlin, who teaches at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said he believed Mr. Caste's behavior in looking at child pornography was an "aberration," and that there was no evidence to suggest he is a threat to children or that he ever attempted to abuse anyone.
               </p>
               <p>
                In addition, Mr. Caste passed a polygraph examination about whether he has ever engaged in sexual activity with a child, Dr. Berlin wrote.
               </p>
               <p>
                The defendant's accessing child porn "was not a reflection of any pedophilic desire to engage in a sexual liaison with a youngster," Dr. Berlin said. Instead, he continued, it involved a combination of "voyeuristic curiosity, combined with a desire to catalog and collect."
               </p>
               <p>
                Had he not been under "extraordinary mental and emotional distress associated with his wife's severe, unrelenting and ultimately fatal illnesses," Dr. Berlin said, it would have been extremely unlikely Mr. Caste would have developed an interest in child pornography.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Very odd.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know I can't speak for anyone but myself, but "developing an interest in child pornography" over "emotional distress" is an extraordinary leap in logic.
              </p>

              Man, that's the strangest article. Seems like splitting hairs to me. Check these quotes:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "Under current circumstances, a diagnosis of Pedophilic Disorder can infer a risk of hands-on offending with children. If the diagnosis is made largely on the basis of the use of child pornography, the inference may be inaccurate, with potentially unwarranted negative consequences for the individual."
              </p>
              <p>
               "From a purely statistical standpoint (all else being equal) individuals with no history of a hands-on sexual offense against a child, but who have accessed child pornography, are at low risk as a group of committing a hands-on sexual offense in the future."
              </p>
              <p>
               "
               <strong>
                Even though viewing sexualized images of children is illegal
               </strong>
               , privately viewing such images and fantasizing about them does not necessarily reflect a real-life intent or interest in being sexual with a child."
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It's just hard for me to justify the debasing of innocent children as a sexual orientation. I understand that they're trying to differentiate the criminal act from the mental disorder, but even so...normalizing "attraction to prepubescent children" is not the way to go.
             </p>
             <p>
              Give them a pedophilia prevention hotline or something, similar to suicide prevention. This would allow them to seek help, and not have to face the "adverse effects" of admitting sexual attraction to children.

               This is classic Marxist Critical Theory. It IS splitting hairs, that's the point. To divide anything and everything and reduce it to such a minute questionable structure (figuratively) that one has no choice but to aquiesce to the very sophist notion that one cannot know anything. You saw that clearly, that's good. Splitting hairs. Take this conceptual strategy and multiply it by 1,000 and you have the Marxist school of thought. All in the attempt to control other people. It is designed to accomodate this very thing that we are investigating. It paves the road for pedophilia, sex workers, refugee crises, welfare(cloward-piven strategy), you name it. THIS is exactly why we as people have been so controlled and why we have the world we live in. Not the only reason, but it has major influence...

Eventually, all pedophiles give into their urges.

               <p>
                I agree.
               </p>
               <p>
                On another note, I looked into the writer of that article you linked and I found some interesting stuff.
               </p>
               <p>
                It was written by Fred S. Berlin, who is an "American psychiatrist and sexologist specializing in sex offenses". That's to be expected, of course.
               </p>
               <p>
                Something interesting I did find though, is that Fred Berlin actually defended Joe Paterno and his actions in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal (
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_child_sex_abuse_scandal">
                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_child_sex_abuse_scandal)
                </a>
                )
               </p>
               <p>
                Now, Joe Paterno was implicated in knowing that child abuse was going on, yet did nothing about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                What Fred Berlin says after having looked through the Freeh Report (
                <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/12/sports/ncaafootball/13pennstate-document.html">
                 http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/12/sports/ncaafootball/13pennstate-document.html)
                </a>
                ), is:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 "I have not seen evidence supporting a conclusion that Joe Paterno had acted in bad faith, nor have I seen evidence supporting a conclusion that he has ever been a man who had lacked a genuine concern about the well-being of others – including the well-being of children.”
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                That quote is taken from this site:
                <a href="http://www.paterno.com/Expert-Reports/Dr-Fred-S-Berlin.aspx#.WEukkVxVbTo">
                 http://www.paterno.com/Expert-Reports/Dr-Fred-S-Berlin.aspx#.WEukkVxVbTo
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                There's video there as well, where he gets noticeably flustered defending Joe Paterno. (Here's a youtube link of the video as well:
                <a href="https://youtu.be/FJ1lsJG5LPo">
                 https://youtu.be/FJ1lsJG5LPo)
                </a>
                )
               </p>
               <p>
                Ok, so that quote and verdict by Berlin was published on February 6, 2013 (
                <a href="http://www.paterno.com/Resources/Docs/BERLIN_FINAL_REPORT_2-7-2013.pdf">
                 http://www.paterno.com/Resources/Docs/BERLIN_FINAL_REPORT_2-7-2013.pdf)
                </a>
                )
               </p>
               <p>
                Now what's interesting is that in 2014, new evidence suggested that Paterno had known about sexual abuse going on at Penn State since 1976. Here's the article, published this year:
                <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/17015181/testimony-unsealed-documents-alleges-joe-paterno-knew-jerry-sandusky-abuse-1976">
                 http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/17015181/testimony-unsealed-documents-alleges-joe-paterno-knew-jerry-sandusky-abuse-1976
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                So, in essence, Joe Paterno lied to the authorities about his knowledge of Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse of children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now, this could be a simple error on Berlin's part, not having the full evidence, so he was unable to make a proper judgement of the situation...but I just find the whole thing strange.
               </p>
               <p>
                It reminds me of the Mark Thompson-Jimmy Savile thing, where Mark Thompson gave bad information about the Jimmy Savile Pedophilia case, or rather denied knowing anything about Jimmy Savile's pedophilia..
               </p>
               <p>
                But hey, Jerry Sandusky is in prison for child sex abuse, and Joe Paterno is no longer alive, so this could all be null and void information.
               </p>
               <p>
                Still...the idea of defending or covering up, or even normalizing the debasement of children doesn't sit well with me.

                 I find it highly disagreeable, to put it mildly, to think this is how they want to treat these Pedophiles. I spent 22 years helping to put people like this away. Of course, at, work I had( HAD )to be professional and not lose my shit on these people, but I know how they think and even the ones that are not offending yet....they will eventually fall prey to their base nature. This is very difficult to know what and how they think and then how my Professors want me to think, which is not based in reality. One point to make all of my Psychology Professors are left wing liberal. It has not been easy for me going back to school in a leftist Liberal world.

                 I agree. It's not a disorder, it's an incurable disease.They can't be saved or medicated. The urge to act upon their fantasies is too powerful and is putting children's lives at risk. They need to be put away for life. The globalists' agenda refers to depopulation of the earth, which is in my view an evil satanic plan, unless it's the normal masses depopulating the earth from these sick disgusting bastards pedophiles.
