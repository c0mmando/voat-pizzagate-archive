<p>I looked again now, maybe 10 days later, and Larry Hilbloom Foundation has been scrubbed from their donations/supporters page.  Wow, definitely onto something here!</p>
<p>Next I looked into the other supports and the one that seemed suspicious was &quot;The Sirius Foundation&quot;.  If you just do a google search into Sirius Foundation in Australia, nothing really comes up except for an address/no website or phone number, which is mildly suspicious.

<p>However, if you look elsewhere there\'s a Sirius Foundation in Haiti!  Of course they are a children\'s charity too!!! </p>

<p>On their site they claim to have been started by &quot;Coles Group&quot;.  Coles group has connections to The Clinton Foundation through the massive Caracol Industrial Park pushed by Clinton and the Clinton foundation as bringing in the work to save Haiti.  Check this article out:</p>

<p>&quot;One of Haiti’s richest men, Richard Coles, is opening a new factory to produce for Hanesbrands there.&quot;</p>
<p>And if any of you are doubting the whole Luciferian/Satanic/Devil angle to all of this, read the same article and you find this quote:</p>
<p>It was in Haiti that he [B.Clinton] decided instead to embark on a run for Arkansas attorney general—the race that turned out to be the start of his journey to the White House and, arguably, the beginning of Hillary’s public life as well. We may never know what moved him. But an important moment came outside the capital, at the Vodou temple of Max Beauvoir, a Sorbonne- and City College of New York-educated houngan, or priest. After a ceremony honoring Ogou—the god of iron, war and politics—the Clintons and Beauvoir sat all night by the coral-stone peristyle talking about faith and the future, the houngan told me. “We reached the conclusion that the pursuit of God is the pursuit of excellence,”</p>
<p>My suggestion to lurkers who are bored and want to find their own evidence, look into satanic names and symbology and you will find that the controllers/elites are naming everything they do based on their belief system.  Sirius is where Lucifer comes from.  Hence why I found the Sirius foundation in Haiti owned by possibly the richest man in Haiti.  I also found that the Clinton foundation was supporting something called Belzeb ((Beelzebub(Baal-Zebub)) Coffee.</p>

            ba'al has some connection to Aleppo : "The word Ba'al can be translated as "lord", "owner", "master", or "husband", and referred to a group of deities venerated in the Levant. Some of these deities were also known under different names (e.g., the storm god Hadad of Aleppo), in which case Ba'al was a title; in other cases, Ba'al appears to have been a name. The oldest references to him are personal names from the third millennium BCE."
