            You should know that the symbolism is much much deeper than simply the lingo of pedophiles. Hotdog and Pizza are at the root of the "Illuminati". This isn't just a sex scandal. This is how these freaks run the world: with symbols.

            I'm also working on a poster or brochure.  My thought is to play up the potential danger our children are in.  Everybody except the pedos is interested in child safety.  Maybe, "Your Children Are Targets"  "What Is Happening To Our Children"  "Your Children May Be Under Surveillance"  My$.02.

           <p>
            maybe use same method for printing/disguise purch via cab method
           </p>
           <p>
            do it in high traffic time and when questioned tell people you work for a marketing company smile shrug laugh tell them you have a family including a 4 legged friend thats expensive to feed.  make your response light hearted with a smile.
           </p>
           <p>
            dispose of said disguise at a bar/rest. bathroom &amp; have the bartender call you a cab after a casual meal/beer.
be happy and play cool with everything maybe have a beer or glass of wine.

            Love you too, boo. I'm going to do the same, let me know with an edit where you are with flier development and I'll assist and then fund my own print and drop off. Agree we still need to keep this in the forefront, no time to rest now, there's still kids in cages.

            Don't forget to write #PizzaGate and the voat link on all your paper money. I've been doing it for weeks and weeks now and all that money is now in circulation... Everyone carries cash. Remember the I Grew Hemp carton speech balloon on the dollar bills back in the 90s? Nah, that wasn't me. But the concept is effective.

            Would be great if we can print a bunch of high politicians famous faces who had been arrested/charged with sex crimes against children asking ''coincidence? want to know the truth? investigate pizzagate'' Normies need visual reclaim and facts. Nowadays people forget scandals easy one by one. Seeing 10 or 15 faces together create visual memory impact.

            In 1800/ NY state after a bunch of high profile Masonic murders people used flyers on trees to start an anti Masonic party and revolt.  If people are gonna censor PG online we have to take it offline the old fashioned way. Don't forget using magic markers in bathroom stalls. Tons of graffiti in bathroom stalls.

            I would put these up any place where you think a bunch of parents will see them. I'm not suggesting you post this near a playground, but I keep feeling like we are missing a huge opportunity to red pill the moms of America. There is nothing scarier than a bunch of pissed Moms.
           </p>
           <p>
            I walked a young mother through some of the evidence over the weekend afree she told me about a kids youtube channel that was totally inappropriate. She was so shocked when i told her how deep this goes and then she was very very angry.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we would start to see changes in a couple of ways if we could get Moms more involved. Large companies advertise to them specifically because they often control household budgets. If we could unite a bunch of angry Moms we could hit these people were it counts. 1 - they would stop posting all of their kids pictures on facebook/whatever so much. That would remove a lot of eye candy of these sickos. 2 - they would be more vigilant in public and maybe help catch some of these people and 3 - they could choose to buy smarter and stop putting so much money in the hands of people who want to abuse their children.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to flyers I suggest we start lighting up the boards at babycenter.com . There are tons of parents there from all over the world. I've seen a pizzagate post or two, but they were laughed off. Anybody have a good post they want to throw up there? The Bargain hunters board would be a good place.

             I could do some sort of a "MAPG" or "MAHT" Moms against PG or Moms against Human Trafficking angle in ANOTHER set of flyers, to appeal to the mom demographic? Pander those flyers particularly towards mothers. There are tons of single mothers out there that are millenialls and will know how to navigate social media on their smartphone. How do you make one of those "barcode" looking things? Are those still relevant? You pull out your camera and place it over this weird looking square bar code, and it takes you to a link.

            State some startling and creepy facts.  Can't think of good ones off the top of my head but ones that make people say "WTF?!" Maybe like the FB I ran the largest CP site in history (if that's the case), the NCMEC get paid $X from Congress, have access to all the CP on their own private servers with no over site and yet their success rate is X.  Did maybe like that. And end with "Pizzagate isn't about pizza." The facts need to be interesting,  head scratching. Better than my examples. :)

            I would define pizzagate real fast like- pizzagate is an uncovering of pedophiles and child trafficking rings of the most influential in society....then put known facts like how many people go missing and info on people like dennis hastert, jimmy saville, norway, a little overview of the many elite who have been revealed. You need quick definition, stats and previous busts. Thanks for doing this!

            ""THEY Insist that #PIZZAGATE is fake news; but is it really? Research and YOU decide". Then maybe with a smaller font:
"Consider that there is a war on alternative information going on. History taught us where this totalitarian behavior leads.  We the people are not here for any political reason, all we want is the security of children who dont have a voice to be heard.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the backside I would put questions, that "normal" citizens would ask themselves..like:
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it possible that something that sounds like a bad horror-movie could be reality?
Then I would provide a link about the Jimmy Saville case and ask the same question again.. who was knighted by the Queen and hang out with all the royals..turns out he was a child predator and provided children over decades!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I would put a link to the Belgium case with Marc Dutroux, who was a "nobody" but received lots and lots of money by anonymous people so he could provide them also with children.
            <strong>
             27 witnesses died before court-hearing.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Dont forget to mention senator Nancy Schaefer at some point.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end I would write something like: 
All these cases were mentioned by witnesses and some researchers years before they came to light, but nobody wanted to listen. It was our inability to react which allowed the continuous suffering of more children.

            Or something like that. If you can correct the mainstream media's bs definition of pizzagate and replace it with the truth, that would be great. Then you've debunked all the articles they will find when they Google pizzagate, since those all use the incorrect definition (pizzagate is a bunch of loonies who made up a story about Hillary and a pizza shop basement).

            Good Job OP.  I like it.  More and more people are finding out.  I would suggest considering areas of town that are missing from our little insular consciousness.  I would consider upper class hippie areas (maybe Whole Foods and Yoga places?)  They are interested in new information.  Also working class areas. Be safe.  They know damn well that the rules are for thee not me mentality of the elites.  They also treasure family.  Remember in Spanish/ Tagalong or whatever ethnic group it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            :) Best of luck my friend.

            Can I suggest maybe saying on it "what is Pedogate?" Because if you Google what is pedogate instead of Pizzagate you don't get all the BS that google MSM and everyone else have associated with Pizzagate. Pedogate takes you straight to results with headlines like "elite pedophiles" and another attention grabbers

             I will put a disclaimer of some sort to let the person know that "Pizzagate" and "fake news" are virtually side by side in the Google trends, and that there is a coordinated effort to stamp us out in the mainstream media.

              And meanwhile pizzagate remains a ridiculous and obviously fictitious conspiracy theory and therefore no arrests are ever gonna materialize out of it.

            , can you stick a link in here to something related -- like maybe PizzagateHowie periscope, or some particularly effective posters you've seen, or ineffective ones, so this can be left up? Right now, it's an unsourced discussion post that we will have to remove if we don't want to get busted for censoring when we remove the unsourced discussion posts by shitposters like PGisStupid ad his ilk.

            Check these out! These came from /pol and the person has a couple like this. I think these are great to peak interest. I'm not sure if this link will work but if it doesn't, I'll look for another way to share.

            I am not sure how aware of Saville everyone is over there but covering up at the BBC for 20 odd years then managing the NYT - the main "debunkerer" of PG seems pretty relevant to me. Keep up the good work and positivity dude. Would love for you to keep us posted with designs and ideas for some food for thought for the rest of us here.

             Yes! This is another one from /pol. I've linked a couple so far but this is a great one to peak interest in Saville.

            Nice motivation op. I always think some type of mystery can motivate people to further research something. Like a while back someone was suggesting a flier with something like "THEY Insist  that #pizzagate is fake news; but is it really? Research and YOU decide" with some links and pictures.  I never like people ordering me what to think, so something like that angle might intrigue some people.

             Simply being exposed to the evidence will redpill anyone. They just need to dedicate a little time to sift through it all. I was gradually redpilled over the course of an hour. It's slowly dawning on me the immensity of it all. How long it's been going on.

            Depending on your town I guess, if you're near an elite pedo hotzone, it may be worth researching the way home printers can be identified by in-built "finger-printing" security measures. Supposedly to combat counterfeiting, but you just know civic resistance was also under their gaze.

              Oh I'm definitely going to include the name.   The re-branding thing to me was always a Psy op.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, I'm not gonna put Pizzagate in 64 BOLD font in blood red or anything like that lol, but I will at least include the hashtag.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll include the FBI document, the symbols. I'm using Ben Swann's video as a guideline on how to "condense" the most incriminating and thought provoking evidence onto one piece of paper.

             Good point though, let's think for a second: Places TONS of people Congregate...
I attend a major university. It's a "regional campus", but still a legit campus, although relatively small. I will be plastering each buildings bulletin boards with my fliers.

            If it turns out really great, you should upload a PDF version so other people can easily print and use in their own cities and town. I've also seen #pizzagate is real on dollar bills...

Get a bald cap from a costume shop for security cameras.

            Graphic should include comparison between FBI and a pizza logo, as people instinctively trust three letter official orgs' documents and every inhabited place in the u.s. has pizza shops.

- chickenlover
- girl with arms taped
            </p>
            <p>
             Be sure to include some of the original emails too. They are facts and what sparked Pizzagate. Good (bad) emails include:
- pizza-related map 
- dominos on cheese or pasta 
- $65,000 hot dogs
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're playing up the media censorship angle:
You could show a graphic of the Rise of "Fake News" vs "Pizzagate" on google search trends. The timing lines up perfectly: they pushed "fake news" directly in response to the breaking of this scandal.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you share the VOAT link, you might want to mention that it's being censored/hidden from Google search results for PG. Back in February, VOAT was at the top of Google. Today, it's not there. There is a legal notice at the bottom of the google page. Look for yourself.

             Ah, I like this.  A bunch of famous names all over the page.  Even good guys. Them in the middle (circle or something) "Pizzagate isn't about pizza.  Look for yourself.  The children depend on it. " or something like that.

              That sucks but a neck tattoo would play it off well.  Neck tattoos, however, while helpful to get pussy, tend to make you more identifiable. So do it after the fliers.

            Oh Thank You. I highly suggest no SRA and just focusing on the sex trafficking and missing children.  Kids tug at the heart. Please let us know how it works out and what experiences you might have as you tack them up.  You must be pretty excited to be going . Am glad you will have help and not trying to do this on your own.   Good Luck!
