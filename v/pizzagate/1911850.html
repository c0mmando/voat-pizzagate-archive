            People are kept poor for a reason. They will work for slave wages just to survive. Rich people can look like heroes when they help poor people. Money can be raised with pitiful pictures by psuedo-religious organizations to fund another large group of heroes who get invited to political events and serve as character witnesses for otherwise corrupt politicians. IT'S A CIRCUS.

            Yes. Yunus invented microcredit, purportedly to help the poorest of the poor.  In fact, microcredit drives the poor even further into debt which they cannot repay. Yunus heavies like Abdus Satar then place inordinate pressure on the borrowers. When they can't repay the debt, they are forced to sell a kidney. People like Satar are the go-betweens....from organ donor to organ trafficker.  Why was Yunus awarded a Nobel Prize?  Why did heavies like Clinton, WHO and UN go in to bat for Yunus, who preyed upon his own people to feather his own nest.  What other dirty stuff is he up to?

            I think this is interesting, and hope something comes of it. Clinton's relationship with Yunus seems fishy, even beyond all the obvious money corruption. He constantly asked for favors when Clinton was secretary. He'd communicate with her via Melanne Verveer, search wikileaks for that name. Verveer and Clinton started a human rights non-profit that focused on human trafficking back in the 90s. Was there more to Yunus's relationship with Clinton?
            <br/>
            But just given what we know on the surface, she needs investigation, and people need punished. The public is willing to let her off the hook because she lost the race!

              It is not illegal to unmask.  the problem is when it is done for political purposes,  or it is based on fake intelligence, which is known to be fake.  Then it is illegal.

               The problem was that Nunes falsely portrayed it this way for political purposes.  He implied there was something unethical about what Susan Rice did and there was not.

               This is confused.   Unmaksing by definition is someone responding to a real piece of US intelligence.  Policymakers/officials are not bringing their own intelligence fake or otherwise into the deal.   They are reading something captured/prepared by the US Intel agencies and that has already been masked by the US Intel agencies.   It Susan Rice's case, she was asking about transcripts of U.S. surveillance of foreign targets.   The intelligence was signals intelligence which means there's a recording of this.   Susan Rice had nothing to do with capture, reocording or creation of this transcript.  It would be impossible for her to do so.

"I saw no evidence of any wrongdoing," said one U.S. official who reviewed the documents, who would not agree to be identified further. "It was all completely normal."  His assessment was shared by a senior Republican aide who had been briefed on the matter but declined to speak on the record.

               The unmaksing controversy is a very clumsy attempt to change the conversation.   Because they know what's about to happen this week.

             "...a political action committee affiliated with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, who has ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, contributed almost $500,000 to the 2015 Virginia state Senate campaign of McCabe’s wife, Jill McCabe. (She lost the election.) She also received $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is connected to McAuliffe, a Democrat.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, wrote a letter to Comey on March 28 expressing concerns about McCabe’s involvement in the Clinton emails matter, given the donations that his wife received. “These circumstances undermine public confidence in the FBI’s impartiality,” Grassley wrote."

            Muhammad Yunus: Economist
           </p>
           <p>
            Added by Editor on August 11, 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Muhammad Yunus’s vision is the total eradication of poverty from the world. ‘Grameen’, he claims, ‘is a message of hope, a programme for putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long’.
           </p>
           <p>
            This work is a fundamental rethink on the economic relationship between the rich and the poor, their rights and their obligations. The World Bank recently acknowledged that ‘this business approach to the alleviation of poverty has allowed millions of individuals to work their way out of poverty with dignity’.
           </p>
           <p>
            Credit is the last hope left to those faced with absolute poverty. That is why Muhammad Yunus believes that the right to credit should be recognized as a fundamental human right. It is this struggle and the unique and extraordinary methods he invented to combat human despair that Muhammad Yunus recounts here with humility and conviction. It is also the view of a man familiar with both Eastern and Western cultures on the failures and potential for good of industrial countries. It is an appeal for action: we must concentrate on promoting the will to survive and the courage to build in the first and most essential element of the economic cycle Man.
See Yunus Center, Vision. "
           </p>
           <p>
            "Professor Muhammad Yunus established the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983, fueled by the belief that credit is a fundamental human right. His objective was to help poor people escape from poverty by providing loans on terms suitable to them and by teaching them a few sound financial principles so they could help themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Dr. Yunus’ personal loan of small amounts of money to destitute basketweavers in Bangladesh in the mid-70s, the Grameen Bank has advanced to the forefront of a burgeoning world movement toward eradicating poverty through microlending. Replicas of the Grameen Bank model operate in more than 100 countries worldwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Born in 1940 in the seaport city of Chittagong, Professor Yunus studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh, then received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt in 1969 and the following year became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. Returning to Bangladesh, Yunus headed the economics department at Chittagong University.
           </p>
           <p>
            From 1993 to 1995, Professor Yunus was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women, a post to which he was appointed by the UN secretary general. He has served on the Global Commission of Women’s Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance."

            I have more links, will post later.  Just a note:  Micro finance seems to be quite a lucrative concept, otherwise one wonders why a poor person would be able to secure micro finance loans from multiple NGOs with no oversight (up to 4 that I've read about), can't pay on first loan?  Pay it off with second loan (larger loan of course), repeat several times...finally, when completely overwhelmed by the "help" of debt offered from eager NGOs seeking to uplift your life, then sell a kidney to pay off the whole thing, or sell a child into sex slavery...it's a Globalist's win win, exploiting humanity for profit from many angles, while garnering awards and nobel peace prizes to appear like such a great person to the sheeple.

              Because I have a lot of info/links on Yunus, I'm putting in info where I can...there's a big picture of some sort coming into view I think.  The USAID funding of pyramid scheme style marketing under the auspices of 'helping people'?  Enter a poor country to 'help' them. Lure in 'investors' who don't know the whole picture of black market ties to organ harvesting, drug trafficking, child sex trafficking, slavery etc...anything that can be exploited is exploited.

             I have been a micro-lender for years and have re-lent to the same entrepreneurs over and over. Yet I do believe that there is usury in micro-loans. From my vantage point (doing it for 0% interest) it didn't raise a question but within the affected countries (SE Asia) there seems to be massive corruption and misery tied to this format. Perhaps cryptocurrency would help us lend directly to entrepreneurs... because it's the middleman... it's always the middleman who gives cancer to all business systems.

              Thanks for the info...lending and credit, lines of credit etc. are not a bad thing.  Like you said, it's the predatory lending that drives the tragic results. And in the case of predatory or unregulated mico finance in poor countries, the organ harvesting 'middlemen' have an easy time preying on those struggling with debt.  What would be interesting is to find a link between those middlemen and some of the NGOs who help the poor dig the hole into debt.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm still plugging in info, it's a huge topic
              <em>
               I had mentioned "up to 4" as a number of NGOs lending to one poor person, I remembered incorrectly, it was double the number.

              The Bangladesh poor selling organs to pay debts
             </p>
             <p>
              "Mohammad Akhtar Alam, 33, bears a 15-inch scar on his stomach where he had a kidney removed. The organ removal - which is illegal in Bangladesh unless the organ is being given to a spouse or family member - combined with the inadequate post-operative care he received, has left him partially paralysed, with only one eye working and unable to do any heavy lifting. 
To earn money, he runs a small shop in the village that sells rice, flour and the occasional sweet treat."
             </p>
             <p>
              "A couple of years ago Mr Alam's income from driving a van was not enough to make the weekly loan repayments he was required to make from up to eight different non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which lend microcredit "One day [a man] rode in my van and asked me why I was doing this," he recalls.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I told him that I was very poor and that I had loans from seven or eight NGOs. I owed about 100,000 taka [$1,442; £900] and I could not return the money to the NGOs. I used to try and sell furniture and things for cooking to try to repay the money."
Mr Alam had got caught in a web of loans in which he first borrowed money from one NGO and, when he was unable to pay it off, he borrowed from other NGOs.
             </p>
             <p>
              His passenger worked as a middleman between organ seller and recipient and persuaded him to sell a kidney, promising 400,000 taka ($6,360; £4,000).
Seventeen days later, Mr Alam says he returned home from a private hospital in Dhaka, barely alive and carrying only a fraction of the money he was promised.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I agreed to sell my kidney because I couldn't return the money to the NGOs. As we are poor and helpless, that is why we are bound to do this. I regret it," he says.
             </p>
             <p>
              So just giving a poor person $1500 to free them from a spiraling debt isn't charitable, but letting him sell a kidney is?

               Thanks for the additional info. I am being brief here but I am saving everything related to this so I can look further into this. I have followed Yunus' career and I have his book as well as many others on the development of this lending model. I will look into it further. The agenda is quite booked until July 4th weekend! Thanks so much for your work.

                "An investigation by The Daily Caller uncovered that Muhammad Yunus, who in 2011 was ousted as managing director of the Blangladesh-based Grameen Bank amid corruption charges, benefitted from grants, contracts and loans by the State Department while it was under the direction of Clinton.
Yunus has also been revealed to be a Clinton Foundation donor."
