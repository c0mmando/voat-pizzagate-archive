<p>That requires a technological system to support this type of activity.  I think we understand through the recent shenanigans with Twitter, Facebook, Google, that the people who run these platforms are possibly compromised.  Indeed Google has military origins.

<p>Recently, through my own investigations of the Hampstead case, I was alerted to a United Arab Emirates satellite broadcasting company <a href="http://yahlive.com/">Yahlive</a> .  The Hampstead angle is another chapter of this book, so I won’t go into that here.
Yahlive is a very important broadcasting company for the Arab world. <a href="http://www.satelliteprome.com/news/saudi-tv-channels-exclusively-on-yahlive-in-hd/">Saudi TV channels use this company exclusively</a>.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a very strong influence in Washington.  This article lays out how much they spend on lobbying <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/adding-it-up-the-top-players-in-foreign-agent-lobbying-718">https://www.propublica.org/article/adding-it-up-the-top-players-in-foreign-agent-lobbying-718</a></p>
<p>The UAE ambassador to Washington is <strong>Yousef Al Otaiba</strong>.  The following lengthy Huffington Post article contains much background information on him and describes his great influence in DC.  As a philanthropist he is highly involved with children’s charities too.  I highly recommend taking the time to read it.
<strong><a href="http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/his-town/">Yousef Al Otaiba is the most charming man in Washington: He\'s slick, he\'s savvy and he throws one hell of a party. And if he has his way, our Middle East policy is going to get a lot more aggressive.</a></strong> </p>
<p>excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of this, though, pales next to a quiet diplomatic achievement that has been unfolding in the Northeast’s tech manufacturing corridor. Otaiba often touts the fact that a UAE-owned firm named GlobalFoundries made a multi-billion-dollar bid to take over several plants in upstate New York and Vermont that are responsible for IBM’s entire microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing business. The acquisition was so sensitive that it had to be cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, since it would mean that one of the Department of Defense’s most trusted providers of semiconductors for weapons systems, aircraft and other government technology would be replaced by a foreign-owned entity. The deal won approval on June 30, less than a decade after the Dubai Ports World debacle. There was no outrage on Fox News, no protests in Congress—least of all from the UAE\'s onetime nemesis, Chuck Schumer, who has praised GlobalFoundries’s takeover of the plants as “great news about the Capital Region and its economic future.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hollywood Connection</strong></p>
<p>A speculative article on Yousef’s Malibu connections:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.yolandaslittleblackbook.com/blog-1/2016/05/07/201655why-does-ambassador-yousef-al-otaiba-need-a-50-million-compound-in-malibu/">Why does Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba need a $50 million compound in Malibu?</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Otaiba also has a reputation for exceedingly generous charitable contributions to a whole host of philanthropic causes. He’s also well-known for his penchant to throw extravagant parties for his select circle of high-powered Washington politico contacts. There was that one time he flew Wolfgang Puck from LA to his Virginia home to cook dinner for his family and a few guests. You know. Just your typical, everyday dinner party.</p>
<p>As it happens, Yolanda was researching His Excellency when we discovered something interesting – or at least interesting to us. His Excellency is (allegedly) besties with our very own boy <strong>Jho Low</strong>. In fact, His Excellency has (allegedly) been involved in several business deals with the very shady (and extensively legally-embattled) Mr. Low. He and Mr. Low are – or were – both significant shareholders in something called the <strong>Abu Dhabi-Kuwait-Malaysia Investment Corporation (ADKMIC)</strong>, a British Virgin Islands-registered investment company. That’s according to Mr. Low himself, not Yolanda.</p>

            Ah, finally I may understand what happened to a college classmate of mine.  She was murdered the weekend before the Seth Rich murder.  She was a satellite expert who lived in an upscale Baltimore neighborhood.  Stabbed to death, while walking her dog.  She was a big supporter of HRC and, just maybe, she stumbled across something satellite related that got her Arkansided?  Maybe this was it or did she realize that cell towers are being used for more than phones and texting?  I am almost afraid to even write about this.  She is the closest person I have known who ended up dead under shady circumstances.  (Before going to work with satellites, she was a big public policy wonk).

             Thank you for your comment.  I believe that I can deduce who you refer to.  It seems that Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications (LMGT) took over the company that she used to work with. I will delve a little further.

             Recently, through my own investigations of the Hampstead case, I was alerted to a United Arab Emirates satellite broadcasting company Yahlive . The Hampstead angle is another chapter of this book, so I won’t go into that here. Yahlive is a very important broadcasting company for the Arab world. Saudi TV channels use this company exclusively.

            Several years ago I performed data recovery for a US based satellite TV company owned by a middle eastern man (clearly an arabic name and accent). This recovery was on an 8TB RAID array. Most cases someone removed a wrong disk or did something to crash the array and it just needs to be reassembled, mounted and fsck it. So the first part of recovery is examining the system logs for different things like disk/power/filesystem events. Well this system had a slew of file system errors all which showed there were video files with names that all had ages in them like "8 yo" all the way to "16 yo" and some with pornographic titles. I was able to recover the RAID part with the data on it and I checked the folder these files were in and there were
            <strong>
             thousands of these videos
            </strong>
            . I checked the folder size and it was obviously the purpose of this storage device since it over 80% of the storage space being used.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was told I would likely find CP after enough time doing DR, so I documented what I did, per our SOP, reported it to my director and he reported it to the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had this feeling at the time that the whole satellite thing was being used as a front to distribute CP but I just told myself it was being handed off to better people and that was all I could do to help. I'm dumbfounded the guy just acted so casual about it and didn't think anyone would notice what the dataset consisted of. I don't poke around in people's data, but couldn't justify to not do anything in this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't recall the company name but I do remember it was on the east coast since I had to coordinate between timezone differences.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still in shock at the emergence of the "streaming" industry. Look at twitch, all it does is host people streaming games and it sold for a billion dollars. The hardware and internet bandwidth needed to host streaming services is readily available to the public, anyone can go rent a server these days, and you can even purchase "anonymous hosting" with bitcoin through TOR. Hell you can even rent a server hosted in a raid proof bomb bunker. For the handling of the video, there is open source software for encoding/streaming/encryption. The whole streaming thing seems to of started with "camgirls" and this idea has been around for a while now.

            Have run video cam servers, for 6 usd per month and a little know how, you can have a server anywhere in the world with capacity for about 25+ x HD ready steams many more if lower quality. Using a piece of free software RED5 for the video encoding.

            The infrastructure already exists, dedicated systems would be WAY to obvious for majority case uses. Hiding in plain sight and agility are critical to hiding something like this.
