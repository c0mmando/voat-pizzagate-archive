            ThIs kind of thing is so important but /and it is really overwhelming. I know that's so much takes place on a global scale but it feels hopeless sometimes like it's so big and wide and deep and high ... how can anything any of us do that will really make any difference in the end.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm an atheist and nothing has challenged my faith non-beliefs as has pizza gate. I knew that they're all sorts of globalist agendas taking horrific tolls, unending as far into the future as I can conceive of. but it was finally in this that I had an overpowering feeling that this was a spiritual battle between good and evil. evil is not a word that I ever use. I do use it now period and to show you just how far this has affected me comma I have on several occasions felt the overwhelming need to run to my closest Target store go right to the jewelry counter and bar necklace with a crucifix on it. I still might..

             I believe in Christ's teachings. I advise everyone who feels that there's something more to this to mediate everyday and look within, as almost all philosophies and Gnostic Christians preach. Look into catharism and their teachings. Lucifer controls this world and the Roman Catholics, Satanists, Moloch worshipers and Luciferians believe it.

             Thank you for your painfully honest comment. I read it with a sick feeling as it struck home as something I could have written about myself.

            <p>
             What is PizzaGate if not a battle of good against evil. I wouldn't have imagined I would have said something so melodramatic a few months ago. But it children FFS. The purest, most naive and innocent among us, not tainted by the accumulated crap of modern human experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             I look at my two sons, 4 mths and 3yrs, and feel a sense of dread for their future and also an overwhelming guilt I've brought them into this world. I hope it passes and I am am going through some form of PTSD.  I think to a large extent the Pg community is a self help community of people suffering PTSD and also cognitive dissonance over our shattered world view.
            </p>
            <p>
             PG is like a hole ripped into the fabric of how the world really works and we've all got a glimpse of how much evil really exists behind the scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Christianity, yes I am with you there. A lifelong atheist / agnostic, who now has a sense (still fighting with) that we are living through a time which may we'll be a crossroads in human history, a point where two strikingly different paths lie ahead. Maybe this is Biblical and this is the test which is so clearly good and evil, that we've got this one final chance to pick a side. Maybe it's a spiritual test on an individual level as much as a spiritual battle on a larger scale. I feel weird even writing this but that's what I've been wrestling with.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've pondered on how Trump and Melania both deliberately invoked God, something not done for a long time. How jarring is it to see the Hollywood and Illuminati music industry invoking Satanic curses on Trump while the media normalises and promotes it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I definitely feel like a boat which has lost its anchor and can see a storm ahead.

             I'm not religious but one thing I appreciate about Christianity is it associates God with truth and Satan with lies.  Considering one thing that Pizzagate researchers want is the truth to come out.  Assuming Hillary were to release her 650,000 emails and they demonstrate without a doubt that she is innocent I would be fine with that.  I just want the truth to see the light of day.
