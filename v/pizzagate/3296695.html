<blockquote>
<p>[Jailed pedophile doctor Michael Salmon] authored 38 scientific papers and a text book used by doctors, chaired the World Paediatric Congress held in 1986 and served on a number of professional bodies, including the Royal College of Physicians. Shortly before his first arrest, Salmon was hailed by Princess Diana for taking 300 ill and disabled children to Disney World in Florida. He was asked to join the inaugural Dreamflight charity trip, <strong>co-founded by former British Airways cabin crew member Patricia Pearce</strong> in 1987, as chief medical officer. The former doctor said he was phoned by British Airways and asked to pick 300 \'very sick and handicapped\' children who would benefit from the once-in-a-lifetime experience. Princess Diana waved the flight off from Heathrow Airport, with 298 young children aboard, including one of the girls who later claimed Salmon indecently touched her during a medical appointment.</p>

<p>One resident said: ‘He told us he was related to the Percy family of Northumberland. He went up to Alnwick Castle and he said he could see the family likeness in the portraits.’</p>

<p>So, the British press have long gone on about how well the Middleton girls have done in terms of who they associated with and eventually married.. the MSM narrative is that this is a middle class family of British Airways employees who did well for themselves.. WAIT,  British Airways??</p>
<p>See this post on : <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3109919">The Middletons and British Airways</a></p>

<p>The company began when the family returned to the UK from Jordan, where Mr Middleton had been managing an international air station for British Airways...</p>

            In another report, which is on the Arizona state website (

             Notice in the top right hand corner in the menu entitled General, a link called Cache of Cheese Pizza.

            This is further evidence that the pizza code is known to the US government and to THORN.

            As for Jeffrey Epstein, his brother Mark Epstein, has many links with the United Nations through organisations like the Humpty Dumpty Foundation, for example.

            Notice that media stories on Jeffrey tend to omit any information on Mark. There is a reason for that.

            The scandal is global, and huge.
