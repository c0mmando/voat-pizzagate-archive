            I wondered the same thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've watched a few of Pastor Manning's  ytubes  claiming that Obama  came out of a Chicago  church,  Reverend Jeremiah Wright,   that catered to alternative  lifestyle.
           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzdc8LBp_qY
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            E.T. Elliot, the doctor of common sense,  came out and did a vid  about the  gay sex inside the whitehouse, which he claims he saw the vid.     I can't find that ytube now, but I watched it a few weeks ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            These 2 brutha's can be pretty wild,   so some might say that they're  not trustworthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying that being gay means there's pedo-crime involvement.    I'm just saying that there appears to be people like  Joan Rivers who   also made some claims about their sexuality,  and   it appears that  there is information that they're not telling the public, or are hiding from the public .
           </p>
           <p>
            If they're  lying about  their sexuality, are they also lying to cover-up  other sexual activity, whether they're engaged in it directly or not?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the question that arises.
           </p>
           <p>
            Larry Sinclair did a press conference talking about Obama in ways that claim  Obama lied about the era of his  cocaine use and his sexuality.
           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lrf8DbrJH0
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If Larry Sinclair is right,  and  I didn't see Obama  filing a counter suit against him  (did you?)    then maybe there's something  to this.
           </p>
           <p>

            Larry Sinclair is considered dead now,  which is just another dead body in the long list of the present whitehouse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis  visits to the whitehouse  doesn't look that strange now does it?

            Or like... any proof of the party, assuming it wasn't a purely "private affair". Like... what was he doing the day of the "party"? Where/when/how did it take place?
