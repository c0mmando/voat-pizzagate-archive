            Alex Jones is good for one thing: wasting my time with distraction. Every click bait tweet sucks an hour of my life away for 45 minutes of ranting about vaccines and 15 minutes making wild unfounded claims from CIA, FBI, NBA sources (aka handlers).

            I'm not trying to throw Jones under the bus. The man probably didn't have time to look into it. If somebody were to sit down with him and carefully review the findings, while distinguishing them from the many false leads, he would understand.

             Too bad he doesn't have a staff, and isn't making millions to do exactly this. Too bad he couldn't hold his mouth until he did find the extra few hours to properly research. Wonder hwy he's got a gig as a reporter if he doesn't know how to carve out enough time to educate himself?

              He does have a staff and a couple of them fucked up and reported erroneous stuff. All of the instagram photos were real, the emails were real, but there were false leads thrown in (like the fake "menu" that was found on a comp). It looks like one or more of those reporters ran with those false leads and got him in legal trouble.

               OK, here's the thing. You are now the 3rd person to claim that there was more than one instance of erroneous reporting, yet no one ever cites anything besides Biggs.
              </p>
              <p>
               Biggs was fired immediately, meaning Alex would not at this time be in any legal trouble over what Biggs posted (and I believe it never got further than Biggs' Twitter stream, it wasn't on InfoWars).

              Jones is currently being exploited and used by everyone, die hard PG researchers, the mainstream media, and even James Alefantis. Jones is in a no win situation, but I would stake my life on one simple truth. Jones has not been lying for the last twenty-years when he said time and again that if given the opportunity he would tear the mandible off of any pedophile and beat them with it until exhausted. He had Nancy Schaefer on about CPS child kidnapping rings five years before VOAT even existed, and was perhaps the first person to state publicly she was murdered by the PTB to cover up same. He mentions Schaefer probably once a week since she was murdered. That's over three hundred times by my reckoning, not to mention the thousands of other references he's made to the satanic child kidnapping sex rings and snuff films.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can certainly question Jones's specific actions on the legal front at this particular time, but questioning his sincerity in wanting to destroy all pedophiles is an error of biblical proportion.

                V___Z, the reason we differ on opinions of Alex Jones is because I've listened to him very regularly for many years, and you've merely adopted all the talking points of his many enemies, the same kind of short sighted enemies who level every ridiculous charge against David Seaman. You've probably watched mostly compilations of Alex Jones produced by others, which after 22 years on air and tens of thousands of hours of programming, selective editing can paint anyone with just about any brush desired.
               </p>
               <p>
                What makes you think Jones's followers agree on all of his tactics or are incapable of filling in a gap here and there that Jones might leave un-elaborated for tactical reasons? I am not a gambling man, but I would wager that on a point by point basis, you and Jones would agree on the majority of talking points about global geopolitics the PTB, and child sex trafficking. Most importantly, in direct response to your post, let the record show that Jones absolutely savages Jews and Zionists day in and day out. Let me repeat that with emphasis.
                <strong>
                 Jones absolutely savages Jews and Zionists day in and day out.
                </strong>
                Whether it's the Rothschild's, Janet Yellen, Alan Greenspan, Rahm Emmanual, Sumner Redstone, Cass Sunstein, Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Alan Derschowitz, Chuck Schumer, Diane Feinstein, Michael Bloomberg, etc., no Jew escapes his wrath. Why Jones has eviscerated so many Jews since he's been on air, you'd have a much shorter list of the few prominent Jews he hasn't eviscerated instead of the ones he has. If you listened to the show as long as I have, you would know this.
                <strong>
                 The one thing he does not do is single them out as Jews
                </strong>
                . That is his God given right and prerogative you shorted sighted man. And that's the problem with the most vehement Jones haters, they're terribly misinformed. I defended your man Seaman ferociously time and time again for all the right reasons, and guess what, he's Jewish, and with the exception of Jones's retraction on Alefantis, Seaman holds Alex in much esteem.
               </p>
               <p>
                How do you remotely square your breathtaking hypocrisy here of liking Seaman, a Jew, and holding great ill will against Jones because Jones wouldn't dream of attacking Seaman solely because he's Jewish?

                 And further, the mere act of using terminology created by the very agencies we all know run the nastiest stuff on the planet does not remotely mean we use it correctly, or attribute same to the right people. What is the chance that the worst leaders, groups, and agencies which Jones has been going after for 22 years would love to have tens of thousands of Jones followers fall away because they think they've discovered he's a "limited hangout"? How difficult do you think it would be to have operatives create scads of material to convince people like you that he's a limited hangout?

               RWB, right. He is certainly committed to bringing down pedophile rings. No denying that. There is nothing wrong with him wanting to focus on the broader pedogate. It is just another way of arriving at the same conclusion that pizzagate arrives at.
              </p>
              <p>
               What should be dismissed is any comment from him that pizzagate is just a fake "honeypot" distraction. He came to that conclusion only because he was depending on staff and didn't adequately research. My guess is that he didn't have time with a million other news items in the cycle. It is quite real actually, he'd see that if he researches thoroughly.
