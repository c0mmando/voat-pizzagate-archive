             Was there a film made perhaps?  Was he paid for it?  I would not put it past anyone.  It certainly was a Satanic Ritual type of crime.  There may have been rape and also the baby was near birth if I remember correctly.  Was the baby given away to someone?  Was it really alive?  There are so many possibilities now that we know what they are capable of.   Years ago we never would have imagined those things, you know, when the news reports came out.

              Less than a year after the release of Rosemary’s Baby, Roman Polanski’s pregnant wife was ritualistically murdered by members of the Charles Manson family..... what would the odds be ?  ....... When Tate refused an abortion, Polanksi went back to London and had an affair with Michelle Phillips of The Mamas &amp; The Papas 
The author suspects that Charles Manson was paid $25,000 by a British satanic cult to target Tate

               Yes!  Wow, I wonder what secrets that might divulge.

               </a>
               Edit:   The book takes its title from the apocalyptic race war that Manson believed would occur, which in turn took its name from "Helter Skelter" by The Beatles.[2] Manson had been particularly fascinated by the Beatles' White Album, from which the song came.   VERY Interesting.
