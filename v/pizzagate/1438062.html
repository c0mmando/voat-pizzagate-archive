<p>I was on the Comet website and checked out their shows page, on which there is just one show advertised, which took place on October 28th 2016, featuring the bands ‘Pujol,’ ‘The Grey A’ and ‘Rom.’</p>
<p>Here is the creepy poster advertising the event</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cometpingpong.com/shows/">http://www.cometpingpong.com/shows/</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The illustration is credited to a Grace Macfarlane, and you can see a selection of her artwork here:</p>
<p><a href="http://portfolios.mica.edu/gallery/14212763/MICA-Competitive-Scholarship-2014">http://portfolios.mica.edu/gallery/14212763/MICA-Competitive-Scholarship-2014</a></p>
<p>As you can see, there are references to mind control, depression, freemasonry and cannibalism- but to name a few.</p>
<hr />
<p>But that’s not all.   Pujol (a Spanish word, pronounced \'poohole\') is the headline act. I had a quick look on Youtube to see if their videos would be as weird as some of the other bands who’ve played at Comet, and lo and behold, they are. I decided to focus on their video entitled “Sleepy Doni” as it really creeped me out.</p>
<p>Here’s the video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcXGc3oz0LA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcXGc3oz0LA</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I noticed there were subliminal words being flashed up on top of the already creepy and weird visuals, so I downloaded the video and ran it through After Effects so that it would throw out the single frames as PNGs, in order for me to pick out the words I was seeing.</p>
<p>In order, these words are:</p>
<p>love /
bunny /
bunny /
grow /
hold /
smile /
kiss /
touch /
touch /
you /
agape /
soul /
quiet /
try /
friend /
party /
doggie woggie /
gawd /
dance /
hug /
thanks /
blah blah</p>
<p>Here are the frames themselves; I’ve Photoshopped them into a single image for you:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/0LVDT">http://imgur.com/a/0LVDT</a></p>
<p>They’re all rather suggestive considering the childish theme and the lyrics themselves, but I found ‘AGAPE’ particularly interesting. Of course it can just mean having your mouth agape (again, suggestive) but I also wanted to point to another interpretation.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Agape</em> (Ancient Greek ἀγάπη, agápē) is &quot;love: the highest form of love, charity; the love of God for man and of man for God.&quot;[1] Not to be confused with philia – brotherly love – agape embraces a universal, unconditional love that transcends, that serves regardless of circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Here we could be being linked back to the familiar ‘boy love’ that we’ve seen all over the place; I found it interesting that \'philia\' is mentioned right there in the opening paragraph of the wiki page.</p>
<hr />
<p>Moving on to visuals, we’ve got the creepy eyes of Horus on the kid, the Satanic character looming in the darkness, and the ‘blowing mouths,’ which to me look more like what would happen when reflex anal dilatation occurs than someone blowing kisses...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reflex_anal_dilation">http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Reflex_anal_dilation</a></p>
<p>The mouths are also shown on pairs of hands that are doing the typical ‘fly like a butterfly’ action, and we all know what butterfly symbolism means.</p>
<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control">http://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Then there are the questionable lyrics, some of the strangest being:</p>
<p>Me and Doni /
Shave our eyebrows /
And clean the Ka-bar /
On a hotel towel /
Counting shekels in the moonlight /
With his mommy in a clerical cowl /</p>
<p>Make of those what you will; a ka-bar is knife, shekels are ancient Hebrew currency, and cowls can be associated with Satanic cults etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>Finally, here’s a hotdog themed promo poster for another show Pujol played at recently:</p>

<hr />
<p>Anyone got any more thoughts on these guys, and whether it\'s worth looking further into them and where they\'ve been playing?</p>
<p>It certainly looks like being creepy is a prerequisite for headlining a gig at Comet, at least!?</p>

            Yet 80% of American Jews have no connection with their biblical brethren.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Khazars converted ... they have NO genetic relation to the biblical jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            So &lt;white, non middle eastern&gt; Jews can only be connected to Judaism via religious beliefs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same way Ivanka Trump is only jewish by conversion to said religion, not genetics.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if you believe that you are 200% Jewish and not middle eastern, then you feel like this because of Tradition...not because it is in your blood ;-)

            It actually has a PIZZA PARTY BAND in it, and something to do with satanism, all in the first minute. They made a point of DOGGIE WOGGIE in the subliminal text in the music video, and here the pizza party band are all dressed as dogs. Could be a coincidence, could mean something. Who knows at this point!

            Here's a link to all their videos:

            I think we're wasting time with the bands. This place has had hundreds of bands come through. probably thousands. it's just speculation.

             We're not gunna find pictures of them raping children. That's what the FBI is for. A kids restaurant that promotes bands which talk about pedophilia is enough for an FBI investigation. Since they won't, this needs to get to enough people that it becomes a mass public outrage. No parent or normal person will accept pedophile art, propaganda, bands and sympathizers all in a fucking childrens restauraunt. Everyone needs to know this is going on.

               What I'm saying is, the public, if they were aware of pedophile references and art being exposed to children, they would demand an investigation. The FBI would be well within their rights to investigate. 'Comet Ping Pong is a fun, kid-friendly neighborhood pizza restaurant that has outdoor seating' that is the first line on their website.

               From Comet Ping Pong's (pre-pizzagate) Yelp reviews:

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                7/23/2015 The "hip" restaurant is apparently too "hip" for this 22-year old. Untethered children run about the restaurant, ignored by their parents, and obnoxious groups of teens and twenty-somethings rock the booths behind you and have roaring unabridged conversations. The managers and wait staff seem unfazed by the children treating the dining area as if it were a playground.

For a place that attracts so many families, we were shocked they had only one gross bathroom with no changing table. The food was good quality but overpriced considering the small portions and sarcastically unpleasant wait staff. Would much prefer neighboring options.

The comet is great for people who have kids. The back room is great for them to play in and has about 4-5 tables. It's always filled with families so do expect some screaming and background noise of children. The pizza is good for what's it's worth. It's not the greatest but it's still good.... politics and prose is next door so that's always a good thing.

             Not only that, but all these same bands play in similar small, often all-ages venues everywhere in the country. And I'm not talking about some secret network of pedo pizza places, I'm talking about the premier indie rock venues of a certain size in every city.

             This is the indie music scene, period.

              What? Talking about a fucking child on the corner blowing his kisses one at a time. Are you fucking serious? If this is the indie music scene they all need to be lined up and shot. They are clearly talking about prostituting a child, and are grooming all the children in the establishment.
