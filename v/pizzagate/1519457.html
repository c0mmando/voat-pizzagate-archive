           So as most of you know, there was a massive pedo bust in Norway very recently (I suspect because of interpol investigation stemming from wikileaks) and mainstream media initially reported but then quickly deleted all mention of it.  I have a strong feeling this is relevant information. It is extremely unusual the measures being taken to hide this.

            Fuck Wikipedia, they are a censorship platform. Look at their entry for pizzagate, its a joke. Either we strip the owners of their power or we need alternatives, because wikipedia deletes people who are notable like David Seaman.

            Somebody should expand on it and make it more visible. More not less is required to make the story critical mass.

            We need to also go directly after the press that is supressing this story. They newspapers usually have an "obudsman" or public editor - a quasi independent journalist who acts as a referee between the public and the paper to make sure the news is being reported accurately (in theory anyway) This person does actually respond to claims of censorship and wrongdoing by the paper and its reporters/editors.
           </p>
           <p>
            So we need to tweet, email, post all about the Norway story as much as possible.

             One of the more trustworthy journalists who follows the SPJ Rules/Ethics of Journalism
             <em>
              might
             </em>
             have a helpful word of advice, especially about the ethics of several "top" newspapers/news sites literally erasing the existence of the story, without any explanation or update. More than one of those sites all doing the exact same thing &amp; scrubbing it completely is more than a little suspicious.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know where she stands on this yet, but I can tell you that during the more heated debates on #GamerGate she stuck out her neck to listen &amp; even attend the AirPlay GamerGate event in Miami back in 2015, around the one year anniversary of #GamerGate. You know, the debate that was threatened to be blown up with a credible enough bomb threat that the second half had to be canceled?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, at the time she attended this, most every other "journalist" had written us off as everything ranging from "conspiracy theorists, tinfoil hat wearing MISOGYNISTS, SEXISTS, RACISTS, HOMOPHOBIC, TRANSPHOBIC, STRAIGHT WHITE MALE ASSHOLES" &amp; it was amazing that she gave us a chance to present our rather huge dossier of proof &amp; listen to our complaints in a public setting.
            </p>
            <p>
             She is pretty damn unbiased when it comes to news &amp; factual journalism. She might have some ideas. Might be worth it to ask her via tweets ✨🔥💥
             <strong>
              SPECIFICALLY AND ONLY in regards to the recent scrubbing of the Norwegian Pedo Ring Bust, JUST FOR THE TIME BEING ~ just to get our foot in the door with a well respected journalist who happens to be the President of the Society of Professional Journalists.

             Please don't overwhelm her, she could be a valuable voice in this. Her name is Lynn Walsh, of NBC 7 in San Diego. Set aside any disdain for MSM for a moment. She is going to be continuing into 2017 as President of the SPJ (Society of Professional Journalists).

            <p>
             If I find an infograph or quick, simple to see piece of info, I might do this myself &amp; report back. Like I said, I do not want to overwhelm her with multiple questions, just this particular issue to start with.

             I'm pretty nervous because it's so important to do this right.  /nervous shaking.   /jaw clenched. /deep breaths.

             Of course anyone can turn rotten or change their stance under the pressure of whoever wants to keep this silenced, but in the past several years I have seen nothing but accountability &amp; responsibility from this woman. She expects it of all journalists, too.

            There was one detail in the news story that can be read in the UK Independent version of the story that creates a legal crisis for the leftists and so they don't want to talk about the story and need to hide it. One of the participants was planning on raping his newborn as soon as it was born and I think it was to be live streamed on their network.  Although that is about the most horrendous thing imaginable, the left endorses or at least defends killing babies fresh out of the womb and murder is usually punished more harshly than rape. It makes it more difficult for them to justify late term abortion.

            <p>
             And regarding the "turtle" references, it makes me wonder why the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are always brought up within the Pizza Pedo Circles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, I remember that TMNTs ate pizza, &amp; we have plenty of ties to pizza references &amp; even actual pizza shops leading to the black heart of this whole thing, but did I miss TMNT being used in the Wikileaks Podesta emails or being in the code word list or specifically mentions the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or something?
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, I agree that this is a good idea that could really open some eyes.

              a cabal of the white knights that will camp wiki pages day and night, just waiting to revert any and every edit that he/they/their special little group disagrees with. And they are dying to label you all of the usual BULLSHITTERY in efforts to make sure you will be discredited and either banned or get the page locked and "protected" to ANY new edits.
              <strong>
               Even if new information comes out.

              They are SJWs on crack-steroids and if you don't fall in line with the SJW cult, it's proof that YOU ARE LITERALLY HITLER, YOU #RACIST #SEXIST #MISOGYNIST #TRANSPHOBIC #HOMOPHOBIC #ISLAMAPHOBIC #RIGHTWINGER #WHITESUPREMACIST #BERNIEBRO #TRUMPLOVER!
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah, over the past 2+ years, I learned that I am "a stupid white #GENDERTRAITOR who is suffering from #INTERNALISEDMISOGYNY and that I should kill my self for being a supporter of #GamerGate and #NotYourShield" from quite early on.
             </p>
             <p>
              HORRIBLE 'editors' on Wikipedia who will bury stuff if it doesn't fit the preferred narrative they've got going over there.

              They will also arbitrarily change what is considered a "reliable source" depending upon which sources share their preferred narrative. Arbitration and such barely took care of any of it. One nut got subject banned but kept right on editing and reverting edits he didn't like, took almost 2 years before they even got sick of his "dragon" ass and gave him the boot. I hear he haunts rational wiki or some other wiki now and now that I think of it I think he got chucked from one of those too.

              But yeah, bunch of goal-tending, nest-sitting, campers who will always cover for each other and are all suspected of having multiple sock puppet accounts. I learned that Wikipedia is even worse than I thought and recalling this crap has me clenching my jaw till it hurts and gives me a headache! Frustrating fuckers!

              Also, jimbo could NOT CARE LESS. He just shrugs, trusts the long-existing clique and claims that "everything will work itself out". Ask or tweet him more than once and he will start with the #LABELING of you too.*

             Sorry it's so long ("that's what he said" -Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflen Paper Company) but I wanted to include as much information/my personal experience with Wikipedia as possible.

             As others have said, I'm going to take a look at Infogalactic.com.

             re: your edit, if you're thinking about the post you see on this subreddit about wikipedia deleting info on the Pizzagate talk page, that was actually due to relevance. The info was irrelevant. A source like AP should be enough for an article on the Norway incident, even if it's only tangentially related to pizzagate (as far as we know!)

              SJWs and the left have and will edit and delete articles on Wikipedia that go against their narrative. If those news sites are deleting articles from their own sites you can bet your ass they go against that narrative.

            Its being scrubbed here too... I've managed to archive some from here.  The first from a place called sott.net has this

            about it, but interestingly on the right hand side in the latest news section, a 'NY man has taken thousands of babies into his safe haven'. Might be worth a nose about?

The BBC appears to have no knowledge of it, of at least its not allowing me to find it easily. But I found this from them relating to the Philippines from 2014 which has some interesting perspectives.

            The Daily Mail although a paper to be avoided usually because of its seemingly hateful nature does occasionally have its uses in that it turns its hate to include pedophilia, so often is the case that they have quite a lot of stories on the matter. 
There are also various operations with Scotland yard on the go with this topic.

             I can translate if necessary. 
I am from Norway.
My translation skills are at worst decent, and I would gladly dedicate my spare time to help this cause!
I even got an article on stand-by from a Norwegian newspaper regarding exactly what you're explaining. It is 1 month old.
