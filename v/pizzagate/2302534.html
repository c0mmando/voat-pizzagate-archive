<p>(15) Alcoholic child molesters are self-pitying, and they hate the child for &quot;making them do it.&quot;</p>
<p>I think Davis wrote &quot;Pop&quot; and sent it to Obama in college.</p>
<p>(16) Men who were molested are made to feel that they aren\'t real men. I think Obama published &quot;Pop&quot; in a fit of rage and self-loathing and defiance.</p>

            This is so unbelievably stupid.   And a good example of the deep belief of pizzagaters in prior conspiracies.  I also love how your quote begins at number 8 and misses the 7 crazy tweets before it.

             [(2) In 1999, I fell in love with a hippie.
We met in San Francisco and corresponded for 18 months.
(3) She invited me to Massachusetts, so I went.
I decided to surprise her at Whole Foods, where she was a grocery bagger.
(4) I sneaked up behind and said, "Excuse me, Missssssss" in an obnoxious, nasal voice.
When she turned and saw me, she fell back against the counter and burst into tears.

            So he's talking about damaged people, but he himself says the happiest 90 minutes of his life were waiting for a date with a hippie girl 20 years ago.   This does not sound like an undamaged person.

           <p>
            He then goes on to say

            Wictor is a genius. Someone needs to get him onto a Pizzagate discussion because he has a lot of influential people who follow him. It would benefit our cause greatly.

            Did Obama by any chance study acting at any point? That's all he was ever good for. Playing a part. The truth that obviously lies beneath is too twisted to believe he ever intended to be a benefit to our country. He obviously works overtime to undermine our President. And people still love him. The words brainwashed come to mind when I think of his followers.

              Nail on the fuckin' head, makes me wonder more about HRC potentially using Bernie Sanders to divide the left and snatch them up - the assumption being that they surely wouldn't flip over to supporting Trump... ie: Bernie was a decoy and/or backup option?

               "the left" is a term from the French revolution with no application elsewhere except as yet another EUPHEMISM for JEWISH ideologies.  Name any tenet of what you consider "leftism" and you'll find a HOOKNOSE.  COHENCEDENCE?

                  You are not blessed with objectivity. You are not blessed with reasoning. You are not blessed with creativity, intelligence, or understanding. The only thing going for you is your annoying tenacity which makes us all want to swat you like the human mosquito that you are. But hey, keep crying about downvotes, I'm sure that'll change everything, lol 😌
