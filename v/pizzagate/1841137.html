<p>Here are the &quot;dots&quot; I have collected about the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, which may be a possible avenue for more investigation since, in the words of <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/where-is-eric-braverman-neil-brown-marc-turi-and-what-happened-to-monica-peterson-in-haiti/">this blogger</a>, &quot;the Josef Korbel School Korbel and its graduates seem to be very much at the heart of US government foreign affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Josef Korbel School of International Studies appears to be a wonderful and prestigious institution, educating and training individuals for work in international government circles. After all, Joe Biden visited last September, praising its work to the skies. See VP Biden\'s pro-globalist speech<a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/15/joe-biden-talk-foreign-policy-at-university-of-denver-du/"> here</a>. I\'m not making any claims about it, just presenting some little &quot;dots&quot;, which might be completely unrelated and irrelevant:</p>
<p>1) Josef Korbel School for International Studies was named<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Korbel_School_of_International_Studies"> after former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright\'s father</a> and trains interns for government agencies like the DoS, DoD, FBI and Peace Corps. Former SoS Condoleeza Rice is its most distinguished graduate.</p>
<p>2) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SHT000000/posts/268779009987867:0">Monica Peterson graduated with an MA in International Development</a> from Josef Korbel and worked closely with it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/?utm_term=.21eb6a32d2bc">in her postgraduate work as a research fellow at the Human Trafficking Center</a>, of which her professor Claude d\'Estree was the executive director. </p>
<p>According to her professor Claude d\'Estree, Monica was working [to establish an NGO in Haiti](https://miningawareness.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/monica-petersen-condolezza-rice-korbel-school-and-the-haitian-elections-monica-dead-or-us-gov-agent/ http://archive.is/90i2J), which might possibly have been the organization &quot;Free the Slaves&quot;, <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/blog/2015/01/12/fighting-modern-slavery-through-data-and-information-sharing">which has been listed</a> as a Clinton Global Initiative program. Free the Slaves was highly praised and endorsed by Claude D\'Estree](<a href="https://www.changemakers.com/stopviolence/entries/combating-human-trafficking-through-research-and">https://www.changemakers.com/stopviolence/entries/combating-human-trafficking-through-research-and)</a>). Monica\'s fellow student and associate, Rex Hamaker, with whom she testified before the Colorado Senate, is the Director for Communications and Marketing for <a href="http://humantraffickingcenter.org/3335">Free the Slaves</a>.</p>
<p>3) Recently, another connection with Josef Korbel School has come to light. John DeBlasio, the CEO of <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sallyport-global-contractor-alcohol-theft-sex-trafficking-iraq-balad-ap/">the scandal-ridden Sallyport Global, which allegedly ran a human trafficking/prostitution/smuggling operation at a major air base in Iraq</a>, also owns the GPD Charitable Trust. The GPD Charitable Trust has endowed a program at Josef Korbel School for interns to the Middle East,<a href="gpdcharitabletrust.org/parnter-highlights/university-of-denver/"> the Center for Middle Eastern Studies</a>, which might possibly suggest that DeBlasio had a vested interest in obtaining government agents who might possibly facilitate or corroborate with his own operation---not stating this as fact, just presenting the possibility.</p>
<p>4) The dean of Josef Korbel School is Christopher Hill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_R._Hill">who has a very distinguished career </a>as U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and served as U.S. Ambassador to Korea, Poland and Macedonia. It is perhaps worthy of note that President Biden <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/15/joe-biden-talk-foreign-policy-at-university-of-denver-du/">worked closely </a>with the Korbel School’s dean, former Ambassador Christopher Hill, who served as the United States’ representative in Iraq from 2009 to 2010.</p>

            "two tracks"...Absolutely, perhaps even a third (although technically included), which involves intelligence gathering and coordination at levels that the second track, already set up for illegal activities, is unware of regarding the bigger picture.  The public face provides cover for both.

            'What's wrong with this picture?'  I agree, and while I don't want to disparage any legitimate charity groups or efforts, the sheer number of NGOs, CSOs, and network upon network of radical political activists, who depend on the continued exploitation of people in order to gain power within countries, makes me leary of all the 'glitzy websites'.  Using stock photos anyone could make up a website and solicit money with little substance to say and no proof of actually doing anything, besides the non-tangible Go-to Activist Gold Standard Term: "Raising Awareness".
           </p>
           <p>
            And to what degree is all this "Raising Awareness" a slight of hand, keeping focus off of what we are NOT intended to be aware of?  As you said, "..a fancy cover and misdirect for the total opposite."
           </p>
           <p>
            One reason to doubt is the reaction of MSM to actual stories of  the break up of large transnational  pedo rings, sexual slavery human trafficking rings.  Pretty much crickets, no large scale exposes, instead they focus on politically motivated Marxist agenda stories or just plain Fake News.  Given what we know about the scope of PG, it's clear that many if not most of the NGOs are used to one degree or another to enable or protect the very powerful people who profit the most from the exploitation of moving masses of people around the globe.

            About the Human Trafficking Center
           </p>
           <p>
            The Human Trafficking Center, housed in the University of Denver’s Josef Korbel School of International Studies, is the only two-year, graduate-level, professional-training degree in human trafficking in the United States. One way graduate students contribute to the study of human trafficking is by publishing research-based blogs. The HTC was founded in 2002 to apply sound research and reliable methodology to the field of human trafficking research and advocacy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Founded in 1964, the Josef Korbel School of International Studies is one of the world’s leading schools for the study of international relations. The School offers degree programs in international affairs and is named in honor of its founder and first dean, Josef Korbel.
           </p>

             Well yeah, that is an ideal way for human trafficking Globalists to maximize profits while tightening their stranglehold on the world, in their move to consolidate power.

             Okay, now we see this NGO, like 1000s more across the world, are useful in furthering the Globalists profiting off of spreading globalization, where large amounts of human trafficking involves the flow of victims across national borders!  Gee whiz 'Free The Slaves' and HTC blog pages, whatever shall we do?  Just have 'Open Borders' for all?

             to have sex
            </em>
            ) while they themselves disrupt families and lure underage teens into protest slavery, one can see why it's important to take politicized groups  that want to run the world with a grain of salt.  Both the HTC blog pages are very politicized for a leftist agenda, and a few clicks around the Swanee Hunt website is perhaps even more so in certain respects (aside from the vocal opposition to a legal sex trade), even while being more closely aligned with John and Cindy McCain.
            <br/>
            Even Van Jones shows up on this list:
            <a href="https://www.prime-movers.net/our-fellows/">
             https://www.prime-movers.net/our-fellows/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Swanee Hunt was the person Monica Peterson took issue with over the sex trade.  Recall Monica's friend saying:  “She was a sweetie, an amazing, wonderful girl,” said Elle, an activist in Colorado. “She really did care about sex-worker rights,” eager to do battle against anti-trafficking advocates such as Swanee Hunt, who want to end the sex trade entirely.
           </p>
           <p>
            But both the Swanee Hunt pages and the HTC, while on opposite sides in their views of prostitution, both are well versed in GlobalSpeak (and she's in with the Council of Foreign Relations as well
            <a href="https://www.swaneehunt.org/2017/03/08/cfr-spotlight-women-peace-security/">

            </a>
            )....which to me means that, regardless of what "brand" of activist we find encompassed into these two examples, all roads still lead to Open Borders and moving millions of people around the world while taking some of them into slavery, or stealing their kids, or killing the family for their organs is, as Soros would coyly say, "The new normal".

            Yes, the rats are now invading the rabbit hole.  This, like many other connections we have found, will not run cold, but I predict it may be another one that is so well planned that it would take a team of investigators, like that of the FBI to unravel it.  This is their plan.

            Richard C. Holbrooke was also a Board Member of the Council of Foreign Relations and a Member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.  The Bilderber Group was connected to the Manhattan Project.  The Manhattan Project was rumored to have been hatched at the Bohemian Grove.  I know that over the years from reading I remember he was close with Zbigniew Brzezinski (Mika's Dad) and Brent Scowcroft.  Birds of a Feather.  While I did some research on Sallyport Global I found that quite a few of the Team Members and Board were Members of the Council of Foreign Relations.  There were numerous ways that they were all connected. This whole Rat's Nest seems to be so intertwined  and that is it's purpose.  Hard to Untangle.
