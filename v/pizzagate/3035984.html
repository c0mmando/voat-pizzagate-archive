            As a Brit, I get more of an anti-brexit vibe from that than anything, especially the part where they are saying the bit alluded to, about revolution, and then saying "It's not in your nature". That makes me think of a potential Yellow vest-style revolt against the inevitable shafting that's going to come regarding Brexit, and a kind of taming of the British people: "Oh no, we don't revolt, that's not in our nature...", that kind of thing. The advert on the whole is a left-wing drive for diversity, inclusion etc., it wreaks of it all through the ad.

              Maybe if you were British you'd see things as I do, from a British perspective. Anti-brexitism is everywhere for us, I see it in this too. That makes me a pedo? Shush.

               Ronson is one of British construction’s most important clients, and one of British business’ most notorious figures. His company, Heron International, started as a furniture business run by his father. Ronson joined in 1954 aged 14 and became a partner in 1957. Then, by bringing the first self-service petrol stations to the UK in March 1966 and steering the business towards property development, he built it up to be one of Britain’s largest companies by the eighties.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the success was short-lived. In August 1990, Ronson was convicted of conspiracy, false accounting and theft for his part in the Guinness share-trading fraud. He was fined £5m and spent six months in prison. Not long after, Heron collapsed with debts of £1.6bn owed to 82 banks and 15,000 bondholders.

               Guinness Affair : Precusor to kiddy trafficking??

              </p>
              <p>
               The Guinness share trading fraud was one of the most famous British business scandals of the 1980s. Guinness shares were to be inflated in order to assist its takeover by the Scottish drinks company Distillers. Ernest Saunders, Gerald Ronson, Jack Lyons and Anthony Parnes were the perpetrators of this crime. They planned to raise the share price of the Guinness in order to win the bid of takeover of Distillers. They paid out indemnities to the companies who were part of the scheme and other awards were paid to the companies that supported them in the scheme. All four were convicted of dishonest conduct of share support in the Guinness Affair.

               "Mr Saunders was convicted of false accounting, theft and conspiracy, in 1990.
But his five-year sentence was halved on appeal. He was released from open prison after serving only 10 months when doctors said he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a permanent condition.
At the time of his appeal, a psychiatrist said he was unable to recall three numbers backwards and did not know who was President of the United States.
Mr Saunders health subsequently improved but his advisers denied he had made a "miraculous recovery" from Alzheimer's disease, suggesting instead his illness while in prison was stress-related.
Mr Saunders has since carved out a lucrative consultancy career while at the same time negotiating his £75,000 annual pension from Guinness. "
Also jailed were stockbroker Anthony Parnes and tycoon Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron empire, who had agreed to buy Guinness shares as part of the illegal share-support operation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mr Saunders was supported by the cream of the City establishment during the Distillers bid.
Guinness's lawyers were Freshfields, merchant bankers Morgan Grenfell and Henry Ansbacher were also on hand, and the brokers were Cazenove, the most blue-blooded of City firms.
Lord Spens was forced to resign as Chief Executive of Henry Ansbacher - but was later acquitted of fraud.

Ronson says that to this day he doesn’t quite know how he pulled his life back together. Certainly, he was helped by friends in high places. He borrowed money from Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, communications billionaire Craig McCaw and other wealthy acquaintances to accumulate enough capital to get back into the game.

               With a mutual interest in musical endeavours, Lyons became acquainted with the Conservative Party Prime Minister Edward Heath, and remained close to his successor as Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher.
Lyons was accused of having used his personal friendship with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to ensure the Guinness brewing group's offer for Distillers in 1986 was approved by the Office of Fair Trading. Thatcher replied to a letter from Lyons saying the matter would be passed to the minister then responsible, Paul Channon. The bid was subsequently unblocked.
