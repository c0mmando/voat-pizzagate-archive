  'formattedContent' => '<p>Several years ago, I came across a video series on YouTube called <em>Programmed To Kill/Satanic Cover-Up</em> from the \'Lolfieldandlove\' channel (many of you will already be familiar with it) which was based mostly on the book <em>Programmed To Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder</em> by the late David MCGowan (link to McGowan\'s book at the bottom).  Both the book and the video series posit the idea that the classic profile of the serial killer, i.e. the deranged loner attacking and killing random people driven only by their own personal demons/mental problems, is largely a falsehood.</p>
<p>Other tropes of the classic serial killer profile such as only killing a specific type of person based on race, gender, age, etc. or the use of a specific modus operandi is also largely untrue.  An examination of the evidence shows that in the vast majority of purported serial killer cases, victims were murdered either by weapons of opportunity (i.e. objects found at the scene) or executed via a gunshot to the head with a small calibre pistol, usually either a .22 or a .25 (the mark of a professional hit-man and straight out of the CIA assassination manual, btw!).</p>
<p>What emerges from the book/video series is a picture quite different from the one we know; that what appear to be random murders may in fact be targeted hits carried out for nefarious criminal purposes and what may appear to be a deranged loner may in fact be a member of a Satanic cult or a mind controlled assassin.  Many purported serial killers claimed that they heard voices commanding them to kill or that they were compelled to kill by some unknown force.  Some serial killers like Edmund Kemper and Arthur Shawcross described entering dissociative states while committing murder, a sign of Multiple Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder which is itself indicative of trauma based mind control:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0TysMxrAKQ&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0TysMxrAKQ&amp;t=4s</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6zT6tHC9PA&amp;t=281s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6zT6tHC9PA&amp;t=281s</a></p>
<p>The relevance to the subject at hand is found in the fact that many purported serial killers/mass murderers were not only child rapists themselves, but were part of a wider network of child rapists, almost invariably containing prominent individuals and/or operating with the connivance of the authorities.  Some examples are as follows:</p>
<p>*<strong>Marc Dutroux:</strong>  The \'Monster of Belgium\', Dutroux was convicted of the abduction and murder of 8 girls.  He and his wife had previously been convicted of abducting and raping 5 girls, for which he received an absurdly lenient 15 year sentence, yet served only 3, despite his own mother warning the authorities that her son was a dangerous paedophile who would likely kill if released from prison.  Moreover, his wife was able to secure a teaching job after being released!  Upon his release, Dutroux set about buying several properties despite being unemployed and with no known savings to speak of.  Children started going missing shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Though Dutroux and his accomplices Jean-Michel Nihoul and Bernard Weinstein would be blamed for the murders, Dutroux claimed that they were merely middlemen, small cogs in a larger machine as he put it, that they provided children for so-called \'pink ballets\', paedo-Satanic parties attended by the elite of Belgian society; police, judges, politicians, bankers and nobility, who would abuse these children in some of the most horrendous ways imaginable.  Many of the participants were identified by the children who had survived their ordeal.</p>
<p>A massive cover-up effort ensued.  Police lost evidence, ignored witnesses, an honest magistrate was removed from the case and other honest investigators began receiving anonymous death threats (reminiscent of Magistrate Michele Giuttiari in the \'Monster of Florence\' and Detective Lenny Harper in the Haute de la Garenne children\'s home abuse cases) and some 30 witnesses died in the 8 years it took to bring Dutroux to trial.  This blatant cover-up and corruption sparked the \'White Protest\' which saw 300,000 Belgians march on parliament buildings.  Belgian firemen turned their hoses on the edifice, symbolising how badly the Belgian political and legal establishment needed cleaning up.  In the end, however, none of the elite paedo-Satanists identified by Dutroux or their victims ever faced charges.</p>

            Thanks for this post Podge512, its always good to see a discussion of David McGowan's work here IMO. You mentioned multiple personality disorder, as being a trait many serial killers, especially those with rumored elite connections, appear to have or have had. I wrote a previous post
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2042045">
             here
            </a>
            about the "Greenbaum Speech," a speech by an actual Clinical Psychologist named Dr. Corydon Hammond, where he does go into detail about the horrible, organized child abuse that these cults appear to be using to "create" people with multiple personality disorder or DID. As horrible as it all is, definitely have to eventually confront the reality of what these people are doing behind closed doors.  Thanks again for your work!

            ?" It addresses the probability that Dennis Rader didn't act alone, and was just a fall-guy for the spooks behind the murders. Also,

             Thank you very much! I recall watching a video about the BTK killer and how it was extremely unlikely that Rader could've murdered Joe Otero (Rader's alleged first victims) and his family single handed.  Otero was a trained Air Force commando and a champion boxer, his wife and the older kids all practised martial arts and they had a large and vicious guard dog.  The surviving son Charlie also said his father was acting as though in fear for his life in the weeks leading up to the murders, such as making his family hide in the closet during a power outage until he could confirm power was out in the whole street, making his son go to a window when a telephone repair man showed up to confirm there was a company van outside and two days before the murders, he attempted to give his son his ring in case anything happened to him.  Definitely more to the BTK case than meets the eye.

            I read the book, Programmed to Kill. Dave McGowan was a meticulous researcher. He gave many incidences of how the murders done by these govt. trained brain washed people, were actually carried out by a group. When the lone murderer stood trial, this evidence was always kept secret. i.e. JFK . So we would have to ask , what was the reason this was fact was so important , even to the point of implicating those who took part in the cover up. To me, this post explains it. Whom, the real facts lead back to. Thank you ...best citizen journalists anywhere are right here.

            Moors murderers Jimmy Savile linked to Ian Brady pedo ring. (This story also took place while The Beatles were killed and replaced in 1964) What I think could be happening with these serial killers is a feeling of fear and panic is being put upon the public.
