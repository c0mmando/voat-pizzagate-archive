            Found something that could be innocent, it's Schumer's mentor. Stanley H. Kaplan and the article said Schumer worked for him when he was fourteen. Kaplan developed a prep class for the S.A.T. test. Schumer part of this group.

            I was watching a YouTube video that was on a different story within the PizzaGate genre. At about 30:00 the guest being interviewed gave a distinction between pedophiles and pederasts (pederasty). I'd not heard that second term before. He said that pederasts relations were multigenerational that start with prepubescent boy and the relationships go on into adulthood. They can be married with children and seemingly normal. Does anyone know about Schumer's and Weiner's prepubescent years? In the video, he talked about this type of subculture went on in Hitter's Germany. I remember years ago I read a PDF about the history of Homosexuals in Germany and how it came to the U.S. In it the homosexuals were referred to as "butch" and the "femminites" (feminine behaviors). Nazi homosexuals were ultra-macho or "butch," and the "femminites" were the ones mostly put in the concentration camps. They were annoying to the "butches." Does anyone know if Schumer has German roots. Another dot to connect is the Nazi's who survived after the war. I've read things about Hitler surviving and Bormann, Hitler's second in command. Many of the Nazi's went to Argentina and other parts of South America. They promised to wage war on the U.S. and to take us down. The FBI had investigations of many of the high elites, even Hitler. I think I read that there was a rogue CIA connection to many of them who have survived into the next generations doing spurious activities. Many of the Nazi's came to the U.S. as well. Is there any connections to the Nazi's in Schumer's earlier generations or their family friends, that sort of thing? Here is the link for the video:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBILQZj3Itw">
             Truth Unsealed: The Zodiac Killer And PizzaGate
            </a>
            One more thing about the Nazi's after the war was the Rat Line to help them escape. It was mainly through the Catholic Church who helped them set up the Rat Line. That's really fits with the subcultures and pizzagate.

             Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer are in the Knights of Phythias together which held its historic parade in Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's home district with many other ties to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is a key, and leads to many bigger and sinister plans. Freemasons in Racine and other secret societies are involved in racketeering, bid rigging, illegal campaigns, bribery, embezzlement and other crimes.

              Hey I was 'looking for you the other day but couldn't remember your name.  There was a story on here about an old man that confessed to murdering a missing boy and he said he had been kidnapped himself as a little boy and forced to murder another boy and he lived in Racine when it happened!

               Are you talking about Vernon Seitz or another case? Racine has a long history of satanic abuse and trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here is an excerpt from that article about Seitz:
              </p>
              <p>
               "Police searching the home of a deceased St. Francis barber who claimed he was involved in murders of two boys 50 years ago found child pornography, newspaper clippings and fliers on missing children, bondage devices and paintings depicting child torture. The search of Seitz's home in mid-December yielded a number of disturbing discoveries, including books on how to perform cannibalism, bondage devices, newly poured cement in the basement and elevated piles of dirt in the yard, according to a police affidavit used to obtain a search warrant. A handgun was recovered and the books on cannibalism also included a copy of one entitled, "Eat Thy Neighbor: A History of Cannibalism," according to a police inventory report. Police jack-hammered the basement and also searched Seitz's business, Vern's Barber Shop, 4243 S. Packard Ave., where they found a poster of Jacob Wetterling, a Minnesota boy abducted in 1989."

                 Unfortunately that is only one of many other similarly disturbing cases. Racine is hiding some very deep, dark secrets, and everyone needs to put the spotlight on Racine and find out who forced Loretta Lynch to stonewall the investigations into corruption in Racine and why. The Clintons are closely linked with Racine through Sustainable Development, Agenda 2030, Rotary, Community Policing, the DNC, and many other connections, but this goes beyond just the Clintons. Whoever is pulling the Clinton strings is also pulling the strings that tie to Racine.

               That is correct. The Racine angle is scarier to those involved, because they know it is true and full of criminal corruption tied to the same power players. They were prepared for the CPP angle and even directed it to narrow the scope and create their false victims and fake news strategy, but Racine is a surprise approach they were not expecting and cannot cover up. Investigate the connections and you will find out it is all true. Racine is absolutely corrupt, and has an amazing number of connections to this bigger picture on a global scale. It is a domino that will start a chain reaction. It is indisputable and anyone who claims otherwise is clearly either not informed about Racine, not interested in solving this puzzle, or is paid opposition. This is Paul Ryan's district - a cesspool of corruption, trafficking, and secret societies.

                Racine is the key to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and the sooner others realize this, the sooner we will all solve the bigger picture. Unless of course you don't want to.

              the Maddy McCann disappearance in Portugal. 
There were suspect sketches made. 
The other sketches are spitting images of John and Tony Podesta... this one, not so much.

               Why was David Miliband in Portugal on the morning of 8 September 2007? I remember wasn't it on some home video of the McCanns?
              </p>
              <p>
               "In late September Foreign Secretary David Miliband telephoned Gerry. "
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann">
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               As Ed Milliband was classed as Gordon Browns pet project and David was Blairs it could explain a lot, like the missing link between SOROS and the family.
               <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/04/article-2487217-1930674500000578-886_634x441.jpgJPG">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm certain it was part of the video released at Christmas showing Madeleine opening her presents, the one where she is dressed in pink, Some one posted a still from the video on a forum and it looked like Milliband sitting on the couch
"remind myself that David Milliband did get a bit involved in the introducing of McCanns to the EU parliament for the promotion of the Amber Alert thing."
              </p>
              <p>
               So I recently asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Freedom of Information Section:
              </p>
              <p>
               Please supply the following information during the period 1 August to 20 September 2007, together with:
              </p>
              <p>
               a) Actual Dates
              </p>
              <p>
               b) Names of countries and cities/towns visited
              </p>
              <p>
               c) Express purpose of the visit.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have received this reply, dated today (2 July):
              </p>
              <p>
               I confirm that the FCO does hold information relevant to your request and the details are as listed below:
              </p>
              <p>
               10 August, visiting Florence, Italy: purpose: ‘Bilateral visit’
              </p>
              <p>
               4-7 September, visiting Bucharest, Romania – Istanbul, Turkey – Rome, Italy – Madrid, Spain: purpose: ‘Bilateral visits’
              </p>
              <p>
               7-8 September, visiting Viana do Castelo, Portugal: purpose: ‘GYMNICH (informal gathering of EU Foreign Ministers)’.
              </p>
              <p>
               So it seems he was in Portugal talking to the press on the morning of 8 September just by the fortuitous chance of being at an informal meeting in Portugal of some other EU Foreign Ministers. hmmm

            Here's a biographical fluff piece on the relationship.  Weiner tried to mirror Schumer's career &amp; used Schumer's popularity in tracing his own political steps.  Lots of leads in the article (Weiner's family had ambitions for him to be first jewish president or perhaps speaker of the house) but I would not take any of the author's claims with more than a grain of salt.  The tone is straight propaganda.

            If Weiner's laptop has been stripped dry of anything incriminating, you know Comey had a hand in the cover up. It will probably be cleaner than my gramma's chromebase.

             I believe it was FBIAnon told us to hone in on that connection, but of course we knew about it before he told us to dig deeper, problem is we can't really dig into Weiner and Schumer that much as FBI has to be sitting on a boat load of data with all those emails and knows WAY more than we'll ever imagine.

             I hope Trump has the right guys in place to keep archives all the incriminating pieces of evidence to put these sickos away for life.
