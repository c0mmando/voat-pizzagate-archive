            Hi there
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Machz">
             @Machz
            </a>
            . Here in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            , you need to make this a research post in order for us to be able to leave it up. The guidelines for that are in the sidebar. It basically means stating a premise, such as "These accounts seem to be trying to hinder the pizzagate investigation" and then link to evidence supporting the claim (preferably archived, so they can't delete their submission or comments when exposed) explaining what you think the evidence means. The evidentiary standard for things like this is pretty much a Voat-wide expectation, not just in here. You'll get a lot of blowback if you can't support the claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            To satisfy Rule 4 and have your research post be directly relevant, you'll need to also address how you think the particular type of malicious content fits into the larger pattern of MSM and social media suppression of Pizzagate and those investigating it, and link to at least one previous article here or elsewhere describing that. Searching for the keyword "censorship" in previous thread titles via SearchVoat.co should turn up several.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fair warning: this can unleash a barrage of shill vitriol on you that you may not want. You can DM or modmail me and any of the mods privately.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alternatively, if you want to post on the record but to fewer eyeballs, and not have to explain the connection to the larger censorship effort, you can make a post in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , which is where we talk about administration of the subverse and meta topics like shills. Be sure to ping the mods (M's and J's, not the O's) to the submission, because it may take us a while to see it, otherwise.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Will Voat figure them out and make them go away?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Voat has very strict limits on moderator power, especially over comments. We may only remove actual illegal content or adspam from Comments. We may only remove posts that violate the community submission rules stated in the sidebar, or the Voat User Agreement. We only ban users for posting illegal content or repeatedly disregarding submission rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shills know this, and routinely take advantage of Voat's indulgent attitude toward offensive speech. Calling them out and downvoting them is frequently the only thing we are able to do. Asking for subjective bans to make them go away, or getting angry about it when we don't do so, is "un-voatlike" and makes the person doing it seem like an agitator themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            This current post unfortunately doesn't meet any of our submission rules as written (see the sidebar -- view desktop site if on mobile). I will give it the 24 hour Removal Reprieve flair so you can edit it as I explained above if you wish. Please edit, making sure to add an additional headline to the top (put a "#" at the beginning no spaces) that meets Rule 3. Reply to this comment when you've done so and I will remove the flair. Otherwise, please self-remove and repost in

            Re: possible doxxing - you might want to make sure to not leave any hints about your rl identity in your comments, and to not copypaste comments you may have posted elsewhere on the internet (with identical wording) here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, taking part in Discord chats involves a high risk of being doxxed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otherwise, you should be fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat doesn't censor comments unless they are obvious spam.
