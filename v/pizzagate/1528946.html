<p>Cenk and Anna from YouTube\'s biggest &quot;alternative&quot; media channel, The Young Turks, recently laughed at the idea of pizzagate, especially as it relates to Hillary Clinton. Cenk reveals that he has not seen some of the evidence that is publicly available. </p>
<p>Cenk asks how anyone can be &quot;stupid enough&quot; to believe Hillary might possibly be involved in a satanic cult (though I don\'t watch TYT, I caught their pizzagate hit job when it was discussed on an actual alternative channel):</p>

<p>Here are the facts:</p>
<p><strong>Claims of witchcraft/occultism</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ0gNZCVXvw">Larry Nichols, former 10 year accomplice to the Clinton\'s, claims Hillary Clinton is a Witch</a></p>
<p>And hacker Guccifer <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/23/jailhouse-letter-guccifer-laments-failure-to-expose-crimes-rails-against-clinton.html">wrote from his jail cell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After his hacking escapades for which he pleaded guilty to two U.S. federal counts, Lazar told Fox News in hours of recorded phone interviews and an in-person jailhouse meeting how he breached accounts belonging to Blumenthal and Powell.<br />
His letter is imbued with references to conspiracy theories like the “Illuminati,” which he believes is an international cabal that controls world affairs and wants to expose.
And he takes rhetorical aim at Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee: “<strong>Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, (sic) satanic, shadow group</strong>. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt motive to understand what I am talking about.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hillary\'s sexual perversion, child molestation</strong>:</p>
<p>A snippet from Cathy O\'Brien\'s &quot;<a href="https://archive.org/details/TranceformationOfAmerica">documented autobiography of a victim of government mind control</a>&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyC9NWBUsAAvZyo.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CyC9NWBUsAAvZyo.jpg</a></p>
<p>Information about Cathy (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8FizeF1uck">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On May 7, 1966 a 9 year old child named Cathy O\'Brien was subjected to an occult ritual named &quot;The Rite to Remain Silent&quot; that involves the Catholic Church as well. This is her own very shocking and eye-opening life story about her experience as a CIA MK-Ultra Whitehouse Pentagon level trauma-based Mind Control slave. She speaks out to expose those who abused, who go right up to presidents and congressmen and women and to give voice to the many mind control victims out there who can\'t think to speak out.&gt;
O\'Brien claims to have been abused since she was a toddler by her own family. Forced to partake in satanic sadomasochistic child pornography movies produced for Gerald Ford, she was eventually sold to the CIA, which was looking for traumatized children for their mind-control program ... U.S. Presidents Ford, Reagan, Bush and Bill Clinton; Canadian Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney; Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid; Haitian dictator Baby Doc Duvalier; Panamanian President Manuel Noriega; and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia all sexually brutalized her. She recounts in graphic detail how the elder George Bush raped her thirteen year old daughter and how she was forced to have oral sex with Illuminati witch Hillary Clinton ... While being sodomized, whipped, bound and raped, O\'Brien overheard the globalist elite planning a military coup in the United States and conspiring to usher in the satanic New World Order</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hillary has a creepy pedosexual for a campaign manager/right hand man. Her personal assistant for years was until only months ago married to a pedosexual, she has taken flights on Jeffrey Epstein\'s &quot;Lolita Express&quot; and is married to Bill, who loves raping women and has taken 26 flights to Epstein\'s sex slave island.</p>
<p>Hillary once defended a child rapist as a favor, and recently got Laura Silsby off the hook for attempting to traffic 33 children out of Haiti.</p>

            I don't have to prove anything to your satisfaction or jump through any of your hoops. (However the fact that I and LolPhatt express uncertainty proves there is controversy, even among pizzagate researchers, not even in mainstream society.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though you (correctly) despise WP and Snopes you still seem to have a fact-checking mentality. Get used to dealing with shades of gray in conspiracy research and lack of authority figures.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've mentioned Bryce Taylor to you twice and you say nothing! Instead you're going on about some lame, unimportant, nameless, incidental WP-cited researcher. I would think you would take Brice Taylor to be a real gift, as you say. The fact that you don't respond makes me question your motivation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only reason I got involved with your submission is you titled the first, deleted version "we do have proof" HRC molests kids, now it's "first hand accounts say". I don't have a problem with that wording.

            Before Cathy O'Brien, Mark Phillips was involved with Brice Taylor. He's supposedly a deprogrammer who accesses multiple personalities and brings back lost memories, some would say he's a controller. Taylor &amp; Phillips wrote Thanks for the Memories, I believe (.pdf link at deleted post). Anyway it's a quite similar account. Some say the similarity lends credence, some the opposite.

            It seems Taylor and Phillips had a falling out, there's probably some juicy stuff there. I found a YouTube video: apparently Mark Phillip diagnosed a woman as being a Monarch slave and brought out horrific accusations against her family. The video is her family siblings responding that it's all B.S.

            Nicely put, except I might quibble with the last sentence, do you have to know public figures to judge them? Also sometimes people you know do have a hidden side.

            Don't know if you're familiar with the Hampstead kids case. Two kids made videos detailing fantastic abuse by their father and their school. That's another controversial topic among researchers.

            There is such a thing as disinformation, or poisoning the well, it's handy to control both sides of a debate. You put out outlandish claims to make your opponents look ridiculous.

            I don't like the term "pedosexuality". Call it pedophilia. Seems a bit normalizing to me to put it with homo and hetero sexuality.

            I'm glad you changed "we do have proof" to "first hand accounts say", because Cathy O'Brien is highly controversial, even in the CT field.

            I suggested you search for the words "Mark Phillips" CIA and gave you a link to another .pdf book by Bryce Taylor aka Susan Ford.
