           Recently, I found myself in a conversation with two people in a public location - call it parent and full adult child (ostensibly) - which ran the usual course of topics leading to "things have to change within this country."  Pizzagate came up in some initial detail, but I received "that look".  Conversation changed to work related stuff for a while, and then, out it came - this guy personally knows someone

            We need a pizzagate/iamscaredandwanteveryoneelsetoknowaswell subverse because 90% of these posts, and there have been quite a few, are attention seeking bullshit.

            I don't want to be the first person to test that theory.  I have a bizarre habit of finding myself inextricably tied to weird situations.  Particularly this one.

            They can't sensor conversations on the ground don't be intimidated by a look.  There are nearly 10k subs (if they start offing people from Voat it will statistically take a while to get to you) and the only reason you would be in any real danger is if you are sitting damning information.
