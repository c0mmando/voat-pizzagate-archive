<p>I still haven\'t heard anything back from my 1st submission (on 1/24/17) to <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/</a>. So, I created another submission again this morning (1/27/17), basically stating that the same problem w/ their website is obstructing investigation into child sex trafficking &amp; each day its delayed, it puts more kids’ lives at risk.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="https://voat.co/user/TheRedPi11">@TheRedPi11</a>\'s comment about calling them...so I just called 202-456-1414 &amp; pressed 0 (20+ times to override their loop). A girl answered &amp; I told her the issue. She asked if I had emailed We The People, I explained to her that I did, which took me to the WH submission. Then, she hung-up on me (little brat!)! So, I called back &amp; same girl picked up, then saw my phone # &amp; hung-up again. I waited 5 minutes &amp; called back (w/ my # blocked). When she picked up I said please don\'t hang up!</p>
<p>Anyway, she was NOT incredibly helpful...she kept saying she had no way to contact anyone who could look into website. I told her that their webmaster could have this resolved in less than a day. She said the only contact info she had is this email: <strong>wethepeople@whitehouse.gov</strong>. EVERYONE PLEASE FLOOD THEM WITH EMAILS REGARDING THIS ISSUE!</p>
<p>I kept pushing her to talk &amp; she inadvertently stated that she didn\'t know when something would be done w/ website as current administration hasn\'t decided how they are going to proceed with it (I assume she meant We The People &amp; <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/</a> site).
I told her it seems incredibly suspect that certain petitions are clearly being suppressed/censored (like petition vs Soros &amp; ours on investigating child trafficking &amp; sexual abuse). It’s very shady...they clearly don\'t want this petition to get 150 signatures necessary to  appear on list. While other petitions, like one to reveal Trump\'s taxes is almost &gt; 300K OVER minimum (100K) required.
Anyway, here’s the email address again: <strong>wethepeople@whitehouse.gov</strong>.</p>',

            Follow-up White House calls:  2.2.17 202-456-1414
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             1st call disconnected
            </li>
            <li>
             2nd call disconnected
            </li>
            <li>
             3rd call abruptly transferred to “eop managed voicemail”. no other info on greeting
            </li>
            <li>
             4th call abruptly transferred to “eop managed voicemail”. no other info on greeting
            </li>
            <li>
             5th call told this "eop managed voicemail" is who manages we the people petitions. refused to give me a phone number to contact them directly. Refused to give me his name.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I called again on principle - that the petition(s) are not working - but I'm not even sure this petition is important anymore since Trump seems to be opening up investigations, but would like feedback from others - is this something we should be focussing on?

            I thought it was over 100,000 when I signed the petition a few days ago.  It's the first time I have signed a WH petition, so it is possible that I saw "signatures needed" and misunderstood that the petition was already over the 100,000 needed for a reply, but I signed feeling sure that a reply was "in the bag."

            I remember reading a post (not on this group) from a girl prior to the general election and she said her grandfather was best friends with Trump.  Someone asked her if Trump knows about all this Pizzagate stuff and she said that her grandfather had spoken to Trump and he is completely aware of what is going on.  Let's give him time to do a bit of Whackamo on those sickos soon.

             My Uncle is a big developer/builder &amp; knows Trump.
             <em>
              (It's the same Uncle who gave me inside information on another private island in Thailand that Epstein, Clinton, etc. frequented (in addition to his Virgin Islands). I'll get that research/information uploaded this weekend, btw...I've found more pertinent on JP that I've got to compile 1st.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, he said that Trump is aware of child sex trafficking (&amp; how widespread it runs). Trump is ABSOLUTELY disgusted/revolted by all of those involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             IMHO, I think if we get this email sent regarding fixing the petition, it will just serve as added motivation (or proof that the people want this investigated ASAP). Trump/Sessions can use petition to substantiate further probing. Because those involved include (but aren't limited to) corrupt elite, govt officials, agencies, foreign leaders, reporters, celebrities, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             It gives DoJ an additional tool showing that We The People want this taken down &amp; it isn't just Trump trying to 'get back at them'.

            Listen everyone I would really like to encourage everyone to take a breath. At this point is seems very clear there is no action that can be taken until the certain people are mobilized. It is so important to understand how things work. There is no way any whitehouse receptionist would know about an investigation of this magnitude. In fact at some level the hope is true American Patriots are serving their countries. 
If there is an active investigation occurring we would not be aware. Neither would they that is why archive,

             I agree! We have to have faith! President Trump is on this and has to wait until Jeff Sessions is sworn in. Sessions then will appoint someone to head the prosecution team.

              Special prosecutor. Secret grand jury. We will never hear about it if Sessions and Comey are playing their cards right to finally catch these people. Remember Norway boom. Bust70, 000 taken down. Keep the faith in humanity Trump is a shrewd businessman. Why do you think they fought so hard then fled to tax havens so far. All top state department fired two days ago. 
Art of the deal.
