            Trust the Plan, bitches. Just trust us. Q would never lie to you. Just switch off your brain entirely and believe everything Q says. And always remember to support Trump no matter what he says or does. And support Israel and Hate Palestinians.

            Danger:  Hackers' socratic method leads to RESEARCH. Lol...really?
Remember in the beginning people would warn each other to stay "safe" whenever a good lead was posted. We were exposing the deep state.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now  supposed to be scared of hackers asking questions?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously, don't gaf of q is a group of hackers or the greatest catholic school history teacher ever.  Scared q is wasting my time? Wtf was I doing otherwise?
           </p>
           <p>
            " I would've had an airtight case against the deep state, but q is a liar, so I failed to defeat satanic army of bankers &amp; pedophiles."

             ! Wassup, homeboy! I didn't put it in my post title but in my article/video I argue his detrimental reliance on Q caused him to take actions that got him shot,
             <em>
              possibly
             </em>
             . Flynn was very convinced by the Q narrative and took a risk thinking he'd be "working for the president directly" as a result. That action was taken 3 days prior to him getting targeted and shot. Bit of a leap, I know, but sound logic imo. If I'm wrong on that one at least I got a conversation about Flynn going again. More people need to be on this.

               A police officer shot him after a 'passerby' made a 911 call about him threatening people outside a house that had 'children inside'. Turns out it was Flynn's house with Flynn's children inside but swat and police acted on the tip by surrounding the house with guns drawn. It looks like an attempt at assassination-by-911-call to me. No details on the 'passerby'.

                 A resident reported being ‘menaced’ by Shelton with a gun. Police and Swat arrived, negotiated with Shelton, and shot him when he came outside. They cite ‘multiple shots’ fired by him, which seems different from his story. Was he swatted?

                 )
Officer Tim Pickins was cleared by grand jury for shooting Shelton. Pickins claims Shelton stated he was on a ‘mission from God’ and fired a shot stating ‘Warning shot… bitches.’ Pickins also stated police body cams had their visual ‘blocked’ but the ‘audio was unaffected’.

The testimony of police seems very strange considering police tend to unload multiple rounds and kill citizens for far less than the apparent danger they described. The loss of bodycam visual is concerning, too. It may be worth noting that the Oregon State Police are part of a Masonic order.

            I've been calling out this Q LARP since the beginning and let's just say that opinion wasn't very popular then, but it's pretty undeniable now.
            <br/>
            If an insider has anything important to say, they'll speak in complete sentences, not vague cryptic jibberish.  This fits the profile of a psychic.

            Well thank you for caring enough to make this video. It could very well be what you think, the problem is he uncovered so much, it could be anything, including a false flag.

            The Q-project was fake, no doubt. The question is do we believe the current narrative of how Q was faked. All of the current stories tend to move Q away from alphabet agency control. Is Q really not the CIA (or one of the umpteen other government agencies?) The current narrative gives us Q as a creation of a few private individuals or private organisations. It seems suspicious when we start to have 'colourful characters' (some with 'colourful names'- Baruch the Scribe!) getting pushed our way. Did Q really arise from the soup of a low-rent soap-opera?There were large resources behind the project - where did the money come from? Why did Youtube green-light and push the project? Could Q really gain such traction without at least the tacit approval of the intelligence community? Like JFK and 911, I guess we will never know. But if the creation of Q was a psyop of some kind, then the same could go for the deconstruction of Q.

             Why not Mossad? To me it doesn't really matter anymore which intelligence agency it was. None of them serve the American people. They're all operatives for the elite - any other narrative is an illusion. We, the people, must organize ourselves to solve these problems. They will not do it for us.

             This is assuming facts not in evidence.    Why do you think there were large resources?  It seems very much the opposite.   It was literally just people posting on chan boards, making youtube video and websites.   How much does that take?
            </p>
            <p>
             It might have been sophisticated, but it seems like all of it could be for pretty cheap.  Especially if they were making money while doing it.

              Same goes for many submissions that you ignore. You are cherrypicking based on your own desires and bias. If you treated migratorypatterns submissions the way you treated this one migratorypatterns would get most of their posts flagged.

            , I am flairing this Possible Disinfo because it makes a number of misleading or false claims, such as "Q anon is a mountain of lies" (not proven) and:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Around the same time Q showed up, pizzagate.wiki was taken down, Rebelskum went dark
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Which I know for a fact to be completely false causation. I spoke with Rebel shortly after Pizzagatewiki went offline and he confirmed it was due to his letting the registration lapse, which I posted about here. He is still around.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also pretty lame that you are blaming the consequences of hacking the Deepstate that FlynnL1ve5 has encountered on QAnon. Where's your hit piece on Wikileaks asserting Seth Rich shouldn't have leaked the DNC emails to them, under that logic?

             I've connected with Rebel myself. I know he's still around. He definitely was dark for months though - and has abandoned posting on all his accounts except one (plus a tweet he did). But, he would not discuss pizzagate.wiki with me or others. He wouldn't even acknowledge questions about it. I'd be interested to see your record of his "letting the registration lapse" comment.

               Interesting that you both jumped to the conclusion I was comparing credibility of Wikileaks and QAnon, and dodged my point. I did no such thing. I said it is as idiotic to blame QAnon for Flynnl1ve5 getting shot as it is to blame Wikileaks for Seth Rich. They both fucked with the Deepstate by choice. Nice deception tactic.

                By Flynn's own words he was highly motivated and influenced in his thoughts by Q Anon. Thoughts lead to actions. Every human action is preceded by a human thought. He was highly influenced by Q.

              The problems in this thread have nothing to do with my supposed prejudices, ES. Maybe if you could step away from yours for two seconds, you could see it is loaded with false correlations and misleading statements. Why would you want to support that? This piece doesn't help your anti-Q case at all because it's so poorly sourced and constructed.

               You are not the style monitor. The post meets the rules (the way they have been interpreted so far) and that is the only thing you are allowed to judge. You let shit slide all day as long as its dirt on democrats or good about Trump.

                The problems in this thread have nothing to do with my supposed prejudices, ES. Maybe if you could step away from yours for two seconds, you could see it is loaded with false correlations and misleading statements. Why would you want to support that? This piece doesn't help your anti-Q case at all because it's so poorly sourced and constructed.

               You just exceeded your mandate as you always do when it comes to Q. People in this forum call Hillary a cannibal on an almost daily basis and you don't say jack shit about that do you? Any proof that Hillary eats people? Nope but you let it slide. The bitch probably has eaten a person but there is no proof for it.

                     Just because i'm not in the mood today does not mean I won't be in the mood at another time. It wouldn't do any good any way because your ego blocks your learning channels.

            I have been watching this train wreck in utter amazement that people would actually believe it could have been real. One thing I discovered is that there are not as many die hard Q believers as there appears to be. I firmly believe the core group, Patriot Soap Box and CBTS (same people) were using an army of alts and were cruising from one site to the other talking to themselves. Doing this it makes it appear as if there are more die hard followers than there really are.
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed that when questioned they would give the same canned answers and often offer hostility, as if by design.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will be another scam, and another, and another..........more will come. I hope people learned a lesson. We pay with our time, our attention, and some paid with donations and buying merchandise. Flynn got hurt in real life.

            to be taking place (nxivm being one very large target, hopefully really does lead to the podestas and beyond) and if the world is better for it, then onward i press.

             NXVIM was not exposed by Q.  The story that led to the arrests was in the new york times  based on the writings of an upstate NY journalist who used to work with Raniere.

              again - i can't say that Q did or didn't have anything to do with this - but (and i appreciate your constant skepticism) your words don't match your alleged attitude.  to claim an absolute negative in this case goes against your 'are we sure' nature.

              the evidence against nxivm has been piling up for years.  they were known since the 90s, and sued the shit out of everyone who crossed their path...it takes a corrupt system and some string pulling for this to happen.  as corruption is swept out (ag schniederman is a key component to working towards a conviction)

                Frank F. Parlato, Jr., a newspaperman and blogger in upstate New York, spent years fighting to expose Keith Raniere, who is accused of branding and enslaving female followers of his organization, NXIVM.

               <p>
                Raniere once employed Parlato as the group’s publicist — giving him access he’d later use to help bring NXIVM down.

               This is a simple psychological phenomenon known as confirmation bias. You viewing things through a prism. There's another one called the availability heuristic,  once you can think of something easily, you start noticing it everywhere and you over estimate the rate at which it's happening.....Did you know that more Americans have been killed by falling out of bed than have been killed by terrorists over the past ten year?  Which one do you think about more often?   My brother once bought a car model I never heard of, after that I started to see them everywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
               You said Q brought your attention to a subjects you might not have known, but that NY Times article broke the NXVIM thing open.  It's the reason for the court cases.  It has nothing to do with Schneiderman protecting this group.  Schneiderman also open a case after the Times article, but since they Feds were pursuing the case, he let them handle that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why did Times article cause things to change so much?   Insiders inside the cult were willingly to speak out.  The branding was a secret eve within the cult and when that secret got out a lot of people realized what they were part of.   How did John Gotti finally get put away? A high up insider testified against him.
              </p>
              <p>
               So yeah, this is an easy one to be sure about.   I was pretty sure from the beginning that Q was fake because I believe in America and its institutions and a coup like this couldn't happen.  The story of secret arrests and people being set to Gitmo is a fantasy of Trump acting like a banana republic dictator.  We don't disappear people here.  The NSA, and the military would never go along with illegal orders such as these.   There's no way whatsoever an executive coup like this could happen.  You could have a few small people try, but the mass of law enforcement and the military would never go along with it.  The White Hat / Black Hat thing is a load of bullshit.  The oath the military takes is to the Constitution not to the President and they have the duty to refuse an illegal order.

            The guy did a good job on the article but he must not know how they were doing the Twitter tricks. They were pulling Trump's Tweets from this site

             http://trumptwitterarchive.com/
            </a>
            about five minutes sooner than they would show up on Twitter.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Tweets will show up to the Tweeter immediately but sometimes it takes a couple of minutes for the server to take a Tweet site wide. They were grabbing the Tweets earlier than everybody else. That is how they knew there would be misspellings etc....
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Twitter caught on to the scam and changed the code. Now they can't grab the Tweets early and that is why they suddenly stopped "

             I think they also had access to a news server that only people with credentials could access. Can't remember the guys name that had the access but I think he might have worked for Washington Post in the past and could still hit the server. He could see what was boiling in the news pots that might actually get published. His name has been said on this forum before not too long ago but I don't remember which thread it was.

               Subject: CBTS Baker setting story straight. I'm tired of the lies. Q tell all.Just the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               ”QBRD_BAKER” here
              </p>
              <p>
               I’m here to separate FACT from FICTION.
              </p>
              <p>
               For a couple of month’s, I tried to set things straight. I eventually gave up trying because every time I posted anything to tell the truth it was quickly deleted off the board, and people were too brainwashed by this point. Everyone affiliated with CBTS were quick to label me or others a “SHILL” when posting things on the board. They told Anons to ignore my posts and they followed marching orders like the sheep they’ve become. It’s really sad! The one thing we were trying to push on everyone not to be.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let me explain. I’m one of the original members of the CBTS group/bakers/Mods – or whatever you want to call us. I ended up bailing from the group, as did a many others, and because of the shit that this all turned in to.
....
Here are the FACTS:
.....
And I say this with so much guilt, No, there is no real Q member or members within the government or in the military giving us intel. It’s the truth!
              </p>
              <p>
               I want everyone to know though that the intensions behind all of this were noble and honest at first, but it eventually changed, and people in the group got greedy, big headed, egotistical and all they saw were dollar signs coming out of this. Basically, they chose to become the famefags they are now! It sickens my stomach that I didn’t cut ties in all this sooner! I’ll be even more honest with you. There were a lot of us to start in all this, but many got booted out because they questioned things, because they didn’t want to comply with Baruch or Pamphlet, or because there were too many members to share the “wealth” with. I’ll point out additional facts and point you to the sauce on this for you to follow up on!
              </p>
              <p>
               I’ll tell you who’s the real Q. 
It is everyone who clicked up with CBTS. Pamphlet Anon, Pam’s wife, Baruch the Scribe, Farmer Funk, Code Monkey, Obobo, Rain, Tracybeanz, and to a big extent Dr Corsi (unknowingly at first, but I’m sure Corsi was let on to the truth later on, IDK for sure because I had left the group but I’m pretty sure he knows the truth) are the major players that you know of (BO’s, mods, bakers etc); there were lots of us from, halfchan, reddit, and infinitychan. Each and every one of us has their own “expertise” to contribute and that’s what we did; even very useful techy members like code monkey as a great example. If shit got too heated in the kitchen, and you were considered a threat to the “plan,” guess what, you were outed! That’s exactly what kept happening. If drama broke out, a new discord server was created, a new board was created, you were banned, and more important, you were booted from the group and threatened. Everyone knew going in this that if one person said anything than everyone was going down together. We don’t Doxx Q is how it was put! It would be a “shitstorm” for all of us! This is how “WWG1WGA” came about. We are in this shit together and we’ll go down together if shit got out. The “shitstorm” fell in line with the storm. This is also where the whole “double meaning” came in. We had thought this shit out really well and we all helped to create the lie. We also knew going in that if we were going to do this we needed to cover our bases. Which is how we came-up with "disinformation is necessary,” “future proves past,” along with a many other cheeky words: crumbs, bread, bakers, red pill, etc. Think about! Do you really think some special intel person would know all these chan terms? (Autists, Anons, Bakers, Normies, etc.) Is it clearer now? We made all this shit up! Even when mistakes were made, and they were, we were able to trick people that shit was intentional: misspellings, initials. It’s even how other Q’s were created. We accidentally let it slip that there were many of us within the posts so people said – “oh they must be a group!” we rolled with it! We did this shit on a constant. People swallowed this shit up just as we hoped. ......
              </p>
              <p>
               Here are the sources (How shit was done) for you to follow up on.
              </p>
              <p>
               A lot of the major players (actors) took turns posting as Q. It’s why you see many “device” ID’s on the chans. If you know Pam and Baruch well, and know how they talk you’ll be able to make out some of their verbal habits in the drops. They often taunted people with them. Examples: we serve at the pleasure of the president (this was us, secretly saying we were Q – fast forward it’s also why tracy kept saying “we are Q to POTUS in a recent vid of hers), some of come to drop crumbs just crumbs, trust the plan (Pam came up with this) etc. I can go on.
Prior to the elections some members had started sending letters to the president complaining about the problems in our government. It was time we got measurable change – is what they wrote. We also called it Quality and Quantitative change! This is where Q came from. We called ourselves Q patriots in every letter and made it clear that we were wanting change and that we were rooting for him and promised to help him gain votes to make this possible. We sent lots and lots of letters hoping he’d acknowledge us.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding the famefagging – look back to see who reached out first to inforwars, tracy and many other truthers for interviews. The truth is out there. They’ve even been caught saying that Q told them directly to do this (BULLSHIT AGAIN). This is when Tracy came on board too and Corsi.
......
The tripcode – Matlock was Baruch. That fucking idiot says he knows digital forensics but he cant even come up with a secure trip? He’s the biggest moron of all. We all would secretly make fun of that fool. Anyway, when the trip got cracked we had to come up with something fast. That’s how that “they used special hardware to crack it” came about. Farmer also helped here. You can go back to see he supposedly verifies Q’s IP to validate his new trip along with Baruch and Codemonkey – all fake. We threw that shit in the drops and people bought it all up.
              </p>
              <p>
               Baruch and Pam silenced people that were questioning the drops, and silenced some of us that left and posted the truths by deleting our posts and banning our IP’s – yes Codemonkey/Baruch do track IPs on the board. If they tell you otherwise it’s a lie! If you search there are archives that show the deleted posts and you clearly see the BS that transpired and who’s at the lead (the BO and others). Dumbass Tripfags!
              </p>
              <p>
               CBTS discord – Pam planned to make other platforms to collect money. Farmer wanted to start something in the discord to capitalize. Pam said no (because he already promised people he wouldn’t) and drama broke out. Eventually they planned to break up the CBTS discord allowing Farmer to collect in the CBTS discord and Pam made a new server. By this time, this was the 3 new discord server because drama kept coming up when members questioned “the plan.” This is why it also spilled over on the chans! Farmer took a fall for letting in an FBI informant (as planned). But guess what, Don’t question it, you’re a shill if you do, trust the plan! – Yup all BS!
              </p>
              <p>
               This was a constant and still is. As we broke up the group. Someone would try to control the board to be Q. This is how Baruch took over first on 4chan, then another member, then farmer. Look back and you’ll find constant contradictions from yes we know Q, yes we have contact with Q, to and all that (baruch). Farmer responding as Q to himself as the anon who initials his post with ff (farmerfunk). Search the Qmap website for the “ff”.
              </p>
              <p>
               More recently – you see the drama with corsi and others where Q is bashing them but then gives props to the bakers, codemonkey, and BO – Please open your eyes people! I’m so very sorry for my part but you are all being lied to.
The pictures - We would find them on the net, modify them with photoshop or other applications, reverse the images over lay things on them, or did things so that they couldnt be reversed search in google: unless that's what we wanted you to do. We would test it ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               The bigger parts:
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a website that shows all of TRUMPS tweets. It’s still on the web now (
               <a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/">
                http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/
               </a>
               ). It used to be able to load tweets right after Trump would post it but a bit faster than it would pop up on Twitter; around 5-15 min faster. It mostly depended on the server but this is how we got lucky and were able to post some of the words off Trumps tweets on the chans before it loaded on twitter. This really made it all very believable. But really it was all because there was a code that twitter provided to capture the tweet off the server (it’s how media websites would capture and embed them too). Twitter eventually fixed this and it’s why you no longer see the POTUS tweets prior to him posting them on twitter. This coding was all code monkey with the help of a few others.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pam and his wife gave a lot of direction on the drops. His wife wrote the questions because she knew the connections. Others helped to. Corsi as well by providing Pam answers from his research. You’ll find a lot of things from corsi’s books covered in the crumbs just reworded for the socratic method we used (Pams wife came up with this).

He could see what was boiling in the news pots that might actually get published. His name has been said on this forum before not too long ago but I don't remember which thread it was.

            Its the fraudsters behind the Patriot Soap Box 24/7 livestream that are behind it from what I understand. Those fuckers have not totally given up yet. They are not pitching the line that Julian Assange is Q Anon even though Wikileaks called them a bunch of Pied Piper frauds. People have been put in prison for doing what they are doing. If law enforcement can tie them to the monetized part such as the youtube channels, T shirt sales, selling that app, they are open for prison time and I hope they get busted.

            From what I understand they made some good coin on this fraud. Pamphlet, one of the people pretending to be Q, suddenly turned up with what appears to be tens of thousands of dollars worth of studio grade computer equipment etc...There is a video somewhere of him with all his brand new shit but I don't remember how to find it. Tracy Beanz too.

            They seriously took advantage of a lot of well meaning patriots and I hope they get their ass in serious trouble for it.

              Not Cicada 3301. I think they were involved at the very beginning but not in a malicious way.  I think Cicada bailed out early because the shit started to get so damn crazy.

              Farmer Funk, Pamphlet, Pam, Baruch The Scribe, Codemonkey from 8Chan, Tracy Beanz, and a few others. CBTS/Patriot Soap Box people. From the way I understand it they were driving the traffic to specif youtube channels and sites that they could control and they are splitting the money.
