            So glad this was posted.  The timing and context of these is at the very least weird if coicidental.  There are probably several of us with special skills or ties that are intentionally remaining anon.  Yes, back up everything.

            Yo, I need to chime in here. I have offered to filter and polish sound files of possible concern, also cleaned and posted the 2007, comet pizza yt audio. I do work and atm, very much in the process of a music project. However, my Voat.co acct, SoundCloud and I suppose anything else doxxable are absolutely right here, I don't alt cuz that shit is helmet logic. I am exactly who I am, got something needs to be said, you can come to TJ Mexico in my Colonia and say it, prolly should say it nicely though, this ain't cuckafornia. I'll feed you to pigs myself, though as we do it here, I wouldn't have to, that said. I can offer my Friday night to filter passing any audio files that may be of question. In full view of this collective, pass/passback open page is the right way to do that, there be counter ops here. 100% agree on that. I, am not one. Want proof? Its in the details of every post, comment, and action here among many other sites I am on. I think that this collective investigation is in fact turning over the right stones, dare I say invoking the same power that is called meme majik, sincerely. Focused, intelligent, open information exchange is actually unstoppable, the enemy, though they fancy themselves as superior are actually just predatory animals whom prey on game that cannot even defend itself. That's some hyena level shit and this right here, a growing pride of fukking lions. It is absolutely correct to be suspicious, I for one do not like the deletion of material. That is the antithesis of conducting an investigation and needs to be addressed. Sufficient examples of subtle and not so subtle counter intelligence strategy abound. Bear in mind though, in real time you are watching established organizations, businesses, foundations and charities change logos, private pages once public and issue "pleas" to mainstream media for cover and counter spin. Do y'all realize what that means? This is beginning to devide them and that is the start to conquering them. Their hubris, as always will ultimately be what betrays them, delivering themselves unto demise of absolute, unmitigated, asymmetric savagery.

             Not only that but do you think these people are going to play fair to the people they hire for $14 an hour to shill? Nope, the clintons tie up loose ends and they'll probably use them up and serve them at the next cannibal party. Can't have them writing books or doing interviews about what it was like on the inside of CTR

              Well I do know that 14$ hourly is laughable. My favorite shill shatter was dissecting the archetypal nuance of absolutely horrendous syntax used by the lot of them. If they were making 14$ hourly the clintons were getting robbed, (also funny) I do agree though. I would not work for that mess, even if I were a starving artist "writer". They were actually, this gonna sound so douchey, my toys for thier short time here:( I miss shatting on them honestly

            Im down with you I didn't think it made any sense. They could easily have contributed without 'offering their services'. I didn't want to be unappreciative but it sounded like nonsense, especially with all the unnecessary back story.

            People, beware of clicking on any links those people might post for you. Maybe to check out their P.I. company or bio somewhere, it may collect your IP. If someone like that posts a weird link and you want to check it out, paste it into archive.is and look at it there.
           </p>
           <p>
            They really want to find out who the diggers and knowledgable people are. Don't fall for it. You're not being helpful, you're falling for their bait. If they are the real deal, they can look at any number of repositories with basic info and they can find it themselves.

            I disagree. Anybody who has the power to "shut this shit down" also has more than enough power to find it all without asking politely. George Soros, NSA, CIA, FBI, you think these people need to ask where to find the information?

            One of them I think was called FutureFather, offering to develop a data base to collect and compile all the info and evidence.
In his statement, it stood out to me that he suggested that we know &gt;who&lt; is investigating who.
           </p>
           <p>
            I commented that decentralization makes it harder for them to find the golden eggs if they seek to eradicate them and the request to know "who" is investigating is a direct and perceivable threat to individuals safety.

            I'm the OP from the Australian journalist thread. I'm trying to keep my identity as much a secret as possible - I'm not planning on publishing my name on any of these articles, not sure I want my name published to a piece like this. But if it's really bothering you guys, I'm happy to confirm privately with mods I am who I say I am.

             frankly, if you are really a trained journalist, shouldn't you be able to sift through this site on your own without enlisting our free help? And be better and faster at it than we are? Don't you need to decide for yourself what is most pertinet?
            </p>
            <p>
             I worked in PR for many years, so I did see that many members of the press do want material simply handed out to them so they can do a gloss over and write it up.  So simply asking for material doesn't necessarily make you not legit.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, if you were just infilitrating, you would certainly have already figured out a cover story to send to mods or whoever.  Anderson Cooper is with the CIA for example, as are many members of the media.  So just having a name doesn't necessarily make you legit either.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please don't be insulted, but these were my thoughts as I read your post and it probably is shared by others.
            </p>
            <p>
             At any rate - be prepared to roll up your sleeves, and if so, good luck.

            I have just posted about diversion tactics on the front page.
Thanks for warning about this.
I advise people on here don't private message some one keep it public.
Don't click on links from new posters .
Don't go on a wild goose chase.
Democrats are involved one of them ran for president focus on them especially Podesta .
Satanic a Ritual is involved.
Don't let some one talk you into not focusing on it and Pizza Gate IS political.

            Watch this shit I've seen this happen before on actual message boards about cases.
The West Memphis Three was flooded with shit like this. One guy even pretended to be a cop .
           </p>
           <p>
            Be careful.
