<p>This SC man wanted to eat a child, police say. HE\'S OUT OF JAIL ON BOND</p>
<p>GREENVILLE COUNTY, SC - A man police say wanted to “cannibalize” a child after turning her into a “full time baby maker and sex slave” is out of jail on bond, according to court records.</p>
<p>Justin Teeter Bensing, 36, of Myrtle Beach, faces two counts of criminal solicitation of a minor in connection with a roundup of more than 40 accused child predators and sex traffickers announced last week by the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>What else is interesting about Greenville County, SC? </p>
<p><em>Former U.S. Education Secretary Dick Riley, a Greenville Democrat and former South Carolina governor, endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hillary Clinton has spent a lifetime getting results for women, children and families,” he said. “She will spend every day as president working to help hard-working South Carolinians get ahead and stay ahead.”</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, former Gov. Jim Hodges, the last Democrat to occupy South Carolina’s governor’s mansion, is set to endorse Clinton on Wednesday, Clinton’s campaign said.</em></p>
<p><em>Hodges is to moderate an event with Hillary for American Campaign Chair John Podesta, a former senior adviser and chief of staff to President Barack Obama.</em></p>
<p><em>Riley, 82, served as governor from 1979-87 and worked as U.S. education secretary from 1993-2001.</em></p>
<p>*“Hillary is smart, grounded and focused on the issues that matter most to South Carolinians,” Riley said. “Back in the 1970s, she came to *South Carolina to help children. As first lady of Arkansas, she and I worked together to reduce infant mortality rates in Southern states. <em>She wants to get things done and will fight for the underdogs – that’s the way she\'s always been.”</em></p>
<p><em>Clinton, a former U.S. Secretary of State under President Barack Obama, has visited South Carolina several times since announcing her candidacy.</em></p>

<p>The fact that Bensing was released on Feb. 14th, Valentine\'s Day, on a bond on just $12,500 is also significant because it appears that this day is big for occultists and Masons because it\'s their day to celebrate Nimrod. </p>
<p><em>February 14- Valentines day is a pagan festival that encourages love and physical lust. It is celebrated precisely 13 days after Imbolg, thus imprinting upon it the number “13”, Satan’s number of extreme rebellion. While most people view this day as the day to honor your wife or your significant other, this celebration is steeped in paganism.</em></p>
<p><em>Consider the camouflaged occult gods in Valentine’s Day</em>:</p>
<p>Cupid- the son of Venus, is really Tammuz son of Semiramis Venus- daughter of Jupiter is really Semiramis herself Jupiter- the head deity, a sun god <strong>Nimrod- (Semiramis’ husband) is considered a sun god in the Babylonian Mysteries</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youthtruthusa.com/satans-calendar/">https://youthtruthusa.com/satans-calendar/</a></p>
<p>NIMROD</p>
<p><em>In Freemasonic myth, not only was Nimrod the founder of the Babylonian monarchy, he was also the Grand Master of all Freemasons and the builder of many wondrous cities in the land of Shinar. He was also the demonic genius behind the Tower of Babel, a tower that would reach to Heaven: which was the first co-ordinated assault on Heaven by the incipient five thousand year old Luciferian Conspiracy for World Government inspired by Organised Evil.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.overlordsofchaos.com/html/freemasonry_.html">http://www.overlordsofchaos.com/html/freemasonry_.html</a> </p>
<p>I\'m wondering if Bensing or his father belong to a Masonic lodge. </p>
<p>What else is significant about Valentine\'s Day, the military and pedos? </p>
<p>Remember who Nicolas Cruz, the February 14th Parkland school shooter, stayed with: <em>James, 48, is a decorated army veteran and a military intelligence analyst who served stints in the Middle East between 1988 and 1996. Kimberly, 49, is a neonatal intensive care nurse who cares for premature and ill babies.</em> <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-school-shooting-family-helped-nikolas-cruz-20180217-story.html">http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-school-shooting-family-helped-nikolas-cruz-20180217-story.html</a></p>
<p>And there\'s this: <em>Bruce Arlie Harvey, 42, of Reva, Virginia, pleaded guilty on Aug. 14, 2017, and was sentenced on Jan. 25, to 276 months in prison for three counts of transporting a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in criminal sexual acts, three counts of interstate travel with minors with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct and one count of possession of child pornography.</em></p>
<p><em>Additional evidence presented during the guilty plea revealed that at the time of his arrest on May 3, 2017, investigators recovered a Sony microcassette in a</em> <strong>bedroom closet that contained a film clip dated Feb. 14, 2007, that showed one of the victims performing a sexual act</strong> <em>with Harvey in his Madison County home.</em> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-virginia-detective-sentenced-23-years-prison-sexually-exploiting-minors">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-virginia-detective-sentenced-23-years-prison-sexually-exploiting-minors</a></p>
<p>Although, I\'m convinced that we\'re in a spiritual war and the good side is winning. Why? Because the sting operation in Greenville County was named Operation Millstone. From the original article: <em>Greenville County investigators charged 14 child predators, two human traffickers, 10 prostitutes and 17 johns in connection with the two-week-long sting, the name of which, “Operation Millstone,” is rooted in the New Testament book of Matthew.</em></p>
<p><em>“If anyone causes one of these little ones — those who believe in me — to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea,” the verse reads.</em></p>
<p>There\'s some info I left out to keep things as tight and on topic as possible, but please read the original thread and the comments to get a full grasp of all the evidence here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2434674">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2434674</a></p>

           I'm wondering if Bensing or his father belong to a Masonic lodge.
          </p>
          <p>
           What else is significant about Valentine's Day, the military and pedos?
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember who Nicolas Cruz, the February 14th Parkland school shooter, stayed with:
           <em>
            James, 48, is a decorated army veteran and a military intelligence analyst who served stints in the Middle East between 1988 and 1996. Kimberly, 49, is a neonatal intensive care nurse who cares for premature and ill babies.
           </em>
           <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-school-shooting-family-helped-nikolas-cruz-20180217-story.html">
            http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-school-shooting-family-helped-nikolas-cruz-20180217-story.html
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           And there's this:
           <em>
            Bruce Arlie Harvey, 42, of Reva, Virginia, pleaded guilty on Aug. 14, 2017, and was sentenced on Jan. 25, to 276 months in prison for three counts of transporting a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in criminal sexual acts, three counts of interstate travel with minors with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct and one count of possession of child pornography.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Additional evidence presented during the guilty plea revealed that at the time of his arrest on May 3, 2017, investigators recovered a Sony microcassette in a
           </em>
           <strong>
            bedroom closet that contained a film clip dated Feb. 14, 2007, that showed one of the victims performing a sexual act
           </strong>
           <em>
            with Harvey in his Madison County home.

            https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-virginia-detective-sentenced-23-years-prison-sexually-exploiting-minors
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Although, I'm convinced that we're in a spiritual war and the good side is winning. Why? Because the sting operation in Greenville County was named Operation Millstone. From the original article:
           <em>
            Greenville County investigators charged 14 child predators, two human traffickers, 10 prostitutes and 17 johns in connection with the two-week-long sting, the name of which, “Operation Millstone,” is rooted in the New Testament book of Matthew.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            “If anyone causes one of these little ones — those who believe in me — to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea,” the verse reads.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           There's some info I left out to keep things as tight and on topic as possible, but please read the original thread and the comments to get a full grasp of all the evidence here:

                He was arrested in the sting. This is a fact, so I don't see why I should give him a pass. We truly don't know what these people are in to. Did he always ask for ID before, um, moving forward with his intentions?

                 The sting 6 month long according to a sheriff that is now under various charges and a lawsuit for rape proved to net 2 sex traffickers. The fact is more than half of the individuals that were involved in the sting never crossed the line or sought out underage persons. The number of people reported was to inflate a story to give himself credit to a city that he committed crimes against. To put people in the same category is irresponsible and ultimately an unjust death sentence. It's not a free pass it's just responsible reporting.

                   It's in the news, the sheriff more than 6 months ago had a lawsuit for allegations of rape brought against him. That's everywhere in the news. Shortly after this investigation starts. That's in the news as well. The article that reported the sting also goes to list what charges were brought against who. Those are facts. If an individual had crossed the line at any point his or her charges would have included the fact. The investigation did not only go after child predators but after individuals who sought the service of professionals of consenting age. To put those people in the same category is like putting parking tickets with people convicted of vehicular manslaughter.

                      Really? That's basicly the same article about the sting arrests. It says nothing about the sheriff being crooked or anything about your boy Mark being innocent of diddling kids. Please go do something productive and stop trying to play hero unless you can put your money where your mouth is by offering clear and concise proof of your claims.

                        I understand that. It doesn't mean that those arrested have never done things they haven't been caught doing. It's important to know who these people are and what they may be capable of, and who they associate with.

                         The world is full of good people that end up doing bad things. Individuals have been going to see professionals in this industry for as long as written word has been around. The reasons can vary from problems at home to just being lonely. To put those individuals with ones that seek out underaged persons is a death sentence. Do you really believe that is just ? The individuals that had nothing to do with crimes against children must always be mistaken as being that? It's a death sentence for those who were not there for underage.

                          So, what you're saying is that it's cool because Mark always asks for ID before engaging in sexual intercourse with strangers. Am I hearing you right?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Look, if it hadn't been for you coming into this thread, nobody would be any the wiser because I placed a question mark after his name. I remain as biased as possible and if Mark is as upstanding as you say, why can't he stay away from having sex with strangers, or go wherever this is legal? He was charged and this is public information in a sting designed to catch child predators. I cannot delete info just because you tell me some info and expect me to take it as truth. I hope he turns his life around and stays out of trouble and away from people who will only bring him down.

                            First, this isn't an article, it's a blog. His name was in the article, which is why it's in the blog. The sting captured those who were diddling kids and anyone else the net dragged in. His name is associated with the sting. I don't know Mark and I can't say for certain of anything he has or hasn't done, thus I cannot determine what he's guilty of. When he has his hearing and there's no evidence of him being involved with underage persons, he should move to have his name removed from the articles, and the blog will follow.

                              Then, he shouldn't have anything to worry about. If anyone looks up Operation Millstone, they'll see that he doesn't have any charges associated with minors. Although, sex trafficking people who aren't minors is just as bad. Can you furnish proof that he wasn't involved with sex trafficking or luring minors and/or adults for the sex trafficking ring?

            I believe there is a masonic connection to the parkland shooting. The word
            <strong>
             stoneman
            </strong>
            is a code for mason which is a reference to freemasonry. Of course that happened on valentines day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Defiantly a masonic element because people for the most part are not clandestinely into cannibalism and child torture. However there are better examples of masonic involvement in even things like the hampstead case where the mother blames masonic police. Doing the numerology can wind you into a loop and that is confusion.Charlotte was the place where they had made the first 33rd degree. During the days where Jesuits and Jews and Masons owned slave plantations. So in that sense maybe there is a connection to child sex slaves and the slave barkers of old.There is defiantly something dark going on.

             Kinda like Charlottesville FF: "Victim" Heather Heier = HH = Heil Hitler. I dismissed a lot of this a while ago, but the body of evidence pointing at symbology is significant.

              Yes, it's become impossible to ignore what a strong significance the symbols play into all of this. In my opinion, it's the proof that we are indeed in a spiritual war and symbols are the language between the material world and the unseen forces that surround us.

              While I think there is something to be said for the race mixing propaganda pushed by the left. There is also a strong wave of isolationism and that does not build a strong country. Nazism has ruined a lot of good things but it also is a method of ritualized depopulation and that is exaclt what the elites are wanting. People need to grow up and snap out of the nazism because its putting too much pressure when a healthy racial relationship is more realistic than this day of the rope bullshit that freemasons say to prelude to their guillotines.

               We have more than enough "diversity" for one superpower. The left just moved from gas chambers to abortion tables.  And wtf is a "healthy racial relationship"? That sounds like white guilt NWO shit.

                A healthy racial relationship is anything aside from the divide and conquer mind control. Ever notice how people started calling people cianiggers and just jamming that nigger word in there? Well simply put the blacks are a very easy group to get to bumrush and riot. Human exclamation points if you will. So what happens is you take a bunch of kids and indoctrinate and control the information they have by plastering a swastika or screaming nigger to be edgy. Ideally you would use the niggers as kind of lab rats to form torch bearing mobs and whatnot. No justice for the human sacrifices no peace. We can use that hype when exposing these freaks. Divide and conquer is masonic it not called divide and conquer in their cult though. Its called divide and rule. So you see they mix up the masses in cliques that all symbolically align to their cult and agendas.

                Like mark passio said if people knew that there are pillars of society in satanic rituals guarded by police in the woods wherever. Then they would know we need all the christians and non cult people we have. Black people are already mad why not use their anger to chip away at the total media blackout that they have given this pizzagate?

             Thank you for your comment and validating my suspicions. If you do a search for Japan's media, they actually printed the school's name as "Stonemason".

            His parents are Donald R. (1948) and Heather B. Bensing (1946)
           </p>
           <p>
            His father Donald lived in Virginia Beach. Lots of military bases here. His addresses appear that he and his son moved to all of the same areas except Colorado, but his mother Heather lived in Colorado, Florida, and Kansas, but has no addresses for Virginia, North Carolina, or South Carolina.

              Coming from Fayettenam, I can tell you the rumor on base is that Osama bin laden was trained at Ft Bragg.  Further, 910 area code is where Lee Harvey Oswald called his "handler" after his arrest.

               Geez.  You should be on the board more often!  What a bit of news.   I have long believed and thought there is plenty going on at those bases.  There was a case in Columbia that involved soldiers making CP while raping 15 yr old girls.  I also believe there is a huge code of silence at all bases.  This is why it has been so hard to find articles.  I also believe that when soldiers are arrested at a base for sexual abuse of a minor, no one goes any further.  They do not research or report whether it is a much larger operation.

                 Yes, but there was some question about it. People were saying it was not on the up and up.  I usually don't listen to that, so I am at a standstill now.  I know there are people that would try to call her report bogus.  The enemy for sure.

                  I was hopeful Cathy O'Brien's story was bogus because TRANCE-FORMATION OF AMERICA was an evil book to read.  Since watching the video shoot confirming the face carved onto her vagina, I have zero doubts that the worst is likely the truth.  I've known for 26 years about ritual abuse but only since trump was elected has the curtain started to drop.  Many of these stories simply confirm what I've known for more than half my life.

                   Her abuser is Msgr. Thomas Benestad   It is a very strong and much needed revelation I believe has helped her.  She is still fighting after all these years.

                     She still has not reconciled with everything.  She knows there are things that will  come into her mind that she does not yet remember.  I don't even know how she copes.  I so admire her. The fact that she has confronted her rapist is astounding.  Such courage.

               There have been some horrid happenings in that area I am sure.  Need to be looked up.  I found quite a few of soldiers living on a base and arrested but nothing about there actually being a group of them doing it on the base but we know this is going on  It is going on in Afghanistan and in Columbia

                  Yes, it does seem as though it's still a tough hike up hill, but compared to just over a year ago, we are doing pretty good even though the evil seems to be ramping up and multiplying like cockroaches. Chin up though! : )

                   Oh no.  I will be ok.  I get like this after seeing certain things.  Sometimes it's just a small thing.  The new post about a choir's logo.  A Bleeping Ad for Swirls.  Ugh.
