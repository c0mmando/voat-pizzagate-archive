            Funny how each time David gets into the real evidence, RDS asks a question that sends him off in another, watered-down direction. When you're here to talk about the actual evidence of Pizzagate, why would you take 1/3 of your time to talk about internet issues and blockchain? Children are dying as we speak, and worse. This is why anything the CIA is controlling is not to be trusted - RDS has made this whole testimony so diluted and fragmented as to not be worth sharing.

            Not defending David here, but none of you have attacked what he says as being in error, only that his character and motives are in question.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have to say that while his personality leaves much to be desired for my own tastes, he can do great presentations of the facts with regard to Pizzagate evidence. He has a sharp mind and knows the subject well. I do believe he has suffered for his work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just find the 100% negative comments here a bit strange. There is NOTHING positive about David's presentation? If any of you had the chance to get the facts out to a wider forum than

             It has been hinted at many times that DS is CIA, but is he a catholic too? hahahaha......anything about validating pizzagate is a win ( I think that's where Titus frost might get off). DS works for someone it was just never found out who, but here he is giving testimony about COLONIAL pizzagate when George Pell has never been brought to justice yet and pope Fransic is one step away from an arrest by the ITTCS who has Vatican inside knowledge and also Interpole support......whatchout Francis I wouldn't go to Dublin this summer!. Also don't you thing its all aprapo that these vids are released during the Independence of the USA holiday when they were recorded before pizzagate even hit the internet? David didn't pop on the scene until after a lot of people already KNEW about it, remember John Podesta is not a Vatican podesta...….the timing is all wrong......whats amazing is that Voat pizzagate doesn't even know who DS is anymore.very sad...….Hillary Clinton was sending back dated messages ( so people who saw these back dated emails wouldn't open them...) but the attachments were current so its an old technique...an old one but a really good one that works......The whole thing is an internal war and has nothing to do with the public. The catholic spirit side wants to rule over the colonial capitalists money side but both sides are pizzagate. They all serve because blackmail is king don't ya know. In trying to take each other down they have exposed themselves to the public, Im sure we will see a few more years of this mess because they cant put the cat back in the bag but they are still trying as pedo people slowly go down while the fat cats throw them on the heap for damage control. The press as we speak are taking a beating about being totally corrupt. I also think David is very smart and that's why he was chosen, sure looks like Vatican backing to me, lots of witches on that commission too. scary. I don't trust this commission but ive never seen David talk about it in front of a bishop! This is pretty fresh but as you know THE MEDIA doesn't look to be picking it up for some reason....Its because the capitalist money makers own ALL the media...……..the pope needs a press. Better crack out that old Gutenburg and get cracken.

            ITNJ is a dog and pony show..they have no arresting powers...for that a court should have a lien on ur name ..
Courts get ur consent to have a lien on ur name when u take part in their debt currency system..the central bank note is a receipt of u allowing the govt to print debt currency in ur names ...collectively the public insures the currency and statututes ..in return of the implicit agreement to stand under the charge (do u under stand the charge) and be surety for any charge placed on the CAPITALISED NAME which is the creation of the state and property of it(A..lien) as long as it is used to further the debt.
When the public ..individually reduces the debt ...that lien vanishes..and the courts administered on admiralty rules..can return to being run on common law and jury system of peers who choose to reduce the debt ..
           </p>
           <p>
            ITNJ ..purports to run on common law...but does not have teeth like the administrative courts...since everyone sitting their holds a Capitalised name that is property of the state ..
If it places a charge under common law on, John Podesta..
..and they summon him to their tribunal...thhye cannot invite the police to enforce the policy since they dont have any lien on the name of JOHN PODESTA..
           </p>
           <p>
            JOHN PODESTA is not John Podesta is not the pedofreak we know..
I dont know all of law..but at least know that it is based on collective insurance by consent of the voters ...whose.names.are.properties entrusted by Rome to the holder of the birth certificate .who as trustees (first ur parents ..then after 18 ..the flesh and blood U) run the war declared by Rome in the papal bull dum diversas ( meaning until different..) claiming the assets of this world and its administration..
International and constitutional experts agree.this treaty we have with Rome via the birth certificate is the basis of internatiinal and national law..
           </p>
           <p>
            ITNJ cannot trump that ...even Trump cannot trump that...only u individually can trump this perpetual slavery ..since slavery is volunteer...u can only end perpetual slavery by acting different ..ie reduce the debt ..instead of lending ur labour credits ie debt ot the banking system of the War game..
WE R FUNDING OUR OWN SLAVERY 
..its laughable if it were not for these pedofreaks who now this game..
John podesta at the jesuit factory of george town university ..who has given talks on slavery at the law clubs of georgge town  knows what the game...
They the economic value of the legal fiction that is ur name ..and the capitolised (Capitol Vatican) version..
This is why he knows and values the abuse and killing of children..after he adopts them..
" I am ur father ...say it ...I AM YOUR FATHER."
He beats it into them

             Whoa ! I’ve tried to wrap my head around the whole birth certificate thing , but my brain can’t understand it . What a joke this life’s is ! Nothing is as it seems . We’ve been duped since birth . So basically we sign our children over to them at birth with a birth certificate? I looked into this before but came across some other stuff that says it’s bs and you can go to jail if you try to mess with it . Have you personally gone through the process of your surety right thing ?

              U dont sign ir child away..
What is happening is that 
when u are born ..u arr delivered at the port of the war game ...ur mothers apply for a live berth...it is this applicationnof live berth that is the financial instrument they use ..as a indemnified bill of lading..
The certificate is just a receipt saying that u have claim over that instrument ..like a fixed deposit certificate...
The apllication of live berth acts like a collateral for them to run the war...until u grow up and are given a choice to keep playing the war game or opt for peaxe..u have that option all the time ..
Ure just not informed of that choice..they ritualise this in movies
             </p>
             <p>
              ...its like a shipping journey...
U enter the port inside.a war game...
Google : what is namium
             </p>
             <p>
              To move the ship while in the game they require ur consent everytime u decide to move the script forward..
Another substitute for money is the word scrip..or colonial scrip..
From buyimg a cup of coffee..to ..a house or car...its part od a script and u need a scrip..
U work.for these scrip...or u pledge.ur future labour to introduce new scrip into the new event of the war game show..as a loan to ur Name ...
As trustee of that name inside the war ..u are a trustee...since u havent claimed ur right to the name by declaring peace and gain beneficiary status...
             </p>
             <p>
              U are constantly being diverted andnconfused ..asked to consume the credit u earn...
Consume actually means wastage ..
Its wastage since u can easily reduxe the war debt and declare peace...
Ur citizen..ship has then arrived at the port of peace ..
The indemnified bill of lading which is the applicationnof live berth can no longer be inside the war ..and ised as collateral to fund the war game scrip..
The US already acknowledges ur surety status ..when u reduce debt at its banks under its Acts...u call it a debit entry...it actually reduces the banks debt to u ...so the bank acdepts ur surety rights over it and the US bank pays ur bill..
In the case of using a fed note...it is the US treasury that pays dor that cup of coffee ..not u ..if u notice..
The US fed note is created because u agree to allow the US to create these notes with u as surety ..that isnthe voting system..u gove permission to go into 21 trillion because u agree to he surety to it ..
This is why the US fed prints notes ...when u are billed for that cup of coffe..u dont have to pay..u default ..and the capitalised names' insurer the govt discharges it ..ie it doesnt pay but shifts it into the future..via the promissoru note..no one pqys for.anything...evrrything is a record of a.default of payment ..
             </p>
             <p>
              Know its.not ur debt that is removed .from the US trewsury this.fictional.debt is only inside the game of the war..21trillion and counting ...
Remmber its ur instructiin and promissory note  that created the credit used to buy ur house..u basically acted like a mini govt ...instead of a treasury bill u created a mortgage contract ..with the house ie property as security..
and pledge to use ur future labour to at least pay the interest..
Same.with ur credit card..
At the instance u use it u create credit ..new credit thwt didnt exist before u bought the cup of coffee
             </p>
             <p>
              When u reduce the US debt ...u will.put back the obligation they have onto thier heads to discharge all ur debts ...past present and future...
Its difficult to understand since we have been driving the car in reverse....
             </p>
             <p>
              ..the charge on ur house will be removed ..once u agree with the US that u will...take any credit or assets.to.remove the US debt ..in.return for them.acknowledging hthat they will.remove all charges aginst ur name ..the mortgage debt that will be removed ..since the US will have to in writing acknowledge that u have been all along been the surety to creating all the credit in ur life..for the runnig of thr US ...
U stood.as surety inside the war game.to.create.the credit for the US bank (utube : money as debt)
The bank is a US sub corporation under its Acts...
Even ur name ..walmart ...ben and jerries are all registered corporatiins ..all created by some Act ...all.therefore sub US corporations..
U can start off.with say 10 dollars...to the US treasury ..u can do it as a group ..but make sure theyngive it in writing by email.that they acknowledge ur surety rights over them and will.discharge all bills and charges including ur mortgage contract ..
They have to acknowledge it since u already are surety to the credit u created for the bank...
             </p>
             <p>
              I am.gonna.do.it.with less.than a few dollars.a month ..if they agree in the first email....then im out of the game...
As.for.placing a.charge on others...i will plsce.a.charge on an insursnce company in another country...for forging.my signature...all that money will go to the US treasury...
Ur co tract with the US started with ur birth certificate...its a co tract to take care of the name and its beneficiary...
U r apllying reversionary interest on them
Google.: reversionary interest..
             </p>
             <p>
              U already surrender ur credit.to the US dont u?
Ure deposits.at the US banking system.is actually a loan to them..They then set up. As trustee to the account ..look closely at the dotted.line on ur check book..
Its not a.dotted line ...tell.me.what it says ?
One u understand what it says u will realise that when u get a bill.mit is not u whonis paying ..its the bank ...since u decreased its debt to u ...u call it debit ...when u debit the bank account u are decreasing the banks debt to u...unthen become surety to the banknat that instance ..and exercise ur surety rights over the US who then credits the shopkeeper..
The US discharged ur bill through the bank..
When u deposit. Ur credit u are actallynloaning to the war machine..
When u positiin ur credit to reduce debt ..u will feed the peafe machine and starve the war machine..even if it is a.few.dollars to.start with..
Whether it is on the war side or peace side ..u are acknowleged as.surety..social surety or security account ..
Can u see the dotted line ?
All in time

              Those pedo freaks know their time is up ....
The prince of thieves is about to Re turn..
Christ is just a double book entry system that accounts for this credit system ..it can be run for War ..or Peace...
They want to keep is sinning ..Sin is just a recording and depositiining of  our inside the war game ..
The original sin comes about when ur mother does labour to bring u into the earth vessel..the name is an account she creates with a name tagged to it..to record ur usage of that earth vessel which she actually laboured to create..u cannot pay her back ..hence they habe crrated a double book entry system called Xhrist ...savings account in Xhrist with u as the eventual beneficiary...but they program u as trustee ..holder of the birth certificate to loan it into a war game ...when u do that u become an enemy of ur own state ..ie enemy of the State ..and autimatically enter and fund the war at the same.time...
When u exit and defund it ..it is the equivalrnt of being at peace with ur estate ie ur name ..since u have decreased the debt u owe to ur mother ..
..there is a lot to read ...i am not completely knowledgeable in this topic..but now enough to see the trick ..that they themselves reveal to us..
             </p>
             <p>
              ..if u notice in the movie In Time ..the machines that make the rich wealthy are xreated in great volimes by the poor in factories...
Ur deposit alllows the bank to keep ot as margin for the credit u create for the banking system and the US treasury...
The US goes into debt by stealing ur future labour credits..and giving it to the arms industry ..big pharma ...which then deposit it into Big banks ..that then buy ur mortgage contract from the bank that also stole ur future labour to create the credit to buy ur house..
Is is stealing ...if its already stolen

              Once u realise that we dont own anything ...everythung is public property as everything is registered ..ur car ..ur house ..ur children..ur credit u will realise is not urs .. U will then see the bigger picture that all we arr are trustees..with the master trustee the US...our decision as trustees to loan into the war turns the master trustee into a war corpiration..when we as trustees reposition the credit on the Asset side of the US treasury and reduce its debt ..it will respond..we fear we lose everything if that happens...when we already have made and act out the decision of surrendering everyrhing by registering everything including our registered name to the war side ..
Fear then is sold back to us to keep us in the game of debt ..and we buy into it from a lack of knowledge..

                Just remember ..therr is no money ..and therefore .no debt...
All the credits u see are a record of a default ...
Either the system defaults on their payyment for ur labour..
..or the name u carry as a trustee defaults and this is recorded as a credit to the system..
These defaults is what run the war fictional debt system...
When u decide to stop defaultung by placing ur credits..and instructing ur book keeper to use it to reduce debt and thus collapse the treasury bill..
..u are stepping outside the war game and olaying the game of peace with the US as ur debtor...
It has been ur debtor from the start but only indirextly..via thr banking and bench system...

               <p>
                I have an anology in the form of a stage show explained to someone else..in thr comments..

              Rings a bell..
Does he cover leiber code and martial law.
The military code was set up about the same time in 
India ..with the sepoy mutiny of 1857 as back drop
In India ..every administrative officer has a military equivalent 
Designation..
For example the district collector has the 
equivalence of brigadier aftrr 7 years ..while 
.it takes 25 years for a soldier to attain it
The military rule is hiding behind a pseudo peaceful
Civil administration..
Its actually military peace keeping administratiin
while the fictional war is going on with fictiinal
debt created by us lending the debt we create 
by selling our labour..
This gives them a licence to designate us a
enemy of our estate..and collectively the State
.its a perpetual motion war machine
..perpetual voluntary slavery..as described in
the papal bull of diversas
enemies of Christ will be perpetual slaves
..
They live off our ignorance of this simple
accounting trick..
They got us selling the rope for Rome to hang us with

               <p>
                Thank u for the links...i'm still watchimg them for clues...
In most of these lenghty talks ..whether by design or not ...the solutiin is not given...but ive noticed that there are truths laced in..
As for fimding remedy in courts ..it is futile..
Make peace with ones adversary...
..the minute we use the banking system and bank note we are adversarys...the court system is a symptom of the debt created...
Courts are badically another tool to control debt inflation ..
Its a form of temperory death..
They A-rest in war ..
Similar how they give the account a-Rest in Peace...
               </p>
               <p>
                The simple silution is to reduce debt at the US treasury ..instead of surrendering all ur assets including labour credits to the registry of the war game ...do the same at the US treasury...
...
It doesnt take hours to understand ...
We already are sureties to the war credit ...and then the capitalised name is made to bear the cost or payment of the debt via statutues...
The legal definition of constitution is a documwnt that shifts debt onto a third party..
No different to ur car insurance policy..its to ensure the war ...and the corporation that runs it as a roman legal pirate corporation...we call it the Nation...
We are the third party that has to stand under the charges ...at court

            This video is of David Seaman sitting in front of a catholic bishop and others at an International Tribunal for Natural Justice  (ITNJ) meeting . They are discussing the topic of pizzagate openly and everyone should watch this to see how they manipulate EVERYTHING.  . David S has a huge following and can be used by them to mislead many . He claims to be the only “ researcher “ in the USA to banned from places like YouTube etc . ( pretty sure I heard that right )

             I have heard of Seaman but I don't listen to any YT idols.  They are in business for themselves, mostly.  Why the ITNJ is giving him voice, I do not know.  They must know they do not have power, but want to further spread the crimes of the pedo cabal and believe that he is speaking for the abused and those that wish to stop this insanity.  I am hoping they are not in collusion to just gain more attention for their own common good, and Narcissism.

              You can see them when you switch to 'desktop view', I also copied them for you below. The sidebar also has links to stuff like the archive of the Pizzagate wiki, so it might be worthwhile to take a look. ;-)
             </p>
             <h1>
             </h1>
             <p>
              PG rules:
             </p>
             <p>
              1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities. See definition of Pizzagate and examples of relevant posts.
             </p>
             <p>
              2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.
             </p>
             <p>
              3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate. EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support).
             </p>
             <p>
              4: Meta submissions and general discussion submissions without sources will be removed. Please submit indirectly relevant posts to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               /v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              and unsourced questions to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/AskPizzagate">
               /v/AskPizzagate
              </a>
              . Sourced activism / publicity posts and memes are allowed. Posts about the subverse itself go to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
               /v/pizzagatemods
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              5: You must label NSFW posts (“Not safe for work”; for example gore, nudity etc.) as such when submitting.
             </p>
             <p>
              6: No Link Posts -- Only editable submissions made with the "Discuss" button are allowed. "Link" submissions have been banned by the community for the reasons described here. Link posts will be immediately removed.
