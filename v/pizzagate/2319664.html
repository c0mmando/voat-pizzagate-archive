<p>According to its 2015 tax return Elysium had net assets of $5,371,088. From what I can see, the charity paid a salary of $740,000+ to founder Jennifer Howell. As she owns the charity, I\'m assuming the cash of $5m+ is hers.  Johnny Depp donated $25,000 (no doubt why Amber Heard was \'honoured\' by them). James Franco gave $7000.

<p>But there are absolutely no evidence of this.</p>
<p>I think this charity is a scam.  It\'s a vehicle set up by Jennifer Howell to make Jennifer wealthy.  There\'s no outreach work that is either visible or in evidence.

            There is no way these kind people would set up a fake charity.  J/K.

            Notice how all of their charities are always for kids (supposedly)?  None of the demons are involved with animals, homeless, vets, etc.  It's always foster/adoption/Haiti/art/music BS.

            In light of pizzagate all these charities seem to be, are fronts for pedophiles or money laundering operations. That aside, Marina "the male" Abramovic seems to be King Satanist that they all suck up to.
