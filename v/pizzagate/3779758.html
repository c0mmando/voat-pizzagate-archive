<p>Stow, MA — A police chief in Stow, Massachusetts has been pulled from his job as the city’s top cop after video by a self-declared pedophile hunter was posted online. The video allegedly shows the cop attempt to meet a boy — who the chief knew was only 14 — for sex. Instead of meeting the boy, however, the chief was confronted by  Predator Poachers Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Stow Police Chief Ralph Marino has been relieved of his duties after a meeting with state police over the weekend, according to authorities. As NBC10 Boston reports, Marino met with Massachusetts State Police representatives Saturday at the Stow police department, the town said. After the meeting he put himself on indefinite administrative leave and named Sgt. Darren Thraen as acting chief.</p>

            i watched the footage of his [Former Chief Ralph Marino] brief interview about the missing toddler, which if y'all don't know, happened not once but TWICE, and it physically hurt for me to see him lie. I could see through what he was saying.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a survivor of child abuse and mind control, i can say with certainty he was covering up his tracks yet his tracks were quite sloppily covered up. I'm so grateful that he got caught. I only wish he had a harsher sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            And i really hope the poor little toddler child is gonna be okay. it really sickens me to think he could have been involved in her momentary disappearances.

             He's a particularly good one, talks well with the police &amp; cooperates when they're called in on a perp. Brought down many others before, one I thought was even linked here but I get mixed up with other boards.

             As mentioned in one comment, he's incriminated men of the cloth, men in the military, in education, of all ages, classes &amp; ethnicities - all with a different excuse or justification, only one who ever sought help &amp; kept in contact with them gratefully. A chief of police is a major catch, but always one to watch yourself with from there on. Predator Poaches is a nationally-connected movement with several channels across different states. Most organized we've ever had since YouTubers started these kind of pranks, and the iconic Chris Hansen before them.

              I remember one youtuber who exposed pedophiles was publicly shamed by a feminist governor who said no one he confronts will ever be prosecuted. Called him a dangerous vigilante even though he was being a responsible and nonviolent citizen
