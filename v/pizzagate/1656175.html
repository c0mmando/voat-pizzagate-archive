            Wow I was expecting this thread to have some sort of updated info on McSorely.. Now I really am beginning to worry...
           </p>
           <p>
            abat - he was Kristin Cavalarri's brother. You know, the pretty blonde evil bitch from the MTV shows The OC and The Hills?? Because of his connection to her, I feel he may have known more than even we know. He spoke of the Rothschilds &amp; Rockefellers ruling the world shortly before his death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another strange "coincidence" was that Kristin gave birth to her third child the day his car was found abandoned w/ all utilities including radio blaring. THE SAME DAY! Not to mention the first pictures of her in public after it was confirmed Michael did.. she's not a very good actress. She looked like she was about to bust out laughing. But only certain type of people can see through people's true intent like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            These two have all the info that made me highly question the case:

            I will look into Cavalarri when I get time. I will look into McSorely if I can find lead. I have never heard of Cavalarri before. Got resource links? I do know who the McSorely guy is, what you refer to.

             Also there was a huge thread on a citizen investigator forum who did as much as they could to find out what happened until he was found, and the confirmation of death was exposure to the elements. Case closed. On their forum as well.. after they told me quite bluntly that " this isn't one of those type sites.  You'll get better answers else where but not here" 
whenever I mentioned him being followed and even called DURING THE EXACT TRIP to his mother to say he was. They seemed a bit too " earthy" to really understand how evil operates and that it's real, and it's hidden from public.. and people are murdered over it probably every day. And no doubt people are gang stalked and stuff. But they wouldn't have any of it.. so I was left alone in trying to find something off about the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             THERE WAS ONE THING I REMEMBER.. two police officers stated two different definitive statements regarding something that was impossible if it weren't a mistake. I just remember that.. the one statement ran from the polices' official site contradicted what the officer at us the actual scene said to the reporter. It was something important, it's just been so long since I was looking at that. I'm sorry but if you find stuff, then it'll give me some passion myself to look again as I've become better and better recently ;) back then, I was even wanting to go by myself on a trip just to look at everything and the people who worked at that last Gas Station he was at. Or if that slaughter house was still in use, the type of people who worked there.. I was really upset over this specific case for some reason. I guess because he looked like a good person who was killed for being so. Here's the vivid and highly detailed investigating involving the roads and locations and amount of time traveled, etc. They never seemed to expect ' foul play's ( which again, I find strange in lieu of the fact he said he was being F FOLLOWED!!  there are people in the world who are followed, no doubt. I hate when they use mental illness as a reason to not investigate more.  Grrrrr

            There was a guy "M" on Discord that claimed he was him.  Stories of boxes of empty vials, possibly for drawing blood.  This guy was very intelligent.
