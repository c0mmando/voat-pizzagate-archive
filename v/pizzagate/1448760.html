<p>If they\'re mysteriously missing, seems to be a legal case to report to authorities! If their home is with one of the involved people in the crimes of child abuse, seems to be a legit reason to report to child protective services! This has to stop!</p>
<p>How to know Cory Woolman, Caris\' mother, is involved: she commented on the picture above. How to know that\'s in fact Cory: her Pinterest has the same username (ccwoolman). Proof that\'s her Pinterest is on <a href="https://nl.pinterest.com/ccwoolman/followers/">her follower page</a> you can see someone following her called Jay Cummings. No coincidence, obviously, although I don\'t know who Jay Cummings is, maybe Scott\'s brother..?</p>
<p>Someone know more about Scott, Cory, how many children they have, their family, their role in this? Please.</p>
