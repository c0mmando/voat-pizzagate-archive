            I copy their work everyday and post it on pizzagatenomods. Thats why I understand the so called "Trolls" that come here everyday. Cicada3301 set up serveral puzzles that spanned every social media site. I know the truth all of it, even pertaining to NWO and their plans and players. LHOHQ Is mostly about 2 particular "government contractors" and government dark projects and companies who are funding our destruction. Their sites were years in the making. You can't put the clues together until you've seen it all. They've even dropped things I am pretty sure wikileaks hasn't printed just yet.
WorldCorpo is a depliction of a dark project -trauma to break ones psych, grey aliens is another one project, except they plan on taking the alien thing to a whole new level, and a whole new place.
           </p>

            Jimmy Comet is first a victim himself, possible cocaine addict, definetly a handler and possible pedo, if not he entertains the pedos/satanists and keeps them supplied. The real action happens at next door. The whole block should be burned to the ground, but please don't take my advice on that.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just opinion we have a hacker which I did a seperate post telling Jimmy they own all his bases. Well who in wikileaks do we know thats setting up pizza pages -Stratfor, who controls Stratfor?  Big shout out to fellow Voater who did an interview  he said "horse pizza pages" that helped me connect the dots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about the sandyhook/hamstead kids at the superbowl, the biggest child sex trafficking event of the year. The parents with Jimmy at the White house. Its impossible to id the boy playing ping pong with Obama from behind he does resemble one of the Sandyhook kids. We have trafficking and dark projects going on here simultaneously. Its been going on since the beginning of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have Imran Awan subscribed to the kid videos on youtube. He owns rental homes in Marthas vineyard. Then we have a pizza related map found by a realtor in the Podesta emails. ---I am betting Stratfor pizza related pages again.

            although I don't always agree with your comments about Jews, their certainly is similarities today from the World War 2 era. The sexual art is the same tactics they used to try to break Hilter and his culture. Hiltler burned all the books of porn early on and his country thrived. Today its being used the same way with pedophilia. Pedos satanists come in all walks of life though. These people they're all from hell. I don't care what they call themselves, on earth.

            PsychoNut and GoithamGirl did a lot of work on it.  The contact info was publicly available elsewhere so was not some big "leak."

           <p>
            Ultimately, after getting headaches from the flashing lights, it was concluded that the entire thing was a psyop.

             The entire thing was a psyop-No absolutely not, thats absurd. You admit quitting over flashing lights. I followed every single lead and every single site did anyone else? Here is one paragraph you probably can't find anywhere else yet and it was put there years ago.

              I have no control over the FACTS that: /
