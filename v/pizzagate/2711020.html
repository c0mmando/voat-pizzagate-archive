            Hello. Maybe I can help some people out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul McCartney is an interesting lad. If you say his name in a recorder and play it backwards. It sounds like “Ian Iachimoe”
           </p>
           <p>
            This was the name written as credit to “Paperback Writer” Ian also contributed to “International Times” magazine who also collaborated with “Yoko Ono” prior to John Lennon meeting her. You see Yoko claimed she never met or knew of the Beatles when she met John. This was always the “John and Yoko” story — but as Howard Stern pointed out when he interviewed McCartney for the first time, she knew who the Beatles were.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1993 McCartney and Youth (from Killing Joke) did their first collaboration album under an band alias name “The Fireman”
The first two Fireman albums never used McCartney or Youth name or voice. Their first album had a track called “222” in 1993. In 2007 Paul McCartney under his name did a track called 444.  444+222=
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1998 “The Fireman” had an amateur looking dotcom site to help promote their second CD album. There were 9 (yes nine) menu options to choose from. One link would take you to a naked woman from what looked like a photo from 70s perhaps. Other links would have cryptic messages some later identified as captions that were voice clips used in their second album. Later identified as Linda McCartney’s voice who passed before this album was released.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the webpages in 1998 said “The Fireman is No Mason” — there was an online web interview where someone in a walrus mask answered questions by only typing to the interviewer. The interviewer asked if “the fireman is no mason” an anagram. The Fireman responded with “no, no Sam it ain’t no anagram”
           </p>
           <p>
            10 years later, 2008 Paul McCartney publically promotes a third Fireman album officially using the McCartney name for the first time. On the back of the CD and LP plastic wrap there’s a sticker. And it says “no Sam, no it ain’t no anagram”
“No Sam” could be backwards for “mason” technically in a recorder.
           </p>
           <p>
            But “the fireman is no mason” does seem like after all these years an anagram for “I am the risen son of man”
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s all in the mind you know...
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, “ king of cosmania “ not just my username on this welcoming site, but also description used in Paul’s 2007 Memory Almost Full album. “King of cosmania” could be anagram for “Son of the Magickian”
           </p>
           <p>
            Crowley was rumored to be on cover of Pepper twice. But the man behind the blonde girl on right is not a second Crowley. But he is a member of a lodge !
           </p>
           <p>
            Also a mirror to Pepper cover will show a hidden walrus which premieres months before I am the Walrus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking of I am the walrus, it also comes from The Book of the Law by Crowley. “Let him practice speaking backwards , this, I am He, let him say, Eh am I.”  I am he...we are all together.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing you can’t SEE that isn’t shown. For all you know you’ve seen 3 McCartneys but have only heard 2 Paul’s. In other words, 3 Paul’s in front of our eyes over history and 2 Paul’s to our careful ears.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just Paul though? John? Ringo? Fingo? And this is just 1966-1967 and one band we are talking about.
           </p>

            There’s nothing you can see that isn’t shown.

           <p>
            It’s easy !

            I believe this information will become public in the near future. It would seem the problem is far greater and way beyond just Hollywood. It's pretty scary to think people do this. When it's reveled, expect a ton of suicides and people going off the rails. Some will refuse to accept the truth and stay blind forever, the worst fate...

            Paul re-published a Crowley book called the Winged Beetle in the 70’s. Aka scarab. You can see one on that new solo cover too. See where his band names came from now?

            No shock here, the Beatles were throwing up the hand signs and symbolism on their albums back in the day. John was the good one, that is why he is dead. Paul has always been for his own glory.

             John was not the good one. They were all born into masonry and were switched genders. The beatles are all women, their kids, spouses, and parents switched too. This is the dirty masonic secret aside from pedophilia. John’s death was faked. Mark David Chapman was a mason crisis actor.

            It sucks because I honestly want to like Paul McCartney, but always have it not even being him possibly in the back of my head.
Sorry for the off topic comment, but I don't have the points to make a postThe website actualized dot orghas the.. well I don't know the technical name so I'll just call it the "spiraling triangle." Also all his youtube videos.  The guy looks psychotic, but you can't judge by looks lol, and at first glance I didn't see anything suspicious besides the triangle which may have other meanings, and a banner that said "killer deals." But I only took a quick look at it, I thought maybe someone more adept at research would want to look it over.

            One of the biggest uses of symbology in recent years regarding album covers is seen on the Bon Iver album "22, a million" - designed by Eric Timothy Carlson. Loads on show if anyone wishes to take a look that knows a bit about this kind of thing. The album also contains songs called
            <strong>
             33 "GOD"
            </strong>
            and “
            <strong>
             666 ʇ
            </strong>
            ” (that's supposed to be an upside down cross, by the way)

             Paul re-published a Crowley book called the Winged Beetle in the 70’s. See where his band names came from now?

             Also reminder that the Beatles were transgender women like most of your favorite bands, and John and George’s deaths were faked.

             Not only that, but Paul is the second Paul from a look-a-like contest as per George Harrison. First one died in a car crash. Someone was playing with the truth either way you look at it, no?

               I just made a comment that I thought everyone knew about, and obviously they did not. George Harrison said that he died in a car crash and admitted it before he died. Why would I get so many people interested in what I know about that, all of the sudden? Strange to me, as I typed it as falling asleep. Perhaps I have hit a nerve unintentionally. I am going back on attack mode now, after being mellow for a while.

                What you believe is not the truth. Both the real Paul McCartney and the man calling himself Paul McCartney today, were performing as the same Beatles bass player at the same time between October 1963 and June 1964 - the last time the real Paul McCartney was seen alive.
               </p>
               <p>
                The conspiracy theory that Paul died in a car crash and was replaced by the winner of a lookalike contest - which was first put out there by a US radio host (therefore CIA) in 1969, is disinfo.

                   Believe is a funny word, in that you have to sometimes use the word to express an opinion. Opinion sounds a lot like an onion when you peel the layers back. I am sure that proof of information would buy a big golden shekel. Sadly for you, you are out of luck, with me.

            This is really sad.  They are all sickos.  Evil Satanic Perverted Sickos.  One of the songs is Come Onto Me.  Not Come Unto Me.  I don't want to idolize any group or one performer, But God, are there none left that we can enjoy?  Sad.

             You have to remember that a lot of the songs that you like were outright stolen from (?). If a particular song were to make money by the ones who stole it, they would indeed off the original composer if confronted with lawsuit. So much for the easy life of being a musician. Think, easily replaced.

                 Bob Dylan basically borrowed his entire style from Rambling Jack Elliot. Elliott was born in 1931 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Florence (Rieger) and Abraham Adnopoz. His family was Jewish. So was Dylan. R.Jack was tasked to get all of Americana and sell it through properly owned zionist channels, and that is exactly what he did. I could really just go on and on about that, but the video where he leaves his goy stepchildren that he never raised in poverty says a lot.

              Both industries need to be totally cleaned out.  Just like the RCC.  From top to bottom.  But people are so hooked on their favorites.  I agree that the Paul in the 1st video is the real one.  The other one is the fake.  I really noticed a much larger difference in John.  Paul's chin was out of wack and the hair.  But I would never have believed it then.

                Yeah, well I was a shrieking teeny bopper then so I would not have noticed.  It took me all this time to believe in this stuff.  But my God, who could ever imagine.  Wonder why they took John out.  I heard something about him being so involved with young girls that it was going to come out, but who knows.  He beat his first wife and then Yoko too I think.  But I think that was the 2nd John.  Good God  this is so confusing!

                 Never heard of that weird stuff. Yoko is super Strango though. Ono released the album Yes, I'm a Witch in 2007. I also remember her climbing into a black cloth bag with another man on a late night television show (Letterman)as an art thing. All you saw was a moving bag with imagination attached. I actually felt sorry for Julian when I was a kid, and still do.

             They all did. The last time the real Beatles were seen together was arriving at Wellington airport on June 21st 1964 - if they were killed on that day it would have been a solstice sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were replaced by look alikes that had been posing as them since at least October 1963 in TV shows, concerts and public appearances. This period covered the first visit to the USA and the Beatlemania phenomenon, which was a manufactured psyop.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last album to feature the real Beatles on the cover was "With The Beatles" - the one where their faces are in half-shadow, and the first album to feature the the replacements was "A Hard Days Night" - the movie to which contains both groups of men. The real Beatles couldn't have been around to see the release of the album or move because they would have blown the cover. They knew they had doubles posing as them, but were told it was for security reasons - probably had to sign the official secrets act.
            </p>
            <p>
             What makes this pizzagate related is Jimmy Savile was a major player in their murder and the subsequent cover-up. The replacements were probably brought up the ranks of freemasonry by committing human sacrifices, hence Aleister Crowley on Sgt Pepper.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is so much more to find out about this conspiracy, but there is also a red herring "conspiracy theory" that Paul died in 1966 and the other band members agreed to have a double take his place. This is to make people look at comparisons of Paul between 64 and 66 - essentially comparing images of the same man.
            </p>
            <p>
             This sacrifice and the sacrifice of JFK - if you connect all the dots - is what paved the way for 9/11 and pizzagate.

               There are no real sources for this. Everything that people investigate gets lost in the "Paul is dead" (PID) conspiracy theory subculture - which is full of shills and censorship.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have only known about PID since the beginning of the year,  when I was investigating the death of Heather O'Rourke which took me to this message board

               I quickly realised that the man calling himself Sir Paul McCartney was operating before the 1966 date when he was supposed to have replaced the real Paul.

              <p>
               I then set about trying to find the earliest time he posed as Paul and the last time Paul was seen. As I watched a lot of media I noticed differences in the other Beatles,  so I just tried to observe which ones were which. I noticed that both groups did shows at the same concert venue and clips of both groups were edited into a seamless whole.

               One of the best pieces of evidence, which I have shown to family members is a couple of videos from the 1964 and 1965 NME awards shows. Here are the two videos. When "Can't Buy Me Love" finishes on the first video, (64) immediately swith to the second video
