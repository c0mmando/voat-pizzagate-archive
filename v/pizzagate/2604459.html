Interesting article exploring the links between Scientology and the Intelligence community in the US and possibly in Russia. Is Scientology a real religion or cult? I think not. Nobody could seriously believe the stuff they supposedly believe. I\'ve never talked to a Scientologist who actually talked about what it is they believe... they just say it\'s &quot;changed their lives so much.&quot;</p>
<p>Note: if you\'ve ever been inside a Scientology building, you were definitely recorded the entire time. (Note: ex-Scientologist who responded to my previous post, nobody cares what you say, you\'re simply here to handle the SP)</p>
<p>Fascinating stuff</p>
<p>Beware Lord Xenu</p>
<p>P.S. Look around at the faces of the Scientologists you know and ask yourself, does this person bear a resemblance to the Satanic spawn love child of L. Ron and one of his love slaves? (P.S. to the Scientologist who responded to my previous post, no, I never said all Scientologists look as ugly as L Ron, just that some of you remind me of him)</p>
<p>P.S. Has anyone seen that scene in Deadpool where they are near some foster home center that they\'ve been talking about being a bad place and the guy running it runs outside the building and they say, &quot;Wow, he even runs like a pervert. He runs like a sex offender who just lost his laptop.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I had the scene to show you, my husband showed it to me yesterday.</p>

<p>P.S. To the &quot;ex&quot; scientologist who responded to my previous post, you\'re welcome to post your scripted letter campaign on this post if you please, I\'m sure people will be interested in how much you believed in Lord Xenu while you were a Scientologist. Funny, the numerous times I heard those same exact lines about how your religion is no crazier than other religions, because none of the Scientologists I knew believed in that stuff you claim your &quot;cult&quot; believes in. So fake! Cover blown!</p>',
