            Yes they are trying to normalize pedophilia, and once aware and red pilled it's plain as day. Good catch. I cut the cord and have a Roku tv, but even YouTube has tons of garbage, like cartoons and videos designed to groom children. All media is suspect as hell.

             Absolutely, it really is everywhere. I try hard to keep level headed and not be consumed by confirmation bias, but even objectively speaking you start to see it right across the media. The worst is the BBC for me, growing up you just trust it as a kid, but I now view it at an arms length and with such contempt.
            </p>

             And yeah, neither Branson nor his company's name has sat right with me.

             I respect your opinion, but I would argue it's not a massive leap. When films, program's, music, art, books, magazines, internet articles and radio are all perpetuating this propaganda I don't think it's a big leap to think a suspect company's tv adverts are doing the same.
