            I would like to add a word of caution.  I have been following child sex abuse and trafficking for several years and I think everyone should be aware of a pattern I have seen play out over and over again.  1.  CSA survivors claims are ignored by MSM.   2.  Some CSA survivors claims get covered by MSM.  In the UK the DM as linked below is often one such outlet.   3.  Either the story then vanishes, or it is given legs (more and more coverage) and then BAM - story after story appears tearing CSA survivor story apart etc.  4. The public is thus lulled back to sleep, but not before being brainswashed to suspect such stories as false and dismiss them when covered in the future.  5.   This is the most IMPORTANT, having used CSA survivor A, to rubbish the whole CSA and powerful people,  CSA survivor cases involving powerful people that have a lot of evidence and thus legs get buried under the IT IS ALL FALSE NARRATIVE.
           </p>

            I am not saying that is what is happening in this case just saying be aware.   Also same with Ben Swann who has multiple threads on here for days.  Again, Swann is probably genuine, but everyone needs to be aware how those in power can take the Swann report to drive the narrative down a certain path.   If, I were to guess what that is I am thinking research here and elsewhere has shown this goes beyond CPP etc.  Powerful players, corporations, foundations etc are involved in organized CSA, organ harvesting, blackmail, and destruction. It has been going on a long time, and tax payers around the world have funded a lot of it.   My sense is that might be worried this bigger story is about to unravel, so they give us CPP and JA and hopefully that will send most of us on our way

            I read 2 emails about her in the leaked Stratfor files that WikiLeaks published. I don't have the link.  I'm surprised to to see your post. The documents are in THE GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE FILES. wikileaks.org

             I went through every one of these (there were no hits at all for Anneke Lucas), I don't see what you are talking about.

              I have some info on her.  She was kidnapped and trafficked as a sex slave by police who were trained by DynCorp. The private army enforcer for the US.  DynCorp is also involved in rape, murder for hire, kidnapping, sex trafficking, organ harvesting, and torture.  This is how the Clinton Obama brigade uses them. 
This young woman said the police had raped her over a thousand times in addition to trafficking her.  It's been a while, but I'll search my files for links.

              Yup, it would be good to see links if you saw references in wikileaks. We need to be careful like the comment above mentions. They will try to undermine with fake news to legitamise their claims that it's all fake.

            Lucas has a credible history (she runs a prison-based Yoga system focused on healing and spoke about her history before Pizzagate broke), but when Lucas first made her claims about the nature of the pedo/murder ring online, no major publications picked up on them. Then, her Wikipedia page got scrubbed (reported on Voat recently).
