           Hi,
          </p>
          <p>
           I've not been posting on here much this last couple of weeks, I had been overdoing it a little and decided to take a step back after a couple of months, and be a bit more passive.
          </p>

           I seemed to have missed some stuff recently, and its pretty hard to find an accurate break down of the recent events.
          </p>
          <p>
           Could someone hit me up with a brief summary? I'm hearing a lot of stuff about Alefantis on reddit, and weird emails etc
Things are being scrubbed from reddit and voat? voat has been pretty good at not censoring stuff here, have mods accounts been compromised or something? whats the slimg link etc?
