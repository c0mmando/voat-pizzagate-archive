           Hi,
          </p>
          <p>
           I've not been posting on here much this last couple of weeks, I had been overdoing it a little and decided to take a step back after a couple of months, and be a bit more passive.

           Could someone hit me up with a brief summary? I'm hearing a lot of stuff about Alefantis on reddit, and weird emails etc
