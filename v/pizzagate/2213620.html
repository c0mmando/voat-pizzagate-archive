            <p>
             The comparison between the 1995 Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls and Burlesque, the Steven Antin film that opens today, is fairly inevitable. Both movies are about young naifs who arrive in the big city (Las Vegas and Los Angeles, respectively), wide-eyed and determined to do whatever it takes to win a part as a nightclub dancer.

            Ronni was a huge PR rep with a LOT of connections reflecting her long-term staying power in Hollywood. She was also an art dealer for those seeking a tax write-off and an investment. This was actual, valuable art one could temporarily donate to a high end museum for the prestige and the tax write-off to a charity cause. Usually happened during a dinner with society's elite. More prestige and acknowledgement of one's wealth &amp; power.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the art was real, some fake. Hard to tell the difference. A lot of BIG players got burned as a result especially with the NY side of the operations. Seller was always expected to compensate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eastern European big mob investor in the film, Burlesque, was laundering drug $$$, as SOP. He also expected to sleep with 1 of the young actresses as a bonus. SOP re Hollywood. Ronnie Chasen was involved with negotiations as well as selling investment art to cover the financial records and to lessen the tax burden for all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Problem was the young actress had a boyfriend. She begged Ronnie to get her out of her "obligation."  Meanwhile there's an enormous power play going on forever between those in the Mid East including the Arabs &amp; the Eastern Block. Both launder $$$ by financing films. ALL expect SOP "bonuses." They're enticed to invest my being shown pics &amp; very kinky videos of possible talent. Often they get to help pick the top leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Understand that not all films make a profit. Not always possible to figure out successes in advance. Track records are uneven for even the best Academy Award winners. This is why those who appear to consistently make $$$ and are Box Office draws get away with murder. Periodically those loyal to either side of the equation "get taken out" in a long ongoing contest of who's got more clout.
           </p>
           <p>
            NO ONE in Hollywood wanted the case solved. It would expose way, way too many power players re SOP in Hollywood. Not just talking the "fringe benefits" of major film financing. Therefore the Beverly Hills Police Dept once again was charged with immediately covering up a major scandal. They found a patsy which was a total joke to anyone who knew the smallest details of the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was 100% guaranteed to be a pro-Hit. Only a certain kind of shooter can hit a woman in the head and neck 3 times in a row without missing. Of course he used a silencer. Gun was completely different than the one claimed to be used by the set up "patsy."
           </p>
           <p>
            Shooting happened when Ronnie had to wait at a 4-corner traffic stop in Beverly Hills. Lots of people around on a weekday night, good weather and all, even if it was late evening. Shooter's car was dark with very dark tinted windows so no one could really see very much. He left the country without a trace.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Patsy" was attached to a very different gun without a silencer. It was claimed he was riding a bicycle. Believe me a Black man who appeared to be an alcoholic/drug addict or just not "all there" riding a bicycle in Beverly Hills at any hour would generate a lot of calls to the police, even without the shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting that an Indie-style Doc film was announced when it was apparent the way the case "was solved." "Patsy" after all "committed suicide, saying he wasn't ever going back to jail. Rumors are his family needed the $$$ he got for the faux hit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doc filmmaker, an Indie and not a name obviously, needed BH Police cooperation. They stalled forever. Finally he realized his film wasn't going to go anywhere, after hsi initially ignored threats to "put a lid on the Doc" got much, much stronger. Now you know why actresses all have super explicit pics and a wide variety of extremely kinky vid footage of them too.

                Easiest is to go to "LipstickAlley.com" and Google the names desired and start reading. Each famous name will bring you multiple threads, some recent, some not, and all have other names to add to your list of serial pedo abusers.
               </p>
               <p>
                While LipstickAlley is an online site originally designed for upwardly mobile, educated Black young women, others do read and post almost always Anonymously. Therefore plenty of "Insiders" leak lots of Hollywood "Tea" as it's referred to on LSA.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's done IMHO to spread the word of the inherent evils of the entertainment industry as LSA is basically a Christian oriented site. Also to lessen the fantasy aspect. There is understandable resentment of course of why White men can physically and sexually abuse so many and still be employed at a high paying job with a lot of perks without being arrested. Just letting you know in advance to be respectful if you choose to go onto that site. Overall it has the MOST info re pedo and adult sexual, and physical and emotional abuse stories from both Old and Current Hollywood. No, info definitely covers all races of actors and singers/musicians.

                Some of my extensive notes from another site that's been degraded here were re-posted under my other handle without my permission. Just wish they would have posted them as "anonymous." While purposely not necessarily mentioning him directly, it involves Linkin Park &amp; Yugoslavia.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also he's well-known to be a super power player in the decision to really boost certain actors &amp; singers careers over others for various reasons. Cher has been repeatedly papped with him but now claims to be on the outs for various reasons.

                When you're on a huge yacht in international waters you have a lot more freedom re your choice of guests and age restrictions re alcohol &amp; party materials. Everyone knows what the captain says, goes. Hired crew are usually very well-paid but must be totally subservient. It's an occupation with an extremely high turnover.
               </p>
               <p>
                Since ALL of Hollywood prioritizes the powerful, as defined by who overall makes the most $$$ for everyone else, and who has access to the biggest investors with the deepest pockets, as well as the largest markets to sell the "product," or alternatively actual or claimed connections to one or more of the above, please take that into consideration as to what Hollywood will always accept.

            This is excellent detective work. Ronni was a publicist she knew all the dark secrets in Hollywood. Geffen and Diller are so wealthy and have been wealthy for so long they have to be at the center of the young boy sex party network. Keep digging!

             That's random. 'College Humor.com' ? Weird, until you realize College Humor's founder, above-mentioned
             <strong>
              Ricky

             WOW.
             <strong>
              Barry Diller
             </strong>
             was a guest at Alison and Ricky's wedding in 2015. Huh. So that must mean Barry and Brian are close + good friends. Huh.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why was Brian suspended from NBC's Nighty News? For exaggerating a few stories away from the newsdesk?Could Diller have not stepped in and made it go away? NBC statement at the time: "The extensive review found that Williams made a number of inaccurate statements about his own role and experiences covering events in the field. The statements in question did not for the most part occur on NBC News platforms or in the immediate aftermath of the news events, but rather on late-night programs and during public appearances, usually years after the news events in question."
            </p>
            <p>
             Please. Why was Brian REALLY suspended? Coz he's a fking sleazeball of Weinstein (or Diller himself) proportions? Or worse?
