<p>It is time to speak up for the children who are sexually used by the Shriners and Jesters. The fact that Shriners have sex with children at their sex parties is probably their most closely guarded secret. Their basic protocol is to drug children so they can’t remember what happened afterward. The children, no matter how many times they are raped and degraded by Shriner pedophiles, do not remember it afterwards. This enables the pedophiles to use innocent children over and over again with nary a worry of exposure. </p>
<p>The mothers of these children are not drugged and thus live with the guilt of keeping this horrible secret from their targeted child/children and everyone else their entire lives — like my mother did. My mother (now deceased) was a victim of the Shriners and it is for her sake as well that I speak out. She married a Shriner without knowing the plans he had for his adopted stepdaughter. I wonder if these were not his plans initially. Perhaps he saw others in his fraternity doing this and figured this would be an easy way for him, a family law attorney, to earn some extra money. Either way, it was an unconscionable thing to do not only to me, but to his own wife! My dear mother (nor any mother) did not deserve to suffer with the knowledge that her child was being used by lecherous men who marched proudly in parades.) The wives are told that if they say anything, their entire family will be killed. This is how the Freemasons operate. </p>
<p>I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ now and it is he who protects me, not my silence. I will not be silent when children are being filthily defiled by Shriners and other Luciferians who think they are above the law. They can get away with crimes worthy of thirty years only if those who know what they are doing keep their secrets for them.</p>
<p>Shriners are Luciferians. This is crucial to know in order to understand one of the main reasons they choose to sexually abuse children. Occultists move up in degree more quickly by sexually violating children, Plus, pedophiles just plain enjoy having sex with children. 
If you are a Shriner and not a pedophile, you are not off the hook. You choose to associate with such people and call them brothers. Considering the fact that Shriners are Moslems (they take an Islamic oath and have an Islamic belief system) take note of what the Islamic “faith” says about using underage girls for sex.</p>
<p>The Shriners have their hospitals so they will have a tax deduction but only a small percentage of their donations goes to these hospitals. Every parent who has a child in one of these hospitals should not let that child out of their sight and get their child out of that hospital as quickly as they can. The staff might not touch them, but if a pedophile Shriner wants to get his hands on your child he can. Due to being drugged, the child will not recall what has happened to him/her so as to report it to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Morocco Shrine of Jacksonville, Florida. Men who came from this precise group of Shriners sexually abused me and other innocent children. And no, this wasn’t some one-time event. This went on for years. Shriners like to party and it is not just with adult prostitutes. It is with children — and they have plenty of money to pay the wicked adults who hand them over.
Well their filthy secrets are being exposed. Parents, keep your children away from grown men who regard your children as “our kids.” They do not own your children and they have no right to do with them what they will. Grown men with Luciferian beliefs and values have no business taking charge of anyone’s children.</p>

Be Aware and Keep Posting about them now.  Keep looking up their  misdeeds and criminal corruption and POST them here.  Everyday We Must Post.  How about 10 Posts A Day?

            Roskens has been implicated by multiple authors now as one of the behind-the-scenes operators who walked out of the scandal untouched. He turns out to be a fascinating nexus of parapolitical weirdness in his own right. He's also involved with a Masonic "boy's club" with a remarkable pedigree which I'd never heard of....

             Yes this Roskens is def a piece of work: Since 1996, Roskens has served as President of an international business-consulting firm, called Global Connections, in Omaha. In 1999, the government of Japan appointed him honorary consul general for the Nebraska region to assist Japanese nationals living and working in the Omaha/northern plains regions, to improve trade relations and to monitor local exchange programs with Japan. He also serves as Chairman of the Omaha/Douglas Building Commission; is a board member for ConAgra Foods and The Silverstone Group; and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  That's just for starters.  Thanks for including him.  Am reading now.

             L.B. "Red" Thomas headed up finances for ConAgra, which put funds into Franklin certificates of deposit. Union Pacific, and its executives acting as individuals, poured in money, while Union Pacific officer Arnold Nesbitt sat on the board.

             Ak-Sar-Ben interfaced with the Franklin credit union proper, but also with individuals in the orbit of Larry King. One of its biggest financial contributors in recent years was the department store heir and child abuser, Alan Baer.

I asked my close friend and adviser William Colby one day in 1991.

              "I give up," former head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Colby said. "What could that group have in common?"
"Three things," I replied, "all of them a burden at times for those who have to carry them. The three things are me (John DeCamp), a case called Franklin and a man named Larry King."

              While I am upset about Roskens being charged with accepting gifts and taking trips I am really upset with what he might also have done as head of USAID.  We know there were many things going on in Syria during the gassing of the people, so we know there were things he must have been overseeing as well.  This is what worries me.  Of course, had he been charged with something similar (which I doubt they would allow to happen) I think he would have received a slap on the wrist for that as well.

            This seems relevant:
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/13/guatemalan-childrens-shelter-fire-death-toll-rises">
             Victims from Guatemala children's shelter fire flown to Galveston Shriners' Hospital
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             EDIT: To be clear, I have nothing to support the victim's claim that kids get abused in Shriner Hospitals. There are 20 such hospitals in the U.S., one in Canada, and one in Mexico. My suspicion is that since these are charity hospitals, they will see a high proportion of kids in foster care, or homeless, or otherwise vulnerable. These are the kids that have the highest rates of sexual abuse by their guardians, as well as being the most frequently trafficked. So there may well be a connection, and I am looking for one. This news story was the first thing that I turned up.
