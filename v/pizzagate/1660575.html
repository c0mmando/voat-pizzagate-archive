<p>New facts and details have emerged in the Laura Silsby child trafficking incident in Haiti. This article will provide background on the case, Silsby\'s connections to the Clintons and the politically powerful, as well as newer developments regarding her possible continued criminal activities with husband Norman Wade Gayler.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Laura_Silsby">More information on Laura Silsby and the New Life Children\'s Refuge Incident can be found on the Pizzagate Wiki.</a></em></p>
<h1>New Life Children\'s Refuge Incident</h1>
<p>Laura Silsby, now Laura Gayler, was implicated in the abduction of 33 children in Haiti in 2010 along with fellow missionaries from her organization, New Life Children\'s Refuge (NLCR). Silsby and the missionaries would claim they were taking orphans from the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic. It would be revealed, however, that the children not only had families, but NLCR was also never authorized by the Dominican Republic to set up an orphanage.</p>
<h1>History with the Clintons and their help in the cover-up</h1>
<p>Sometime before the actual incident, WikiLeaks emails show the US State Department had an email from NLCR detailing the costs and methods for transporting children form Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Their mission has bizarre religious motivations and should have certainly been watched more closely by the State Department: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the urgent needs from this earthquake, God has laid upon our hearts the need to go now vs. waiting until the permanent facility is built. He has provided an interim solution in nearby Cabarete, where we will be leasing a 45 room hotel and converting it into an orphanage until the building is complete. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huma Abedin, close aid to Hillary Clinton and wife of Anthony Weiner, was frequently forwarding Hillary articles on Silsby\'s organization and its status leading up to the event: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772</a></p>
<p>Hillary Clinton and her infamous lawyer Cheryl D. Mills were then subsequently involved in covering up the story of the incident. According to WikiLeaks releases they worked to produce a controlled version of the story for the mainstream media: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3465</a></p>
<p>Then Bill Clinton arrived in Haiti three weeks after the earthquake in February 2010 and just days after Laura Silsby and the New Life Childrenâ€™s Refuge missionaries were arrested. Within one month he managed to convince the Haitian government that there had been no wrong-doing and the charges were dropped from kidnapping to &quot;irregular air travel&quot;. All the missionaries were immediately freed aside from Laura Silsby, who then served 4 months in Haitian jail.</p>
<h1>Husband Norman Wade Gayler\'s possible criminal past</h1>
<p>Upon returning from Haiti, Laura Silsby would marry Idahoan Norman Gayler in 2015.<a href="http://www.idahopress.com/members/marriage-licenses/article_66d89e80-7ac7-11e5-8455-bb1f73f60cf5.html">(1)</a> Norman more commonly goes by his middle name Wade Gayler in the Idaho business community and is currently a staff member of the Red Cross as well as Utah and Idaho Southern Baptist: <a href="http://radaris.com/p/Wade/Gayler/">http://radaris.com/p/Wade/Gayler/</a></p>
<p>Reddit researcher Ridestraight would identify Norman Wade Gayler\'s name, face, and story with a serial Salt Lake City criminal and biker gang member. His mugshot can be found 7 times for various crimes in Salt Lake City during the 90s for unspecified crimes worth thousands in bonds.

            The best is the picture of Laura Silsby clamping her lips together:

           </p>
           <p>
            She's got a deep dark secret she's hiding and I have a sneeky suspicion it's about to come out:
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            One other damming piece of circumstantial evidence is the Mormons have been helping out the CIA for years. And the story we've all heard about Howard Hughes may even be a lie:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTtD3Edtyzo&amp;t=2s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTtD3Edtyzo&amp;t=2s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks like Howard Hughes may have faked his own death and hired a coterie of Mormons to serve as his body guards for the last 25 years of his like.

               Well facial structure and weight-distribution due to age and obviously weight gain seem consistent. Eye color is hard to see in the more recent pictures but there is a certain resemblance. That could be said when comparing all sorts of people though so while it's there, it should just be looked into more than any sort of conclusion.
