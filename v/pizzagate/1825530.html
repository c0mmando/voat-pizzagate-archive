            Last night I was listening to Pocketsoffuture podcast by Paul Ramono (great videos) and he pointed out clearly that introducing children to any material that is explicitly sexual in nature already tantarmounts to sexual abuse since children are not wired to grasp anything sexual - especially boys who mature at an older age. Children have to be left alone to explore their own sexuality by exploring the world around them with some sage guidance from well meaning adults around them - and I mean adults, not NAMBLA perverts!!!!!

            This goes way back to the Bolchevik revolution and the Nazzi party - both were funded by occult satanist bankers using homisexual pedophile advocates - it is an ongoing NWO conspiracy. BTW - check out Hitler's Youth movement founder - he was a notorious homosexual pedophile! Time to connect the dots! NAMBLA and Trotskites are one and the same. Time to smoke the beast out of it's cave!

            Yeah I'll comment and upvoat every thread concerning this matter.

           <p>
            I KNEW there had to be some real dirt on these BAMN bastards especially considering their so openly Marxist.  I've never seen one example from any marxist ideologist that isn't as transparent and shallow as a ghost and every since marxist communism was invented by the international bankers it has been NOTHING but a convenient hiding place for members of the satanic cult.  The bolshevik revolution and the elimination of the czars and millions of christian lives later the scourge is still spreading from the eastern block in an orchestrated takeover.  Communism has only been being implemented in the world because they have found out it is the form of slavery that works best for them because they can eliminate any opposition at will.  Fuck these trotskyite prostitutes and pedophiles straight to fucking hell.

             You're dead on the money. If only 15% of the US population could grasp this comment - NWO will be no longer. Marx was a Rotchild agent - the goal was to comsolidate power. Communism = State Capitalism! Notging more, and whoever controlls the state controlls the everything. I grew up during communism in a Soviet republic - I know from first hand experience. It's all a satanic agenda and pedophilia is its global currency!

            These NAMBLA types thought they were very close to achieving their goals until Trump won. They were just one SCOTUS justice away from the legalized child rape that Ruth Bader Ginsburg demanded in her 1977 manifesto.

             Let's see which "rights" groups publically speaks out first for protecting kids from grooming/brainwashing/'emancipating themselves from their parents (or running across state lines and assuming a fake identity, while living with a Den Mother like Felarca, and being forced to attend Marxist meetings and protests.
             <em>
              And perhaps (if they're really good and worthy of it), servicing their adult pedophile protest group members?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Who will it be?
 "Women's" groups and LGBTQXYZ "communities" ? (they have never to my knowledge spoken out against NAMBLA so why would they start now?
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Recall 1991 was the 15th!! Conference (the year of the Newsletter printing BAMN's Eileen Scheff's position on Nambla: a loud ringing endorsement!).  At that time the newsletter reported that Scheff was a Detroit Lesbian/Gay rights attorney and RWL activist,
             <em>
              meaning she's a Marxist Communist
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh BTW, in the newsletter, Scheff calls Nambla a Gay Organization...so all you gays who are not on board with this shyte (and I know you're out there, some are here helping us expose the pedos)...better contact your community to denounce Scheff, (and BAMN), or accept that people will always link "Gay Organization" with pedo Nambla.
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone from the Woman's Center in San Francisco did denounce Nambla, AFTER they let the group use their building for a conference, but at least they denounced them publically.  As far as the FemiProNons...they don't seem to have time to stop fretting about their vaginas, and now breasts...Today on their radar: FemiTard de jour up in arms today over babies' breast feeding privilege!  So unfair to the cucks!
            </p>
            <p>
             So who else will speak out for the kids' rights to NOT be groomed as sex toys for most often than not, white men?
 "Immigrations rights" groups? (
             <em>
              Open Borders makes trafficking boys and girls soooo much easier!
             </em>
             ), like Shanta Driver (attorney) and (attorney) Eileen Scheff's BAMN?..Oops, that's right, the group was conceived in FULL SUPPORT of Nambla...
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems, according to this DC article, the only group with enough sense to call out BAMN's propensity of hanging with clueless kids  was NAACP and the FBI!
"In 2005, the NAACP criticized BAMN for taking advantage of black middle- and high-school students to add to their numbers.
“Some of them didn’t even know why they were there – they were just there as tokens, so people would see a large number of black students,” Alex Moffet, then-president of the NAACP said, adding that BAMN was “just perpetuating untruths about young black students. As a community, we find that totally unacceptable.”
             <em>
              Who got the high school kids to take time away from school to "protest" the election results? hmmm
             </em>
             (Well we know Yvette Felarca was an organizer and marched in at least one BLM protest..so that (White Male) Soros paid group has doesn't seem to have a problem being associated with BAMN in that respect)
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2005, the FBI put BAMN on a list of organizations potentially involved in terroristic activities. The ACLU publicly blasted the FBI in defense of BAMN, which the ACLU said was only engaging in “peaceful protest activities.”
            </p>
            <p>
             "Four of RWL’s (BAMN's parent group) proposals (top left) were adopted at the NAMBLA conference.
             <em>
              wonder which ones help destroy society and create a Marxist Communist Worker State?
             </em>
             Four of those proposals were adopted as positions by NAMBLA:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Abolish all age-based curfews.”
             <em>
              kids need to be transported across state lines at any hour day or night!
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             “Children shall have the right to ‘divorce’ their parents.”
             <em>
              Yvette Felarca and Shanta Driver call it 'emancipation' probably because the whole child divorce idea didn't resonate with the majority of Americans.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             “Lower the voting age and extend the right to vote and hold office to all politically active youth.”
             <em>
              So they can protest anyone who speaks out against pedophiles and then become Mayor!
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             “Children and youth must be provided non moralistic, explicit, sex-positive – including lesbian/gay positive – sex education that includes safe sex education. Condoms, latex barriers and contraceptives in appropriate smaller sizes must be distributed in all schools.”
             <em>
              you mean with qualified Marxist professors, lawyers, teachers, Organizers and politicians?  They can demonstrate how to engage with "appropriate smaller sizes
