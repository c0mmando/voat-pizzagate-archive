There are disturbing indications that Mr. Alefantis is running some form of pedophile ring that involves quite a few public figures in Washington D.C.  It would appear that he is the "Achilles heel" for all these people of stature.</p>
<p>Since the investigation began, Mr. Alefantis has deleted many of his posts and set his social media to private. We have archived the entirety of his online presence however. Links posted here are both archives and screenshots I took while helping to investigate.</p>
<p>First I will discuss Alefantis’ links to powerful people, then outline the preponderance of evidence that he is a pedophile and uses Comet Ping Pong as a front for his sex trafficking ring.</p>
<p>#I. Connections between Power Brokers and Alefantis</p>
<p>**David Brock, director of Correct the Record**</p>
<p>James Alefantis is the romantic partner of former CTR director David Brock.  Here is a link confirming this and showing them caught up with another individual in some kind of blackmail love triangle:</p>
<p>http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html</p>
<p>Here is a photo of Brock on Alefantis\' Instagram:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/p58Eks.png</p>
<p>**Hillary Clinton**</p>
<p>Here is a letter Alefantis posted from Hillary thanking him for helping with a fundraiser that involved the Podestas:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/Jeh0X</p>
<p>An FEC search also shows payments made to Alefantis from the Clinton Campaign and pro Clinton PACS</p>

<p>http://archive.is/5ljQn</p>
<p>**Barack Obama**</p>
<p>Here is a photo Alefantis posted showing Obama playing ping pong with a young boy:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/4uB5R</p>
<p>Obama has also been identified in the Wikileaks Podesta dump as having held phone banks at Comet Ping Pong\'s location:</p>

<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5326#efmADoAEY</p>
<p>Alefantis is also listed in White House records as having visited a few times:</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/Ia1lLQK</p>
<p>**George Soros**</p>
<p>Yes, George Soros even is involved with this pizza parlor. He is listed as a major donor to the American Bridge 21st Century PAC:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/afTPu</p>
<p>This PAC is on record with the FEC as having made several donations to Comet Ping Pong:</p>

<p>http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?13940775420</p>
<p>http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?14960793887</p>
<p>**Marina Abramovic**</p>
<p>Alefantis appears to have some form of relationship to spirit cooking "artist" Marina Abramovic as he references her in his instagram:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/laESt4</p>
<p>He also posted a photo which appears to possibly make a Moloch reference:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/ycEwD</p>
<p>**Podestas**</p>
<p>Here is Alefantis posting a photo of Tony Podestas house:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/LIHTn</p>
<p>You may remember this "Arch of Agony" statue from the house of Tony Podesta, as seen in this Washington Post article:</p>
<p>https://archive.fo/HhWH9</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this house contains art showing child abuse by Biljana Djurdjevic:</p>

<p>#II. Implications James Alefantis is running a pedophile ring out of Comet Ping Pong</p>
<p>**A. Sexual references made in Comet Ping Pong and by Alefantis online**</p>
<p>First. Comet Ping Pong advertises itself as a "family place for parents and their kids"</p>
<p>This website here shows that a reviewer mentioned the presence of hidden doors in the establishment (it also revealed that the Food Network show host Guy Fieri has done an episode there). Link and screenshot of relevant portion here:</p>
<p>http://www.sashalordpresents.com/comet/</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/iFTJal.png</p>
<p>The Washington Post has also run a story revealing that Comet Ping Pong has been accused by a Washington Neighborhood Commissioner of being a "haven for rape and murder:"</p>
<p>http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html</p>
<p>http://archive.is/ezdQE</p>
<p>http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13055188/frank-winstead-gone-wild-the-recordings</p>
<p>http://archive.is/23PH4</p>
<p>Despite it\'s claim to be "family friendly" the restaurant has a number of disturbing sexual references inside and James Alefantis makes a number of references to pedophelia both overtly and implicitly online.  Alefantis actually posted a photo of an “art” photo piece which appears to show a man vaginally penetrating what could be an underage girl. I have decided not to share it here but it has been archived. He has since deleted the photo.</p>
<p>EDIT: People suggested I post an edited version of the photo. Here it is, with all NSFW parts removed:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/IFs0bU.png</p>
<p>EDIT: users saying this actually might is a self portrait of the artist and his pornstar wife. But I still think it\'s inappropriate that the owner of a "kid friendly" establishment was posting hardcore pornography to his Instagram at the very least.</p>
<p>Here is a photo showing the inside of Comet Ping Pong where graffiti saying “shut up and fuck” and “Amen” are clearly visible:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/lu0Uf9.png</p>
<p>He posted a disturbing image of a little girl taped down to a table in Comet Ping Pong:</p>
<p>https://archive.fo/YJJnJ</p>
<p>He joked about purchasing infants:</p>
<p>https://archive.fo/5UecO</p>
<p>Here he posted a photo featuring a man wearing a shirt that says “I love children” in French:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/ON22AY.png</p>
<p>Here he reference a “boom boom room” which sounds disturbingly like a play on the phrase “boom boom” used by foreign prostitutes to describe sex:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/Dk0yPw</p>
<p>More on the above photo:</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2015/10/14/with-la-boum-boum-room-d-c-just-got-a-lot-weirder/</p>
<p>A photo showing children engaged in some strange ceremony or ritual:</p>
<p>http://archive.is/hXYje</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/dAMKb2.jpg</p>
<p>Another odd photo someone tagged at Comet Ping Pong:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/7UoOMf.png</p>
<p>Here Alefantis posted a photo of a man with a yellow bead necklace around the head of a young boy. A quick search reveals yellow sex bracelets imply analingus,  and the hashtag #chickenlovers in the instagram post is a pedophile reference to adult men who are attracted to underage boys. Links below:</p>

<p>http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sex%20bracelets</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/RXxkc6.png</p>
<p>**B. References to pizza in a was that is either sexual or involved children**</p>
<p>Alefantis and others **clearly** use the term “pizza” to allude, at the very least to sex (I believe it to mean sex with minors).  Here are a number of references from Alefantis and others tagged at Comet Ping Pong making sexual innuendos about pizza and children:</p>
<p>https://archive.fo/rwOig</p>
<p>https://archive.fo/mKH6M</p>
<p>https://archive.fo/NphBA</p>

<p>http://imgur.com/a/txnm3</p>
<p>https://archive.is/FMLbx</p>
<p>**C. Innuendos to systematic child abuse and trafficking**</p>
<p>Comet Ping Pong’s posters for the “concerts” played at their venue show references to abuse and pedophilia.  </p>
<p>Here is an poster which may refer to the out of body experience children have when experiencing extreme abuse:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg</p>
<p>Here is one showing a band called the “Lolitas” played at Comet Ping Pong:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/4Y3VIs.jpg</p>
<p>**More disturbingly** Alefantis has posted a number of photos showing very suspicious rooms, construction of underground chambers and openly joked about “filling them” with his friends on Instagram.  </p>
<p>Here is a photo Alefantis posted showing men digging a hole.  Him and his friends joke about “filling it” and a commenter claims his hole has  “been full for quite some time now.”  They also joke about doing a “line up” at the hole in the near future.</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/s3px8V.png</p>
<p>Another photo he posted appears to shows a large freezer, which could appear to be a location used for some kind of imprisonment or torture. Commenters on the photo joke “rinse it off when you’re done” and “kill room.”</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/86mWlT.png</p>
<p>The man who commented “kill room” on the above photo has a number of images on his Instagram appearing to show he makes child sized coffins:</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/m9UgrV.png</p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/3YcyRF.png</p>
<p>**Here is a disturbing Wikileaks email where a "torture chamber" is referenced:**</p>
<p>https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492</p>
<p>Finally, people have noticed that pro-Hillary groups own ALL the properties on the block where Comet Ping Pong is located.  </p>
<p>https://i.sli.mg/1XVf9d.png</p>
<p>As noted in the previous picture, some of the company logos of nearby groups who have offices near Comet Ping Pong look similar to known images used by pedophiles as per this FBI document:</p>

           The individual I have mentioned is one James Achilles Alefantis. Mr. Alefantis is the owner of the Washington DC pizza parlor Comet Ping Pong. There are disturbing indications that Mr. Alefantis is running some form of pedophile ring that involves quite a few public figures in Washington D.C.  It would appear that he is the "Achilles heel" for all these people of stature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since the investigation began, Mr. Alefantis has deleted many of his posts and set his social media to private. We have archived the entirety of his online presence however. Links posted here are both archives and screenshots I took while helping to investigate.

           Despite it's claim to be "family friendly" the restaurant has a number of disturbing sexual references inside and James Alefantis makes a number of references to pedophelia both overtly and implicitly online.  Alefantis actually posted a photo of an “art” photo piece which appears to show a man vaginally penetrating what could be an underage girl. I have decided not to share it here but it has been archived. He has since deleted the photo.

           EDIT: People suggested I post an edited version of the photo. Here it is, with all NSFW parts removed:

           EDIT: users saying this actually might is a self portrait of the artist and his pornstar wife. But I still think it's inappropriate that the owner of a "kid friendly" establishment was posting hardcore pornography to his Instagram at the very least.

           Here is a photo showing the inside of Comet Ping Pong where graffiti saying “shut up and fuck” and “Amen” are clearly visible:

           He posted a disturbing image of a little girl taped down to a table in Comet Ping Pong:

           Here he posted a photo featuring a man wearing a shirt that says “I love children” in French:

          </p>
          <p>
           Here he reference a “boom boom room” which sounds disturbingly like a play on the phrase “boom boom” used by foreign prostitutes to describe sex:

           Here Alefantis posted a photo of a man with a yellow bead necklace around the head of a young boy. A quick search reveals yellow sex bracelets imply analingus,  and the hashtag #chickenlovers in the instagram post is a pedophile reference to adult men who are attracted to underage boys.

           **B. References to pizza in a was that is either sexual or involved children**
          </p>
          <p>
           Alefantis and others **clearly** use the term “pizza” to allude, at the very least to sex (I believe it to mean sex with minors).  Here are a number of references from Alefantis and others tagged at Comet Ping Pong making sexual innuendos about pizza and children:

           **C. Innuendos to systematic child abuse and trafficking**
          </p>
          <p>
           Comet Ping Pong’s posters for the “concerts” played at their venue show references to abuse and pedophilia.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here is an poster which may refer to the out of body experience children have when experiencing extreme abuse:

           Here is one showing a band called the “Lolitas” played at Comet Ping Pong:

          </p>
          <p>
           **More disturbingly** Alefantis has posted a number of photos showing very suspicious rooms, construction of underground chambers and openly joked about “filling them” with his friends on Instagram.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here is a photo Alefantis posted showing men digging a hole.  Him and his friends joke about “filling it” and a commenter claims his hole has  “been full for quite some time now.”  They also joke about doing a “line up” at the hole in the near future.

          <p>
           Another photo he posted appears to shows a large freezer, which could appear to be a location used for some kind of imprisonment or torture. Commenters on the photo joke “rinse it off when you’re done” and “kill room.”

           The man who commented “kill room” on the above photo has a number of images on his Instagram appearing to show he makes child sized coffins:

           Finally, people have noticed that pro-Hillary groups own ALL the properties on the block where Comet Ping Pong is located.

           As noted in the previous picture, some of the company logos of nearby groups who have offices near Comet Ping Pong look similar to known images used by pedophiles as per this FBI document:
