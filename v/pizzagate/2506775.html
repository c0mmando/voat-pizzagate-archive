            Patience.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Podesta's multi-million dollar business is gone ... kaput .... that's HUGE!!!! And look how people are responding to Skippy's tweets? You think that would have happened two years ago before this story broke?
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidence for us is NOT evidence that would convict anyone in a court of law ... nor should it. There is a different standard that must be proven and that's where the hard part comes in. Things need to be documented, sources have to be verified with members of the cabal that are either frightened to talk or loyal to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot is being done. There are all those indictments. Deep breaths ... popcorn ... talk long walks ... DO NOT DISCUSS THIS WITH ANYONE OUTSIDE KNOWN RED-PILLED ASSOCIATES. That last part ... take it seriously. You're never going to convince anyone until everything hits. A couple of friends of mine were posting shit about our POTUS and I stopped myself from answering because they still believe the lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have sympathy for them. Pity them. It's going to be a shock and a slap in the face. Here they thought they were being so noble ... so good ... and they were in league with child predators.
           </p>
           <p>
            Try to think of it that way, but for now, enjoy this time where everything is gelling and the Cannibal Elite are starting to panic. I don't enjoy all these deaths ... do not ... but I'm taking about the eradicating of this cabal for good. Rooting it out and not just making a splashy arrest. The Kenyan was President! Skankles was the heir apparent. This was not supposed to happen, but it did!
           </p>
           <p>
            So enjoy and don't get despondent ... we're winning ...

            You are dead wrong. Just the opposite. All the social media and twitter blasts exposing these satanic pedo monsters is working. Example, look at the work Carolyn Limaco is doing. Shes consistently getting right in their face through social media and Nicky Hilton Rothschild has blocked her on all her accounts and her posts coincide with Carolyn’s, same with the CNN loser she’s blasting. THAT is where the people will win. They don’t like being exposed and more people are waking up with all this new info coming out. As long as Podesta is well know for being a sick pedo and more people know about this, the better. It’s a definite win for Pizzagate.

            Hmm. Well, kev, it would have been nice for you to add this "traction" stipulation to the 24 Hour Flair policy discussion thread when we were initially putting that policy in place. To my knowledge, we have never used "traction" or "upvotes" as a reason to leave a rule-breaking post up, ever, either before or after the institution of the 24 Hour Flair. It either breaks the rules or it doesn't; that is our criteria.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2400756">
             24 Hour Edit flair policy discussion
            </a>
            we said all rule breaking threads that could be fixed with an edit would get the flair, and that:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ➖Cons: Shitposts stay on the board overnight. (Where they can be downvoated soundly, accruing negative SCP and exposing their purveyors to the appreciation of the community. Ahem. Perhaps this is not a negative!). Some threads will get upvoated without getting fixed and will get removed anyway.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I flaired the post for removal under Rule 2 because it lacks supporting links, although one could make a case for Rule 4. Just as we have been doing with all rule-breaking posts, and would have removed today, regardless of votes or comments, if users and OP decided not to edit.
           </p>
           <p>
            But now you have overruled not just my flair, but our whole flair system, which was working quite well. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is Rule 4 outside of the flair policy? Is Rule 2 outside of the policy as well? Do we even have a 24 Hour flair, given what you've done here?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or, are you saying mods are supposed to be making personal judgement calls about what gets the 24 hour leeway and what doesn't? That approach seems way more prone to attracting cries of censorship than giving everything but Link posts the flair.

            Rules and mods are here to protect and serve us. However, there’s a place for exceptions like these. This place is like a high pressure boiler. Despair and seething anger. Something’s gotta give. This thread provided a much needed pressure release valve. Much better than people offing themselves or deciding on that Kalorama armed home invasion.

            No one failed. A lack of arrest isn't indicative of a failure. A lot of people care, lots of people have honor. Just because you are giving up doesn't mean everyone else is watching football on Sundays. That's insulting to the people that have put so much time into this.

            I'm new to Voat but I've been a long time lurker. This sub is far more powerful than some of you may know. For every 100 people actively posting here there are a 100 more lurking, watching, archiving and red pilling others. Keep up the fight.

            The Podesta emails that started Pizzagate were released as retaliation to Trump's grab em' by the pussy tape being leaked. This whole thing has been a psyop from the start. Nothing was ever going to happen. That's not to say pizzagate isn't real, or that thousands of children aren't being raped/murdered/etc by elites on a regular basis. Think more of controlled demolition. This has steamrolled into a Trump-supporting right-wing type deal. This was never about having people arrested or stopping business as usual -- it was about making Trump look good and making people believe someone is fighting for the kids in DC. That's where Qanon comes in as well. Propaganda to keep the sheeple under control. This sub now has at least 3 active Trump/Q-loving mods, and that is not an accident. Anyone looking objectively at Trump should be able to see that he's not to be trusted, but yet there is a steady stream of Trumpism that is supported and encouraged by the mods.

            said, if we want things to happen, we will have to do it ourselves. We cannot wait until someone in the government does something because it will never happen. No true "outsider" will ever be allowed to become President. If we want change, it's going to take a full-scale revolution. We cannot trust anyone who works in the White House, plain and simple.

            Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s email server last week.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,” Prince claimed.
           </p>
           <p>
            “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments,’” Prince explained.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I believe – I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York – the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they’ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,” Prince said.

            The cabal of pedophiles have run the world since the dawn of time. Do you not understand how far this bloodline occult thing goes back? We are talking generations and generations of disgusting cannibalistic people breeding and setting up networks across the earth. These two men in particular hold a lot of dirt on a lot of people who are still necessary to keep the everyday world going. Like you and I, we are good people and we want to see groceries on the shelves next week...if these cannibal pedophiles are exposed and murdered in the streets..while vengeance may be had, good people are still going to suffer. If the pieces fall slowly, the good people won't suffer. We recognize children are suffering RIGHT NOW, and we pray for them, because if this awakening moves too fast then we ALL suffer.

            Several thousand million more folk have been red pilled than since before the story broke 2 years ago. Thats YUGER than YUGE. Alefartface and Skippy are done. Its almost better they're still 'free', because god knows every day in public is more hell for them than cushy Gitmo, HAHA.

             Yes. I think all of us here get credit for waking up so many people.  Who else did that?  They tried in the worst way to sweep this under the rug.  The people had none of it!  They Are SO WOKE. And they are not going back to sleep.  We have AWakened the Sleeping Giant!

            Yes, the Podestas and Clintons are still walking around freely.  And we're all being told 'Trust in the Plaaaan!'.  It's 5-D Chess.

            Meanwhile we're about to get into an illegal war and are being told the attack on Syria was actually attacks on CIA bases, though there's absolutely no evidence of that.

            Sadly, this is only a drop in the bucket regarding the crimes of the Cabal and only a tiny fraction of what people need to be awakened to. Start with the phony government, the phony court system and the families that own the worlds central banks that control nations around the world. Rothschilds, Warburgs, Rockefellers, Mogans, Goldman etc.. Alefantis is of the family of Rothschilds, he can't get arrested. Your so called government are employees to the Cartel. The Treausry is funded by the FED and the FED gets its money from the IRS. FED and IRS are private and owned by the cartel. So the cartel pays them, so they own them. Your taxes go to the private IRS. You pay for PG when you pay taxes. Most the tax money they keep, some they give to IRS t fund itself, and some to politicians. You expect them to arrest themselves? The system is theirs. The mods are damage control and this sub is a laugh for anybody awoke. Gain the knowledge that they keep from you, you will understand reality better.

             The mods and the shills in this sub sell Trump, as if he isn't part of the Cabal. Therefore this sub serves disinfo purposes. They even deleted a thread I had about moving on the the action phase and defunding the banks. Shutting down our banking accounts and religously preaching this daily. The mods deleted it and said I need examples of what a boycot is for, and I needed to be more specific about which banks. Complete joke, I said all banks.

             Things I woke up to: NGOs stealing children, pedophile blackmailing runs the world, globalists want to kill us all, Zionism, CPS stealing children, freemasonry everywheeeeeeere, hollywood pedophilia, black pope/gray pope/vatican corruption, and I started to pray after being a hard atheist. Pizzagate scared me straight out of materialism, atheism and into the arms of Jesus and God.

              Christ re_turns ...
Christ is but a double book entry system tracking and providing remedy for the debts we create ..
The remedy for more debt is even more debt via debt and destructiin industries..
.when we destroy debt at the trewsury the Christ re-turns ..reverses ..and the remedy is peace..
Google : surety rights
When we reduce debt at the treasury..the Roman war corporation becomes our debtor and they will have to sing to our tune ..we can sue anyone under universal jurisdiction..

              A well armed militia of Patriots is not illegal. The wording in everything has to be correct and according to the constitution and law. We cant just say "we're putting together a militia to go after the zog". We play it smart until each state militia is at least 1 million strong. Then the fucking order goes out to revolt and arrest the traitors.

                In this conversation, it was meant to override the government and issue arrest warrants against some of their own people. I would say that's against the government and illegal. Not saying it isn't warranted, just that they wouldn't necessarily like it or allow for it. Legality gets a little messy when you're acting against them.

            Yes, I think we all expected/hoped that these things would go faster. But, 2 years ago there were just leaked mails and fishy pictures on an instagram-account.
Not enough to arrest someone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Potus ist just 1,5 years in power  - and as far as I see it, I htink they did already a lot. Think of the 24 sealed indictments and all the other actions against trafficking and pedo-websites. And, don't forget that they are working in the background to cut off the money and "structures" of that "swamp" (Saudi Arabia, Epstein, Haiti, Clinton foundation...). This is a lot of  work to do! 
If they had arrested Podesta, HRC, Obama and Alefantis already in 2017, I am pretty sure, they would have been walking free just after a few days - with public applause.
And Trump would have looked silly and we all were bashed as conspiracytheorists (how they did it after that gunman-incident, just worse).
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to drain a deep and muddy swamp you have to do some preparation fist - and dig some ditches. The swamp creatures will not notice  - but suddenly find themselves aground! That's the moment, when we can catch them, because they cannot escape anymore by jumping into the mud. And I am sure, these people are already "under supervision".
           </p>
           <p>
            If you just walk directly into the center of the swamp without preparation you will probably sink in - and all the swamp creatures will escape easily - or even devaour you!

             But if we hire a team of private investigators then perhaps we could get some more info on Alefantis. Problem is I don't have the money, but If I was a millionaire I'd be funding a giant team of PI's to get everything on Podesta and Alefantis

              I'm betting there already is a mole in the group, which is exactly what they have to do to get the evidence needed to bring them down. Can you imagine how long it takes for the mole to gain their trust, then get video and audio undetected because you know if you get made, you'll most likely get killed and ruin any chance of getting another mole in the group? Not to mention, whoever is the mole would be faced with proving he's one of them by doing some heinous things.

             I'm not weak, just tired. Alefantis and Podesta have had all this time to cover their tracks and that just really pisses me off. They've probably destroyed all of the hardcore evidence by now so maybe we'll never get them.

             If I lived in DC, I'd do something. But what about the people on this sub that already live in DC? I've seen plenty of people on this sub saying they live in DC, so why the hell aren't they getting interviews with associates of Alefantis? Why aren't they getting interviews with former employees at comet ping pong? Nobody has done anything close to that. It just feels like nothing important is being done and the more time we waste the more time Alefantis gets to cover his tracks

              sincerly this is something that i really cannot understand at all. too many efforts to research, too many people "engaged" but i cannot understand WHY people at DC haven't dont anything. I live in a shitty country, but we have a good thing, average population here is totally against pedo, and if there is a suspicion about a place running a pedo ring like this fucking restaurant we hit to death like this:

            I recommend taking some time off the internet. Have a beer with good friends on a patio, enjoy the spring weather, smell the flowers, make love to your partner, go camping, attend a film festival or see local bands, go to your local library or art gallery.... life can be beautiful. I hear you, but don’t take this burden upon yourself. You’re letting those bastards Clinton, Alefantis, Podesta rob you of your life. Don’t. Try to live a little. 6 months away from this subverse will work miracles. Take care, brother.

             Thanks for the advice, this is really getting too stressful. It's even more stressful when you realize that we have trump as president and still nothing gets done. Sessions could easily blow this thing wide open

               We are the resistance! Just keep on going, till the end of days. We are like Bulldogs, we have them by the neck, and we will not let go. Make sure these monsters know that. With Trump or without Trump - this is the begining of their end. 
Hey Skippy all this because of 'P@ssword' for Password!!!! And they are idiots to boot as well their outside resembling their inside - Oscar Wilde nailef it with his Picture of Dorian Gray!! Makes our job so much easier. Folks, just take look at Skippy or that Creep of The Century JA - there should be an investigation based on their looks alone. I mean seriously folks!

               Do u honestly think that a creep.like james alefantis ..with close connections to politicians ..with a computer in the premises is not followed by the NSA..every OS has a back door..
Time comes they will strike..under instructions from whoever activate universal jurisdiction..
Natiinal security agency...an agency of the security of the nation ..the security of the nation is the surety ..ie the individual who actvates surety rights over the US treasury..
Its coming ..nsa is a servant ..an agent
..of whom ?

             You seem pretty sure pizzagate is fake. Didn't something about it strike you as real for you to be here in the first place? Like, your username is Are_we_sure, like you believed pizzagate but were having doubts. But it sounds like you're pretty sure there's nothing to pizzagate.

                 I'm reminded of this lyric:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house, with a can full of gas and a hand full of matches, and still weren't found out.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 That's kind of how I think about your attitude toward pizzagate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As if, if there were pedophiles, they would fuck kids live on TV to get caught. Like that's the level of evidence you'll need.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But having Heavy Breathing at your venue, with the pedo spiral, for all ages, and joke "We all have our preferences," isn't enough of a can full of gas and a hand full of matches for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And Podesta. With the creepy artwork. And the coded E-Mails about kids in hot tubs rubbing your nose at 5 in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How come, to me, those count as cans of gas and hands of matches, but they count as nothing to you?

                 , weigh in here. How does one leap from a can full of gas and a hand full of matches, to them being responsible for a fire? How does one leap from pedophile bands, logos, and emails, to pedophilia?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Is it a leap?

                  I don't buy your analogy at all.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In your example, you begin with something real, something that actually happened.   A house burned down. 
Then you two people who had the opportunity and the means to do it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In Pizzagate, you begin with nothing real, nothing that actually happened.  This is the giant absence at the middle of the case.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When you have something real that happened, you can investigate what caused it to happen. If the fire was arson and if that arson was caused by gasoline the two people standing there with the gas and the matches look might suspicious.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In pizzagate, all you have is suspicion.  A year and half in and that giant absence is still there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you wanted an analogy more like pizzagate it would something like.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There's somebody online who you don't know and who doesn't like you says you're an arsonist.  Absolutely no evidence is given.
Then all of his many, many friends look for evidence that you ARE an arsonist.  And all of your emails and social media are looked through and every time you mention "fire" or "matches" or "burn" is listed as evidence of your guilt.   Also every time you mention sandwich because another anonymous person says sandwich is how arsonists describe their crimes.  Then they start looking through all the emails of people you know and their social media and OH MY GOD, his friend from high school is a FIREMAN!  The fire department is in on it.  And what is this on his instagram!  There so blatant about it.

                  Look at this email he burned a colleague.  We have to see who works with him and if anyone died in a fire.

                   I know that the code words were just made up on 4Chan. I'm tired of seeing people attribute the code words to the FBI. It was the pedo spiral that should be attributed to the FBI. But isn't it clear that there is coded language in the Podesta E-Mails in a way not present in your sandwich example?
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>

                   I first thought of Laura Silsby, but you might say she's too far divorced from Comet Ping Pong and the Podestas. Then I thought of Madeline McCann. The Podesta E-Mails were deleted the day she went missing. That kind of coincidence is like coincidentally being near a burnt down house with the means to burn down a house. Then there were the police sketches that look just like the Podesta brothers. Is that a giant absence still? The Instagram posts were fucked. Children with money. Children being taped down. Hotard. Selling of children. If it is all humor, maybe leave that humor to others that aren't already surrounded in suspicion. Then you have Alefantis's avatar, Pan, god of pedophilia. And his name's French resemblance to "I love children" and the acronym "Satan Life." I know what coincidences are, and the possibilities of coincidence here, but it still needs to be stated as evidence. That Axl Rose's name is an anagram for Oral Sex is no coincidence. You also have a video of a child screaming for help from Comet Ping Pong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There's so much evidence here that it's hard to remember it all, and instead focus on the big evidence claims and how they've been debunked. Like that the code words were just made up by 4Chan, or that the sculpture was made before the Dahmer picture. (Even so, as I've told you before, the collection of the art piece may still be a tribute to Dahmer.)

                   Then you've got Megan Kelly doing the soft ball interview. The mainstream media immediately pronouncing it as debunked. The DC police obviously had not looked into it before pronouncing it debunked. And even archive sites started to get scrubbed of pedophilia articles from MSM sites. You've got James Alefantis pizza man named #50 influential man in DC. And apparently some kind of biological connection to the Rothchilds. You've got big politicians visiting this pizza joint for no apparent reason, and large donations going to it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There was also a murder threat from Alefantis to a pizzagater which had a police report filed regarding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You also had $65,000 of pizza and hotdogs flown to the white house.

                     I'm tired of seeing people attribute the code words to the FBI. It was the pedo spiral that should be attributed to the FBI. But isn't it clear that there is coded language in the Podesta E-Mails

                    True about the code words.  As for the spiral the FBI never claimed that the spiral = pedophilia, in that they adapted a very common graphical element.  The vast majority of uses would be unrelated.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    No I do believe any code words are used whatsoever in the Podesta emails. In all cases, the plain language is understandable and far, far more likely than the fantasies involving the code words.

                    A subject I have debunked many times.  There's actually no connection whatsoever.  The claim was that Silsby got the kids from Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos, but that is absolutely false.  We know exactly where she got her kids from.  The AP tracked down where are the kids came from and found their parents.

                    Absolutely.  The eFits are definitely odd, but the official police story is they are THE SAME MAN as described by two different witnesses and this man was said to be between 20-40 year old.   I know the autists can't get beyond this, but there's no way that squares with two different men who would be in their 60's at the time.

                     (As a complete aside, I don't think she was abducted.  I think she died in that hotel room.  An accident.  The parents put the kids to sleep and go out for drinks and when the come back they find Madeline woke up and had an accident and then they engage in a quick cover up.  There's many wierd things about how the efits were produced.  The McCanns hired this investigator to look into the case and the guy turned out to be A, a complete conman [he even faked his own wedding] and B a client of Patton Boggs the Republican lobbying firm who was a competitor to Tony Podesta's company.  I think he had offices in the same place as Patton Boggs)

                    You realize that all the evidence was heavily cherrypicked right?   Only emails that had supposed code out of thousands and thousands of emails.  Only social media posts with kids.  It's all a cherry picked distorted view.   i doubt people hear could actually describe what Tony Podesta's art collection was actually like, because they only saw a tiny part of it.

                    You know you have this backwards right?  All the posts you referred to were posted before pizzagate and then viewed with the utmost suspicion. That's why I gave the example of people looking through your emails and social media with suspicion and not giving you any benefit of the doubt, because that is what happened. Think of how easy people could frame things, if they already thought you were guilty.   The posts themselves are not suspicious, unless you already have child sex on your mind.  (Psychologists call this priming.) They may be in bad taste, but they do not serve as evidence of child trafficking.  They may be shocking to folks who don't know drag queens, but even that photo of the guy in drag covered in blood is pretty easily understandable as that was his Halloween costume and he was going as Carrie from the Steve King book/classic horror movie.

                    Do you actually believe this to be evidence?   Because I think you realize this is not evidence.  And his name is Greek, not French and he didn't choose his name.   My last name sounds like an animal, does that mean something?    What you are engaging in here is known as confirmation bias, viewing evidence in a way that confirms a conclusion you already have.  All people are prone to this.  It's pretty powerful too, because it's "feels right"  feels like it's true.

                    No apparent reason?   It's a very well reviewed restaurant in a city with a lot of politicians.  And specifically what politician are you thinking of?  It's like a well reviewed restaurant in LA having celebrities go there.  Yeah, it's a company town.

                     The $65,000 hot dog party guy? Not a White House insider. A guy who worked in Texas with no first hand knowledge of the White House and certainly not an Obama insider, he hated Obama. AND he just repeating a fake story that was going around on the right wing blogs and talk shows. After Obama had the pizza chef of a St Louis Pizzeria come to the White House to make pizza, right wing blogs started saying he wasted a bunch of taxpayer money just to eat pizza. (Actually the pizza chef bought the ingredients himself.)

                     Most of your post contains taking points I cited as facts and showing them not to be facts. For example, your two linked threads about Silsby were fairly long. Can you agree with me that
                     <em>
                      if
                     </em>
                     what I cited as facts
                     <em>
                      were
                     </em>
                     facts, then there would be a substantial theory here, rather than mere suspicion?

                     I'm not sure that I understand how cherrypicking is supposed to be damning here. Like, have you seen that video of Biden allegedly groping that little girl on C-SPAN? It looks weird. But imagine if you popped up and said, "Yeah, but take a look at all of Biden's other TV appearances where he didn't grope a little girl." The isolated evidence is damning enough.

                     In some neuroscience experiments, you're asked to perform an action, and then the scientists try to predict what you did. They look at their fMRI results. Even though, say, you moved your left hand instead of your right hand, hours or days before the scientists put in their "prediction" of what you will do, the scientists still "predicted" your action before you performed it, by studying the fMRI results that were taken before you performed the action. If I say, "The scientists predicted your action before you performed it," you might say, "You know you have this backwards right? First I moved my left hand, then days later the scientists finished analyzing the fMRI results."

                     I understand that pizzagate broke, and then everything was viewed with suspicion. But if you were without an air of suspicion, you would just be the guy making pedophile jokes. If you were "already" surrounded with suspicion, as was my verbiage, it was because you were already surrounded with things that would look damning once given an initial spark of suspicion. This is what I meant about being "already" surrounded by suspicion. They were already surrounded by suspicious things.

                    <p>
                     For example, someone who bought into the Satanic panic of the 80s might make the leap to pedophilia from spirit cooking alone. That's because there is an assumed relationship between Satanism and pedophilia. But then you add the hot tub and nose rubbing emails, and visiting of a venue which plays bands that have the pedo logo in their music video, and you see a selection of Tony's art collection, then you are building a case against someone you were "already" suspicious of. I'd say, given the first thing that makes you suspicious, each subsequent thing adds to what you were "already" suspicious of. Of course, when you present your findings in bulk all at once when pizzagate broke, that's when people became suspicious. But I wouldn't use that bulk evidence as a reason to prohibit my use of the word "already." Remember, the clock starts given the first suspicious evidence, not when the bulk bomb broke.

                     Yes, it is evidence. I see no reason not to call it evidence. If I suspected you of being a furry, and then I found out your last name was Fox, that would be evidence. I would wonder if you changed your name. I don't know if he chose his name or not. Given that I don't know ahead of time whether his name is his birth name or a changed name, given that I am suspecting him of pedophilia, his name's resemblance to pedophilia should certainly be kept on the table, and motivate researchers to go find out if that's his real name or a changed name. And even if it were just a bizarre coincidence, it should still be noted as a bizarre coincidence, rather than not mentioned at all. Then we can choose how minimally we weigh it as evidence. Otherwise, you're taking something that looks coincidental and suspicious and blatantly ignoring it, which is ignoring evidence.

                     I disagree with your assessment of confirmation bias here. Maybe I would sooner agree to an accusation of pareidolia. It is not because I am pre-convinced that Alefantis is guilty that I take his name to be evidence of Satanism or pedophilia. It is because, in isolation, counts toward the thesis that that man may be a Satanist or a pedophile. This could even be the first piece of evidence, that "spark" I referred to above. So now you see why pareidolia is more accurate than confirmation bias. But even pareidolia is not accurate, because I am not finding patterns in random data, or patterns that only I can see, but rather these patterns of the anagram and the French are objectively there for all to see and evaluate.

                     If I recall correctly, the video was dated years before pizzagate broke. I don't know why the video taper would hate Comet Ping Pong. If, years before Pizzagate broke, I stumbled across a YouTube video of a kid screaming at Comet Ping Pong, I would think, "Wow someone was probably video taping because they were concerned at the sound of a child screaming," rather than, "Wow that guy probably hates that establishment and is trying to frame them by making it seem like screaming is coming from withinside rather than from the street."

                     If pizzagate is psyops it's worth studying for that reason alone. The controversy should be what powers had the resources to develop this sophisticated and convincing -- (you must admit that a lot of people were convinced) -- of a psyop, rather than some elite pedophiles at a pizza place. Instead we get this MSM narrative about Russian hacking. Rather than the psyop that attempted to sway voters away from Democrat that was being broke by Wikileaks right before the election. Or do you think social media is enough to organically grow such a "psyop." In fact, it seems like a misnomer to call an organically developed suspicion by an unaffiliated mass a psyop. It's not like there was some shady cabal that was pushing this on the world. Or do you think a few 4Channers are that powerful? And I suppose you're not convinced by Q either, while I am.

                      On the "50 Most Powerful People in DC" article, I agree with him. There are a bunch of random non-politicians/lobbyists/government officials on that list. GQ is like some shitty fashion magazine; they don't have any special insight into anything. The only political commentary I've seen from them is Keith Olbermann's unhinged Russian conspiracy rants.

                       You're wrong on this.  It's a well respected restaurant.  Folks here tried to pretend it was a front or just a dump...(I guess industrial design hasn't hit their towns yet), but it was a place serious about the food and pretty popular.  That's why the idea that children were being held there was so ridiculous.  Thousands of people walk though there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       First of all, a Michelin star isn't even what the restaurant is going for and is the wrong standard even to apply to a place like Comet that was always a neighborhood restaurant.  In Washington DC, with all its money and all the foreign visitors only 14 restaurants have Michelin Stars.

                       Alefantis was not a chef and was not even the most famous person behind Buck's or Comet when it opened up.  His partner Carole Greenwood was well known and respected, having had her three of her own restaurants before him.  She was a good chef, but a bit of a pain in the ass.  When Alefantis joined up with her, he was going to take care of the business side and the "front of the house"  aka dealing with customers which was not her strong suit, and she was going to concentrate on the food which was her strong suit.

                       This is a great review.  3 stars is "Excellent" and 4 stars is superlative.  4 stars is a dinner you should never forget and a casual place like Comet wouldn't even be able to reach it, because they are not going for that level of service.

                        The pies come by way of a big wood-burning pizza oven and Carole Greenwood, chef of the neighboring Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping, where the ordinary (steak, mussels, chocolate cake) tastes extraordinary. No surprise, then, that the pizzas at her spin-off are so seductive. Thin and crisp, the big, rectangular crusts are made with both Italian white and wheat flours, drizzled with garlic-laced olive oil, and scattered with high-quality toppings, including fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce made from scratch and tinged with honey and basil.

                       Here's one of the better photos of their food.  They look like well cooked pies--heat high enough and in the oven for the proper amount of time.

                      Precedents?  That doesn't mean anything about a specific case here today.  In 1919 a bunch of baseball players threw the world series.  What meaning does that hold for last year's World Series?  What doesn't make sense is if you didn't prime people with the SUPER EMOTIONAL subject of pedophilia and just had them read through Podesta's emails or look through Comet's instragram, they would not be jumping to these conclusions.  They just wouldn't see it, because it's not there.

                      That's the whole point of confirmation bias and other mental quirks we all share.  It's very easy to take facts and shape them into a narrative that we tell ourselves, in fact our brains tend do this automatically.   The question is are we kidding ourselves, are we telling ourselves a story that isn't true.

                      Folks in the DC media would know that instantly.  They could dismiss as soon as they heard as it as evidence.  It's basically folks taking thing way too literally, I think in addition to the pattern finding you mention, people's abilities to process figurative language may be at play here.  I don't know if there's a term for that.  I'm familiar with Alice Waters and Roberta's Pizza and when I heard "the evidence" involving them, it sounded immediately ludicrous and I knew it was false.

                      Confirmation bias is a powerful thing.  Motivated reasoning is a powerful thing.  Strong emotions can overwhelm rational thought.   Politics combines all three of those.  Now add the emotions about pedophilia and it's insanely potent.   I think that the folks who started this knew that the conspiracy community already had a prexisting belief in the word run by a singular group and a prexisting belief in elite pedophile rings as stable and enduring conspiracies.  So yes.  This was merely throwing in chum in the water.  And let's face tons of people who pushed this only cared about the election.   They didn't actually believe things like Hillary has a neurological condition and is followed around by a secret medic.   They just wanted other people to believe that.  The psyop hit the jackpot when they encountered the character of the openly gay and campy pizzeria owner, James Alefantis.

                      In terms of this being a psyop, and being set forward by people with an agenda.  Take a look at the original post linking Hillary Clinton to Silsby.  They claimed that Clinton had been following her for years, they point to a document they said was written in 2001.   But when you read it, it was clearly written AFTER the Haitian Earthquake.

                      I take you at your word, that you are interested in evidence based discussions.    Many here are not.    I think if you want a real lesson in epistemology and critical thinking, look at all of this stuff from the very beginning and ask yourself if the claims are true and if they stand up. Ask yourself, is the person making this claim in a position to know this?  And look at them with the knowledge that a year and half later, funny pictures on Instagram and jokey comments are the worst that was found.  You want critical thinking, read the Podesta emails in sequence and not the cherry picked ones and see if anything jumps out at you.  This was one of the biggest prebunks.  Since no code is in the emails the claims seem immediately ludicrous.

Predicting that Hillary has kuru isn't stating definitively that she does; it's saying here is something which can be tested according to our theory. While it is doubtful that Hilary has kuru, what is not doubtful is that it follows naturally from a theory of satanic pedophilic cannibalism.

                       This whole pizzagate thing has been very upsetting for me. I'm not one to subscribe to conspiracy theories. And it annoys me that there are types of people who don't know a fraction about pizzagate that I do, who think they can just go to Snopes or Wikipedia and determine that it was debunked. It's not a conspiracy theory anyone wants to be true, because we don't want children fucked and eaten. But I want some of it to be true, lest I be an insane conspiritard who fell for nonsense. I think there's a real difference between the type of person who saw a commercial for a TV show about ghosts or aliens, and so believes in them, and a pizzagate researcher who had genuine things to investigate, like if it Alefantis is his real name and if there is a Silsby connection. These are the types of things that warranted research, and were not researched by the MSM or the police.

How do you know there was no police report filed against Alefantis regarding a murder threat? Did you personally go inquire if there was?

                       Does THAT count as evidence? Here, from the Wikileaks email, we suspect some group of people of Satanic ritual abuse. That this information came from someone raised in a cult, do we think of this information merely as their political muckraking, or as an intentional strike against a cult?

                       Unfortunately, James Fetzer is an expert in philosophy of science. He unfortunately claims that the evidence gathering and predictive processes of conspiracy theories are like that of other credible scientific theories. If you search the PhilPapers database for conspiracy theories, you find professional papers that are apologetic to the concept of conspiracy theories, even if there is no apologeticism toward any specific one.

                       There needs to be some authoritative mind map where all of this information is collected, and your deflationary responses can be offered to all pieces of evidence. Then we can easily see what remains standing. There are sites that do this for, for example, the moon landings, and yet there is still the expert in philosophy of science James Fetzer who denies the moon landings. If you say 100 times in 100 threads that there's no Silsby connection, pizzagaters will still maintain that there's a Silsby connection because your voice is drowned out by those claiming there is a Silsby connection. Likewise, for the pizzagate deniers, who immediately believe whatever Snopes and Wikipedia and the MSM tell them, there will always be nothing to pizzagate, and it will always be debunked, simply because that is the claim that is screamed the loudest to drown out other claims of evidence. Screaming loudest is what we have with pizzagate and with flat earth. What happened to the days where calm reason will lead us to truth, and not just truth agreed upon by me, but truth agreed upon by all? I don't think truth is subjective or matter of opinion. Far as I can tell, you're a debunker while Snopes / Wikipedia / the DC police / MSM are loud claimers. "THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE! THAT'S THAT!" Their behavior itself is suspicious, as

                        .  There's a really good book on this called Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow.   We evolved two different ways of thinking.  One that helped us develop agriculture one that helped have a "gut feeling" that the shadow in those grasses is a lion and we need to start running immediately.   This fast thinking, gut/instinct level thinking is often correct, but it's not highly accurate in any way.  If it was wrong about the lion in the grass this time, it's still useful as we may need next time.  But what happens is we often don't recognize when this quick thinking gut instinct has fooled us.

                        Utter bullshit.  People simply don't want to believe the evidence.    There was a large and widespread Russian hacking campaign. It went waaaaaay beyond the DNC.   Podesta emails were part of a widespread spearfishing campaign that at least 100 other Democrats were targeted.  The hacking groups responsible have been known to computer security professionals for years and years.  The same folks who successfully broke into the DNC, tried to break into the White House and the State Department.  They were not successful, because Dutch was watching this live and giving the information on what to shut down.

In elite circles, it would more likely be very quietly done.  Let's pose a hypothetical.  That you visit prostitutes.  IF this was the case, would you let your friends know about this or would you keep it secret?  The idea that once you graduate from the Ivy League and become an elite that people whisk you into this grand conspiracy is nuts.   Donald Trump was friends for like 15 years with Jeffrey Epstein.  Does that mean he knew Epstein was hiring high school girls to massage him?  Or is that something Epstein kept to himself?

And under Wikileaks, he releases the bulk emails with no comment. You're telling me that his past wouldn't be evidential or corroborative toward a theory involving Satanic ritual abuse?

Why is it different than the lottery example? I suppose I consider Silsby to be one piece of evidence among many, not basing the whole case on her, whereas the lottery would be the primary source for solving all your life's problems.

                         Just because there's plausible deniability doesn't mean the appearance of the spirals or whatever aren't indicative of something. In the least, you have suspicious evidence when there was none before. That is, a case with one piece of plausibly deniable evidence is weaker than a case with zero pieces of evidence, not equal to it.

                         <em>
                          knowing what we know

                         , we may need to believe Pizzagate, or invade Iraq for weapons of mass destruction, or believe any apparently true theory which turns out to be false. You can make mistakes ultimately, but the question is of what the most rational decision given all available evidence is. Would you let John Podesta babysit your kid?

                         We could write a book called Debunking Pizzagate. Then researchers can debunk our book, rather than YouTube videos and repetitive voat threads. Or, our book would be undebunkable, and that would be the end of it.

                          Seeded vs engineered.  By seeded I meant they planted the seeds for the conspiracy to grow, but they were not in charge of its ultimate destination.  Engineered to me is like having more control over it.  It would planned from beginning to end.   Seeded is giving the conspiracists the basic elements and having them run with it.

                          If you increase the possibility from 1 in a trillion to 1 in a billion, you've increased the probability a thousandfold, however, this is still lousy evidence.

                          You missed the point with the spirals.  You talk about plausible deniability....you're focusing on the tiny percentage of the people using spirals, those who use it as a pedophile signal.  I'm talking about genuine deniability, the huge percentage of people using spirals who would have no idea what you are talking about, who have no connection to pedophilia at all.  Your approach risks smearing and defaming these people.....again, a witch hunt.

                  Heavy Breathing is just some shitty local band. One of Comet Ping Pong's things is that they have live bands on some nights, and "all ages" really just indicates that it's not "21 and up," i.e., it is not taking place at a bar. I went to a lot of small "all ages" venues when I was a teenager, and it's not like people are bringing their young children along. Also, a lot of bands that do not have much musical talent will try to adopt this edgy or absurd type of humor as a gimmick (I was in one of those). Does Heavy Breathing have a pedo spiral? If so, I must have missed that part.

                 <p>
                  Tony Podesta's creepy artwork, I agree. The idea of keeping that shit in your home is so alien to me.

                  The emails are weird too--clearly some coded language. But to say it's related to child sex trafficking has always felt like a huge leap to me. There's plenty of other shit these nefarious niggaz might be getting away with because everyone is so fixated on child sex. So it's kinda like, Eminem and Dr. Dre walking a few blocks away from a dead body with a can full of gas and a handful of matches. Maybe they were on their way to go torch that body, or maybe they're doing some other, unrelated bad thing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The example Eminem uses immediately establishes that he and Dre had the means and opportunity to burn down the house, which makes them suspects. The police will still need to establish a motive, look for physical evidence, search for other witnesses, etc. But maybe it was their house, which caught fire while Dr. Dre was cooking Hamburger Helper, and on their way out, they took all flammable materials with them in an attempt to prevent the fire from becoming uncontrollable.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I guess I didn't really answer your question. I don't know how. We just kind of build narratives and reject the ones that seem unrealistic or don't mesh with our worldview.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I think the thing I find most troubling is the media, the "fact-checking" organizations, Wikipedia, et al. marching in lockstep, going out of their way to declare Pizzagate "debunked" several times per article, when they never do that for any other conspiracy theory. It's definitely not making me

                   less
                  </em>
