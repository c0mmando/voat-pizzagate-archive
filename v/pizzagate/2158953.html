<p>Why would Tillerson or Sessions object in the first place?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judicial Watch announced today that a federal judge will personally review, in camera, redacted material from emails discussing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of iPads and iPhones during her tenure at the State Department. Judge Kollar-Kotelly also ordered the State Department to file an affidavit addressing why it should not have to search new Clinton emails recovered. In taking these steps, the court rejected arguments by the Tillerson State Department and its lawyers at the Sessions Justice Department.</p>
<p>The court will review the blacked-out information so as to better ascertain whether the government misconduct exception would require the release of the full emails.  Generally speaking, the government misconduct exception prevents government agencies from withholding information that would shed light on government wrongdoing under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is relevant to Pizzagate because of all the information that could come forward if the rest of Hillary’s emails are released.</p>',

            We now know Sessions is in the swamp, everyone was so sure when he became AG his first objective would be clean the swamp, that has proved false, he is a Swamp Monster himself.

            Who knows what Tillerson and Sessions know?  These days I don't know the difference between the cabal and 5D chess.  Remember in Willie Wonkas Chocolate Factory when Wonka would weakly protest kids acting up but secretly he knew what they were doing and he let them ruin themselves?  If Trump admin can make it look like they aren't helping investigations, then he and his administration are better off.
