<p><strong>Related to pizzagate as we need to mobilize our community to spread this knowledge throughout social media, and this is how:</strong></p>
<p>I continue to see people on this board (and others) asking people to tweet @ someone, like/share/comment on stories for more exposure on this or that social platform, etc... but they can\'t because they don\'t actively use social.</p>
<p>My brother makes a living in social media marketing and tipped me off to this high-end &quot;reseller&quot; social panel. You can buy anything here from tweets to FB shares to YT views for the cheapest prices on the global market, and they look super legit because most of the services utilize ad-swap networks of real people (people who make a living liking shit on social). Often tools like this are utilized in tandem with other marketing techniques to give a super-boost to certain content for significantly less $$.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>For ONE DOLLAR you can purchase 10 custom twitter comments that will quickly be posted on any tweet you\'d like. Comments can be whatever you want from pizzagate to pedogate and can include links. $10 gets you 100 comments of your choosing, again all from different accounts. This network of accounts is so massive, they really cannot be silenced or banned as the activity will continue to come from countless unique sources. LIKES and RETWEETS are even cheaper, at $2 for 1000, with the option to buy much less for just a few cents.</p>
<p>The potential here is limitless. If we see an important tweet that needs visibility from the masses, a few people throwing a dollar here and there, or even one person dropping $20 would be able to massively boost that tweet with thousands of unique likes, RTs, and comments. Podesta and Rothchilds tweeting again? Annihilate it with hundreds of comments. Based Twitter journalist without much of an audience dropping huge knowledge bombs people need to hear? Boost it to trending. Pedo protectors spreading lies? Control the narrative with reply comments, and then liking those replies to shoot them to the top of the chain.</p>
<p><strong>How to Join - NO CHARGE TO TRY THIS!!</strong></p>
<p>This service is a tight-knit community for social media resellers so they don’t always have registration open. My brother has a great relationship with the guy who runs it though, so they agreed to open accounts for anyone looking to help the cause. Depending on when you’re reading this, registration may have publicly opened back up so feel free to check the site itself first.</p>
<p><strong>The website is <a href="http://famearmy.com">http://famearmy.com</a> formerly known as SMOshark</strong></p>
<p>If public registration is closed as it is at the time of this writing, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Message their support Skype account &quot;smoshark&quot; and tell them you\'d like to create a new account by mentioning keyword &quot;Voat&quot; and they\'ll be happy to get you sorted. They will additionally pre-load the account with 50 cents which is enough to test several services for yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don\'t have Skype or simply don\'t want to bother with that, you can inbox me and I\'ll get you an account by essentially doing step one myself and relaying the login to you (then simply change your pw). You\'ll still get the 50c credit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, no verification required here. Use a bullshit junk email or make one up if you prefer. The only reason for providing email is so the site has a method of contact for you if you file a support ticket. Skype is also accepted instead of email, so if you reach out yourself via Skype then no need for giving an email. Other than that, you simply make up whatever username and password you want. As soon as you first log in, I highly recommend changing/updating the password yourself for added security assuming the normal built-in registration form wasn\'t available on the site directly.</p>
<p>You can now browse the service list and make orders. The ability to “Add Funds” is at the top - they accept PayPal, WebMoney, and Bitcoin. My brother and his clients have spent thousands on this service over the past year and never any issues, I\'ve been using it for over a week now and it\'s fantastic. Honestly feels badass wrecking social media from the sidelines without even logging in to their platforms.</p>
<p>Lastly, anyone who thinks this is some sort of attempt to doxx people should realize it\'s quite easy to remain anonymous throughout this process. To further clarify for those unfamiliar with social media, this DOES NOT use or require any social media accounts of your own, other accounts will be conducting the activity you pay cents for. All you need to do is copy/paste the link to the chosen tweet or post etc into your order, specify what you want on it, and voilà.</p>
<p><strong>With tools like this, our small voice of thousands can be magnified to millions for cents on the dollar. Happy redpilling!!</strong></p>',

           <p>
            Do all 10 of those have to say the same thing or can each of those have a different message? AND THAT QUESTION MEANS IF ALL 10 ARE A REPLY TO ONE TWEET, THE SAME TWEET, THAT WAS MADE THAT YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO, CAN YOU SEND 10 UNIQUE TWEETS AS A RESPONSE?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you sent 10 tweets in response to a twitter message that all said the same thing it would look like a bot. If you can send 10 tweets in response to a tweet, and all 10 of the tweets are different, the ya got something good going.
