<p>Jennifer Love Hewitt is a child actor with links to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1595551">Oakwood Arms</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2375690">Kids Inc.</a>, among other things. </p>
<p>In 1992, she starred in a movie called <strong>Munchie</strong> where the pizza scene is from (here is <a href="http://instantqueuedrandomness.blogspot.ca/2013/10/for-your-consideration-munchie-1992.html">a summary</a>).</p>
<p>Munchie was directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0691061/#director">Jim Wynorski</a>, soon after he made a couple of films called “976-EVIL” and “Scream Queen Hot Tub party”.</p>
<p>The next year, when she was 13, Hewitt did another movie with Wynorski, <strong>Little Miss Millions.</strong> The other film he directed that year was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108142/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_90"><strong>Sins of Desire</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coincidental that a resident of <strong>Oakwood Arms</strong> (who has been <a href="http://www.agcwebpages.com/BLINDITEMS/2017/NOVEMBER.html">revealed as a victim</a> of Disney\'s <strong>Kids Inc.</strong> producers) would star in a movie around the same time by a guy known for &quot;967-EVIL&quot;, &quot;Hot Tub Party&quot;, and &quot;Sorority House Massacre&quot;?</p>
<p>In 1994, Wynorski followed them up with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110854/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_88">Point of Seduction: Body Chemistry</a>... then &quot;Victim of Desire&quot; and &quot;Sorceress&quot; in 95.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, a key scene from the 1992 Jennifer Love Hewitt movie shows a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcPnbjPOUqQ&amp;t=25m37s">pizza floating in the air</a> while being controlled by magic… before being hunted down by an angry man wielding a meat cleaver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be good if someone had more information about <strong>Wynorski,</strong> besides the IMDB filmography above. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2442492">Love Hewitt’s</a> connections to PG were explored in my last post, but there is probably more left to say on that subject too.</p>

            Its old VHS footage from an Barbie workout video, JLH is one of the dancing kids.

            Maybe this website needs a closer look?

             Yes, you should make a new post. There's something to uncover between the spandex / 'dancing' / Mattel / Barbie stuff... I thought aerobics were pretty out of fashion by '92, so what was the "business case" for making this tape?
            </p>
            <p>
             Wynorski probably saw footage like this (JLH dancing on Kids Inc. too) when he cast her to be in his movies. Wynorski
             <em>
              wrote
             </em>
             a line from Scream Queen Hot Tub Party:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Actress 1:
             </strong>
             "Soon we'll be in contact with a dark, festering demon who roams the neverworld in search of obscene and perverse pleasures..."
             <strong>
              Actress 2:
             </strong>
             "Want to call my agent?"
            </p>
            <p>
             What if he went back to his trailer after directing exploitation flicks all day, and watched an aerobics video like this? Based on his stated feelings about the women in his movies, you really hope he didn't know about this video when auditioning JLH for the 'pizza movie'... (but he probably did).
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             (Also note that the first thing in the video is that big star in a circle on the floor).

            In 1998 Wynorski appeared in a documentary Some Nudity Required where he said he got into film "for the money and the chicks" and said "breasts are the cheapest special effect in the business".[9]     JLH starred in his film when she was 12.  I am getting sick thinking about it.  All of his films were filled with Sex-Pots.

             Later he says:

            <p>
             "No one wants to see a woman without big breasts. On film, guys rent videos and... it's good if you can act, pop your top, and have good looks".

             This is the same director who worked with Jennifer Love Hewitt at 12, and again at 13. He is obsessed with jungle-themed exploitation movies where women are stripped, defiled and sacrificed:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               "When I was a kid, I loved jungle movies. I loved when the guys were going to the Lost Island and they meet up with the tribe of women...

               </strong>

               <strong>
                never did what you

              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               "Let's

                throw that whole premise out the window.

               <strong>

            </ul>
            <p>
             The documentary also notes that Wynorski is/was a major player in direct-to-video market. "Turn on a channel late at night, and you'll find a Wynorski film".
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, despite working with younger actresses like Hewitt, "he does yell and scream a lot on set".
            </p>
            <p>
             They show examples of him doing so:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              "Jackie,
              <em>
               shut up!"
              </em>
             </li>
             <li>
              "Get this fucking shit out of my fucking - "
             </li>
             <li>
              "All you've got to do is
              <em>
               sit there and look oblivious".
              </em>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             So while living as a minor at Oakwood Arms, this is the director Jennifer Love Hewitt was sent off to make

              Sounds like a prince. Just a charming guy. Exactly the type you'd want your underaged daughter to be working for. And what the hell happened to that Dr. somebody and SS? Wasn't he supposed to release that little boy's name if SS didn't answer? Hello!!!! He hasn't answered!!!

               This connection is probably more significant than it first appears...
              </p>
              <p>
               It's one thing to have part of the movie business that's dedicated to action, horror, faux-Satanism, scantily clad women, etc. Those B-movies don't necessarily hurt anyone, when they're made by, and for, adults.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here, however, a guy whose career revolves around directing pervy 'Satanic' B-movies is chosen to make a children's film. The first question is: who asked him, and why did he agree?
              </p>
              <p>
               Second, the movie ends up starring an Oakwood Arms kid who was previously abused for years on Kids Inc. Again, why is there such a direct link between Disney and this direct-to-video side of the business that's fixated on nudity, Satanism and exploitation?
              </p>
              <p>
               Finally, in a kids movie with the star from Kids Inc., this notorious exploitation director happens to insert
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcPnbjPOUqQ&amp;t=25m37s">
                a long scene
               </a>
               where a
               <em>
                pizza
               </em>
               is:
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                put under a spell by a demon
               </li>
               <li>
                attacked with a meat cleaver
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               It's hard to see this as anything besides the director
               <em>
                openly flaunting
               </em>
               the relationship between kid's entertainment and the 'Sex, Satan and Death' part of the industry.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hiring a known perv with a tendency to yell at his actors to direct this movie (made by and for children) is the first message they are sending. It's like telling parents "yes, look at this director's name, you
               <em>
                know
               </em>
               what is happening".
              </p>
              <p>
               But including an extended violent scene
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcPnbjPOUqQ&amp;t=25m37s">
                with a pizza
               </a>
               is going to that extra mile to rub it in their faces.

              While living at the Oakwood Arms, yes.  Can you imagine that was her refuge from these freaks?  From the frying pan into the fire.   Wynorski sounds like a typical pervert.  He has a super breast fetish.  I am not just talking about ogling.  This guy is obsessed.  AND, he has the connections and ways to get his fantasies met with making these movies.  He put JLH in her first film.  Just think about that.  Her mother knew what kind of pictures this guy made and she let her do it.  She could have stopped it.  She was 12.  12!!!
