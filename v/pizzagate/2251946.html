<p>&quot;UPDATE 2:23 PM EST -- MONDAY, NOV. 20</p>
<p>I have now spoken to almost ALL of my former colleagues in the Intelligence Community and here\'s what took place:</p>
<p>Yes, a group of military aircraft approached and circled the CIA Headquarters in Virginia for upwards of 30 minutes on Saturday.  They did NOT land and did NOT enter CIA HQ forcibly - or otherwise.</p>
<p>There is apparently an ongoing and gigantic problem between the Military and the CIA insofar as the Military is engaged in implementing President Trump\'s policies, while elements within the CIA are still INTENTIONALLY carrying out the failed policies of the Obama regime. </p>
<p>Specifically, these failed Obama-era policies include supplying weapons and logistical support to so-called &quot;freedom fighters&quot; inside Syria , many of whom are actually Al-Nusra, Al-Qaida and ISIS terrorists.</p>
<p>The support being provided by elements in the CIA is being used against certain units of the US Military who are also inside Syria.</p>
<p>The Military has repeatedly and strenuously told the CIA the old Obama policies must stop.  The CIA failed to stop.</p>
<p>So someone in the Pentagon/Military . . . . no one will say who . . . made a direct show of force to the CIA on Saturday.  It was, for lack of a better description, the sending of a message from the military to the CIA: knock it off. </p>
<p>It was done over a weekend apparently because most of the bigshots in the Pentagon are at home, and by the time they heard something was going on, it was pretty much over . . . . the aircraft returned to wherever they came from.</p>
<p>This is utterly unprecedented.  To have one agency of the US Government make a show of force to another entity of that same government is unheard of. It smacks of a sort of internal civil war heating up inside our own government!</p>
<p>Apparently, things are quickly &quot;coming to a head&quot; between competing policies and the military is tired of its people being injured or killed by the unintended consequences of the old policies and the CIA\' stubborn refusal to stop backing the so-called &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; in Syria.</p>
<p>No one will tell me who gave the order to &quot;buzz&quot; CIA HQ.  No one will tell me who inside CIA is causing the trouble.  But there is  trouble . . . and given the activities over the weekend, one can only hope this thing goes away very quickly and quietly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as far as the public is concerned: &quot;Nothing took place. Everything is fine.  Nothing to worry about.&quot;UPDATE 2:23 PM EST -- MONDAY, NOV. 20</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>This is the original source of the story with interim updates included: <a href="http://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/news/u-s-national-news/1626-reports-us-marine-expeditionary-unit-meu-lands-at-langley-2200-marines">http://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/news/u-s-national-news/1626-reports-us-marine-expeditionary-unit-meu-lands-at-langley-2200-marines</a></p>
<p>It\'s pretty amazing how original stories get blown out of proportion.  I have not heard of Mr. Turner before, but his bona fides are cited.  This guy\'s timeline, story and details match with the overall stories and events.  I have no reason to think he isn\'t credible.  Hopefully, I\'ll learn a little more from someone in the know tomorrow.</p>
<p>Additionally, I drove by the CIA  (maybe I just ruined some junior lackey analyst\'s Thanksgiving) and everything was 100% normal for the week of Thanksgiving.  Quiet.  Even if half a MEU landed on Langley campus, I don\'t think that could be contained longer than 24 hours.</p>
<p>So, a show of force.  I wonder how well that will play out.  Give them time to conduct some wet ops on key players.  That may strengthen the resolve.  Trump knows what he is doing.  And be thankful this time of year for what God has bestowed upon us.</p>',

             Very interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm relatively new to a lot of the various YT "conspiracy theorists".  I listen to what they say, read what they write, compare it to my known and unknowns and draw an opinion as best as I can.  Obviously, this guy Hodges sounds convincing, Is it safe to think he is pretty on point?
            </p>
            <p>
             Hodges states that the Marines "surrounded the CIA".  The perimeter of the CIA is bounded by major public roads.  I personally verified that there was nothing unusual which would indicate a takeover from these public roads.  V22s are frigging loud.  30 minutes of sorties would make a hell of a lot of noise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Langley is a massive campus though.  Without going into acronymania, they could secure certain parts by dropping in close air support.  I'm sure CIA would know at a minimum of when they hit the ground.  The troopers would have the advantage in the first assault and landing zone security.  From there, you could run a pair of chalks in and out of the LZ in about 5 minutes - That's 64 troopers per lift X 6 lifts in 30 minutes = 384 troops in 30 minutes estimated.  Double that running 4 V22 per sortie.  So, one can play with the math.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd be very surprised if they were to bring elements in from the street.  No way that would go without notice even at 3 am.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if they did take control, there is no way that would remain secret in this town since first light Sunday.

              I've listened to him for a long time. He has a lot of insiders. I've always liked him. That's not to say he's correct here. But, it's something to keep in mind. I'm really curious about how he said we will see a lot of politicians with facial bruising soon but is saving that for another show.

                Remember how we saw a lot of politicians with bruising around the left eye I believe? We were wondering why. Now it's supposed to happen again. I don't know. It's weird.

               Hodges is pretty good and I am hard on the truth community. Most are shills. The alphabets infiltrated years ago. Hodges does peddle products and has some good info. He is a bit old style AM radio and a little corny, but sometimes he gets duped and a lot of the time I interpret different than him. I can't say I think he is a shill however.

            They made arrest then they didn't. Now they just circled. Thanks for letting us know the marines circled a building. This phony soon to be staged Civil War between Trump and his deep state partners at the behest of the owners of the worlds central banks is embaressingly transparent. The Q nonsense is to fill your heads with the phony narrative.

             Based on?  Admittedly, I've never heard of the guy before.  I have some friends digging around to get me a little more on Mr. Turner's background.  That Wikipedia entry for him is obviously not run by anyone favorable to him and looks like a smear piece.

             So someone in the Pentagon/Military . . . . no one will say who . . . made a direct show of force to the CIA on Saturday. It was, for lack of a better description, the sending of a message from the military to the CIA: knock it off.

            So we the CIA plotting a coup and then miltary aircraft executing their own coup.  But it's OK, because it was the weekend and the bigwigs were.  That's why you didn't hear about it.

             No one will tell me who gave the order to "buzz" CIA HQ. No one will tell me who inside CIA is causing the trouble. But there is trouble . . . and given the activities over the weekend, one can only hope this thing goes away very quickly and quietly.

             I have not heard of Mr. Turner before, but his bona fides are cited. This guy's timeline, story and details match with the overall stories and events. I have no reason to think he isn't credible.

              This scenario would involve lawless behavior on both the CIA and the military's part.  People seem to be cheering for this, but wishing for a coup is very UNAMERICAN, it's part of an overall contempt for Rule of Law that is prominent on here.

                This place is psychologically fascinating.   I normally experience very few communities that are so dedicated to gullible belief in some instances, so absolute and rejectionist against facts in other instances.  This is place is in the midst of, yet another, cryptic chase down the LARPING hole, getting their hopes up yet again.  How many times has this happened and people still fall for it.

                I mean I don't come across folks who believe that planes didn't crash into the WTC, that was just CGI added to every camera that was shooting video that day.

               Oopsy!, I droped my verb! More like a freudian slip. You have to be one incompetent spook. "Not my only typo either as I look this over", making a case that there is nothing to see there. And you are carrying on about rule of law when the authorites don't respect law or life. You really are a nutter and a creep.

                You're a paranoid conspiracist weaving me into your fantasies.  Maybe my spookwork is incompetent because I'm not a spook.

                 You aren't smart enough to be a spook. You are a lowly shill, not an agent. Either way, you have no game. Nobody would be here at all hours day after day just to say na uh to everything that gets posted.  The fact that you don't understand that this is obvious to others shows you don't even know how to shill.

              A.  He's a complete and open racist and is proud of that fact.
B.  You don't seem to know what a dogwhistle is.   Calling someout and directly and specifically is the opposite of a dogwhistle.

              Turner started his career doing racist diatribes on NYC radio shows and later worked with neo-nazi groups like National Vanguard.  He threatened the judge presiding over Neo-Nazi Matt Hale's case.  He was well known in the Nazi movement from his shortwave radio show.

              Anonymous went after him in a big way and did all sorts of shit to him for his racism.

            Horseshit. You guys are posting one wild unsubstantiated story after another. The marines circled but did not land. How convient a cover is that? So they report hellicopters flying pasy HQ now? First they landed and made arrest with their guns drawn, now they never debarked. You are being played for the fools you are and continue to embaress yourself reporting whatever somebody claiming to be an anonymous insider post on the net. You will beleive anything so they post anything.

             Yes, and that was very significant to me.  I took it to mean that Trump was being told who really is in control.  I know that Trump does not like to be told what to do, so i had hoped he would poumce on these fuckers.

            Upvoat!  Thank you for posting this.  I was Completely Engrossed.  Riveting Article.  All I can say is Wow!  There is no reason to not believe.   Although I may not agree with all his politics I agree with many, but I am not shocked by the antics of the Deep State and BO.  I have one piece of advice to anyone writing an Editorial, though.  Do not recommend that anyone should be killed.  You will reap the nasty benefits of that statement.  We should have the freedom to write anything, but with the way the world is today and all the crazy killings, anyone can be set off.  Dangerous Words will get you Locked Up.

            Your version sounds much more likely to be accurate.  An 2200 man aerial invasion force in DC would be hard to hide.  Circling Helicopters without permission for that air space, would be a loud way to deliver a message.
           </p>
           <p>
            If that was done, I commend the procedure, mission complete without a shot fired. That has to be the class act.
           </p>
           <p>
            The earlier version, marine landings,  which must have been a planned leak, was designed to bring attention to CIA Langley. It Raised the concern today, does the CIA need to be restrained?  Makes people question like Q does.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes the CIA should be restrained, in a sweat suit, until they spill their beans.

                Philadelphia also has a seemingly endless maze. The park with the Thinker, is an entrance.   Downtown Masonic Lodge across from City Hall, has miles of basement connections, endless library stacks.  An entry point to something deeper, worse. Not even the Masons are all bad, just most!

             Getting clearance inside the FRZ would be no issue.  There are planes which fly around in the restricted zone all day long without squawks, call signs, etc.  DC airspace is run out of Bolling AFB and FAA Leesburg.  Military doesn't need to file flight plans.  They could have filed a request to block out airspace for a night training op and no one would've second guessed IMO.

            I am not at all hopeful this goes away quietly. The CIA has been out of control since its inception and needs to go. To call a war against the CIA a civil war is silly. No one in civil society supports them right or left.

            Being a former Marine, this story seems far fetched.  However, the way that Trump has surrounded himself with Marine Generals is no coincidence.  I wonder if Mattis is about to bring the smack down on the deep state.

             Semper Fi.  I had hopes this was true, but there would be no way in hell, the more I think about it, that something like that could be held secret for more than about 4 hours.  Every teenager in McLean/Langley would be still awake at the likely designated ropes down hack (0330).

              The only way this may have happened is if it was conducted by a small MARSOC unit, based within a MEU.  Even if it did happen, I tend to believe it would be labeled as a "training exercise". I have some buddies on different MEUs right now, maybe I'll give them a call (0621).

              I think I remember the wet works reference being to Scalia was a little far fetched. At least the evidence presented when it first broke didn't seem very supportive.
