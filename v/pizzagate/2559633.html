            I wonder about some of  Weinstein's victims, too. I think some of them made a pact with the devil to trade out sex for fame. How do you explain some of them going back later only to be raped again? Now some of them are aging out of the movies as attention is turned to the never ending supply of younger, more beautiful talent. Feeling scorned, they strike back.

            Thats fake news, NYPD is notoriously corrupt also NATIONAL SECURITY LETTER, if white hats found that shit on AW's computer they would be in fear for their lives....also Weinstein will never be arrested/and specially treated (Bill Cohen's appearance of justice). Also considering the climate anonysmously leaking is the way to go. Your "fake news" media outlet "the Hill" long been discredited as liars with zero credibility YOU HEARING ME WILL SOMMER.....use anonymous sources all the time that get proven wrong and never existed. I know what you are doing.

              I think it most likely has to do with the removal of Schneiderman (Schneiderman, Schneiderman, does whatever a pervert can.  He hits women with open hands....)

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have started a criminal probe into sex-abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein, according to people familiar with the matter, marking an escalation of law-enforcement scrutiny of the former Hollywood producer.
            </p>
            <p>
             As part of the investigation, some of the people familiar said, the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York is examining whether Weinstein lured or induced any women to travel across state lines for the purpose of committing a sex crime, which is an offense that could be charged federally.
            </p>
            <p>
             The inquiry by federal prosecutors reflects what law-enforcement authorities have said is a growing frustration that local prosecutors haven’t brought criminal charges against Weinstein. The veteran Hollywood producer faces sexual-harassment accusations from dozens of women, including allegations of rape and sexual assault.
