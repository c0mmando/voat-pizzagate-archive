<p>Relevance: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have recently come under fire from Liz Crokin when Crokin picked up on Teigen\'s use of a pizza emoji next to the couple\'s one-year-old daughter. Crokin has also questioned why their circle of friends contains so many known sexual abusers. A Voat post has already picked up on the Twitter firestorm, and pointed to Legend\'s close association to John Abramovic. </p>

<p>I\'ve been following the traded barbs between Crokin and Chrissy Teigen/John Legend. I also saw the threat of litigation card being played. I was curious so I went dumpster diving and believe I caught pizza emoji pasting momma in a big fat lie. Here\'s the link: </p>

<h1>John Legend and Chrissy Teigen Cut Off Their Fingers Cooking</h1>
<p>Teigen told Elle.com about a kitchen incident that almost kept her beloved husband from tickling the ivories. The pair had invited friends over (Kimye?) to watch a football game and they wanted to make scalloped potatoes. Teigen handed Legend a mandolin to slice the spuds — and then disaster struck.</p>
<p>&quot;I gave John the task, and within the first three swipes, he cut the tip of his finger clean off,&quot; she said. &quot;He refused medical attention because of whatever was happening at that point in the game, so I told him to go sit and let me \'show him how it\'s done.\'”</p>
<p>So what did Chrissy do? “First swipe — first! — I sliced off the exact same finger tip. We have a great photo of us both at the urgent care center.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The date of the article is December 13, 2016. </p>
<p>I went in search of evidence of this &quot;cutting their fingers clean off&quot; statement, and found this photo taken on January 27, 2017, approximately six weeks after the alleged &quot;accident.&quot; The photo number 642948082 in case the link is not working. </p>

<p>As you can see there is nothing wrong with Mr. Legend\'s hands or fingertips. The fingertips are in place and not disfigured, so what was that story about? </p>
<p>To me it\'s one of those PR stories made up to cover the trip to the hospital. So you mix a little truth which is that they both cut their fingers COOKING, but misrepresent how it happened. Probably sliced too deeply, and when that happens, it\'s hard to stop the bleeding. Hence the seeking of medical attention. They had to come up with something. I mean, both of them cutting the exact same finger? It defies credulity unless it was purposefully done. And the other part of the story where I know she\'s lying? If you slice a part of your finger &quot;clean off&quot;, it fucking bleeds all over the place. Hence, the mandolin would not be able to be used unless they were feeding blood to the friends coming over. It would have to be cleaned, etc. You couldn\'t just walk over to it and start slicing because the counter would also have to be disinfected. Forget about your husband bleeding out on the couch. </p>
<p>But while I was at it, I also looked up snapchat. Seems Ms. Teigen\'s symbol is the ... you guessed it ... pizza.  Three celebrities have it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.imore.com/snapchat-celebrity-emoji-guide">https://www.imore.com/snapchat-celebrity-emoji-guide</a></p>

<p>Bella Hadid? Isn\'t sure the sister of Gigi, the skank who did the bad Melania impression?  777 is actually Aleister Crowley\'s number: </p>

<p>But then anyone involved in his Hollywood sex cult would know. Right, Bella? </p>

            I was there when a work colleague cut off a nice-sized piece of her finger tip with an exacto knife. It wasn’t funny, but she took in stride, bandaged it up, and carried on. Very little blood, very little drama. This happened before social media.
           </p>
           <p>
            My take on these two: Social media has turned people into attention whores, celebrities worst of all. One of these two attention whore celebrities got a scratch, they both pitched this exaggerated story to their agents, and created a publicity stunt.

            This is nice work. Also surely if you cut the tip of your finger CLEAN OFF you would have to have it surgically reattached, right?

             All depends on how much of the tip is removed and a person's definition of what constitutes the tip of their finger.  This from googling cutting off the tip of your finger
             <a href="https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/tc/cut-that-removes-all-layers-of-skin-topic-overview">

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Cuts may slice off several layers of skin. As long as some of the layers of skin are still in place, new skin will form in the bottom of the wound and along the wound edges. The wound will heal from the bottom up.  When a cut or scrape removes all of the layers of skin (a full-thickness avulsion injury), fat and muscle may be visible. This type of wound will form new skin only on the edges of the wound and heals from the edges into the middle. The larger the wound, the longer it will take to heal, and the greater the risk of infection.  Cutting off the tip of a finger or toe are common avulsion injuries. If this avulsion injury is larger than 0.25 in. (6.5 mm) by 0.25 in. (6.5 mm), evaluation by a doctor is usually needed. If you are able to recover the piece of skin that was cut off, take it with you. It will probably not be reattached, but it will give your doctor more information about your injury.

             Absolutely. If the tip were removed, it would have to be reattached which means it was laying on the counter in a pool of blood when she started showing how it was done?

              Yeah the fact that their story makes no sense just cements it for me that they have something to hide. Also in that picture you posted of John Legend with his hands seemingly unharmed, is it just me or does he have a vertical scar at the base of his left pointer? Maybe this is what he was talking about lol? But it's a pretty damn impossible place to be cutting in a cooking accident...

               I did see that but wasn't sure it was a digital anomaly. If you look on the same finger on the opposite hand, you'll see a vertical line also, only much more faint. If it's the vertical line that was the injury, there's no way in hell he did that on a mandolin. Impossible.

            If you're going to nick the tip of your finger off, scalloped potatoes on a mandolin would be the easiest way to do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you wash the blood off with soap and water.  There is no 'fingertip' to be left on the table because it's probably dialed down to &lt; 1/8" which will take off some skin and maybe some fingernail and it will bleed like a motherfucker but it will heal fine.
           </p>

            Just chiming in as a long time professional cook.  I still don't trust these fuckers but this is reaching.

            <p>
             That's what she said. She never mentioned anything about NICKING himself, so why are you?
            </p>
            <p>
             I cook also. I know that when you remove skin ... or the tip of your finger ... it doesn't magically disappear. Now if you cut yourself, it takes a second or two for the blood to start dripping (depending on the severity). But you remove the tip of your finger? You start bleeding all over the place. She couldn't have just gone to the mandolin and started slicing. There would be blood all over the counter and blades. Even if you watch a cooking show, you can see what happens to the work area. If you're  a professional chef you should know this.

              I've seen 1/8" tips taken off with mandolins before.  Not an uncommon injury, even for a skilled or professional chef.  Same thing with sharp knives.

               A shill used the 1/8" and now you're picking it up as de facto?
              </p>
              <p>
               Not sure why you're doing that. The power of suggestion? It's an example of what we're up against when a solid member just picks what a nut burger has to say and repeats it. That same nut burger said it would bleed like a mother so would you mind explaining how she could casually walk over to the counter where her Illuminati hubby cut the tip of his finger clear off and started working on the mandolin covered in blood?
              </p>
              <p>
               I'd like to hear the explanation for that please.

                It may have been the power of suggestion.  I have taken the end of my finger off with a mandoline before.  And I know chefs who have done the same.  Yes, it will bleed like a mofo.  Anything vascular will.
               </p>
               <p>
                That being said, it's possible there may be another ceremony/rite/ritual we do not know about that differs from the regular finger slicing.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not sure who/what explanation you are seeking.  I'm pretty sure I'm not a shill ; )
               </p>
               <p>
                And yes, when you cut the end of your finger off, the natural reaction isn't to let someone else take over.  Also, because he is a musician, he may not have wanted to get cut in the meat (nerves) of the finger.  A slice of the tip of the finger heals without too much lasting daamage.

                 Again, you're relying on what happened to you. If you watch the video, you'll see that when people actually lose the tip of the finger, it shows. The woman in the video lost the tip and when shown, the tip is GONE. The shape is changed. Your experience is not the woman's experience ... just watch the video because that is the injury Teigen described. Not a nick ... not a cut ... but the tip of the finger cleanly sliced off.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Did you have the guard on? Our shill professional chef didn't seem to even mention the guard. If the guard is not on, and it wasn't on in the video, that's when serious damage can be done. If it's on, the damage is mitigated. I didn't get into this because it shows the faux Bobby Flay to be a fraud. Any professional would immediately know the guard not being on the mandolin could cause severe damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know you by your posts, and you don't seem like a shill. That's why I'm attempting to explain something that's rather simple to understand. I even provided a video. It's an identical situation. A chef was making scalloped potatoes using a mandolin and she sliced the tip of her finger off. It's exactly what Teigen said happened. Look at the amount of blood lost and the disfigurement it caused. Now look at Legend's hand in the photos. Do you see any damage? It means Teigen LIED. This is not what happened. I've offered up a possible explanation. The tweets Teigen has made are frightening. The Illuminati imagery Legend has posted is also disturbing so it's ultimately up to you as to what you want to believe.

                  I tried to watch the video, but very slow at times on my VPN.  So it sounds like another ritual.  It would make sense - maybe an initiation into a different "level" of Satanism/Mason/Lucifarianism/Kaballah.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Regarding the mandolin - I bought a 50.00 one and didn't know what I was doign with it at the time, hence the accident.  I know professional chef who took a nice full slice, nail and all.  I'll stick with sharp kitchen knives and food processors.

              it's a plausible story.  a very good one if it's made up.

              if that happened to me in a commercial kitchen i would bandaid up and then put on a glove and then wash the mandolin.

               I thought so. Only way to find out if someone's a shill is by presenting logic. If they start with this shit, yup, they're a shill.

             I'm sure. I mean it's such BS. She couldn't have just gone on cooking. What about the tip of his finger? Was it just left on the counter?

             Thanks for the link. Didn't know about the lodge. Although someone mentioned a satanic church in LA. Maybe this is the one they were referring to.

                 These people are nuts. Did you see the Nicki Hilton Instagram photos? The ones where she's delivering pizza to the hotel room? They are sick. They have all that money and devote it to having deviant sex. What a waste .

                  I have no remorse for these sick scumbags.  I believe though that they are like this because they came through the MK Ultra Pedo Ranks.  CIA MK Ultra controlled.  Walking  Controlled Zombies.  Wake up people they are not worth following and neither are the Pedowood Idols either.  They are all Controlled.  Get it through your heads, that the ones you have Adored and Idoled for decades are Bought and Paid for.  Geez.

                   They're no more like us than Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson or Roman Polanski. Their minds are a twisted ball of perversion and degeneracy. Crokin hangs onto the associations she made in PedoWood thinking people like Anniston and Sandra Bullock are like her. They're not. What she experienced is the charm of these monsters and nothing more. They don't care about her or anyone else they hurt. Why else would they serve the master that they chose?

                  <p>
                   Better to accept the truth and cut ties with those that don't matter. They are the enemy. Whether we like it or not, that's the way it is.

                    All I can think of now is the movie The Walking Dead.  That horrid scene with Dead Morbid Zombie Bodies Walking and Marching in unison.  I feel like they are marching toward us to Trample Us.  They have put a spell on many of our people that think they are Gods.  Gods because they were in a Movie!  Now they are ready to let these Zombies literally take over our Children.  To Mesmerize them and Hypnotize them into Submission.  I Just Can't Stand It.

                      Ha Ha.  Beautifully put.  We have been fooled for ages and I am so glad that I have been clued in.  I am now ready to accept any one that is outed.  The most shocking for me were probably Ron Howard and Tom Hanks.  But actually I have not gone to the movies in years.  Just re-issued old movies and not very often.  I am over them.

                        I think some of them are talented, but with all the enhancements today, they get plenty of help to jack up their performances.  I agree that I have no feelings for any of them now.  We will probably be losing more of them, and who knows why.  They are expendable and their lives are short now due to evidence that must be erased or soon to be disclosed.  I actually am enjoying it for they made their beds and now they have to pay up.

                          I am somewhat happy though lately with all the CDAN Blinds outing the Dirty Rats.  I am thinking that some of them are kind of shaking in their boots wondering if they are next.  The Soul one was very interesting and the one outing who was involved with Chris and Chester.  They deserve justice.  But most of all the Children deserve Justice.

                           Right now all I want are for the scumbags to be outed and go to prison. Like Assange with the encryption key. I just want him to post the files. Yes, I guess there's a part of me that understand that whoever the files are intended to bring down realizes the clues the video gave, but me? I'm so tired of this game. I don't want kids to suffer or anyone that is being terrorized to continue to be silenced. So I do understand what you're saying, but let me put it this way ... my patience is limited.

                            Yes, It has taken far too long to get to where we are now.  Also, there are so many answers as to who to trust and not trust.  I am sitting on the fence regarding so many things and people.  After finding out who the is on our side and who is not, it has been a wild ride.  Yeah, I want it to be over too.  I hope that we have learned our lesson to not trust people just because they are Republican or Democrats.  We should know by now that any one of them could betray us in a NY min.

                             Re: trust and voting. The only good thing about what's happening (besides people going to jail) is that we can tell a little bit of who is who by their associations. But that goes away when these people do. So we're going to have to vet each politician that wants our vote on their platform. If they're at all for this normalization and open border shit, they don't get my vote. But then there'll be those in the cabal that pose as being against them when they're just trying to get their sick selves into power again.

                              Yes, get rid of all of them one by one.  The worst ones, Schumer McCain McConnell Schiff and their likes must be booted out.  They belong in jail and their replacements must be seriously vetted.  Am sick of all of them.  There are Mayors too that rule our large cities that are the tools of the Deep State.  OUT.  All of them OUT.  I would like to see some of our people Run for Office.  No need to out yourself, just do it.  Start with a School Position, for that is where we can make a huge difference with our children.  We can infiltrate too.

                                My friend was in an Uproar over her niece and her math class.  The girl's mother has been begging to find out why there is no text book for her class.  The child is having trouble with her math and the teacher told the mother to go on google.  WHAT?  WTH is going on in our schools. I am shocked.  I used to help out in schools and this is a first.  No more textbooks.  Wake up people.  What is going to happen in our country when they are doing this to our kids.  If you think just because you don't have children this won't affect you, you are sadly mistaken.

                                 No textbooks mean the children are not being able to read and learn how to process that information correctly.

                                <p>
                                 And that child is not the first to have trouble. I stop at the neighborhood coffee shop to unwind and all there are so many kids there with either tutors or parents trying to understand what the teachers want. I've overheard more than one tutor telling the child the correct way to do something, and the child counter with, "But Mr./Ms. Teacher doesn't want us to do it that way." I've seen them break down in tears. It's ridiculous.
                                </p>

                                 Between that and the non-action of bullying, I'd say our schools are due for an overhaul.

                                  Funny you bring that up about the kids and their teachers.  That is one thing that my friend focused on too.  That the kids want so much to do what the teacher wants.  We know kids usually love their teachers.  So they want to please them.  This girl says the same thing to her mother.  But she does not want it done that way.  She told us to do it this way.  I told my friend to tell her that she is not going to school to learn a certain way of doing something she just has to find a way to do it so she gets the right answer.  Some of the problems my friend told me about are done in a way that the parents cannot use the old school ways.  Something is rotten in the USA. It almost seems like a learned pattern.  My friend and I are working on a way to get around this.  I say find old text books and convince this child that something is amiss with the new school plan and it is not the teacher's fault otherwise she will miss the whole year's math class and learn nothing.  Are there any teachers on here willing to help?  How do we mix the old text books in with today's math class?  Help Our Kids.

                                   Getting old text books ... which would cost nothing since they're warehoused ... and perhaps give kids old lessons to do. This way they'd actually learn how MATH. Not the parlor trick the schools are teaching.
