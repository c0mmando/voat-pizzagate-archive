            Because Billionaires and Investors know they can keep going back to the well of the poor.  These people cannot fight back for they have nothing.  The infrastructure is as dilapidated as their homes, if they even have any.  They are worse off than when the Clintons first arrived on their shores.  The Clintons have bled the country dry and so have their friends.  The hospital they were suppose to build never happened and they have sponsored coup after coup.  How can those people fight back?  Why do people not believe the bad things they hear about them, do they not wonder where the money is?  But the missing and trafficked children that are missing is the worst tragedy of all.
