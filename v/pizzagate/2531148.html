<p>-Current Working Theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg (Poltergeist incidents), Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario (Rocky Road incident), the tutor in the episode of Rocky Road (certainty unknown).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to intestinal
blockage. Said blockage being a fecal impaction whose contamination of Heather\'s blood was caused by anal rape. Body was desecrated post-morteum via &quot;skinning&quot;. Said skin was turned into leather as a trophy for the culprits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time of fatal incident: Some time between 1/24/1988 and 1/28/1988, likely during midday or afternoon..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recommended course of action: Anyone with either a Twitter or Gab account needs to get in contact with MacCauly Culkin, for I believe he is a person of interest in this case. Notify him that &quot;there are private investigators who wish to hear his story and we would love to know what he knows about Hollywood pedophile rings&quot;. Bring him here with a specific &quot;code name&quot; so we\'ll know its him.</p>

            Weve said so much about Heather, but Mac Culk should never be ignored too. What was UP with his recent random appearances (with nothing to promote) on various late night talk shows?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think there is some subliminal shit going on, like, he (and probably others) use coded language, during the interviews give folk (his former handlers/abusers, or even his fans) some kind of warning on what he's about to do, or know, or info he's about to release?
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish he and Corey would just tell the truth about Jacko too, urrghh

             Its is AMAZING to me how many younger folks defend MJ and say he was framed/is innocent....its like seriously?! I mean yes the courts found him that way but it took lots of money and help to keep that secret that was waaaaay bigger than just him I am certain,

              oh yes its amazing how blissfully ignorant and plain f*cking stupid people are. Most folk are not like us - red pilled and
              <em>
               aware
              </em>
              - so they carry on living in their dream fantasy world where pedos monsters are fake news made up by alt right.

               To think that I used to use the phrase "Til the last cages are empty" to mean animals in labs...now it has a completely different and yet as significant meaning. Whilst swallowing the first of my red pills with no water I used to think there is just NO WAAAAY this can really be happening. Now its like there is no way it ISNT.

               This always makes me sick.  You too.  I am over and done with Feldman and Culkin.  They should stop teasing us and shut up.  The are only creating drama.  The time they posted his band site on here I just about puked.  The bunny rabbit stuff.  Yuck.

             I don't know what he is up to.  It sounds strange and weird but different than Corey.  Corey is a player.  I don't think MacCauley is.  He is still a product of what happened to him.  He has not had the proper help, it seems.  He still needs deep therapy, you can see how mixed up he still is.  I really am sick of both of them just jerking everyone around.  I could not like a life like that. Suffering is one thing, but this could go on his whole life.  They are keeping him shut up to save their own necks.  Someone is keeping him too scared to tell the truth.

            This lawsuit arose out of the death of 12-year-old Heather O’Rourke, star of the three Poltergeist movies, TV appearances on Happy Days, Webster, and other shows. This death action was filed by Heather’s mother, alleging the defendant Kaiser (Southern California Permanente Physicians) committed malpractice in the care and treatment of Heather O’Rourke, resulting in her death.

            As she was short for her age (she stood 3 ft 8 in (1.12 m) at age 10),[1] she began receiving hormone injections at UCLA to encourage her growth. Her petiteness led casting directors to cast her as children that were younger than her actual age. Her agent was quoted in The Los Angeles Times as saying that when she was ten, "she was still playing 7, 8."[

             The day of her illness was Sunday 1/31. Her death was on 2/1/1988. Meaning the skinning must have happened within a few days after her death.

              thinking that the surgery they preformed to try to save her, they lost any evidence by removing those parts of the colon
             </p>
             <p>
              watching for your timeline, I still think of the little girl from North Carolina, arrests were made in 2014 and they haven't seen court yet

               The blind in question mentioned a medic having to be called after what they did to her.
              </p>
              <p>
               This to me implies there was some serious anal bleeding, ie tears in rectal tissue. This right there should have been a red flag for sodomy.

              <p>
               I suspect the doctors were paid off to cover up the rape.

            I am going to have trouble sleeping again tonight, Sure many others will too.  Thank You  for digging into this. Many of us have heard of the shoes, but connecting them to a child that we all know, well that is hitting pretty close.  RIP Heather.

            Doing some digging regarding shoe making on this. Forgive the morbid nature of this comment, but I need to get the full truth of this case.

            Seems you need about 3 square feet of leather to make a pair of standard men's dress shoes.

             In this 1 minute clip, Alisa says they make shoes and flip flops, flip flops over here in UK would only take a tiny amount of leather. Look how they DISCRIBE the peeling of baby skin and how the blood is still on it - they even motion the action, NOT FAKE, these children have witnessed these horrific rituals! by  MrAvgnfan12 Published on 13 Feb 201 - 305 Baby skin shoes -
