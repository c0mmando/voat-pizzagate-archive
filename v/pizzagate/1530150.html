<p>ICMEC held its first Board of Directors meeting in May 1998.[9] It was officially launched in April 1999 at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., by Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady of the United States, and Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.[4][10]</p>

<p>The ICMEC also has an honorary board <a href="http://archive.is/6Grtp">http://archive.is/6Grtp</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honorary board: Margarida Sousa Uva Barroso (wife of the President of the European Commission) | Mrs. Bernadette Chirac (wife of the French president) | HRH Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol of Thailand | Valentina Matvienko (chair Federal Council of the Russian Federal Assembly) | HRH Princess Lalla Meryem of the Kingdom of Morocco | Queen Paola of Belgium | Queen Silvia of Sweden. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual board for ICMEC is quite interesting </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ernie Allen served as President &amp; CEO of both NCMEC and ICMEC for 15 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer - former ICMEC chairman, the first Chairman of Child Focus (the Belgian Center for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children) - related to the dutroux affair. Patron to Belgian Kids Fund for Pediatric Research, with three other patrons being closely implicated in Belgian dossiers with child abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sen. Dennis DeConcini - Democratic Senator from Arizona later served as Secretary of Homeland Security. Was also personally appointed a director of Freddie Mac by Bill Clinton. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Victor Halberstadt - Bilderberg secretary general 1980-2000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anne-Marie Lizin (president Belgian senate)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jeff Koons - Donated to CTR </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patty Wetterling - chair NCMEC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eve Branson - Sir Richard Bransons Mother </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also just learned that Richard Branson and Jeffrey Epstein\'s island are less than 35 miles away from each other. <a href="http://sli.mg/LhBuCH">http://sli.mg/LhBuCH</a></p>
<p>If I recall in Epstein\'s black book were both Blair and Branson </p>
<p>This does not strike me as the makeup of an organisation that actually wants to help children on an international scale.</p>',
