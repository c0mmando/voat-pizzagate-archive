<p>After reading that short history of the war-gamers and computer history and mind control fanatics in top science positions I wonder if the child trafficking pedofiles we scrutiny as #pizzagate researchers get their immunity from prosecution and media blackout on their crimes because they are part of this mass social &quot;experiment&quot;.</p>
<p>Is the reason the D.C. pedo ring, the Franklin  cover-up was smothered because they were a product of of this &quot;hypnotism and conditioned reflex&quot; experiment?</p>
<p>Did control masters who attended the 1942 conference lay the groundwork for today\'s pizzagate (specifically the D.C. pedo ring associated with the Podesta e-mails and Comet Ping Pong)? And did they lay the groundwork for Epstein\'s freedom of movement to commit so many crimes and Saville\'s obscenities and the Hempstead group and other covens? </p>
<p><strong>Is the apparent immunity enjoyed by the Podesta brothers and James Alefantis because of some association with a think tank?</strong></p>',

            That might just be something I picked up from the old guys where I grew up.  Firearms were normal (like go in your backyard and shoot stuff normal).  I just figured firearms were the farthest thing from rocket science.  Especially given they would teach children at ages of 4+ in the late 1800s.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, I can see your point on that.  I've moved from the country side and (besides hating having to go to a range) it would be the only source of combat knowledge for most of the kids out here.

            I think we are doing a great job and can all agree that even if this is a distraction for something more sinister, the more evidence found, the better. Analyze what you see from more than just 1 or 2 angles.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have been victimized in a similar aspect for years and are lucky that we live in a time where the average citizen, can become an enlightened citizen, by plugging their ears, opening there eyes, and thinking about the most important thing that Grandma ever taught them. We all remember the Benjamin Franklin quote, " Believe NONE of what you hear, and only HALF of what you see." Brainwashing is a real thing, and has been practiced for centuries. Too many of us have been marching to the cadence of a voice that cannot be paired with a face, because you heard voices mention that the destination was paradise. WAKE UP!!!!! Do not be the one that obediently walks into the gas chamber. Take off the tin hat, hand Jim Jones his kool-aid right back, for you are walking into a trap.

            I also think mass unemployment is a made up stresser to disable the populace. 
There's no reason to not have a 3 or 4 day workweek and full employment given the mechanization of the work world.

            The only trouble I see with this paper, which, I think is quite good, is with the SCHILLER INSTITUTE.
It seems they are hooked up with nutty, Lyndon Larouche (names at the bottom of the page). He's as bad as Bertrand Russell in my opinion.

            "In his 1948 work on The Philosophy of Modern Music, Frankfurt School leader Theodor Adorno argued that the purpose of modern music is to literally drive the listener insane. He justified this by asserting that modern society was a hotbed of evil, authoritarianism, and potential fascism, and that, only by first destroying civilization, through the spread of all forms of cultural pessimism and perversity, could liberation occur. On the role of modern music, he wrote, "It is not that schizophrenia is
  directly expressed therein; but the music imprints upon 
 itself an attitude similar to that of the mentally ill. 
The individual brings about his own disintegration.... 
He imagines the fulfillment of the promise through magic, 
 but nonetheless within the realm of immediate actuality.... 
Its concern is to dominate schizophrenic traits through the
 aesthetic consciousness. In so doing, it would hope to vindicate
insanity as true health.''
            <strong>
             Necrophilia, he added, is the ultimate expression of ``true health'' in this sick society.

             <p>
              This paper explores Erich Fromm’s concept of necrophilia, as discussed in his 1963 pamphlet War  Within  Man.  There  Fromm  contrasts  the  healthy  “biophilic”  character  orientation,  which  is open to growth, change, and the future, with the  unhealthy  "necrophilic”  character,  which  is  characterized  by  sentimentality,  dwelling  upon  the  past,  and  an  attempt  to  render  the  world  static,  fixed,  predictable,  and  dead.  While  the  former is future-oriented, like Fromm’s messianic hope,  the  latter  attempts  to  flee  the  burdens  of  personal responsibility, freedom, and individuality  through  psychological  regression  into  the
              <br/>
              past. I conclude by exploring Fromm’s concepts of  necrophilia  and  biophilia  in  light  of  his  longtime correspondence with Thomas Merton.

             Too easy to take out of context.  But, the choice of words may underlay some type of freudian slip (he was a freudian), or as the simpsons puts it "Super Bliminal".  Still not denying the guy was a shithead.

            no, not at all fake. But perhaps the high up protection these pedo ring leaders enjoy in England and the US and other countries has to do with this science dictatorship idea of Bertrand Russell's.
Maybe the public is getting experimented on ... having their creativity stomped out of them, having high rewards for go-along mentality for wars of aggression and other government crimes etc. etc. And now this mass terror - really, pizzagate crimes are a form of terrorism - that the public (us) is unable to stop, stem or speak about.

            Probably not, you have rich people in power covering shit on a regular basis.  The Franklin case also involved the reputation of a credit union which would not liked to be talked about negatively (because a lot of people are concerned for good reason about image).  So, I just don't think so.

              I have, and it's fairly loosely tied shit.  "We're going to train soldiers through video games."

              That premise is dumb as fuck.  You take a person who has played video games and put them on the battle field with a soldier and you'll have a fairly obvious outcome.  You put a person playing strategy video games against a general and have them both in charge of a battle, you'll have a fairly obvious outcome.  The best I've seen for combative training in video games is a general idea of how to sabotage shit, and I know very few people who could make their own thermite.

               The trend owes its health to an odd array of influences: the youthful fervor and firm dis-Establishmentarianism of the freaks who design computer science; an astonishingly enlightened research program from the very top of the Defense Department; an unexpected market-flanking movement by the manufacturers of small calculating machines; and an irrepressible midnight phenomenon known as Spacewar.

              Guess what, it wasn't nice for geeks in the early days.  It's a movement of their own design because they found it interesting.  Some jackass writing a paper on the subject does not mean they run the show.  Quite literally from the 80's until the mid 90's computing was the wild west of technology.  Maybe the big boys were running the show in the corporations, but the little guys were the ones that really made up the movement.

              And yes, there are three factors that gave rise to the popular and current form of the internet.  Video games, Universities, and Porn.

              For the rest of it.  Nepotism - this paper just describes nepotism and a desire to lower the common man.  All to likely yes, and in line with the frankfort school of thought.  Cultural marxists have swarmed the computer science world, they've also been there in the beginning (just not as much).  But, the CMs have been ramping up all over the place lately.  I'm more interested in what's bringing about their current furvor than where it came from (because I already know).

            I have wondered if it's all to legalize pedophilia. The contagion of behavior. The first few original "pushers" go uncharged. Woodstock - drugs were handed out for free. The first taste is free. Tony fat frog Podesta is so pleased with himself that his house is full of killing children. So. Pleased. With. Himself. Sleeps like a baby, probably. Why is that? There's a book about the history of children's lives. Historically, children have been treated very badly. I'll find it. Hold on a sec. Here:

            It's a text book, too. It points out how horrible life has always been for children. I think the elites thought that was better, and served them, so they want that back.
