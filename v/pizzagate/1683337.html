<blockquote>
<p>Congressional candidate James Thompson called for a federal crackdown on human trafficking at the first news conference of the 4th District congressional campaign.</p>
<p>Thompson, a lawyer, said he would press for increased penalties for traffickers, more resources to help victims, and additional training and empowerment for social workers, teachers, health-care providers and others to identify and act on trafficking.</p>
<p><strong>He said those efforts must focus on people who run and profit from the business of sex trafficking, not low-level sex workers</strong>.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing is we’re going after the victims themselves and prosecuting them for prostitution and things like that, instead of going after the johns and the pimps and the people who are exploiting these ... young girls and young boys,” Thompson said. “We’re simply not doing what we’re supposed to be doing. We’re going after the wrong people.”</p>

            Remember, the pope also met with 60 police departments to crack down on Human trafficking...its not in coordination with the Federal investigation being done by the Trump administration.  Keep in mind after 911, it was important to be in charge of the "official" investigation then too. You know, the investigation that didn't even consider controlled demolition, left out the tower 7 building collapse and left out all the testimony about Cheney taking control of NORAD that morning and ordering a stand down as the "terror event" transpired.  The news ran the story "Where was Dick Cheney during 911" and told that he was at his mother's for breakfast that morning....uh huh.....and that guy he shot in the face at his home?  That was hunting accident...news said so.

             Yep!  My first thought.  Also, this guy's a Democrat and, reading between the lines, I get that he wants to dramatically increase the size of bureaucracies.  Putting the two together, he will likely bloat the government and affiliate agencies (higher taxes) all in the name of "fighting sex trafficking."  But, like "Denny" Hastert, it will all be for show and nothing will really change.

              Kind of like Shakespeare said...."all the world's a stage", and as Jerry Lewis said in an old TV game show, where celebs were blindfolded and had to guess who the guest on the show was by asking questions.  Lewis had already figured out it was Walt Disney but asked the question "Are you an actor on stage and off?".
