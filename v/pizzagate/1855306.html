            I have mixed feelings on this one. Although Glacier Dental maybe a red herring, the shills came out strong all over trying to debunk. Also, stem cell research centers do use teeth for the stem cells, younger teeth preferred. I really think there's more to these stem cell research centers, world wide, that need to be looked at closer.

            real or not Voat is one of the last forums for this topic. We can't risk this place getting shut or a lawsuit.  FBI Anon gave us the bread crumbs, CGI and the clintons and associates.  There's 10 mountains worth of info and digging that can be done based off FBI anon, and most of those targets are public. We got to be cAreful about pointing fingers at private citizens and businesss, it will be used against us.

            I've done a lot of research into the connection of dentists with illegal tissue sellers and human traffickers so I acknowledge it might have triggered my confirmation bias.  I'm not convinced the lead is incorrect yet but I think that the people posting the topics are going about it wrong.  The G symbol does not really resemble the BLogo and focusing on it is pointless.  If there is dirt on Glacier Dental it would be best to look into the international adoption centers around it for shady activity (letting pedophiles and abusers adopt, etc.)  Also since Glacier does implants we need to find out who their supplier is and if they are law abiding and reputable.  That would give us a lot more info than endlessly squabbling over logos.

             I'm replying only to your interest in implants. Upon having 2 teeth pulled the oral surgeon put a great deal of pressure on me to receive  bone grafts as part of prepping me for the implants. It was actually heavy handed enough that I decided to get a second opinion and I was informed that there was no need for me in particular  to do bone grafts, my jaw bone was just fine, and on a general basis there shouldn't be a need. So now imagine thousands of dentists pushing millions of patients for bone grafts what with implants now as routine as getting a filling for those who can afford it. The dentists in all likelihood receiving commission type rewards for selling a package of bone material to a consumer. This isn't my area of pizzagate interest but I would wholeheartedly support aggressive research in this regard.

             This is the best road to follow.  If it was a set up (which is possible)  then we don't know the real reason behind it.  It could be for many reasons.  Discrediting just to make us look like loonies, take us away from real  investigations, or to make us look so bad that when we find a real organ harvesting or orphanage selling children, that no one will believe us.  I believe there are really heinous and bad things happening there.  We know that for a fact.  We know that there are a multitude of missing women and children and LE is copying the same speech from DC LE. Families are saying their children were taken and sold or murdered, but LE respond with a blind eye. Yes, there is something very fishy going on that we can be sure of.   We can also be set up to make this look like a bogus place when it is not.  I think right now the best thing to do is exactly what you said.  Also, if it is made to look fake, they are good at faking, The logo could be a form of the symbol on purpose, just saying.  There are too many possibilities (not saying they are correct) to just let this go.  I am saying yes to looking into the orphanages, the school, and the crematorium and some of LE next door.  What if one of those officers came up with a sex abuse record or the Captain had allowed abuse at another station, would we still ignore the story?

            Thank you OP... I've been increasingly vocal about this same concern within the POSTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATED over and over again. It's nonsense. And then the "map" came out with the CA police departments, CPP and Glacier???

            I agree, not necessarily that this is trying to cover something up, but, that this is disinfo/intended to discredit us.

             I confess to being one of those initially supporting them but urging caution.as well.My support was due to the astonishing mini investigation of Abiku nightclub activities in Youngstown OH. Those posters started out same way and came up with legit results ..although I don't know what one does with those results. Certainly stay on top of Jane Vincent and her merry band of followers who might be attractive to runaway teens. More importantly, the mods did their job, gave IDeliverPizza wide berth and when it got out of hand stopped it.  Thanks Mods.

            Thanks for saying this. A non-shill wouldn't push the same fucking story day after day with little to no evidence. I think what these people do is sit in conference rooms and brain storm for a couple of days then send out whatever bull shit disinfo they came up with for a few days then wash, rinse and repeat.

            It's hysterical to see some of the ideas they come up with. I was just corresponding with one of them who goes by the name IvankaJewCock. It's priceless humor if nothing else. The sad part is these useful idiots think people believe them.

            Either way the whole episode can damage VOAT/PIZZAGATERS whether it was a coordinated attack or an exuberant OP. They had several days to come up with something of substance and couldnt. Their headliners screamed a bit too loud, first clue.   So it's been discredited and deleted. I think we should just move on but be aware if it something similar happens again. Quality research and analysis will help the credibility of Pizzagate.

             Yes, exactly. I'm pretty sure he's a kid who literally lives with his mother in a single parent home and is a wannabe Big Important Poster because he's not getting enough attention in his life, but the bottom line is the same as if he's a paid shill-- we risk losing total credibility and also hurting the reputations of innocent people by swarming onto a business without evidence against them.

            Same. I think it's an attempt to make us go after an innocent company in order to discredit us. There is no proof of anything out of the ordinary going on at Glacier Dental. I even saw someone go on about "OMG THEY HAVE DENTAL CHAIRS THERE, THEY MUST BE USING THEM FOR SOMETHING SINISTER".........but it's a dental office. Rofl. The one bad review for them is weird, but doesn't automatically make me think pedophilia or trafficking, and it's the only bad review that I saw for them. The threads are probably getting scrubbed bc there is no evidence, and leaving that stuff up is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            My question is, are the people pushing this shills? Or were they fed this info from somewhere and fell for it? Should we be looking at their previous submissions to see what other disinfo they may have spread?

             I think they're getting scrubbed so they can target specific pizzagate communities. Similar to this post from vice saying
             <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/reddits-conspiracy-theorists-think-world-war-iii-will-begin-tomorrow">
              "Reddit's Conspiracy Theorists Think WW3 Will Begin Today"
             </a>
             , they want to be able to say "Voat pizzagate conspiracy theorists target and attack innocent dental office" and when this place actually has no substantial evidence they can say it's the second attack on a random business (which the media has already painted the Comet Ping Pong suspicions as). Makes us look bad and makes all the research to come out of here look bad by association (which doesn't discredit everything we've done but people who get all their info from the news will think it does).

              Exactly. Derail the investigation and make us look even crazier, two birds with one stone. I'm interested in the timing though. I saw the first Glacier Dental post a few weeks or a month ago...why is it being pushed again now? Are they trying to distract us from something else, and if so, then what? I'm scrolling down through the "new" section and going over the last few days. OP made a bunch of posts on the same day; maybe they were trying to push a post off of the front page. Now Voat is (I assume) being DDoSed...wtf is going on here?

            I had the exact same thought. Evidence to be skeptical of this:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Multiple postings of 3-5 posts, all at once, a couple of days ago, especially by
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/IDeliverPizza">
               @IDeliverPizza
              </a>
              . This serves to give the appearance of a major lead while scraping the front page of legit posts. Take a look at his submission history and lack of reliability, always pointing to the next thing. This account has been around for four months, but he regularly posts SCREAMING HEADLINES that are just rumors...or things we might like to believe (huge break)...which are not substantiated or which never pan out in the end. IDeliverPizza has NO credibility in his history, so I am inclined to believe he is ShareBlue/CTR moreso than thinking he is just non critical in analyzing a lead. I am pretty convinced he is deliberate disinfo. The posting of multiple posts on the same topic within minutes is more support of this.

              The Glacier posts lack any real substance. They are similar to other posts by IDeliverPizza, which sound promising until you actually dig...and this guy does minimal digging.

              The coordination appears high level. It may be that there are some insiders at places like Reddit and 4chan who want to highlight these red herrings, causing us to harass the targets or promote provably false accusations in an effort to discredit or shut this down.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Based on the above, I am strongly convinced it is an actual DISINFO campaign and will only be convinced otherwise with hard evidence. The best evidence against it is the behavior of IDeliverPizza.
