<h3><strong>Summary:</strong></h3>
<h3>Republican congressman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)">Jim Jordan</a> is forcefully denying allegations that he knew Ohio State University wrestlers he coached two decades ago were being sexually abused by the team doctor.</h3>
<p>Rep. Jordan was assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University from 1986 to 1994.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ohio State University is investigating allegations that former team doctor Dr. Richard Strauss, who committed suicide  in 2005, sexually abused team members. The allegations range from inappropriate touching to sexual assault.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Former wrestlers say then-assistant coach Jim Jordan had to have known about the doctor\'s abuse \'because it was all over the locker room\'.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> <a href="http://archive.is/NOSlH">reports:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'I never knew about any type of abuse. If I did, I would have done something about it,\' [Jordan] told Politico on Tuesday. </p>
<p>But his denials have been met with skepticism and anger from two former members of the team, NBC News reported. </p>
<p>Former wrestler Mike DiSabato has said that Jordan is \'absolutely lying\' when he says he did not know about the allegations.</p>
<p>DiSabato and Dunyasha Yetts <strong>both claim that Jordan - the founder of the House Freedom Caucus - was complicit in the abuse that the university is currently probing.</strong></p>
<p>In April, Ohio State University announced it was investigating accusations that Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005, abused team members when he was their doctor from the mid-1970s to late 1990s.</p>
<p>\'Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\' his spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement.</p>
<p><em>Jordan, 51, is conservative firebrand who came to Capitol Hill in 2007 and quickly rose in the ranks of power. He has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Speaker Paul Ryan and is a close ally of President Donald Trump.</em></p>
<p><strong>Three former wrestlers told NBC News that it was common knowledge that Dr. Strauss showered regularly with the students and inappropriately touched them during appointments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They claim it would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One wrestler said he told Jordan directly about the abuse.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>DiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted the university to investigate, called Jordan a liar outright.</strong></p>
<p>DiSabato said he reached out to Jordan, before going to the university, to tell the congressman that he planned to go public with his allegations.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan told him to \'please leave me out of it,\' DiSabato claimed. \'He asked me not to get him involved.\'</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another wrestler told NBC that he, too, had told Jordan what happened.</strong></p>
<p>Dunyasha Yetts, who wrestled at Ohio State in 1993 and 1994, said he and others told Jordan about Strauss.</p>
<p>\'I remember I had a thumb injury and went into Strauss\' office and he started pulling down my wrestling shorts,\' he told the news network. \'I\'m like, what the f--- are you doing? And I went out and told Russ and Jim what happened. I was not having it. They went in and talked to Strauss.\'</p>
<p>Yetts said he and his teammates talked to Jordan numerous times about their interactions with the doctor. </p>
<p>[Jordan said] said that \'no one reported any type of abuse\' to him.  
</p>
<p><em>Jordan was a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion during his time at the University of Madison-Wisconsin. He was a four-time state wrestling champion. In the 1985 NCAA championship match, Jordan defeated future two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time world champion John Smith.</em></p>

            Jim Jordon is throwing his hat into the ring for Speaker of the House when Paul Ryan retires in November.  Between that and his fight against the corruption in the FBI/CIA over the Russian Collusion Delusion is why he is being attacked.  Jim Jordan is awesome...hence the attack.

             I agree that the timing might be a bit odd. Maybe the former players even came forward because they are lefties who would like to prevent him becoming the new Speaker of the House.
            </p>
            <p>
             But this doesn't mean that the abuse by the team doctor didn't happen and the time, and that Jordan knew about it and covered it up.

            Here is video of a CNN interview in which DiSabato describes what was actually done to him by Dr. Strauss:

           </p>
           <p>
            Btw, I notice that DiSabato in the video appears to exhibit an eye anomaly on the right that is not apparent in his LinkedIn photo:

              No, I'm saying that anything is possible.  Jim Jordan is at the tip of the Congressional spear, leading the charge.  I'd be very surprised if he made it to this point if there was something like that in his background.  That being said, there is something a little off about his demeanor (creepy vibes).

               Well, remember that it was only about two years ago that male football players came forward in Britain, talking about their sexual abuse by coaches.
              </p>
              <p>
               And when you look at some of the comments here on the thread, you get an idea why a wrestler would be even less inclined to talk about abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'd say Jordan could probably feel quite safe, assuming that the former team members wouldn't come forward, especially since the alleged perp killed himself some years ago.

                Perkins Coie is a lawfirm that is "investigating" this. Perkins Coie is the same lawfirm that hired Crowd Strike that hired Christopher Steele for the dossier. Perkins Coie is also the employer of multiple former Obama staff members. The timing immediately made it suspect to me, but adding in this firm to the mix makes me believe it indeed is an all out hit job.

                I completely agree.  I've learned to trust my gut instinct over many years.  The Jordan story may be a mix of truth and lies.  Jordan's reaction tomorrow will be telling.

            This sounds like a Gloria Allred style smear to me. I was a wrestler and a judoka. No Dr would have dared to touched me. I call Bullshit.

              Jim Jordan is corrupt and complicit. Jason Chaffetz is corrupt and complicit. Paul Ryan is corrupt and complicit. Trey Gowdy is corrupt and complicit. Rand Paul is corrupt and complicit. Ted Cruz is corrupt and complicit. Rod Rosenstein is corrupt and complicit.

              This is all for show. There is no rule of law. There is no equal protection under the law. The justice system is broken and dysfunctional. The legislative system is broken and dysfunctional. Trump is not draining any swamp or holding anyone accountable. Trump is making deals with all involved to cover everything up so the People never figure out the real Truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              We KNOW this to be absolute FACT. We cannot share why yet, but we KNOW they are all corrupt and complicit.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is happening EVERYWHERE. Only those who do not play ball are held accountable, only after it is impossible to keep a lid on what has been going on throughout America and the world for a long, long time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jim Jordan is a FAKE. Jason Chaffetz is a FAKE. They are all FAKE and CORRUPT. Each and every one is compromised, and they are all making deals with each other because they know what happens if they don't. They all have their weakness.

             Justin....only because you would have perhaps reacted differently, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.

             I think it's not about physical force, but a mixture of shame, confusion, dependence, and power that kept the students from talking at the time.

             Same with the abuse that happened in the British football teams.
