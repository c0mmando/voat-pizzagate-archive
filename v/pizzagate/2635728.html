            The circumstances of his death are incredibly suspicious. I support metoo, and asia argento had very very recently spoken on stage at the cannes film festival about what a monster weinstein is, which is incredibly brave. Asia had one of the most horrible assaults by weinstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think metoo has scared the fuck out of pedos, cuz we are getting closer. And dan schneider has been taken down, yeah!
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, bourdains final episode discussed the aremanian genocide, which i guess tptb dont want even acknowledged.  And now this clinton stuff. He slammed both her and weinstein online days before his death.

            When a satanist (Bourdain) throws more powerful satanists (Clintons) under the bus, you don't think we should report it?  It's news, and it's good news.

            i could not fathom the fawning over bourdain. There exits a most disgusting photo.of him proudly holding up a fresh bleeding heart which Im sure came from.an animal not a human but nevertheless savage and satanic in its  depiction or maybe he was just sharing his delight in being a carnivore which upsets vegetarians for whom he has much disdain.

             In his No Reservations episode that takes place in India, he doesn't have that much of an issue with vegetarians. He hates blah, bland vegetarian food, but when it's spicy-flavorful, he's down for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also did a voice on the show Archer, which has it's red pill moments (like going over MKUltra projects and the lack of informed consent among other things)

             ; the episode with Bourdain results in the chef's death for lipping off to the wrong people.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the girlfriend is suspect because of who she has connections to; I have no doubt she grew up MKU'd and has ties to that "community." I know Bourdain has ties to that as well (went from Travel Channel to CNN, and CNN is the gov's propaganda arm; pretty sure one doesn't get a show on there without selling a chunk of one's soul) and he must have seen some shit. He was an author; perhaps he documented his observations/participations concerning the assholery afoot. Maybe he was going to squeal in hopes of getting a reduced sentence for his own actions. Whatever the reason he was found dead, it brings more questions to the table than it does answers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm in the minority here. I used to watch his show. I've read his books. While brash and opinionated, he did give a fuck about people. Food was the common thread of humanity, something that people can sit down and discover the nuances of another culture.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yeah, posing with body parts isn't classy. Replace the heart with any other organ or primal cut and the picture would be as distasteful because we're not supposed to think where our food comes from; only that it's there on our plate when we're ready for it.

            Never have I seen the shills come out more and say "We hate this guy, glad he's dead", Than with a CHEF nobody knew or gave a shit about, and otherwise had ZERO political influence.

             What are you talking about? Bourdain made numerous statements against Trump and White society over the last few years and drew the ire of many Trump supporters. He was probably the most recognizable chef in the country, other than Bobby Flay. He was praised as a sage and an savant.  A nobody? That nobody got Obama to sit down with him in an obscure noodle joint in Vietnam...

              Chillen and grillin was where Bobby stole how to cook from that other guy. Before that he was a rich kid dishwasher who ... passed .. culinary school. Bourdain was full into this, but was awarded special membership privileges  that someone else might not appreciate. Bourdain grew a heart like the Grinch. Inspired by girlfriend.  I have seen it before.

              I'm not saying Bourdain is one or the other, but it's obvious the shills got in here first to set what our opinion should be on it. Which do you think is more likely, the good guys killed a chef with no political influence, or the bad guys killed a chef with something to say?

               or... he is still alive.  I've known about Bourdain's shady association for over 2 years.  There is a gourmet chef connection to PG and the Cabal and many if not most world renowned Chefs are suspect.

                The connection is the cabal own the commodities markets and if celebrity chefs cook some commodity, the sheeple go out and buy it the next day. The chefs must therefore be controlled allies, and what better way than through paedophilia and cannibalism.

                I've been watching British chef "James Martin's American Road Trip" on the food channel recently. Some of the locations he visits are pizzagate related it seems with Napa Valley among them. Also does some anti gun propaganda in Austin.

               'Liberals loved Bourdain but he hated Clinton'  That is the narrative, you stupid fuck.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bourdain was a scumbag, hung out with Satanists, who fuck kids as part of their belief system. Besides, everything he said was an OPINION.

            Hear, Hear!   Bourdain was a despicable person, and now he's a hero?  No, no, no.  The same thing happened with the recent idolization of Roseanne Barr.
           </p>
           <p>
            Getting back to Bourdain, when asked in October 2016 whether he would consider breaking bread with then presidential-hopeful Trump, he replied, "Absolutely f***ing not, and I would give the same answer that I would have given 10 years ago when he was just as loathsome."
