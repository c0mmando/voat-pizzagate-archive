She was 10 and living as a nomad with her mother and her mother’s boyfriend, traveling from town to town along the Connecticut shoreline. She never got to go to Chuck E. Cheese, she said.</p>

            C'mon this is just crazy.  The article is in no way mentioning some high end operation involving yachts.  You're extrapolating from lucrative.   It's lucrative for some street level pimp from the Bronx to work in CT.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think people are getting confused by the switch in terminology of pimping to sex trafficking.  These are pimps working out of cheap hotels .
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing in that article supports your thesis.  And if you look at Massachusetts, there are more cases out of Massachusetts which makes sense as Massachusetts has a bigger population.

            That's not what the article refers to.  It's referring to street level pimps working the streets, motels and ads like craigslist.

            If you're going to set up, some super secret sex trafficking spot on an unknown island for clients from Martha's Vineyard, you're not going to do it CT.

            This is silly.  The 201 number is for the entire state.  Most of the state does not have a shoreline.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not a short trip.   You have to skip the MA and RI coastlines to get to CT state line.  For comparison's sake, that is almost the same distance as it is from Martha's Vineyard to Montauk on the tip of Long Island.   That's a six hour trip on a commercial fast ferry.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that probably is not the "lucrative section" of the coastline.  Many wealthy folks live along that shoreline, but closer to NYC.
My guess would be the Greenwich to New Haven part of the coast is the lucrative part.
           </p>
           <p>
            The link in the article talks about a pimp from the Bronx working in East Hartford.  Which smack in the middle of the state. And not the kind of Eyes Wide Shut elite trafficking people seems to think about on here.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes no sense to visit prostitutes in CT if you are staying in Martha's Vineyard.  You would go to MA.
