            The UK Government is poisoned by this.  The Scottish government launched an independent inquiry into "Historical child abuse in care" taking the stance to omit faith organisations (Catholic Church) and sporting organisations (Celtic Football Club).

           <p>
            Already letting two of the main offenders of abuse in Scotland off the hook before a pen has even been stroked across a page.
           </p>
           <p>
            Celtic Football Club are intrinsically a  Catholic club, founded on Catholic beliefs for Catholic people, it is no surprise that they have gone on to have numerous employees convicted of paedophilia.

            It is known that MI5 ran a brothel in Church Street in Kensington throughout much of the 1950's and early 1960's for the use of visiting dignitaries, 
diplomats and intelligence officers. While for those too important to visit such an establishment certain discreet gentlemen were called upon to 
provide young female or male company directly to the VIP hotel bedroom.

            "At Buckingham Palace, the 16-year-old boy was approached by Sir Peter Hayman, the deputy director of MI6, who was a pedophile.
Hayman asked the boy to work for him in Canada, where he became ambassador.

            Police raised concerns about undue interest of Sir Michael Havers in ‘Playland’ 1975 trial

            "Havers was solicitor general from 1972 to 1974, attorney general in Margaret Thatcher’s government from 1979 to 1987, and briefly Lord Chancellor in 1987. He died five years later.
In 1981, Havers infamously warned Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative backbench MP, against naming Sir Peter Hayman, the UK’s former high commissioner to Canada, as linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which lobbied to legalise sex with children. "

            Two retired police officers had come forward to say that they were banned from investigating Twiss in around 1978 or 1979. His father, the late Sir Frank Twiss, was Black Rod, the Queen’s envoy in the House of Lords, from 1970 to 1978, and a former admiral. Black Rod is responsible for security and ceremonies at the House of Lords.
The police were acting after Sir Cyril Smith, the late Liberal MP, was seen taking an under-age “rent boy” to Twiss’s London home.
When the officers found out whose home it was, they told their bosses that Twiss could be part of a wider racket that supplied under-age boys to VIPs.
But their enquiries were stopped, leaving the officers frustrated. “We assumed it was to protect VIPs,” one said. 
---&gt;
            <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5721973/Pervert-son-former-Black-Rod-quizzed-police-investigating-Westminster-child-sex-abuse-claims.html">

            </a>
            "They say Mr Twiss: Visited Dolphin Square, the private apartment block in Westminster where Establishment figures allegedly had wild parties."
"The MoS was told of the allegations about Twiss by two former vice squad officers. They investigated him after monitoring the ‘Meat Rack,’ a notorious haunt for rent boys in Piccadilly. They saw Smith pick up a youngster and followed him to an address in Cricklewood, North-West London.
When they found out that it was the home of Twiss, they investigated him and uncovered his links to the corridors of power. When they told their superiors, the investigation was abruptly scrapped."
One of them recalled: ‘We went to the police station in Belgravia, and found a file that said Twiss had been banned by his father from entering the Palace of Westminster. He also went to Dolphin Square late at night. We thought he could be procuring boys for bigger figures from pimps at the Meat Rack. Well-to-do people would not want to be seen somewhere like that. We also followed him to the Meat Rack. Our superiors called it off. We assumed it was to protect VIPs.’

             "The late Sir Peter Hayman, who rose to become a senior spy, and Lord Henniker, who died in 2004 and also had a background in intelligence, 
were two peas in a pod, although how far they shared interests remains unclear.
What is known is that the Queen liked them both so much that she awarded each the CVO, an unusual honour in that it is granted by her personally
Henniker provided a sanctuary on his country estate at Thornham Magna in Suffolk to Peter Righton, who supplied boys to paedophile VIPs at 
Dolphin Square and elsewhere.

             </a>
             Peter Righton was a social worker and academic who in 1992 was fined £900 for possession of abusive images of children. He was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange ( member number 51).  He died in 2007 age 81 years. The Secret Life of a Paedophile documentary in 1994 described the life of Peter Righton and associates. He was a prolific author and in 1981 wrote a chapter in Perspectives on Paedophilia (Batsford press) alongside Morris Fraser and Charles Napier (PIE member number 116). This book promoted paedophilia.

             "Mrs Cairns found the vice-chairman of the school governors, Peter Righton, former Director of Education at the National Institute for Social Work, 
had for years openly advocated sex with boys in care.
"Righton and I had sat together on the body which regulated social work training. I researched everything he had published and I felt sick. 
I was devastated by the betrayal of trust, and social work's naivety.
"He got away with this, and influenced social workers to this day, because they feared seeming "homophobic" by challenging him."
It prompted Mrs Cairns to begin confiding secretly with Scotland Yard.
The impasse ended in 1991, when police discovered Rabet's Sussex children's centre was partly financed by convicted child pornographers 
and that he was part of a ring of wealthy, well-connected paedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police also discovered that Righton was a founder member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned for the age of consent to 
be reduced to four."

              Louis Montbatten :
             </p>
             <p>
              Prince Philip's uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten "was particularly attracted to boys in their early teens; it was this characteristic which made him especially vulnerable to the IRA , because he needed to slip away from his personal bodyguards to keep dates with such boys, some of whom came in contact with IRA men.  His vice habit was similar to that of the former British Secret Service Chief , 'Sir' Maurice Oldfield , 
who was appointed ' Ulster (sic) Security Co-Ordinator ' by Margaret Thatcher in the wake of the Mountbatten assassination .
In 1973, Maurice Oldfield became Director-General of MI6. He held the post under Edward Heath, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan before retiring in 1978.
In 1979 the new prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, asked Oldfield to coordinate security and intelligence in Northern Ireland.
He left this post in 1980 after his positive vetting clearance was withdrawn. Apparently this was because he admitted that "from time to time engaged in homosexual activities."
             </p>
             <p>
              “In 1975, Scotland Yard carried out a high-profile child abuse investigation which centred on the Playland amusement arcade near Piccadilly Circus, and involved the sexual exploitation of homeless boys. The investigation led to five convictions in September 1975. Four of the men convicted were ‘nobodies’, but one – Charles Hornby –  was a pillar of the Establishment. He was a  wealthy socialite, a Lloyd’s underwriter, and an old Etonian, “who on occasion had Prince Charles among his dinner guests”.
The four ‘nobodies’ later had their sentences reduced in mysterious circumstances. One of them, David Archer, alleged that Hornby was far from being the only VIP involved in the Playland scandal.
Last night Archer said he would present the police with a dossier naming the ‘millionaires and titled and influential people’ involved in the Playland affair. He added: ‘I believe there was a tremendous cover-up to protect these people.’
A clue as to the identity of one of these ‘titled and influential people’ appeared nearly a decade later with the publication of Philip Ziegler’s biography of Lord Mountbatten.
In 1975, Mountbatten was told that gossip had linked him to a homosexual scandal. He recorded in his diary: “I might have been accused of many things but hardly the act of homosexuality.”

            PIE = Pedophile information Exchange. Was a long time ago, but it was basically (((Their))) first attempt at trying to legalise and normalise pedovileia. Like a Lobby group they gave shitloads of money to Harriet Harmon, her husband Jack Dromey and Patricia Hewitt to represent their interests through changes in the law, like trying to lower the age of consent. The MP's would used the euphemism "special interests", when referring to them publicly (although they didnt use the term exclusively for them)

             the UK and overseas. He was a founder of the Azimuth Trust charity which sent young boys on sailing holidays as a front for a paedophile ring. 
He was also one of eight men charged in New York as part of an organised abuse network.
            </p>
            <pre><code>Fraser worked as a child psychiatrist in Belfast at a time when a paedophile ring was abusing children in care at Kincora Boys’ Home and other

            <p>

             "HAUPPAUGE, L.I., May 3—Eight men, including a former organizer for Big Brothers of New York and a noted child psychiatrist from Northern Ireland, 
were indicted today in connection with what was described as an “international homosexual ring,” that operated out of Suffolk County.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saverio J. Fierro, assistant district attorney in charge of the rackets bureau, said that a two-year investigation determined that between January, 
1970, and Dec. 31, 1971, the ring supplied boys as young as 10 years old as part of a “club” operating out of the West Islip shorefront house 
of one of the suspects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Fierro said that among the alleged conspirators indicted was Dr. Morris Fraser, a psychiatrist from the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick 
Children who was prominently featured last October in an N.B.C. Reports documentary, “Suffer the Little Children,” on the effects violence in 
Northern Ireland had had on children there.
Another indicted was Hal Oelke, 48 years old, 335 East 51st Street, Manhattan, who Mr. Fierro described as a former employe of Big. Brothers, 
an organization that provides volunteer companions for boys without fathers.
Robert, Patterson, assistant director of Big Brothers of New York, said that Mr. Oelke had worked for the group “in charge of group recreational 
activities,” but that he had “no direct contact with any children” during his employment.
Mr. Fierro said that other links with the Big Brother organization were “still actively under investigation,” including possible fraudulent use of 
the group's name by members of the homosexual ring to attract children and reassure parents.
Dr. Fraser arrived here today from Northern Ireland after having been informed of the indictment. He was arraigned before County Court 
Judge Pierre J. Lundberg, pleaded not guilty and was released on his own recognizance. He is expected to return to his native country pending trial.
 Mr. Oelke also pleaded not guilty and was freed on $2,000 bond.
            </p>
            <p>
             About 15 boys, ranging in age from 10 to 15 years old were were known to have been used by members of the ring, Mr. Fierro said. Some, he said, 
were from “deprived” areas.
Though the boys apparently were not paid, other than with “candy and pens,” Mr. Fierro added, there seemed to have been no attempt to restrain them
 or keep teem from going home. Some of the boys may have been brought in more than once by the ring and one, a 10-year-old, was allegedly taken from 
Puerto Rico to Long Island and then returned to Puerto Rico.
All eight men were indicted on 27 counts of conspiracy; sodomy and sexual abuse. Three were allegedly members of another homosexual ring broken up 
last year by Nassau District Attorney William Cahn, but neither Dr. Fraser nor Mr. Oelke had been implicated before.
            </p>
            <p>
             Three are fugitives from, justice, including Leslie McGaw, an English instructor at Sheridan College in Brampton, Ontario, who is reportedly 
being sought by Interpol in Central Europe. Another, Charles Slavin, charged with actually bringing the 10-year-old boy from Puerto Rico, was 
arrested today in San Juan but refused to waive extradition and was freed on $10,000 bond pending an extradition hearing.
Mr. Fierro said that the indictments allege 19 different occasions when individual members of the “club,” which even boasted a regular newsletter, 
would meet at the home of George.Grehm, 50, in West Islip where two boats were tied up to a dock, to engage in “acts of sexual abuse with young children.”
In 1972 Brehm began serving a one-to-10-year sentence in Auburn State Prison in connection with another ring in which he pleaded guilty to being a member. 
Brehm pleaded not guilty in his arraignment today and was remanded to Auburn.
It was not clear how the members of the ring became acquainted nor precisely how it operated.
The others Indicted were identified as George Rossman, 58, of 20 Autumn Street, New Haven, who described himself, as dean of the Ecumenical 
Continuing Educational Center of New Haven; Angelo Riviezzo, 42, of 95.24 85th Street, Ozone Park, Queens, a chemist; and Ron Ramos, 25, of San Juan, 
who is being sought."
