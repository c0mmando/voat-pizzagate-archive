            In EWS, Domino was the name of the prostitute that propositions Bill on the street.  Here is info  on the masks in EWS from alt.movies.Kubrick  you can find endless mask talk searching kubrick usenet group.

            Here is Info from a poster there:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The mask worn by the Mysterious Woman could well be:
THE TEMPTRESS
Another popular tradition is this "volto" or half mask, which some think
the most seductive of all. Her sleek black bird feathers will tempt the
most resistant to give way to her charms.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mask worn by the men who take the Mysterious Woman away, on the
balcony:
IL DOTTORE (The Doctor)
This doctor's mask with its phallic beak will fascinate and frighten all
who behold it. In history's blackest plague times, it was one of the few
protections a doctor had against the noxious fumes from his patients.
           </p>
           <p>
            Masks will always be the signature of il Carnevale di Venezia. Said to
originate from a victory over Ulrico, the
patriach of Aquileia, in the year 1162. The new Repubblica della
Serenissima (later "Venezia") celebrated its
independence with drinking and dancing in San Marco square. By 1436,
maskmakers or mascareri were officially recognized by their own guild.
By the 17th and 18th Century, the mask became the best way to shed
convention and duke and beggar alike joined in the public festivities.
It all began on Boxing Day, December 26th and reached its climax on
Shrove Tuesday, the day before Lent.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first edict to regulate mask wearing was passed in 1268, and
Napoleon's troops temporarily ended the
revelry with an end to the Republic in 1797. The wearing was strictly
prohibited during religious ceremonies such as "circumcision" and
"purification of the Virgin." "Sensa" or Ascension Day marking the
marriage of the city to the sea encouraged the practice or the period
from October 5th to Decemer 16th when the "domino" was worn and the
Doges held numerous official ceremonies. Since 1978, the art of
maskmaking in Venice has achieved a great comeback, with many students
of the Academy of Fine Arts opening shop to promote the craft.
           </p>
           <p>
            A time for all class barriers to come down, the carnival was a mixture
of drinking, public insults, street theatre, more drinking and masked
balls. With the rich and powerful mixing so closely with the lower
classes, the use of masks was of the greatest to keep peoples identities
unknown. The practice of wearing masks for disguise reached its zenith
in the 18th Century, when Venetians of different social classes used
Carnival as an excuse to mingle and, in some cases, to trade sexual
favors without fear of recognition or retribution. (With a mask, a silk
hood, a tabarro cape and a tricorn hat, a housewife in search of
hanky-panky was indistinguishable from a nobleman on the prowl.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The most common was the Bautta, a half mask worn with black cape and
black tricorn hat or, for the rowdier members of society, Punchinella
masks and hats (the masks and outrageous behavior coming directly from
the Commedia Dell'arte). The first of these two disguises was popular
due to it being available to only the most wealthy, outside carnival
period - the second's popularity coming from the associated vulgarity
and wildness that Punchinella troupes would be allowed to display. The
balls would take place in the various Venetian piazzas and would involve
meals of imported delicacies, dancing and entertainment by jugglers,
acrobats, etc.. as well a feats of strength or daring, performed by
young men, and usually resulting in being plunged into the freezing
waters of the canal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Venice Carnival masks fall into several categories:
- Commedia dell'Arte masks are based on traditional characters like
Harlequin and Pierrot.
- Fantasy masks are figments of the maskmaker's imagination, although
they may be inspired by historical designs.
- Traditional Venetian masks such as the white volto half-mask with nose
cover and its variant, the "plague doctor's" mask with its phallic beak.
(According to tradition, the beak was intended to protect the wearer
from being infected by the plague.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Today's Venetian masks serve two functions: as vehicles for
self-expression and self-display during Carnevale, and as souvenirs or
craft objects to take home as souvenirs of a Venetian trip. Masks are
easy to obtain in Venice. Street vendors sell them (especially at
Carnival time), and you can buy anything from mass-produced paper or
ceramic miniatures to handcrafted papier-māché and leather masks by
skilled artisans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Masks virtually disappeared--along with Carnevale--when Napoleon's
troops brought an end to the Venetian Republic in 1797. However, they've
staged a spectacular comeback since a group of former Academy of Fine
Arts students opened Venice's first modern mask shop in 1978.

            My point wasn't that it doesn't mean domination. My point is that it has a dual meaning.

            People who abuse children often film it and I bet they wear masks while they are doing their pedo BDSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it's just a hunch, but I'm willing to bet that who participate in Luciferian rituals also wear masks of varying kinds.

            but notice the statues in the back are of that monkey that's on the heavy breathing website - the satanic band that plays at comet.  what is the deal with that monkey?  on heavy breathing there's a child that slowly changes into a monkey.

             IMO they are basically saying that human children are just animals: dehumanizing children into objects for their perversion. As evidenced by Majestic Ape's saying, "I had to euthanize that shit!" and referring to her baby as "it".
Also I am pretty sure that the term "Majestic Ape" was first coined by an atheist philosopher to mean "humans" but I can't find it immediately in a quick DDG search and I don't have time to dig for it.

               Ohhhh.  Makes sense.  I don't know why I never made the ape connection with majestic ape- duh!  Through all of the research I've been doing since at least mid October, I've definitely run across the ape connection several times - ok menus, album covers, instagram posts etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did you notice that majestic ape slowly deliberately pronounced euthanasia as if to say YOUTH in ASIA?  I think she repeated it to get her point across.  She was talking about killing the baby because it cried - euthanasia, but then she said it slow and clear and in perfect syllables YOUTH IN ASIA.  These people are sick
