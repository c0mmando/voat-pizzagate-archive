<p>The second part is the Trump question. Is trump a false hope/comtrolled opposition candidate? That would mean that he is put in place to fool the awakened into thinking they have a white hat on the inside fighting for them. All the while, he carries out the agenda of the deep state.</p>
<p>The case against Trump.</p>
<p>1) Trump was at Epsteins Island. This is known by all in here so I will not source that fact. But the only reason anybody thinks this does not count is because an anonymous &quot;insider&quot; Iinsist that Trump was there but did nothing. For most, this is accepted. But some of us think this is not likely.</p>
<p>2) Trump insisted on bringing Comey back instead of replacing him. <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/01/24/trump-will-keep-james-comey-as-head-of-fbi/">http://nypost.com/2017/01/24/trump-will-keep-james-comey-as-head-of-fbi/</a> <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/01/24/trump-will-keep-james-comey-as-head-of-fbi/">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Trump even was quoted as saying that he “loves him” and called him a “great guy,”  
</p>
<p>But Trump earlier had acknowledged in a tweet that Comey has sabotaged the Hillary investigation and was a criminal. &quot;FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem&quot;</p>
<p>And &quot;The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>Why would Trump insist on bring back Comey when he knew he was a crook known for covering up Deep state crimes?</p>
<p>3) Trump is a long time friend of the Clintons and expressed his love for Bill and Hillary   <a href="https://youtu.be/x95eBykVl8Q">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Laster Trump says she should be in jail, and if he wins he will asssign a special prosecuter to investigate her crimes.  <a href="https://youtu.be/WtlFQ4JLzWk">Title Here</a></p>
<p>After elected, Trump says the Clintons are good hard working people and he doesn\'t want to hurt them.  And of course, he never did anything.  <a href="https://youtu.be/qPK7uStv6zA">Title Here</a>   
</p>
<p>4) Trump is good friends with Larry Silverstein, the owner of the world trade center at the time of 9/11. Silverstein is considered a 9/11 criminal to the truth community, but Trump backs the Deep State criminal and says he was the first person he called after 9/11.  Forward to :54 <a href="https://youtu.be/3m_JTSip6dY">Title Here</a></p>
<p>5) Trump insisted he saw Muslims celebrating the destruction of the WTC, but we know they were dancing Israelis who were Mossad agents, not Muslims. Clearly he is delivering a limited hangout and deflecting guilt from Israel to Muslims.</p>
<p>Trumps claim-<a href="https://youtu.be/PpXUgdwhr4c">Title Here</a></p>
<p>The real story- <a href="https://youtu.be/tRfhUezbKLw">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Here is the Mossad dancing Israelis moving van that was reported.  <a href="http://whale.to/c/911truck76xfxfx.jpg">Title Here</a></p>
<p>It is obvious that Trump is selling the official narrative lies that Muslim terrorist did 9/11 and not the CIA, Mossad, and American establishment.  
</p>
<p>6) Trump and Pence sacked Flynn, and the only reason we have been told is because Fly went above Pence head and got info on elite pedos from Russia, and one of them was a good friend of Pence. Does it not sound more like they saced Flynn to cover this back up? Flynn\'s son speaks up about the ring, but Trump and Pence not a word. </p>
<p>7) Trump is constantly flashing the esoteric hand signs, be it Satanic or Masonic. <a href="http://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6P4-wotPf6evS0CmmH2MEgEsCu&amp;pid=15.1">Title Here</a></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.images.dailystar.co.uk/dynamic/1/photos/966000/Donald-Trump-677966.jpg">Title Here</a></p>
<p>8) Trump is being portrayed as an outsider, yet this is absurd.</p>
<p>He was on Epsteins Island.</p>
<p>He is a NY elite bussinesman tied to the Clintons.</p>
<p>He was heavily involved with the TV industry and had his own shows, Owned televised beauty pagents and has small rolls in films. </p>
<p>He was even a character in the WWE.</p>
<p>Trump is friends with two suspected 9/11 criminals Rudi Giuliani and Larry Silverstein.</p>
<p>9) Trumps backers are littered with Israeli zionist Israeli bankers.  <a href="https://youtu.be/Vcd-yvudYSg">Title Here</a></p>
<p>Does this sound like an outsider to you?</p>
<p>In conclusion, Trump is an elite NY businessman, involved with TV and the big screen who is friends with prominent Deep State criminals, pedophiles,  Clintons, Heavily involved in the entertainment industry, spreads lies about 9/11 that protect Israelis involvement, flashes satanic and masonic hand signs, sacks Flynn for possibly securing a list of elite pedophiles without permission, promisses to go after Hillary and doesn\'t, made it clear he wanted to bring back Comey as FBI director, unleashes a slew of arrest of pimps prosittutes and low level child trafickers, but no PG arrest.</p>

            The "insider" who promised a PG investigation once Sessions came was obviously lying.  There is no PG investigation because there is no evidence of any crimes involving Podesta or Alefantis.
           </p>

            Can anyone put together what would justify a warrant in this case?   If you can't do that there is no case.

            OP is a total idiot.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Trump kicked Epstein out of his resort and banned him for life when he found out everything.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              That Trump kept Comey on board is also consistent with (a) Trump having leverage over Comey and so choosing him for strategic reasons, or (b) Comey now wants to take down the Clintons after the previous DOJ fucked him, or (c) any of infinitely many other possibilities. We simply don't know (yet).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Trump was friends with many people as a private businessman. In fact his surrogates likely donated to the Clinton Foundation at some point or other, along with many other foundations and orgs, as part of real estate deals.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The rest is either demonstrably false, inscrutable, or has no bearing on the question of whether Trump's team is going after human traffickers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most importantly, there IS direct evidence that they are going after the traffickers -- they just signed an anti-trafficking order and nearly 2,000 traffickers have been arrested since January. That's more than any other administration in a similar time frames.
           </p>
           <p>
            OP you are not sincerely trying to critique Trump, you are spreading oversimplistic assumptions and falsehoods.

             OP is a shill.  He's going around Voat trying to discredit everything.  Pretending to be apart of it but then switching sides and urging people to join him.  Typical bs.

            I am for bringing down the ring, and i am questioning if that is what this Potus is doing, or if we are fooled. If he is part of the coverup, F him to hell with the rest. I am not even saying I am sure, but I want to see more critical thinking about this. Trump has done nothing but dance. What is the holdup? I am not even mad that you doubt my intentions for this thread. Good, that ,means you have contempt for anybody trying to lead the investigation or focus astray. Good man. You just happen to be wrong about why I made this thread.

            Booze and anti-depressants can't block the feeling of one's country getting flushed down the toilet. More and more people are waking up everyday. The current trickle will turn into a flood of rage the likes of which haven't been seen since the Civil War. Change will come whether they like it or not.

            I always thought the detail about him going to Epstein's dinner parties but eating with the butler in the kitchen rather than with the rest of the guests as kind of funny. Seems like any at the top are swimming in the same pool as people like Epstein, so thinking he defs would know and hope he ran to do something about it. Can't see why a already wealthy person would want the job in his golden years otherwise unless of course he's some sort illumanati grand deception anti-christ. But, yeah, hoping for the first option rather than the latter. Plus, I didn't even vote for him, but it's pretty hard not to enjoy watching him make the establishment step into its own steaming pile of hypocrisy in their attempts to demonize and oust him. So not sure what the awareness of him being "in on it" does for this effort if he is indeed in on it. Way better off than if it were H-Rod since then there really wouldn't be a shot in hell this ever got uncovered.

            Trump's the good guy, I just know it. Even before I got heavily red pilled by pizzagate, my gut instinct was telling me to support this guy amongst the media witch hunt. The Clintons, Deepstate, Rothchild's etc represent the true evil in this world, there HAS to be some good to level out the playing field, right? If not then we are all well and truly fucked

             Because of how the media and establishment reacted to Trump.  Also, Jones was introduced to a lot of people who knew Trump and he talked to Trump and found out he is on the same side against the globalists.  I was also skeptical of Trump in the beginning thinking he was going to just let Hillary win.

            LOL, no OP.. you have always been cool with me. and btw Trump never went to Epstein's Island. The one and only encounter was in Palm Beach at some party and Trump walked in and saw some naked younger girls and left immediately and then bared Epstein from Mar-A Lago.

            I think Trump is just a bad judge of character. It's also possible he kept Comey to drag him in front of the public to clear his name and to justify firing him so he can install someone who will give him the Clinton files imo.

Trump banned Epstiein from Mar a Lago for trying to recruit one of his employees.

            Gowdy is talking about pursuing child sex traffickers specifically recently so something seems to be happening. Definitely not nearly as fast as we would like but it's not like something as big as this is getting can be taken down at once anyway so patience is definitely a virtue. With how ugly the press has covered and his tweet about perverts I don't think he's compromised in the pg way.  Financially he may be but that doesn't have the same moral ceiling as raping and murdering children imo

            An interesting post and it may be possible...anything is possible at this point.  However, would you rather see clinton as president?  What would be the scenario for that....nothing whatsoever about pgate?

            One of the facts that show the pizzagate biased reasoning is the complete ignoration of Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one photoshopped pictures like this together:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Added in facts like his connection with Epstein, his comments about his daughter, his multiple rape allegations etc. and accused him of anything. Instead he was seen like a pizzagate savior. Even tough he fired Flynn's son for tweeting about pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shows your double standard, and the fact that your evidence sucks, because if any of those things could be said about Alefantis or Podesta, they would have been used as evidence. Matter of fact, if tomorrow it was revealed that Podesta walked into some dressing room while girls some as young as 15 were changing to look at them and even bragged about it(like Trump did with the beauty pageant) pizzagaters would completely loose their shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is entirely built on lies, speculation and confirmation bias while there being zero evidence of a crime. Each one of it's arguments are based on flawed reasoning. It's a textbook insane conspiracy theory.

                No I've never said that. I said that the the pizzagate conspiracy theory is fictitious, not that there aren't elite politicians that are pedophiles. Why do you people use such dishonest tactics?

             Those pictures are normal. Why do you only mention Alefantis and Pedosta what about all the other pedophile fucks? Do you need any more than the Franklin scandal or Dutroux affair to have a clue that this stuff happens and gets swept away? You are a textbook shill nobody puts as much effort as you are into disproving something they believe not to be true any reasonable person would move along. YouIzDumbAsFuck2

             You're accurate on OP. Devil's advocate; spreading disinformation. I've monitored posting behavior of OP (content wise) for some time (I build mental profiles of more active posters based on their posted content and attitude towards it, in regards to alignment) and established your sentiment before already. What's being said in this thread confirms my assessment. It's now signal and no longer noise.

              If I had money I'd bet that Trump keeps his FRIENDS close and his ENEMIES closer... He's no fool, as well as I don't think he shows his cards to anyone.  To underestimate his tenacity of reading people, has been the downfall of many. When he said that he didn't believe in giving Isis advance warning I thought that there was a whole lot more there, than meets the eye. Just an observation for what it's worth! You may be SPOT ON as well...

            Trump being at Epsteins Island on one occassion does not make him guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            He will be guilty however if after seeing the horrific things going on at Epsteins Island during first visit and then choosed to re-visit and re-visit manay times over like Bill Clinton who visited 20 times.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no evidence that Trump visited Epsteins Island more than the said first visit.

             You know that there's no evidence that Clinton traveled to Epstein's island? The flight logs used as evidence that show Clinton flew more than 26 times in Epstein's plane, show him flying to a number of different countries but not his island.

              That's 26 times on Lolita Express in TWO years -an average of once a month. I don't see my BFF once a month and she lives an hour away. Epstein &amp; Bill must be super tight. Also, one of those trips was to Asia without a single secret service agent. Totally legit for a former President of the United States to travel to ASIA without secret service. ;) I hope you get paid...you fucking asshole.

              I always thought the detail about him going to Epstein's dinner parties but eating with the butler in the kitchen rather than the rest of the guests was kind of funny. Seems like any at the top were swimming in the same pool with people like Epstein, so thinking he defs would know and hope he ran to do something about it. Can't see a already wealthy person would want the job in his golden years unless of course he's some sort illumanati grand deception anti-christ. But, yeah, not hoping for the latter. Plus, I didn't even vote for him, but it's pretty hard not to enjoy watching him make the establishment step into its own steaming pile of hypocrisy in their attempts to demonize and oust him. So not sure what the awareness of him being "in on it" does for this effort if he is indeed in on it. Way better off than if were H-rod since then there really wouldn't be a shot in hell this ever gets uncovered.

               Paramount was a partnership between Zampolli (ran ID modeling agency, implicated in some pretty weird shit) and Trump to hire old models to market expensive Trump apartments.

                I've looked through a lot of this before. Lots of this info has been published here too. That's why I didn't get all the vitriol about wikileaks only publishing about HRC. His dirt has been out there for awhile. There's multiple books detailing it, which is why it said something about america's own opinion about its gov. I'm not holding my breath, but still hoping that his seemingly reactive nature might be influenced by the public, if that is, the public ever gives up its fetish with russia.

              So you are going to take some unknown butler's word? Trump is a born-again Christian and doesn't drink. I'm sure he's out banging kids. And his wife isn't "mail order." She can speak 5 languages, can you? And how many sexual harassment claims have even been close to true or proven. ZERO.

            As much as I like Trump (and let's face it, better to gamble with an unknown pedo affiliate than a verified one), I will always remain skeptical. The only thing that keeps my hopes up is his speech at the Red Dinner. The reactions from the guests and the booing from many (particularly the news though) made it really seem like he is not with them. Particularly when he made the Haiti comment: "Everyone knows of course, Hillary's belief that it takes a village, which only makes sense after all in places like Haiti...where she's taken a number of them "

            An obvious reference to the haitian sex trafficking. I also want to point out that there has been an increased number of pedophile busts. So there is some hope with that as well. I still wish to see more high profile cases being busted, and I definitely want pizzagate exposed. 
Sex trafficking increasing dramatically:

             Wait. Could Trump have also meant "taken" in that speech as in "conned" or "taken" for their money? Could it also be a double meaning? Hmm...

            Here's the problem. For your average decent minded person, there is or was simply no other alternative than to throw support behind him and hope for the best. There is some merit to some of your points, but it's still very premature to suggest Trump is playing for the other side. No one really knows what's going on, especially behind the scenes. It's fine to speculate, as long as everyone agrees that it's speculation, and there is no net benefit from relinquishing full support for Trump at this time.

             I wanted him  to win because i want Hillary defeated first and formost, but I have been on the fence since day one on whether this is real or not. Even to this moment, I am suspicious but parts of this look very convincing. I am becoming more and more doubtful. I admit I don't know.

            <p>
             I think that depends on what you mean by "full support".  Trump has my support insofar as he the president of our nation and he should be given the chance to do the job.  And yes, unfortunately he is our best and only shot right now.  However, if we are going to pretend that Trump is so great that he's beyond being investigated, then we might as well start fabricating stories to publish on undergroundnewsreport.com and then all meet up for a giant circle j... you get the point.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the sake of pizzagate, I want Trump to succeed as much as anyone, but just remember this: anytime you idolize someone you leave yourself open to being manipulated.

             We may not be Hollywood stars like Trump is, but as he would say, we need to be ready to grab this nationwide epidemic by the pussy.

            Trump has already held a meeting about trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has been an uptick in the focus on trafficking by law enforcement
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump has a lot of other things on his plate besides this (big pharma takeover of society is one that I can think of)
           </p>
           <p>
            He can't do the investigation himself . 
Note how  his executive orders go un-enforced.   Something else is going on.  FBI's James Comey, among others are getting in the way.

            This recent voat post, though apparently a false flag for a release, may hold some other truths

             The only hope outside Trump is...us. That might be why they want us waiting for a hero to take care of it. Waiting and waiting. I don''t know.We can agree that nobody is going to get bored and drop this. But it is taking way too long IMO. Unless there is a secret investigation as we speak, but there is so much info to work with I have to wonder what the holdup is.

             It could be argued that the human trafficking upticks are more focused on the lower-levels and "gatekept" to continue protecting the elites and their supply chains, aware that we're watching and trying to keep us placated.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, my more optimistic hope is that Trump will be willing to roll the dice to save America from the pedo scum and blackmailers, whatever his past may hold.

              Trump and Gowdy are our best bet. However, they can't do it alone and need 'loose' cooperation from other good folks in the power structure. A big unseen battle is going which surfaces partially through the public hearings that practically no MSM reports on. I've been following these for a large part.

             I have heard this angle, and it is plausable. This anti Trump thing may be the biggest psyop in history. Maybe.

              This "anti trump" thing is part of the political cycle. There's protests all over the world everytime a new leader is installed...

               Yes, the globalist are losing elections and they are losing their shi#. But I have to wonder if Trump is reallly their enemy, or a divice to create the chaos they want to bring order out of. With every day that passes with no arrest, search warrants or even a mention of PG, it is getting more and more suspcious.
