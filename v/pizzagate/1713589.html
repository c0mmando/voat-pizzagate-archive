<li>A report is compiled of the situation and sent to Hillary, along with photographic and video evidence of what was occurring. Still nothing is done apparently. They said the problem had been solved. However, this company still have government security contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Problems included:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to many guards, another situation in which Embassy security may have been compromised is when, on at least one occasion, supervisors brought prostitutes in to Camp Sullivan**. This is a breach of security and discipline made worse because the prostitutes were escorted to the facility by some guard force supervisors themselves. Some interviewees recalled that two AGNA guard force supervisors made no secret that, to celebrate a birthday, they . brought prostitutes into Camp Sullivan, which maintains a sign-in log. Women believed to be prostitutes were observed attending the birthday party&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numerous emails, photographs, and videos portray a Lord of the Flies environment. One email from a current guard describes scenes in which guards and supervisors are &quot;peeing on people, eating potato chips out of [buttock] cracks, vodka shots out of [buttock] cracks (there is video of that one), broken doors after drnken [sic] brawls, threats and intimidation from those leaders participating in this activity....&quot; (Attachment 2) Photograph after photograph shows guards—including supervisors--at parties in various stages of nudity, sometimes fondling each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>those who declined to participate often ridiculed, humiliated, demoted, or even fired</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some guards have reported barricading themselves in their rooms for fear that those carrying out the hazing will harm them physically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a guard force supervisor and four others entered a dining facility on August 1, 2009, wearing only short underwear and brandishing bottles of alcohol. Upon leaving the facility, the guard force supervisor allegedly grabbed the Afghan national by the face and began abusing him with foul language, saying, &quot;You are very good for fXXXing.&quot; The Afghan national reported that he &quot;was too afraid of them I could not tell them any thing.&quot;</p>
</li>

G4S which was previously known as Wackenhutt corporation tied to Orlando Shooter, Omar Mateen. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, who worked at G4S from 2007 until his death, committed the largest mass shooting in United States history. Though Mateen\'s employment as an armed guard only slightly facilitated his access to firearms, and the firearms refresher courses he took each four years at G4S suggested more substantial training on his own,[18][19] the company\'s inability to detect prior warning signals brought it under widespread scrutiny.</p>

           G4S which was previously known as Wackenhutt corporation tied to Orlando Shooter, Omar Mateen. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, who worked at G4S from 2007 until his death, committed the largest mass shooting in United States history. Though Mateen's employment as an armed guard only slightly facilitated his access to firearms, and the firearms refresher courses he took each four years at G4S suggested more substantial training on his own,[18][19] the company's inability to detect prior warning signals brought it under widespread scrutiny.
