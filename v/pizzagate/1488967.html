Yet as in the case of jimmycomet\'s Instagram, Podesta\'s emails, and the social media accounts of other associates, there is some highly troubling content that raises many questions.

And it seems that there may be some more support for some of the pedophile &quot;code words&quot; that have been mentioned. </p>
<p>Next, the NY Times once wrote an article on Jimmycomet friend &quot;Miss Summer Camp&quot; AND some more troubling Instagram posts from people associated with Summer Camp</p>
<p>-- First, the NY Times published an article on Ms Summer Camp, real name Shea Van Horn, in 2010, profiling him for his work as a deejay and a female impersonator (&quot;MSC&quot; appears in at least one &quot;jimmycomet&quot; Instagram photo - below):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/fashion/04Washington.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/fashion/04Washington.html</a>
<a href="http://archive.is/WIs15">http://archive.is/WIs15</a></p>
<p>Many people here have probably seen the jimmycomet Instagram photo which shows Ms Summer Camp on the floor of Comet Ping Pong, identified as from Halloween 2015. MSC is covered with fake blood and wearing an evening gown. &quot;Jimmycomet&quot; comments, &quot;Sex.&quot; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9loiojrHqO/">https://www.instagram.com/p/9loiojrHqO/</a></p>
<p>Other photos from MSC\'s account appear to show why he was wearing this costume. MSC was participating in a D.C. event called the &quot;Miss Adams Morgan Pageant&quot; held at the Washington Hilton. Here is how Brightest Young Things describes &quot;MAMP&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The pageant actively discourages publicity (I face a threat of a stiletto to the back of the head just in posting this). In the past, a media blackout was employed to protect the powerful lobbyists, congressional staffers and occasional elected officials who don dresses for a night. These days, its employed more for kitschy fun.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/a-very-gay-columbus-day">https://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/a-very-gay-columbus-day</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the photos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSC\'s costume is &quot;Miss Planned Parenthood.&quot; Besides wearing an evening gown and tiara, he also has on a mask of a crying baby\'s face. MSC has some fake blood on himself, and most disturbing of all, carries a plastic see-through purse containing what is supposed to look like a bloodied, late-term aborted baby. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9tYXi-LHsX/">https://www.instagram.com/p/9tYXi-LHsX/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;MsSummerCamp\'s&quot; Instagram account is currently public, and as with Jimmycomet\'s, there are on it some troubling posts and comments. One that stands out in particular is of a credit card ad which contains the picture of a young boy seeming to enjoy eating watermelon very much. The ad\'s caption says: &quot;Tasting summer in a bite: Priceless (R). With your MasterCard, you are welcome all over Greece, in supermarkets, fruit markets and grocery stores.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misssummercamp writes: &quot;Saw this while I was in Greece. &quot;Priceless&quot; isn\'t the word most people use upon tasting me. #Greece&quot;</p>
<p>And there\'s also this comment: &quot;be_rettsea I think it\'s an error in translation? Should have been &quot;you shouldn\'t have to pay to taste something like this.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7pqfafLHsk/">https://www.instagram.com/p/7pqfafLHsk/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking a further look at some of be_rettsea\'s Instagram photos, there are several that are troubling. One of his Instagram photos identifies him as Brett Andriesen, a Department of Health and Human Services employee. He also co-hosted a gay-themed weekly dance party called CTRL at a D.C. bar, which was written about in &quot;Brightest Young Things&quot;:</p>

<p>Another commenter on the above-mentioned jimmcomet\'s photo of MsSummerCamp is &quot;JaxKnifeComplex.&quot; Jax is also a female impersonator. Here\'s one photo from Jax\'s Instagram, which has been deleted:</p>

<p>Another Instagram user who commented on the &quot;10 holes&quot; post by berett_sea goes by the name &quot;PizzaF------Party.&quot; He does use the actual profanity. I\'m going to refer to this account name as &quot;PFP.&quot; </p>

<p>PFP takes a photo of himself next to a &quot;Baby Doll Pizza&quot; truck (it\'s a pizzeria located in Portland, OR).

<p>Andrewbrischler is another associated account. He has an artist\'s studio, and in one picture he is holding a very young boy who seems to be crying, while Andrewbrischler is smiling (it is of course entirely possible the child is his nephew but some things about the photo and comments are still troubling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>andrewbrischler Uncle Andrew had a very special studio visitor yesterday.

<p>Then there are photos from two different accounts of two similar birthday cakes which have on top the heads of boys, and which are &quot;bloodied&quot; to represent birth:</p>
<p>First, one to Shea Van Horn/Mssummercamp:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/3a1iv">http://archive.is/3a1iv</a></p>
<p>Then there is one on the account of &quot;metalhair.&quot; (I can\'t quite find this account\'s connection, but will post when I do). This cake photo is far more graphic than the other, including more blood, and anatomical features of a woman giving birth, as well as depicting her anus and feces:</p>

           Next, the NY Times once wrote an article on Jimmycomet friend "Miss Summer Camp" AND some more troubling Instagram posts from people associated with Summer Camp
          </p>
          <p>
           -- First, the NY Times published an article on Ms Summer Camp, real name Shea Van Horn, in 2010, profiling him for his work as a deejay and a female impersonator ("MSC" appears in at least one "jimmycomet" Instagram photo - below):

           Another commenter on the above-mentioned jimmcomet's photo of MsSummerCamp is "JaxKnifeComplex." Jax is also a female impersonator. Here's one photo from Jax's Instagram, which has been deleted:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Jax and another female impersonator stand with a toddler, who appears dazed or unhappy. Jax holds the child in one arm and a rifle with the other.

           Then there are photos from two different accounts of two similar birthday cakes which have on top the heads of boys, and which are "bloodied" to represent birth:
          </p>

           First, one to Shea Van Horn/Mssummercamp:

          <p>
           Then there is one on the account of "metalhair." (I can't quite find this account's connection, but will post when I do). This cake photo is far more graphic than the other, including more blood, and anatomical features of a woman giving birth, as well as depicting her anus and feces:

            Also note the handle of one of the commenters: pizzafuckingparty... Not to be confused with fuckingpizzaparty. The former clearly implies that it's a party about fucking pizzas... Would be worth investigating his instagram account too.

            Posts like this basically seal the deal for me that those journalists at the NY Times must feel really shitty because here they spent all this huge amount of money to go to school to be a journalist, and they are being outdone but a bunch of nobodies like us. Not unless Milo (which if you are here Hiiii Milo I love you!), or Alex Jones or any of these other people are here and we just don't know it, none of us are anything special or have these big fancy journalism degrees, we're just regular boots on the street, doing a better job than the New York Times or any of these "news sources".

            Good job investigating!  And thanks for describing the images, to warn us before looking at them.  One thing that really bugs me a lot, is so many pictures we've seen during this whole thing was uncovered, is so many of the children having bags under their eyes.  Either from lots and lots of crying, or getting very little sleep.  So sad and frustrating to see.

            I haven't had time to look at that account, but it sounds like it. Whether or not it's connected at all to people in the social circle we're looking at (centered on D.C.), I don't know, but there is no doubt many people across the country and world like that.

            I also didn't have time to get into all the Satanic imagery I came across in these accounts. there was plenty of it.

              I noticed how factory came up in both places, but "factory" is sort of a popular name in artist and intellectual circles. But there's always the possibility that there could be a connection there. Something for us to look into.

            Summer Camp is known to be a place where kids get molested. My mother refused to send me. These pervs...even the Miss Planned Parenthood- plastic purses from the 50's were a perversion item, perverts fetishizing them. The sickness is thick and deep and old; containing all the perversions anyone could think of. I've been keeping it to myself, but for years I worked with gay men in a professional office setting, for 30 years. This is not new, they always tried to outdo, out-gross each other. They ALWAYS joked about almost everything we've discovered. Down deep there seemed to be a hatred of children, women, family life. And they always talked about young boys. I grew to resent them, because young intern men advanced very fast in the profession. They went for long lunches, business trips. You get me? The younger they looked, the better.

             I have never had such a negative experience with gay men, but I respect your experience.  I would only ask, just like any group, some are awful and some are good, hardworking people.  Don't generalize so much you paint with too broad a brush.

             I too have noticed this connection, not in my own life but in PG. Seems like most pedos are gay, and most gays are not pedos, sort of thing.

             i know gay men who are NOTHING like that. lumping large groups of people into the pedo category is not helping anyone.

              This. I have a sibling that is gay and been asking him about some of these things and he said sadly that it is a part of the culture that it's just like with heterosexual relationships. It may take you a long time to date and meet and find an actual decent guy, but a lot of the men are just assholes or worse. More often than not, the gay men are much worse, and if you find a decent guy, you don't let him go for anything.

              I did see that, but after looking at about 50+ photos, I don't see anything that seems like it's referencing pedophilia. And as we know, pizza seems to be used also to talk about adult sex. There were photos on and related to the jimmycomet account that suggest that, and that's come up in other places too. The context is important, including if the photo also brings up children or the pizza reference is on an account that has seemed to reference pedophilia.

             Well, I don't know. The account certainly is dark, but so far I think the physical location is wrong, for one thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             And just for people who don't click on your link, it actually says "Timmy's Organism." I don't see "Timmy's down." do you see that anywhere on this page?
            </p>
            <p>
             Timmy is also such a common name.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it couldn't hurt to see if there might be social connections between this account and others connected to Jimmycomment, Mssummercamp, or anyone else who is connected to those accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
             How did you come across that?

              Just typed in timmysdown + instagram.  That was first entry.  It might not be a lead, as you are right..he appears to be in Detroit.  BUT...I will be checking out all names affilliated with pages you just posted.

               I just looked through about 50 photos and they are on the dark side, but I didn't see any that seemed to reference children, at least to this point. There is one pizza photo, but in and of itself, neither that photo or the comments seems to be referencing pedophilia either. Could you link to some examples?

             They have completely dehumanized people to the level of objects. 
This is THE MINDSET of psychopaths. Its how they keep sanity despite their actions.

              Not really, most drag queens are keen to have sex with bodybuilders or big guys with beards.  This pedo focus in the elite is beyond the pale for mainstream gay culture as well

               I really hope so.  Because since pizzagate broke, I'm beginning to think that gay couples shouldn't have the right to have children. Sorry for saying that, but after what I've seen, that's how I feel.

                 As a mother I know that just makes me sick. I would  strangle someone with my own bare hands before letting anybody ever lay a hand on my kids. Some of these people just hand their kids over to these things called people. I just can't understand it, but then again I honestly couldn't ever understand how the people of Israel in the bible sacrificed their own babies to Moloch and Baal. It's just sickening.

             I did do so. If you go to archive.is and type in urls, the images are there. I don't have time right now to add them to this thread, but would certainly be appreciative if other people took the time to do that today.

            I'm going to add this to the article, but another thing I discovered is that "momo," used in an Instagram comment about a child, has a number of slang meanings, according to the Urban Dictionary. Some would be innocent in the context of this photo, like an attractive girl, but others might not be.

             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "one half moron, one half homosexual"

             And here's another one from PFP that I forgot to mention. It's about him having a conversation with a high school friend about what they've been up to, and for what he's been doing, there is a picture of a Satanic ritual (the photo is labelled, I believe, "Satanic panic," referencing the supposed panic in the '90s, but that doesn't seem to be why he used this photo.)

             I looked at their web site a bit, but it's entirely possible - and probably more than likely - that PFP just really liked the name and pizza concept, so stood in front of the restaurant's van and had someone else, it appears, take his picture. Still, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to just take a closer look at this pizzeria and keep it in mind.

            These creeps all have the same sick humor. At it's core it represents a total disdain and hatred for humans and it especially targets the most innocent of us all: babies and young children.  Seriously WTF is wrong with these people?

             psychopaths don't feel or act the same as "regular" humans. indeed, they do despise the rest of us.
