Most of the people I\'ve seen coming down hard to decry this all as bullshit do so by the tenuous nature of that building.</p>
<p>This is not about one building.</p>
<p>This is a network. This is Haiti and Madeleine McCann. This is about Jeffery Epstein and Biljana Djurdjevic.  About Heavy Breathing and Refugee Charity “El Pida”. For Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto. Andrew Breitbart and his coroner. For poor Monica Petersen and Euna Lee and Laura Ling. It\'s to find people like Laura Silsby. It\'s about Jimmy Savile and what they did to protect him, and the comedians whose careers were blacklisted when they joked about it years before anyone knew. It\'s about fools in positions of power whom the elites force to action through blackmail. It\'s about secret files on websites, about collusion between the DOJ and human trafficking rings. It\'s about teddy bears by beds of people with no children. About an IMDB actor making us look like gun toting psychopaths, and discrediting the truth. And it\'s about a world wide media shut down anyone who looks too deep.</p>
<p>Whenever you face opposition, whenever they tell you it\'s Fake News, and whenever they try to discredit you, remember what this is really about. Comet Ping Pong is a vector, one of many. Like the rumors of the connected individual whose cargo company brings in &quot;livestock&quot;, or the other stores down the street with questionable symbols now covered up. Everyone knows about Pizzagate and you can guarantee that the people behind the scenes have removed any evidence at that location. Surfaces have been thoroughly cleaned, secret chambers have been emptied, online accounts have been deleted, and even their contacts within Google and other big companies are slowly scrubbing the facts away. Comet Ping Pong is a vector, a passage between. It was a tip of the iceberg, and a peak behind the curtain. What\'s happening is still happening and will simply be moved to new locations, through new unassuming individuals, and out of sight. It\'s a shell game and we lost the ball this time. But we saw the ball, and we know the ball is being moved so we can carefully and patiently wait until the ball emerges again. I can also guarantee you the people behind this will gladly throw Podesta and Alefantis under the bus if it protects the secrecy of the organization. We\'re talking something much much bigger than a little pizza joint.</p>
<p>When they try to shut you down, we have to keep going. For all those people above. But mostly for the kids. All the thousands of poor abuse victims. For the lives lost, for the lives lived in years of abuse. For the crimes committed. And for the other kids still captive, still locked away in hidden chambers.</p>
<p>I am hesitant disclose something that happened a few days ago. You can stop reading here and consider the rest fiction, disinfo, or complete bullshit. Grab a pinch of salt and read on at your own risk. An anonymous individual told me to stop digging, myself, and I can no longer join this hunt with you all. I can only cheer you on. The individual told me that those of us who dig too deep and connect too many facts will draw <em>their</em> attention. He told me it\'s about coloboma, in vitro fertilization, and &quot;The Mark of Cain genetic code the Elites grow their own children with to cannibalize&quot;. This unknown anon, who could be full of lies, told me <em>they</em> will find my family and eat them in front of me while breaking our bodies because watching human suffering is their only pleasure. Probably a disinfo agent. I am not taking a chance, I\'m not digging. I can encourage you all, remind you that the network itself is nowhere near revealed, and encourage you to ignore the dissidents.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work, friends, but be safe. Be as safe as you can.</p>',

            This is about Boystown Nebraska, the Franklin coverup, and Bohemian Grove. It's about Fiona Barrett,  Cathy O'Brien, and Sisco Wheeler. It's about Alfred Kinsey.  Like dapperjabber said, it's a network that operates among the elites of the social heirarchy.

            So how do you make sense of it all, how do you filter the false leads from those dots of information that illustrate what you're dealing with? You look for lies, you look for contradictions, you look for coverups. These are the tells from which you can infer those nuggets of information which become your Rosetta Stone. Significant amongst there are the origins of the common law, the two fates of Judas, and the false story of the events on the road to Damascus. From this point the institutional child abuse connecting the Vatican and the house of Windsor  of the Canadian genocide starts to make sense, as does the reason for the BBC, operating with a royal charter would cover for paedophiles like Jimmy Savile.
