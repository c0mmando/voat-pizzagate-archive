            He gave info to Eric Holder? I have to remind myself how even people investigating this stuff are not red pilled. Eric Holder. Wow. The guys is a deep state nazi. Comrpomised more than just about anybody in our government. Holder and Comey. He didn't see what would come next. That is the FBI that you guys like to pretend are investigating PG.

            You can add Sessions to that list. He certainly isn't doing anything to help. I have a question about Holmseth. He has audio of some of the perps admitting how the pedo ring is run. Have these all been released? It seems like a treasure trove of info but I've only heard one short convo with Allred's protege.

             <p>
              As for the main topic, well, if you read the entire article, you will find nothing whatever tying Mike Pence to anything. Timothy Holmseth goes after a whole bunch of people in excruciating detail, and a court agreed with him just three weeks ago that he had been unjustly persecuted. However, the only thing he alleges about Pence is that he "must have known" about a shady company in Indiana that was involved in human trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Well, sure, Pence
              <em>
               might
              </em>
              have known something. There's absolutely no evidence offered that this case ever made it to his desk, or even that it ought to have done. But let's say that it did. Under the Obama DOJ how much difference would Pence knowing something about child traffickers have made? And let's be clear, the allegation implied in the title is that Pence is ignoring child trafficking
              <strong>
               as VP
              </strong>
              . Really? Is the VP in charge of scheduling investigations by the FBI? Does he recommend people for prosecution by the DOJ? There are 9,300 sealed indictments and counting. You don't think Pence knows all about that?
             </p>
             <p>
              In short, the title is clickbait. This is a real researcher, doing good and important work, who has exposed important people as crooks. Unfortunately his message has been reduced to one throwaway sentence that doesn't even make sense.

                Yes.
                <strong>
                 The attacks on Pence by "Tory Smith" were part of a larger cover-up operation that began four years ago.
                </strong>
                As I explain in my investigative series, it all started with the Snowden/NSA whistleblower affair in June 2013. Snowden inspired a second whistleblower to come forward with information about child sex trafficking to Paul Ryan. He would only testify about it, and turn over documents, if Ryan could arrange for him to do so in front of Congress. Ryan then approached Speaker John Boehner, to set up the testimony, and Mike Pence, who as governor of Indiana had control of a force of state troopers who could protect the whistleblower during the time it would take for the testimony to be arranged.
               </p>
               <p>
                You can see Glenn Beck talking about the plan
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K0JqC6T-wM">
                 in this video
                </a>
                . However, the plan fell apart under threats, and Beck never spoke of it again.
               </p>
               <p>
                My series starts
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2207094">
                 here
                </a>
                , but there's so much involved that it takes a while even to describe. I go through the administrative setup of the cover-up at Media Matters For America by David Brock
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2208657">
                 here
                </a>
                , the financing of it by billionaire pedo Herb Sandler
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2236529">
                 here
                </a>
                . There's a lot of other stuff dealing with other "insiders" apart from Tory Smith, such as Senate Anon and HighLevelInsider and Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt. I eventually come to the Pence/Ryan part of it
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2218774">
                 here
                </a>
                , and then the John Boehner part
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2249514">
                 here
                </a>
                . If you can spare the time, I encourage you to go look at

                 my submission history

               In what what do you think that the title doesn't make sense? I agree that Holmseth is probably reaching in saying that Pence must have known, but that doesn't change the fact that he did actually make the allegation.

                Holmseth unfortunately chooses to say that Pam Bondi and Mike Pence are in "wilful and obvious defiance" of Trump's executive order of Feb 2017. It's illogical to say that, since when Pence was governor of Indiana, Trump wasn't President, and wasn't even the front-runner Republican candidate. Pence could hardly defy an order that hadn't been given. And there's no evidence that he's in defiance of anything as VP; he's been Trump's most loyal supporter since he accepted the nomination.
               </p>
               <p>
                The article you linked to uses that poorly worded statement as its conclusion, which is very bad journalism. While Holmseth did say it, it is scarcely his best moment. There's so much good material in Holmseth's letter that grabbing that one sentence is dishonest.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, just to be clear, I have a long investigative series where I show that Pence knew a great deal about child sex trafficking, and tried to expose it, but was shut down by threats. The series started back in October,
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2207094">
                 here
                </a>
                . You can look at the entire series in
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/SoberSecondThought/submissions">
                 my submissions history
                </a>
                . I'd be willing to bet that Holmseth is unaware of the Glenn Beck whistleblower episode and its implications. If he knew of Pence's role in that, I believe that he wouldn't even have written the throwaway sentence.
               </p>
               <p>
                So just to be clear: I don't blame you for writing the title you did, as that correctly summarized the title of the article. I primarily blame the Public Intelligence Blog for exploiting a weak point in Holmseth's letter.
