<li>History<br />
a. Podesta Emails were released by Wikileaks before election. People searched through them for information about Clinton and the DNC. Lots of serious stuff was found. People had to resign. Another possible scandal was brought up stipulating that code words were discovered and broken. Several strange emails referring to food in a weird way. Maybe read these before the codes if you want and see if anything seems out of the ordinary to you.
&quot;pizza-related map on handkerchief found&quot; - <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23561">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/23561</a>
&quot;Found cheese instead of pasta and sauces&quot; - <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613</a>
&quot;Dreaming about your hotdog stand&quot; - <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231</a>
So the codes are supposedly:
pizza = sex, cheese = child, hotdog = little boy, dominoes = domination, map = DNA</li>
</ol>
<p>b. Comet Ping Pong discovered to be tied to Podesta and other politicians. Has logo very similar to known child sex icons. Nearby shop Besta Pizza also tied to it and has child sex related icon.

c. After looking in to owner of Comet Ping Pong James Alefantis and friends lots of child pornography was found to be available freely on Twitter and Facebook. Linking to these things got the forum for the PizzaGate discussion banned on Reddit. I\'m not going to link to any of this here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Claims<br />
a. Initial theory was that since there were several emails that contained suspicious language found in John Podesta\'s email it may be possible to discover, expose, and most importantly, stop a child sex trafficking operation.</li>
</ol>
<p>b. Current theory has evolved to focus primarily on individuals close to influential figures in DC that also own store fronts in the area as the center of the ring. John and Tony podesta seem to be participants, but not at the center of the operation. Illegal activity could extend to money laundering and drug trafficking as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Response<br />
a. Huge focus on &quot;Fake News&quot; issue. You\'ve heard it, I don\'t need to elaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>b. Banned on Reddit - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/?utm_term=.bbdec8efe174">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/?utm_term=.bbdec8efe174</a></p>
<p>c. Reddit CEO so upset that he secretly edits people comments. Gets caught. Changes rules to censor Trump subreddit. - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/26/reddits-ceo-regrets-trolling-trump-supporters-by-secretly-editing-their-posts/?utm_term=.87a05845b5be">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/11/26/reddits-ceo-regrets-trolling-trump-supporters-by-secretly-editing-their-posts/?utm_term=.87a05845b5be</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Conclusion<br />
a. There is enough history and stats to know that child sex trafficking is ongoing, PizzaGate related or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>b. There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence suggesting that such a ring is occurring in Washington D.C. run by influential political figures.</p>
<p>c. Citizen investigators are required since other investigative agencies and news outlets seem to be ignoring this and can be corrupted or are likely involved at some level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Counter arguments<br />
a. Citizen investigations are essentially witch hunts. These can lead to invasions of the privacy and even physical harm of innocent people.</li>
</ol>
<p>b. There is no proof that Clinton is involved.</p>
<p>c. #PizzaGate is simply fake news.</p>
<ol>
<li>Responses to counter arguments<br />
a. Since this is such an important issue it is worth investigating. Of course harassment, vandalism, and violence should be actively rebuked. Anyone suggesting or doing these should not be considered part of the investigation.</li>
</ol>
<p>b. That\'s fine, this is beyond politics. This is about saving innocent children. This investigation is not tied to any political party; there is even some suspicion of Mike Pence since he covered for Denny Hastert.

<p>c. Of course there are stories about #PizzaGate that are misleading and false. That doesn\'t mean that the entire movement is unwarranted.</p>',

            IMO, the Comet Ping Pong logo is only vaguely similar to the pedophilia logo.  There is some resemblance, but it's not close enough to persuade me that there was any intent there.  Crossed ping pong paddles are an intuitively sensible choice for a logo for such an establishment.  I would not use this as evidence, especially as a leading move.  There's stronger stuff.  The paddles logo as pedo logo comes across too easily as confirmation bias, to a skeptic.

            I think you've done a lot of work with a difficult complicated subject, so kudos for that.  Facing the fact that over the holidays, this is going to come up is something that I think is going to be increasingly evident to any right minded people.  Bravo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say, some of th visual evidence is more compelling than any intellectual or connection based argument.   when people see an infant's face next to comments calling them a "ho-tard" it is hard to put that together any way but degenerate.  I would put some of the initial instagram visual circumstancial evidence in with what you have done.

            Finally, I think you shoudl look into, if you have time, the allegations that Reddit was shut down because investigators got right to the doorstep on the Comet Ping Pong website of a giante cache of incriminating evidence they tried to hack through - the actual blackmail photos the whole operation was set up to accumulate and store.
           </p>

            I wish you best of luck, goodspeed and also happy holidays my friend.  We appreciate the innocent loving moments of our family lives more than ever these days, considering what we know.
