<p>I recently came across a voat post by user &quot;Path&quot;, that had mentioned an establishment called &quot;Uspiritus&quot;, which is an orphanage for abused and destitute children in Louisville, KY that also offers residential treatment for children, who according to their site, have problems such as sexual acting out and impulse control. <a href="http://archive.is/utG96">http://archive.is/utG96</a>  
</p>
<p>If you opened the previous link, you may have noticed the identical girl lover symbol here. <a href="http://archive.is/oPwMv">http://archive.is/oPwMv</a> - As i was looking on their site, I scrolled to the bottom of Uspiritus page and there are links to other organizations. The one that struck me was The Childrens Alliance. Check out their symbol! <a href="http://archive.is/f8Ywj">http://archive.is/f8Ywj</a> - They too are an organization for at risk children and abused children. Check out this FB post of theirs. <a href="http://archive.is/L1VrY">http://archive.is/L1VrY</a>. (All seeing eye - girl) Uspiritus has a vimeo talking about another organization called Mary Hurst <a href="https://vimeo.com/120003298">https://vimeo.com/120003298</a> -  which also is an orphanage home and has residential living for young children. <a href="http://archive.is/0KFzp">http://archive.is/0KFzp</a>. Again, they use another pedo symbol. I thought how odd that all these orphanage organizations that offer residential treatment to abused children, children with substance abuse issues, and sexual behavioral problems. </p>
<p>Another organization linked to the above mentioned establishments is an organization called Safe Place and is at the YMCA in Louisville. Going through their instagram they put the following post which I thought was just creepy. <a href="http://archive.is/GFpLl">http://archive.is/GFpLl</a>   Looks like it might have been made by the children and it says &quot;Help&quot;. Could this be a sign? Notice that spiral...its almost like the besta pizza symbol but a different variation. </p>
<p>I noticed that all these organizations are also linked to an organization called Kosair Charities. <a href="http://archive.is/UFdMl">http://archive.is/UFdMl</a>  - I had been going through Uspirtus FB and had come accross this picture. <a href="http://archive.is/OQsAa">http://archive.is/OQsAa</a>  - The guys in the red hats intrigued me. I looked up to see who the president of Uspiritus was and found this: <a href="http://archive.is/46UgF">http://archive.is/46UgF</a>   -  I found it disturbing that this man Randy Coe, had kids on one side of him and a random shovel on the right side. I did some searching on him and came across this link which I think is pretty crazy. Scroll to the absolute bottom of the page and look at his title. <a href="http://kosair.com/kosaircharities.html">http://kosair.com/kosaircharities.html</a>. He is a 33rd Degree Scottish Rite Mastor Mason. He is one of the leaders of the Kosair Shriners who are a chapter of the Mastor Masons called The Shriners. Here is another article that shows he was honored at the highest degree. <a href="http://archive.is/Zm5VV">http://archive.is/Zm5VV</a></p>
<p>Apparently the Shriners own over 20 childrens hospitals and are heavily involved with the organizations I mentioned above, as well as several other organizations dealing with at risk and abused children. I wasn\'t too familiar with the Shriners, but I started to do some digging and it looks like there is a sub-group to the shriners that one can only become a member through invitation. A very secret society of the top shriners. They are called the Royal order of Jesters. <a href="https://fratline.net/store/images/RJA-200.jpg">https://fratline.net/store/images/RJA-200.jpg</a>. The International Royal Order of Jesters oversees nearly 200 clubs. Their members include United States Presidents, including Truman and Ford, congressmen, governors, state representatives, federal judges, US district attorneys and secretaries of state. Their ranks are swollen with doctors, lawyers, sheriffs, Masonic Grand Masters and Shrine leaders.</p>
<p>Looking further into this secret society made up of the highest degree shriners....I came across an independent investigator who had been researching them for a while. Here is one of her findings, which links this group to child trafficking, child sex tours, prostitution, and other sorts of criminal activity. Here is a detailed analysis of them from investigator Sandy Frost. Must read to see how powerful this group is and the scandals they are involved in. <a href="http://archive.is/kvJZY">http://archive.is/kvJZY</a>  -  I found out after doing my research that another voat user had posted on the Jesters. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1588990">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1588990</a> - They also included a link to a video that does a great job at giving you a look into the society and the scandals they had been involved in at the time. Here is a deleted post about the jesters which the title talks about their nationwide child sex tours. Article was deleted but a few comments were left. <a href="http://archive.is/6ojYd">http://archive.is/6ojYd</a>. Another article discusses the conviction of several jesters who were trafficking prostitutes between state lines. One of the jests was a State supreme court Justice, an attorney, and a police chief. <a href="http://archive.is/lxkdw">http://archive.is/lxkdw</a>  
</p>
<p>I tried to find more information reported by Sandy and came accross this: <a href="http://archive.is/G3R0j">http://archive.is/G3R0j</a> - apparently after investigation the Jesters, she feared her life due to there being a murder and so she backed out on researching them. I couldn\'t find much else on her at all after this date and I\'m hoping she is still around. If anyone could locate her existence for peace of mind, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if any Jests were involved in these Louisville, KY at risk and abused childrens organization and did a little digging. Since Royal Order of Jesters are listed as a non-profit organization...i figured I can do a search for some info and came accross this: <a href="http://archive.is/SdHd3#selection-397.0-397.20">http://archive.is/SdHd3#selection-397.0-397.20</a> - Looks like that is the same man pictured with Coe from Uspiritus. Look at the first picture. <a href="http://archive.is/Zm5VV">http://archive.is/Zm5VV</a>. Here he is talking at one of the organizations linked to all the others. <a href="http://archive.is/5T1Bl">http://archive.is/5T1Bl</a></p>
<p>Does anyone else find it odd, that a secret society made up of 33rd degree mastor masons is involved in a number of foster homes, orphanages, residential treatment homes for young children, and a childrens hospital, while also being known for trafficking children, having child sex tours, prostitution, etc?</p>
<p>Random thought: Could it be possible that some establishments housing orphans and bringing in abused children, could actually be a human trafficking front? This gives those involved a chance to take advantage of children who are already mentally unstable and can abuse them without ever causing any concern from anywhere else, due to the fact that they house abused children. No one would ever suspect the abuse could also be taking place right there at the establishments. Those who run the operation can bring in trafficked children, abuse them physically and sexually while they are there, and then send them off to foster parents or put up for adoption...with the cycle continuing over and over.  Not sure how possible this could be, but it wouldn\'t surprise me if its happening somewhere. </p>
<p>Since shriners have been made up of policitians, judges, police chiefs, and even presidents, is it possible that they could try to cover up anything done by the Jesters, as it would make the shriners look really bad, especially since they are so involved in kid organizations?</p>
<p>I certainly hope the Shriners/Jesters are just sincere people looking to help children and not part of the problem that makes Kentucky the #1 location for child abuse deaths. <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/11357339/ky-ranks-no-1-in-child-abuse-death-rate">http://www.wdrb.com/story/11357339/ky-ranks-no-1-in-child-abuse-death-rate</a></p>
<p>In Sandy Frosts article, she looked listed every jest chapter in the states and found their info as this is all public information. Check it out.
<a href="http://archive.is/Lai41">http://archive.is/Lai41</a>  Maybe we should be looking into some of these guys to see if they have any connections to the main suspects surrounding PG or anything related to child trafficking/abuse. This could be an old list as her article was from 2008, but perhaps there is something more recent. This may be worth looking up folks.</p>
<p><strong>Do not message or try to reach out to ANY of these guys as they are extremely powerful masons. Do your research under the radar.</strong></p>',

            I found where a citizen investigator decided to stop investigating the Jester's in 2013 due to a double homicide....

            </a>
            Here is what she wrote:
I have decided to stop my seven-year investigation into the Shriners’ secret sub-group, the Royal Order of Jesters, involved with human trafficking and prostitution with links to child sex tourism in Brazil.
There was a double homicide in South Carolina a year ago. Brett Parker was recently convicted of murdering his wife and a gambling associate, allegedly to get her retirement and insurance. If you Google his dad, Jack Parker, you’ll find he’s a Jester leader for the Chapin, SC Jester court. He’s been indicted with his son and another associate for illegal gambling. He was also kicked out of his son’s trial after rumors surfaced he tried to tamper with the jury. 
I’m tracking the news stories covering this and it appears that the reporters haven’t established the Jack Parker/Jester connection yet. 
Remember, the Sheriff caught by the FBI in a human trafficking sting pleaded guilty to knowing about a felony and not reporting it after driving a limo of prostitutes from Buffalo over the border to a national Jester party in Niagara Falls, Ontario. 
If investigators track this out and find evidence of Jester prostitution on Jack W. Parker’s computer or if he handled Jester gambling, the same could be charged of him. Plus, according to Guidestar.org, the other Jester courts in SC filed tax returns for the Jesters as they are a nonprofit group. Jack Parker is the only SC “impresario” who has not filed tax returns for his Jester group in Chapin, SC.
After reading the dad had been removed from his son’s trial, I checked Google Analytics to see if anyone had searched for “Jack Parker” on my Newsvine site. The hits began the day after the murder and though Google Analytics failed to track about eight months of data, there have been 62 hits to my Newsvine site searching for Jack Parker. 
It appears that someone is checking to see if I am writing about Brett's double homicide case or Jack Parker's indictment for illegal gambling and his Jester connections. 
I will continue tracking this trial and that of Richard Schair, the former fishing tour operator being sued by four Brazilian women for violating the “Trafficking Victims Protection Act.” 
I will continue working on my narrative book about the Jesters with an eye on a sexy, scandalous, scorching screenplay. I will continue pushing for Congressional hearings into nonprofit corruption to include the Jesters and the International Remote Viewing Association with an emphasis the previous VP used nonprofit resources in his own training after mismanaging the group's conferences after losing money three years in a row.
So I’m done. 
Reporting on human trafficking, prostitution and child sex tourism and giving voice to the victims is one thing. But now that there are links to a double homicide fueled by illegal gambling and the indictment of the Jester Daddy for the same, it's time for me to stop.
Thank you,
Sandy

            Yes, saying they are awful would be putting it mildly. i have wondered how they go from masons to satanic/ lucifer worshippers etc. I have had a few masons in my family. They never made the "leap" from it just being a men's club to worshipping Satan.  I've always thought that secrecy stuff was a little extreme but I know they didn't turn into a Satan worshipping peodophile.  Is there like some worshipful master ( what a stupid name) in the local Masonic lodge that keeps on eye on the members and says "oh He would be good to come into the more secret masons"  these are just my ramblings. I've had to tread delicately when talking to my family members about this because no one wants to believe this about the masons. I do believe I've had some success though because they were going to go through the Scottish rite thing and now they are not. I really want to know how the leap is made though from just being a mason to being a luciferian worshipping freak.

            DEMOLAY- youth group for boys aged 12-20, considered part of the Masonic organizations. Famous Demolays- Bill Clinton, Walt Disney, etc.

            I had never heard of this group until last weekend. And how did I hear about them you might ask. Well my sister just moved to a new neighborhood and put something on the neighborhood website about her son. Lo and behold this guy responds who is a leader in the local chapter for the Demolays, telling her about the youth group for boys.  My x husband also lives in this neighborhood so my son is there every other week. What are the odds of doing all this research and having a " questionable" group reach out to try and get your children to attend. Just a little creepy. In all my research on the Masons and Scottish rite and the jesters, I have never heard of the Demolays. And yes there have been some abuse cases and yes they are secretive just like the masons and yes they take weekend trips sometimes...nothing creepy about it all

             The man Demolay honored by this organization was the last official Grand Master of the Templars.  He was burned at the stake in 1314 for (among other things) : "The second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel, posterior and mouth. The third was telling the neophyte (novice) that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly."

             Just a note to parents who may be thinking of allowing their children to join.
Freemasons will note that he confessed and recanted several times, and was tortured.  But other Templars examined at various Courts across Europe made similar confessions without duress.
They will also say the profane can't understand the virtues of Freemasonry.  So hope and pray you never come to understand the "virtues" they relish.  PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN

             Looks like they want to find smart kids and brain wash beforehand to avoid these smart kids grew into outsider leaders in the society. They want brain washed evil young establishment who can take over their secret agenda.

             Thanks for the info. I was reading about demolay while researching all this stuff and read something about a young boy suing them for molestation by leaders of Demolay.

            HolY Red pill! WOW.. OK so If you watch Fox News there is a disabled Children's Charity commercial on it. I noticed the Masonic Symbol when they showed the outside of their building, some of the men in the advertisement have on those red hats. Then they offer to give you a blanket that has a bear on it.. I dont know the name of the org. But it is something I noticed for awhile and questioned it. After seeing this I felt like I should post. EDIT It is the Shiners ! THATS THE COMMERCIAL! WOWOWOWOWOW THAT BEAR ON THE BLANKET!

            This is a blog post from 2013 about the Shriners &gt;&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            Many lodges are forbidding attendence to any Shriner Events especially the Indianapolis Shrine due to their deep involvement on immoral and criminal sexual activities of underage human trafficking. There are over 191 Shriner locations nationwide involved. We need a list of all politicians, judges and all Master Masons involved. This has been going on for some time and involves an entire nation of master masons who were either participating or aware of the crimes. The secrecy of masons an integral part of their craft protects themselves from their immoral practices and criminal activities...otherwise it would not need to be secret. Many politicians brought into the craft are blackmailed by fellow masons to vote as directed in lawmaking from small cities to our nations capital. This is why they pretend to be philantropists because their real identity would put them in prison without the protection of fellow brothers in all positions of authority in our goverment. This is too big to let lie.

            Knew a guy in college who was a Shriner. I was really impressed that such a young guy would volunteer like that. Years later, he becomes a state attorney and is caught raping kids on camera:

            I will not use any links here hoping anons can dig discretely.
           </p>
           <p>
            I encountered the Shriners through Love a Child Inc., a huge $50 million a year operation from a Haitian orphanage in Fond Parisien, run by Bobby and Sherry Burnette.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much of this is financed by Shriners, especially the medical care in the US. Please look it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Love a Child Orphanage is a large compound surrounded by walls and wires. It contains at any moment over a 150 children. There's a weird little hotel/night club nearby though it's otherwise isolated.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the real operation is run from Fort Myers, Fl. Look it up. This is an enormous building for an organization moving 8-10 containers monthly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do they return empty to Boca Grande? Where does 50mn/yr go? How does LaC Inc obtain such a large budget? I couldn't figure it out. Then I saw the FBI headquarters in Fort Myers is right next to the LaC Inc. warehouse. Then I began to see.

            Thank you. I live in Houston, TX. My grandfather is a shriner and was an active member of the ROTJ during the child sex tourism scandal. Here is something you might find interesting: Their new logo, is fucking PEDOBEAR.

             It may be satire, but this part to me is talking about pedophilia excursions:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The first large-scale family event the ROJ will be organizing is reportedly a fishing trip off of Lake Michigan. “If that goes well,” explained Noble Prick, “we’ll see if we can’t get a larger one organized for a more exotic destination like Brazil. I’ve heard the fishing down there is downright spectacular.

             It says Masonic news satire. So I don't think that is their logo. But interesting because someone thinks it should be, only if disguised as satire is my guess.

             Awesome find! Thanks so much for sharing. I added the update to my original post. How crazy that they would do something so blatant like that. They even call it Jesterbear, like podebear.

               Yeah, I noticed your comment after I had posted mine. Definitely satire, but also very odd to bring it up like that. Either way thanks for pointing out the satire.

            Best thread i've seen all day. amazing diggin'
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             No one would ever suspect the abuse could also be taking place right there at the establishments. Those who run the operation can bring in trafficked children, abuse them physically and sexually while they are there, and then send them off to foster parents or put up for adoption...with the cycle continuing over and over. Not sure how possible this could be, but it wouldn't surprise me if its happening somewhere.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            i would imagine most of these organizations don't abuse the children themselves... rather adopt (or sell) them to people they should not be.
           </p>
           <p>
            they probably do actually help a lot of kids and operate as a legitimate business, as a front should. but a small percentage of kids they get their hands on are not helped and instead sold to other groups doing the trafficking and harvesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            just my assumptions.. and to clarify im not denying there being abuse on location by actual staff at all because it certainly does happen, where theres kids theres pedos, but im thinking the more sinister side of this is a deeper branch not so public, such as these Jesters that indulge in it.

            This was the point I was trying to make a little while back when I posted about this. It was deleted almost immediately. I'm glad someone is paying attention to this. Sandy Frost also has legal documents available to download. All of the evidence is there. I am usually on my phone, so couldn't download all the info. Royal Order of Jesters have a pretty dark history, if you look close enough, and yes, you have to be a 33rd to even
            <em>
             try
            </em>
            to become a Shriner and it's even harder to become a Jester. By the looks of it, I think you probably have to be hand picked. Thanks for posting this! 
Edit to add: Also, damn good digging!

            Before her murder, Senator Nancy Schaefer was working on an expose and she claimed CPS was trafficking children so this comes as no surprise at all.  However the majority of these children aren't orphans at all and they are unjustly removed from good homes for the most inane reasons that don't include abuse with many being placed in group homes or therapeutic facilities (which brings in more money for the state through FED funding).  Great find Op and this definitely needs more digging.

            There is no way that those linked charities having  pedo logos is a coincidence, and that instagram "help" photo is damning too. Good work OP, I hope we can get some more digging on these sickos.

            It is the 33  degreed masons, or shriners that are ultra secretive and protected from the law. As you have pointed out in your post, the participants were judges, politicians , doctors and the like. Have you seen the movie Eyes Wide Shut? Kubrick never lived to see it open in the theaters and I suspect that some of the final version had some cuts?  There is one scene in which the "Illuminati" doctor tells his colleague not to ask to many questions and mentions that he "wouldn't sleep at night" if he knew the level of involvement  [in the occult] of the people society trusted the most. Indeed, it was because of exposing some of their secrets that Director Kubrick was most likely murdered.

            ) on their radar..? It is also a children's shelter for abused children and works with victims of sexual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason this one is on my radar is because Melaney Parker did some work for them shortly before her mysterious "suicide by train".

            I believe Melaney stumbled on something she shouldn't have...either at this organization or in the town of Marfa, Texas, where she lived.

             dude Marfa is a strange place; it's a tiny town run like a police state.  At one point it was the number one drug trafficking point in the U.S. (most likely with CIA involvment) Justice A. Scalia died at a ranch near there ( it was rumored he was involved with underage boys at the party on the night he died).  Also, George W. Bush lives near Marfa.
