<p>As a compliment to other <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611">Executive Summaries</a> on this subverse, this one is an attempt to aggregate all news, evidence and rumours with a modicum of substance which may be indicative of the British Royal Family’s participation in paedophilia, political-loyalty/blackmail club child abuse and or ritual abuse with occult trappings.</p>
<p>This is a COLLABORATIVE post - I invite you all to submit your independent knowledge and findings which I will edit into the main body of this thread (so apologies if comments below dont seem contiguous with the main body of the post’s text as I edit and re-edit)</p>
<p>I acknowledge that there are those who don’t necessarily believe that the Royals paedophile network, if there is one, is the same or integrated with the Washington D.C. one which is the epicentre of the scandal given the moniker ‘Pizzagate’. However, prominent, proven Elite UK paedo scandals bear all the same dynamics - the ex PM Ted Heath was part of a ‘rent-boy’ blackmail ring, and Jimmy Saville practically flaunted <a href="https://archive.fo/Po4rD">his occultism</a>, and the Marc Dutroux affair across the pond featured both.</p>
<p>To place the conclusion near the start, on a 1-10 ‘Epstein’ scale of likely culpability (10 being Convicted of child prostitution for elite clientele, and Podesta being at, say, 8 or 9 - falling short of the ‘10’ simply by virtue of not being convicted despite considerable evidence) I’d probably put the UK Royal family at about a 5 or 6 at most. Aside from Virginia Roberts (Epstein testifier) ‘<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11324889/Prince-Andrew-sex-abuse-victim-Virginia-Roberts-was-introduced-to-the-Queen.html">when-where-how</a>’ of Prince Andrew, the rest is a swirl of very close and long held associations with established paedophiles. While we can at least condemn the Royals for an apparent indifference to the obscene proclivities of their associates, I think we have to give reasonable benefit of doubt to the fact that being such high profile people - and being in the public eye for generations - means that anyone known to the Royals who ends up being convicted of paedophilia will elicit accusations of complicity. That, and they have many enemies who would delight in the unsubstantiated appearing otherwise. Folks familiar with these investigations, the ‘red-pilled’ or even ‘black-pilled’ might place it at a 9 out of 10 - I mean, why would the Royals be exempt when the Vatican is a nest of pedos, the UN is a mobile pedo ring, Dutroux’ 1st stint in prison was truncated by a <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1135141/posts">pardon by the Belgian King</a>, &amp; Washington DC’s atrocities against children are this subverse’s namesake. But I put that 6 out of 10 on a basis of material fact known to the public, and not the deductions of the more erudite.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s delve in</p>
<p>For an historical hint, the 1888 reign of terror in London’s East End, where 7 prostitutes were murdered by the never identified ‘Jack the Ripper’ held <a href="http://general-history.com/jack-the-ripper-and-the-british-royal-family/">Prince Albert Victor </a>as a leading suspect. The Prince’s bloodlust was attributed to late stage syphilis, however, and even if true it cannot be construed to imply a continuum of hereditary depravity to the contemporary heirs.</p>
<p>In the first half of the 20th Century, Queen Elizabeth’s uncle, Lord Mountbatten, was alleged to have a<a href="http://cecaust.com.au/pubs/pdfs/AAS-NZ-paedophile-feature.pdf"> perverse sex life</a> including the abuse of young boys</p>
<p>There were rumors of the Queen being deeply disturbed by some undisclosed conduct of Prince Philip in a 1953 trip to New Zealand, where she compelled him to walk behind her by several paces at the airport when they returned to England. Another such \'scandal is said to have occurred in another trip to Canada</p>
<p>In the 1980s there was a 40 page document by an MP detailing paedopile activities of UK politicians and Buckingham Palace which came to be known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier">Westminster Files</a> or Dossier. It was passed to Britain’s top lawmen to take action, but the file ‘went missing’. When the resulting scandal prompted a revival of the matter, a constant wheel of appointment-investigation-resignation before conclusion- has persisted to this day. Theresa May has overseen the recent faffing of the matter, although the Establishment has conceded that former PM Ted Heath was a confirmed paedophile. </p>
<p>Documents of such nature <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3142099/Police-files-sex-abuse-Gordonstoun-Prince-Philip-Prince-Charles-educated-vanished.html">go missing</a> regularly in the UK, such as the report on sex abuse at the Scottish school where Prince Phillip and his son, Charles were educated  
</p>
<p>Jimmy Savile is, of course, a big red flag. The UK establishment covered up and denounced 30 years of accusations (Sex Pistol’s Johnny Rotten was banned from the BBC for life for calling Savile a pedo on air in the late 1970s). His victims are said to number between 500 and 1000, including occult rituals, murder, and necrophilia. Which is, apparently, what they look for ‘in polite circles’ as Savile was<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/07/jimmy-savile-party-prince-charles"> so close</a> to the Royals that he made the arrangement for Royal parties, and Prince Charles would come to visit him at his cabin retreat.  
</p>
<p>Connected to the Savile / Prince Charles affair was also Peter Ball, a Bishop who Prince Charles worked very closely with at times. He was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3265742/Jimmy-Savile-Prince-Charles-close-friendship-sex-abuse-bishop-Peter-Ball.html">convicted in 2015</a> of historical sex crimes with minors, with Charles denying accusations that he intervened to get Ball off the hook in previous legal proceedings. </p>
<p>In the Jeffrey Epstein ‘Pedophile Island’ case, one of the women who put Epstein behind bars (such as his soft sentencing actually imposed), Virginia Roberts <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11324889/Prince-Andrew-sex-abuse-victim-Virginia-Roberts-was-introduced-to-the-Queen.html">accused Prince Andrew</a> of availing himself of her ‘services’ on 3 occasions in 2001 </p>
<p>In 2011 police <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8802614/Royal-family-obsessives-body-lay-near-Buckingham-Palace-for-years.html">found the remains</a> of a homeless man’s body on an island in the Thames river in line of sight of Buckingham palace. The cadaver had rested there unnoticed for 3 years. Upon identifying the man’s remains, it turned out that it was a man wanted for penning hundreds of obscene letters to the Queen. What made that man dysfunctional, and with perverse grievances against the Royals? </p>
<p>Around the same time there was found a deceased (murdered) <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2083872/Body-Queens-Sandringham-estate-identified-Alisa-Dmitrijeva.html">17 yr old girl</a> on the Queen’s Sandringham property, but it was later attributed to Baltic <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2092886/Alisa-Dmitrijeva-Teenager-murdered-Queens-Sandringham-estate.html">drug-mafia activities</a>. I’m confident, too, that had the Royals been involved, its unlikely theyd just let her corpse rot in the woods on their property, theyd arrange a more comprehensive disposal.</p>
<p>In 2008 the Queen’s own butler -Paul Kidd -was <a href="https://jewishpaedophilia.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/queensbuttlerpaedophile.png">convicted of running a paedophile ring</a> during his tenure of employment, with 29 convictions for 3 boy victims.</p>
<p>And in 2015 there was quite the tourist video of a naked man or boy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsh2F9YwIv4">climbing out a Buckingham Palace window</a>, as if escaping his captors. </p>
<p>Some people did videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0GpOhkFhdw">alleging it to be debunked</a>, though - but I’m not convinced. Give me your forensic opinion below.</p>

              It is. I sent it to my aunt one night after I downed a few beers and was having flashbacks about my pervy uncle. She is still pissed. She knows what I am thinking. Anyways, Trump has been burning down pedophiles by the thousands so I'm good now!  Let's lighten the mood with a 2016 flashback:

            Superb work ....and great information from other contributors.....I'll be busy archiving this stuff
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm on the side of the Buckingham palace video being fake.....if you find images of the palace showing the wing it happens from....it is completely different in real life
           </p>
           <p>
            On the political side of things I'm not sure I've spotted any mentions of elm house or dolphin square....  Two important rabbitholes
           </p>
           <p>
            Going back further there is also Lord Boothby/Ronnie kray and all the connections around them.....such as the story of cliff kitty Richard being dumped in the middle of nowhere in drag by them....and the less fortunate victim of the "suitcase murder"
           </p>
           <p>
            Weird to see Cavendish Hotel mentioned as a royal brothel....in mid 80s I had a summer job working for their dry cleaners....at that point there were lots of Arabs in residence there...they would take over entire floors.....anyway....you'd have to check their suit pockets before cleaning them....often you'd find wallets in them that you'd have to give back....but I did once find a "menu" in one that was clearly not a standard takeaway....and strongly suggested underage girls were available

            And in 2015 there was quite the tourist video of a naked man or boy climbing out a Buckingham Palace windowYouTube, as if escaping his captors.
           </p>
           <p>
            FAKE - the side of the palace in the video was photoshopped in very cleverly - it is from some other stately home [don't know which] but I looked into it closely at the time.  It looks very realistic...

             the wall section is definitely of buckingham palace but maybe of a separate section - there appears to be additional columns (horizontal) between the top window and the roofline when you look between the Streetview version and the video version

            There are also those who claim knowledge that Prince Phillip was present on Heath’s boat ‘Morning Cloud’ (of which there were three) when young boys were removed from Haut de la Garenne children’s home in Jersey to be taken aboard and buggered - with some never returning to shore.  Bill Maloney includes this in his films of the subject

            " Another such scandal involving abducting native children is said to have occurred in a 60's trip to Canada, but the testimony is given to an NGO calling itself an 'International Tribunal' - but with no acknowledged power or jurisdiction"......Rev. Kevin Annette has a world wide following and his tribunals are a way to bring attn. to western elite pedophilia. When he went to GB, he took a Native man who had been at the boarding school , when 10 children went into the woods with queen and prince phillip, and never came back.  The Native man got suddenly sick, went to the hospital and died very quickly..... In good health prior to going there...do more research before casting aspersions.

             thanks for that, very interesting. If you have a source ill edit it in, that's what these collaborative posts are about.  But my point remains , though - however highly you may regard Annette and his work, his 'Tribunal' is misleadingly named because it has no legal standing or powers

           <p>
            Queen Elisabeth (at the time princess) got initiated into a Welsh Druid order in a public ceremony in 1946:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) in a robe of green is led by an acolyte to Archdruid Crwys Williams, who will initiate her into the Mystic Circle of Bards at the national Eisteddfod, or festival, at Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, Wales, August 6, 1946. Men and women who have made a significant and lasting contribution to Welsh culture are sometimes initiated or ceremonially welcomed into Druidical mysteries.

            <p>
             <strong>
              Prince Philip's former royal aide accused of three sex attacks on girl aged 12
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             A trusted former aide to Prince Philip and Princess Anne will face court next week accused of sexually assaulting a girl of 12 while he was working for the Royal Family in the early 70s.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ex-Marine Benjamin Herman, 79, has been charged with three counts of indecent assault and one of attempted indecent assault on the child
             <strong>
              when he was Philip’s equerry – or personal attendant – at Buckingham Palace.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Lieutenant-Colonel later went on to become Princess Anne’s private secretary
             </strong>
             , before returning to the military.
            </p>
            <p>
             Detectives at Scotland Yard are believed to have examined the prince’s official diaries covering the two-year period from January 1972 to January 1974, when the attacks are alleged to have taken place.
            </p>
            <p>
             They have also taken statements from former palace staff but it is not known if officers have quizzed Philip or any other members of the Royal Family about the claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             The alleged victim, who is now in her 50s, came forward in the wake of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Herman is due to appear before Wimbledon magistrates in South London on Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tonight he said he intended to fight the allegations. When asked to comment he looked shocked and added: “I don’t talk to the press.”
            </p>
            <p>
             But when asked whether he planned to deny the charges, he replied sharply “of course” before climbing into his car.
            </p>
            <p>
             Earlier in the day Herman – a grandfather – left his £600,000 home in Hook, Hampshire, wearing smart chinos, desert boots and a blue and white checked shirt before heading to the town’s train station nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had been on bail since he was arrested 18 months ago after voluntarily attending a police station.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today a Crown Prosecution Service spokesman confirmed he faced three counts of indecent assault on a girl and one of attempted indecent assault.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Herman was Philip’s equerry from 1971 to 1974, during which time he shadowed the royal at the Palace and on public and private engagements.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              He became head of ­Princess Anne’s household when she married in 1974, with reports at the time claiming she had picked him to be her private secretary herself from her father’s staff.
             </strong>
             He returned to the Marines two years later.
            </p>
            <p>
             During his career he served with 40 Commando, Royal Marines, and was made Military Assistant and Aide-de-Camp to the Commandant General Royal Marines.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time of the alleged offences Herman lived at Windsor, Berkshire, but also had a base at Wellington Barracks, near the Palace.

             , would you maybe consider including the above info into your OP as well? I feel it is as important as the story about the Queen's pedo butler, especially since there have always been rumours that Prince Philip might also be a pedo. Thank you.

             On a side note, it would be 'Rolf Harris', instead of 'Rolfe Harris' in the OP. Thanks.

               The question is why did Prince Ph. employ him in the first place? Isn't it an odd coincidence that he had a pedophile aide, and later the Queen had a pedophile butler?

              <p>
               Imo it doesn't matter where the abuse took place to make that important.

            About the trial of Queen's guard Simon Davies (NSFW):

            <p>
             <strong>
              A SOLDIER with the Household Cavalry arranged depraved sex parties for
perverts at which children and animals were abused, a court heard yesterday.

            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Lance corporal Simon Davies was at the heart of a paedophile ring whose
members indulged in group sex, bestiality and rape of girls as young as
eight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Davies, 37, admitted a string of sex charges, including repeated rape of a
minor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Retired sheep farmer Nicholas Cordery, 62, who owned a squalid bungalow where
the abuse took place, and two others, Peter Malpas and Anthony Flack, 53,
admitted similar charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Davies’s teaching assistant wife, Fiona Parsons-Davies, 44, admitted a charge
of child cruelty relating to the abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police infiltrated the gang and raided the isolated farm building in Murcott,
near Malmesbury, Wilts. There they found sex toys, 32,000 indecent pictures,
a battered-looking teddy bear and a pair of child-size knickers.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Christopher Donnellan QC, prosecuting, told Reading Crown Court: “This case is
about the sexual abuse of children by a number of people who met on the
internet. They also arranged to meet up in person to take part in acts of
rape and other sexual offences.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The RSPCA seized Cordery’s seven dogs, some of which were at sex parties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Details emerged as the trial began yesterday of child-minder Joanna Gale, 35,
and rail consultant John Connolly, 41, also alleged to have been part of the
gang.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were said to have conspired to rape a girl. They deny all charges.

            There are reports about the Davies trial, but I wasn't able to find any news report about a possible trial of Mark Neal. So maybe he wasn't charged? Will keep digging to find more info.

            So, zooming out to 40,000 feet, if the blackmail theory of pizzagate is correct, those at the very top of the power structure would not necessarily be pedophiles themselves. I think we could expect them NOT to be. It's those they want to control whom they lure into heinous debauchery. Hence the Queen's butler, Kidd, Bishop Bell, and royal confidante Savile.

            The question I have is how does pedo leverage play into the massive geopolitical power shift that occurred between WWI and the end of WWII?

Before the war, imperial monarchy and industrial capitalism were the norm. By the end their dominance was broken and socialism on the rise everywhere.

            Has there always been a Satanic pedovore cabal controlling governments? Or did this arise after the feudal system and religion lost their grip on the populace? Was pizzagate blackmail only necessary (and effective) once technology gave us mass media and effective personal armaments?

            And where did creation of the United States fall in all of this? The blackpillers would have us believe that this, too, was a false flag orchestrated by "Jesuits" and "Freemasons" -- which fails to account for the fact that the Bill of Rights was successfully added to our founding documents and we are here having this conversation at all.

             When one truly wakes up one does so at the expense of coming to see and understand that the world one has created around oneself is one big illusion. It is very painful to watch one's personal reality crumble into nothing, so much so that many only can face a little at a time. Only after letting go of one's sense of illusion does one truly taste Freedom. It is a time where one is weaned off of milk and starts to taste meat, as in hard facts. The truth is the truth and does not change due to whether one chooses to believe it or not :)

              I prefer the use of logic when discerning between truth and illusion. What would the logical reason be for a bunch of control-freak Satanist Masons bent on human subjugation to found a government on the principles of Freedom of Speech, the Right to Bear Arms and other principles which even a retard could see would empower the common man to throw off the yoke of tyranny? Makes no sense.

Why would so many openly blatant pedophiles become knights etc.? Even from the Vatican? Pedophilia is satanic and these rulers are too. You are missing the entire point. It is not politically correct to write or talk about it......but think of a good reason for raping, torturing and killing babies?

             The aristocracy is renowned for it's paedophilia and incest. (I have seen examples up close.)  Don't kid yourself.  I think it's one of the control devices to ensure that they only marry into their own kind, thereby ensuring that assets are kept within the club and not dispersed amongst the great unwashed.  They really do have a different view on sexuality than you and me.

             There were kings that seem to have been pedos, others weren't. But a lots of aristocrats were into dark stuff, and were pedos, since they got away with everything.

            Edward VII had sex with Sarah Bernhardt in a silk-lined coffin which she kept in her bedroom.  Edward VII slept with a young maid called Rosa Lewis.
Rosa told Edward about several little servant girls who were available.  Edward gave Rosa the money to set up a brothel.
This brothel was the Cavendish Hotel in Jermyn Street, next to Fortnum and Mason's. Members of the British elite took their teenage sons to the 
Cavendish Hotel.
Edward VII's eldest son was Prince Albert Victor Christian Edward, known as Prince Eddy.

            Morphine was first isolated from opium in 1805 by German pharmacist, Wilhelm Sertürner.
In CHINA in 1839, the Emperor, Tao Kwang, ordered his minister Lin Tse-hsu to deal with the opium problem.  Lin requested help from Queen Victoria, 
but was ignored. As a result, the Emperor confiscated 20,000 barrels of opium and detained some foreign traders, many of whom were British. 
The Chinese believed that because their ceramics and silk technologies were superior to their British counterparts that their naval ships would also be. 
They were wrong. The British retaliated to this interference with their drug  trade by attacking the port-city of Canton.
This was the beginning of what would become known as the 'First Opium War'. It was launched by the biggest, richest drug cartel that the world has 
ever known; the British Empire.
When the Chinese were defeated, they had no choice but to sign the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. They were required to allow the trade of opium, 
to make large payments to the British, and even to open five new ports to the foreign drug trade. They were also forced to give Hong Kong to Britain
In 1856, the Second Opium War began and ended, with the Chinese being defeated once more. 
By the end of the nineteenth century, an estimated quarter of the male population of China was addicted to the enhanced opium.
In the United States, many of the early Americans cultivated their own opium. Thomas Jefferson cultivated opium at his garden in Monticello.
Warren Delano worked for Russell &amp; Company and was instrumental in importing Opium to instigate an Opium dependance on the Chinese population.
            <br/>
            In 1851 he settled in Newburgh, N.Y. There he eventually gave his daughter Sara in marriage to a well-born neighbor, James Roosevelt, 
the father of Franklin Roosevelt.
In 1874, an English pharmacist, C. R. Alder Wright had boiled morphine and acetic acid together, producing diacetylmorphine. 
Diacetylmorphine was synthesized and marketed commercially by the German pharmaceutical giant, Bayer. 
In 1898, Bayer launched the best-selling drug-brand of all time, Heroin.

            Royals and Satanic Mind Control....
           </p>
           <p>
            The first work in Behavioral Science research was established in England in 1882, while much of the early medical and psychiatric techniques 
involved in mind control were pioneered at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany. The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was set up in 
London in 1921 and financed by the Royal family and the Rockefellers to study the breaking point of humans. Kurt Lewin, a German psychologist, 
became the director of the Tavistock Institute in 1932, about the same time Nazi Germany was increasing its research into neuropsychology, 
parapsychology and multi-generational occultism.
When Hess came flying across to speak with the duke of Hamilton, crashing down 12 miles from Dungavel House, he should have been trying instead, 
to get to Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford. . . . . .One of his honorifics is : Marquess of TAVISTOCK.
His father donated the building that would be used by the Tavistock Inst1tute to study the effects of shell shock on WW1 
troops.
Lord Tavistock... Nazi Sympathiser, hated by his own wife and children..is also called Duke of Bedford - and their family name is RUSSELL.

             Edward VIII, who eventually abdicated the throne because of Wallis Simpson, met Hitler in October 1937. They gave him full Nazi salutes, 
and Hitler considered Edward “friendly towards Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if it 
were not for the abdication.”

             In October, 1964 when I was 12 years old, I was an inmate at the Kamloops school and we were visited by the Queen of England and Prince Phillip. 
I remember it was strange because they came by themselves, no big fanfare or nothing. But I recognized them and the school principal told us 
it was the Queen and we all got given new clothes and good food for the first time in months the day before she arrived.

             "Queen Elizabeth II also celebrated the centennial of the Confederation Conferences in Charlottetown on 6 October 1964. 
On 10 October, as she was touring the streets of Quebec City, a turbulent riot occurred and opposed anti-monarchist Quebec nationalists with the police. 
Since then, the event has been known as Samedi de la matraque ("Truncheon Saturday")."

             Prince Philip's uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten "was particularly attracted to boys in their early teens; it was this characteristic which 
made him especially vulnerable to the IRA , because he needed to slip away from his personal bodyguards to keep dates with such boys, 
some of whom came in contact with IRA men.  His vice habit was similar to that of the former British Secret Service Chief , 'Sir' Maurice Oldfield , 
who was appointed ' Ulster (sic) Security Co-Ordinator ' by Margaret Thatcher in the wake of the Mountbatten assassination .
In 1973, Maurice Oldfield became Director-General of MI6. He held the post under Edward Heath, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan before retiring in 1978.
In 1979 the new prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, asked Oldfield to coordinate security and intelligence in Northern Ireland.
He left this post in 1980 after his positive vetting clearance was withdrawn. Apparently this was because he admitted that "from time to time 
engaged in homosexual activities."

              Stephan Ward and ¨Profumo"
             </p>
             <p>
              Allegedly Stephen Ward was a member of 'The Thursday Club', later renamed the 'Monday Club' . Dr. Stephen Ward was reportedly the pimp for a 
ring of call-girls that operated out of Ward's cottage on the Clivedon estate of Lord Astor. Ward befriended Christeen Keeler.
In 1963, Secretary of War John Profumo was compromised by his affair with Keeler. It seems that she had also been sleeping with a top Soviet 
KGB agent in London, Capt. Yevgeny Ivanov.
"Steven ward was running a spy-ring investigating the whereabouts of 'the Hess files', thought to be kept in the home of
one of the nobility (or even in the palace archives). Ward and prostitute Ronna Ricardo came upon a paedophile ring run by Anthony Blunt, 
and included ... a lot of top people incl polititians... Profumo survived because he had evidence and powerful friends, Ward was killed ... 
Peter Rachman was Mossad..."
Ward attended private parties run by the likes of David, Marquis of Milford Haven and the cousin of Prince Phillip.
These 'often developed into full-blown orgies lasting over an extended weekend, with participants as varied as the photographer Baron and 
American superstar, Bing Crosby.'
Christine Keeler worked at Murray's cabaret club.There she befriended "Mandy" Rice-Davies. Both women 'become celebrated players in 
Ward's celebrity sexual circus centred on his Wimpole Mews flat, equipped with two-way mirrors, Lord Astor's country mansion of Cliveden 
or weekends at Spring Cottage, parties and other rather more dubious social events.'
Dr Stephen Ward had an MI5 controller, Keith Wagstaffe (cover-name 'Woods').
             </p>
             <p>
              Who gained from the Profumo Affair? Harold Wilson became Prime Minister.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anatoli Golitsin, a spy who defected from the KGB, claimed that Hugh Gaitskell was murdered in 1963 so that Harold Wilson, a 'KGB agent', could become 
leader of the Labour Party.

              It is known that MI5 ran a brothel in Church Street in Kensington throughout much of the 1950's and early 1960's for the use of visiting dignitaries, 
diplomats and intelligence officers. While for those too important to visit such an establishment certain discreet gentlemen were called upon to 
provide young female or male company directly to the VIP hotel bedroom.

              "At Buckingham Palace, the 16-year-old boy was approached by Sir Peter Hayman, the deputy director of MI6, who was a pedophile.
Hayman asked the boy to work for him in Canada, where he became ambassador.
Hayman was a member of the top paedophile ring operating within the UK government."

              "The late Sir Peter Hayman, who rose to become a senior spy, and Lord Henniker, who died in 2004 and also had a background in intelligence, 
were two peas in a pod, although how far they shared interests remains unclear.
What is known is that the Queen liked them both so much that she awarded each the CVO, an unusual honour in that it is granted by her personally
Henniker provided a sanctuary on his country estate at Thornham Magna in Suffolk to Peter Righton, who supplied boys to paedophile VIPs at 
Dolphin Square and elsewhere.

              "Mrs Cairns found the vice-chairman of the school governors, Peter Righton, former Director of Education at the National Institute for Social Work, 
had for years openly advocated sex with boys in care.
"Righton and I had sat together on the body which regulated social work training. I researched everything he had published and I felt sick. 
I was devastated by the betrayal of trust, and social work's naivety.
"He got away with this, and influenced social workers to this day, because they feared seeming "homophobic" by challenging him."
It prompted Mrs Cairns to begin confiding secretly with Scotland Yard.
The impasse ended in 1991, when police discovered Rabet's Sussex children's centre was partly financed by convicted child pornographers 
and that he was part of a ring of wealthy, well-connected paedophiles.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police also discovered that Righton was a founder member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned for the age of consent to 
be reduced to four."

He is the cheerleader in chief for the arms industry, shaking hands and paving the way for the salesmen.”
A spokesman at UKTI told Channel 4 News in response: “Prince Andrew supports and represents all sectors of UKTI and promotes business across 
those sectors.” He added that there is no campaign for fighter jets in Indonesia, saying: “We are unaware that Indonesia wants or needs fighter jets. 
We have very strict export licences and anything like that would have to go through proper procedures.”

               "During his talks with Gaddafi, Prince Andrew is believed to have discussed the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Megrahi was 
released from prison in Scotland in 2009 amid reports that Britain had won a lucrative oil deal for BP from Gaddafi in return.
              </p>
              <p>

               Buckingham Palace went to extraordinary lengths this week to try to conceal the Libya trip by the Duke and Mr Rowland. Acting on a tip-off from a 
well-placed source that Andrew made several flights with Mr Rowland, most of which were organised and paid for by the businessman, 
The Mail on Sunday first approached Buckingham Palace on Friday.
The Palace did not respond until noon yesterday. It said the Prince had made one official visit to Libya in 2007, but did not meet Gaddafi, 
and ‘Mr Rowland was not on this trip’.
After several evasive replies, senior sources eventually admitted the Prince met Gaddafi in Libya in 2008 and privately on two other occasions. 
Challenged to confirm that Mr Rowland and the Duke flew to Libya together secretly when the Prince met Gaddafi,a spokeswoman effectively admitted 
that they did."
"The Prince is close friends with British-based Kazakh socialite Goga Ashkenazi."  (She is close friends with Prince Andrew, Duke of York,
 as well as banker Nat Rothschild, real estate developer Nick Candy, Duran Duran band member Nick Rhodes and Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill )

                Elm Guest House.
1990 Elm Guest House boy brothel owner Carol Kasir gives a list of top people to whistleblower.
Apparently the idea to turn the guest house into a gay brothel came from a guest living there called Barry Haddon, with another man called Terry Dwyer.
Haddon was a pimp and pornographer for young boys.

                Soon after, Carole Kasir is found dead, age 47, in her flat.

                1990 - In Rochdale, up to 20 children are taken from their homes and parents after social services believe them to be involved in satanic or occult ritual abuse.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rochdale is the home of child abuser Sir Cyril Smith.

                "Willie McRae was said to have discovered child abuse by cabinet ministers and other leading members of the establishment on both sides of the Border. 
Shortly before his death he was seen photocopying a dossier of names in case something should happen to him"
"His death also came just months after the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens handed his own infamous paedophile dossier to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan 
– only for it to be lost or destroyed by Home Office officials.
               </p>
               <p>
                Fionna Borders, whose late husband James was a barrister involved in a number of child abuse cases, said she was convinced that McRae 
was on the verge of “shaking the establishment” to the core when he lost his life."
               </p>
               <p>
                In 1998 the first articles began to appear on what was a limited internet distribution regarding the paedophile ring around 10 Downing Street. 
On the 6th September 2010 an internet blogger posted an article naming Sir Jimmy Savile as the man who procured children for 10 Downing Street. 
Yesterday in the House of Commons the same allegation was aired for the first time publicly by Tom Watson MP.

            Jimmy Savile on the Parkinson chat-show tells about smuggling a young girl in the boot of his car to see Prince Philip.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM_RlWkE52w">
             The video
            </a>
            is very telling. Savile seems to have been a supplier of young/underage victims to the British Royal Family and to other members of the Elite - he more or less admits it on national television.

            Thank you for putting this together. I am no longer trustful of any "royalty" when seeing all of the evidence of pedophilia. How convenient to lose the files in the Westminster Dossier. I wonder where they are.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to a sworn deposition by Juan Alessi, a former employee at Epstein’s Palm Beach estate, Andrew attended naked pool parties and was treated to massages by a harem of adolescent girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             At least three of the girls were questioned under oath about whether Andrew had had sexual contact with any of the masseuses. One of them, Sarah Kellen, refused to answer, citing her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Another, Adriana Ross, was asked, “Has Prince Andrew ever been involved with underage minor females to your knowledge?”
            </p>
            <p>
             She reportedly replied, “I refuse to answer.” (Prince Andrew says he neither attended nor was aware of any naked pool parties.)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <h1>
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Under the protection of the Queen, Prince Andrew was untouchable.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Epstein was a friend of the duke’s for the best part of 20 years."
            </p>
            <p>
             “Does that mean that Andrew has broken off all contact with Epstein?,” I asked.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Hereinafter,” the source said, choosing his words with care, “we won’t see a photo.”
            </p>
            <p>
             That seemed to leave open the possibility that Andrew intended to carry on his friendship with Epstein, but out of public view.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I remember when Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein first became friends,” said someone who knows both men well. “Jeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time in his life. He had him wear blue jeans for the first time. It was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax.
            </p>
            <p>
             There have been newspaper reports that Sarah got £15,000 [$24,500] from Jeffrey, but I think that Sarah has actually received hundreds of thousands of dollars from him.” (Ferguson’s spokesman confirmed that she had received £15,000 from Epstein but wasn’t aware of any additional amount.)

            <em>
             Just found this little gem:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Epstein visited Windsor Castle in 2000 for Queen Elizabeth’s official birthday celebrations and went to the Royal Family’s country retreat at Sandringham the following winter. Andrew also entertained Epstein at the Scottish estate of Balmoral.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite Epstein’s jail term (he served 13 months of an 18-month sentence) after his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex with an underage girl following a plea bargain deal, Andrew remained in contact with him and was seen walking in New York with him after the businessman left jail. Andrew stepped down from his position as ambassador for U.K trade in the wake of the controversy.
            </p>
            <p>
             That he remained in contact with Epstein despite the conviction raised eyebrows – but clearly Andrew hadn’t realized the impact it would have.

            Tbh I don't know a lot about the Royals, only what I've read/watched since pizzagate.  I did not want any of this to be true, I love watching when they have any ceremonies.  Does the Hampstead Cover up come under the British elite? It involves the police, teachers and authorities in charge of children etc?  If its not right for here I will delete it  but will post first:-   HAMPSTEAD COVER-UP

            ------- **at 2:12:45 mins is the most obvious points where poor little Gabriel has been told to lie and deny his dad did anything -  the policeman, imo, is trying his hardest to get Gabriel to retract what he has testified earlier, but he just cannot bring himself to commit to their rehursed lie 100%  when he says his dad does to hit him and adds 'not hard' AND when he says his dad does not kill so many babies,  'just some' this is so sad, his conversation is not flowing naturally like it was in the first 2 interviews!  **  - Hampstead Christ Church Satanic Ritual Child Abuse Cover-up - Police testimony of

             i havent included the Hampstead case because i think the Royal linkage is too tenuous. Their father did business with someone who also does business with the Royals - i really want something of more substance before inclusion. Fair?

            Great thread, MH! I've created a new "HELP!" flair to let folks know collaboration is needed on a post. I'm going to sticky this, as well.

               I was 15yrs old when The Pistols were playing at a local sports centre in 77, I was a total rebel then and JR was in many ways an idol for me. The common thread of truth that runs through "this thread" was compounded when JR (Lydon) spoke in the manner only he was capable of.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is no "convincing" some people basically coz if one can be convinced one can also be un-convinced. Truth is not about being convinced, it is about getting out of denial :)

               If you don't, you aren't paying attention. Just as Annette  was bringing attn. to the royal family, some guy by the name of Alfred Webre' or something like that told of how he took a girlfriend with him on his missions. ...paid for by donations. It was all over for a while. As turns out, Alfred comes from a family of Jesuits....I never thought it was a big deal that his girlfriend went around with him.

             Another who is named is the US banker John Studzinski. He combats human trafficking apparently. Sounds like an ideal contact for Ivar Mountbatten and co. and Helen Windsor’s ex-boyfriend at SCL in making sure that the “Ukrainian girls” they supplied around the world were all properly kite-marked, wouldn’t you say? Everything above board and shipshape. Nothing untoward going on. All “compliance” boxes duly ticked.

            In this thread I commented about Harry's attendance at the Four Season's restaurant in New York at the Seagram's visit. An event put on by the American Friends of the Royal Foundation and attended by 190 supporters of the foundation.

            That restaurant is partly owned by Classic Restaurant Corp. which leads to a ranch in Santa Fe, coincidentally.

            The Blackstone Group features heavily in many pizzagate posts. One example post which relates to the Child Mind Institute :
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1861756">
             More Child Mind Institute board member connections with Goldman Sachs and the Blackstone Group. Also Tribeca ,Robert De Niro, and why the vaccine and autism movie Vaxxed was banned.

            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            We also know that Harry and his American wife Meghan have a lot of business and social connections with the online art auction house people Paddle8
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2276606">

             One of daughter’s of the Folgers fortune was one of the girls that was murdered by the Mason family when they murdered the rest like Sharon Tate. It is believed that Manson was MK-Ultra which seems to line up with the girls saying they do anything for Charlie and how he prop them up on LSD at the ranch.

             Another thing I heard was a satanic ritual was being performed by the famous people in the house before the killing started, and one of the boys murdered was named (Steve) I think and is the Branson guy that has an island close to epstein in the British Virgin Islands.

              Sharon Tate was murdered for Occult reasons,  there is a reason that she was positioned like the hanged man. She was (supposedly) the head of a pedo trafficking network with Polanksi.  He escaped to Switzerland.. he didnt give a fuck about being wanted for child rape, he was running for his life.
If you want to cry a little into your pillow, check out the similitudes between Charles Manson and David Koresh.  By that I mean.. what did they both want to be, where did they both go, what did they both do after being there?
Messiah is a product.

            Funny how the police will acknowledge the said paedophiles in high places only when they're dead. Try to get a case against them when alive through the 'justice ' system it isn't happening. Tells me that it's a very complex web with people in positions of power all involved. Glad I have such a strong faith because there's no human beings capable of bringing these people to account.

             So, then after the death and exposure the links to those in high offices can be exposed. That doesn't actually prove involvement in a technical sense but birds of a feather will always be found flocking together.

            What's more important is that he tried to help both Charles and Diana and Fergie when their marriages were about to go downhill, as all three of them trusted him.
            <em>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             For an historical hint, the 1888 reign of terror in London’s East End, where 7 prostitutes were murdered by the never identified ‘Jack the Ripper’ held Prince Albert Victor as a leading suspect. The Prince’s bloodlust was attributed to late stage syphilis, however, and even if true it cannot be construed to imply a continuum of hereditary depravity to the contemporary heirs.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I would suggest to delete this paragraph, as the victims here were not underage IIRC. And the Prince as a being the murderer seems to have been a fringe theory.

               Interesting theory, but it doesnt quite match up with the Modus Operandi, though. The killer mutilated victims with a depraved surgeons skill (the prince having doctors training being one of the 'clues' as to his identity) - youd imaging the royal father of a bastard son (or his pissed off parents) would use proxies to murder witnesses

                Do you believe everything you're told ? :)  The Black Dehlila was cut up with a surgeon's skill.. The whores were gutted and police reports tell of a surgeon's skill... were the police surgeons?
Annie Elizabeth Crook was catholic.  a catholic heir  to the throne, bastard or not, the Royal Marriage Act of 1772 would have made any claim illegal to the throne.. not that that would have mattered to Catholics and the Pope.  Its not as if there's been a battle for supremacy ever since Anne Bolyn offered her asshole to Henry 8... stupid man.  Fucked everything up for a bit of ass..

                He was first introduced to the Royal Family, he reveals, by Lord Mountbatten. In 1966, Jimmy became the first civilian to be awarded a Royal Marines’ green beret. Mountbatten was comm­and­ant general at the time and realised that Savile could be a useful contact.

                “Coming from Lord Louis, who was the favourite uncle of Prince Philip, that was quite something,” he says. “So obviously I hooked up with the Prince – what was good enough for Lord Louis was good enough for him.”

                Why is Kincora so important? Because there is abundant evidence that MI5, MI6 and other British intelligence agencies know that many high-ranking British Establishment figures were personally involved in the abuse. These included Lord Mountbatten — great uncle and mentor of Prince Charles.
               </p>
               <p>
                May’s refusal to include the Kincora boys’ home in the general inquiry is certainly because it would expose the connection between paedophiles, MI6, MI5 and the royals.
               </p>
               <p>
                Prince Charles often described Jimmy Savile as one of his best friends. He wanted Savile to be Prince Harry’s godfather — wiser counsel stopped that but the two men shared holidays and much else.

                I havent gotten to Charles yet.. It would certainly explain Savile's 'closeness' to Charles... Montbatten wanted Chjatrles to marry his daughter.  Diane was a fallback option and it's interesting that she was controlled so closely by 'the friendly shoulder to cry on' Jimmy...  Its like a calf crying on the shoulder of a butcher whilst waiting for the axe to drop.....shit this is more twisted that I thought..

             I'll see what I can do but I'm really no specialist - I'm a special needs faggot who bookmarks shit about Jimmy Savile. Let me just rummage through and throw some shit at the wall.

             Thanks for the ping.  I think you'll be surprised with how much we have. I'm currently working on something else at the moment which will require a proper write up instead of the raw data dumping I tend to do here. So I'll contribute in chunks linked to well sourced posts that we already have.  I suggest that you curate the information as we go along.. I'll edit and/or cull info according to your remarks.  Let's get started...
