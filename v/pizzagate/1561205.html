<p>Some donors to Clinton foundation used the Panamanian law firm for offshores
Connections come from the more than 40 years Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent in public life
Clinton criticized those exposed in the Panama Papers, some looking to hide their wealth</p>

<p>One of them is Ng Lap Seng (see sections on China)</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng_Lap_Seng">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng_Lap_Seng</a></p>
<p>Ng Lap Seng is the subject of an American investigation, and faces bribery, money laundering and other charges, as he allegedly that he paid bribes via intermediaries totalling US$500,000 to former UN General Assembly president John Ashe.</p>
<p>John Ashe is dude who had &quot;accident&quot; with barbell and died.</p>
<p>Ng Lap Seng was also part of a Democratic fund-raising scandal when Bill Clinton was president, and is mentioned in the Panama Papers.</p>
<p>Saudis and Pfizer donated to foundation in 08 and crashed the site</p>

<p>&quot;A politician from India donated some $5 million to the Clinton Foundation — which would have amounted to nearly his entire net worth, a new book about the Clintons claims. The Clinton Foundation in 2008 reported that it had received a contribution of between $1 million and $5 million from Amar Singh, a member of India’s Parliament and a pal of Bill Clinton. The size of the donation relative to Singh’s net worth raised questions about whether Singh was the true source of the cash, according to “Clinton Cash” author Peter Schweizer . The 2008 contribution was made as Congress debated approval of a nuclear agreement between the United States and India, which then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton eventually supported.&quot;</p>
<p>Potential tax fraud via tax reporting and donation reporting also talks about mexican donor and changing reporting records</p>
<p><a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-foundation-quietly-revises-mexican-billionaires-donation/">http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-foundation-quietly-revises-mexican-billionaires-donation/</a></p>
<p>&quot;Clinton supporter Ira Lessfield was listed last year as a $250,000 to $500,000 donor. His Leesfield Foundation was listed as having given just $1,000 to $5,000. However, the latter’s tax filings revealed it has given at least $200,000 to the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>The updated donor list merges the two, putting “Ira H. Leesfield and Leesfield Family Charitable Foundation, Inc.” in the $250,000 to $500,000 category.</p>
<p>The website appears to have corrected a similar discrepancy with respect to Fred Eychaner, combining the Chicago media mogul’s personal and foundation giving into one line item.&quot;</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton\'s campaign has received 2.5 mil from a hedge fund called &quot;Renaissance Technologies.&quot; This is run by a man named (((James Harris Simons.))) He also runs Euclidean Capital which has donated 7 mil to her campaign. In 2014 a Senate committee found Renaissance Tech had effectively dodged over 6 billion dollars in taxes. I wonder why they\'re donating to her. Isn\'t she supposed to be breaking up hedge funds that do this shit not get funded by them.</p>

<p>In a previous thread, people were wondering who has donated to Hillary and ended up dead afterwards.
Mrs. Alix was an active fundraiser for Democratic races, hosting First Lady Hillary Clinton in her home on two occasions and raising funds for presidential, Michigan legislative and Detroit mayoral races.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation</p>

<p>Also on that list of donors, is James Murdoch who is Rupert Murdoch son who testified in that telephone hacking scandal a few years back.</p>
<p>Gilbert Chagoury</p>
<p><a href="http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/1037328/Schweizer_-_Clinton_Cash__The_Untold_Story_of_How_and_Why_Foreign_Governments_and_Businesses_Helped_Make_Bill_and_Hillary_Rich.html">http://www.e-reading.club/bookreader.php/1037328/Schweizer_-_Clinton_Cash__The_Untold_Story_of_How_and_Why_Foreign_Governments_and_Businesses_Helped_Make_Bill_and_Hillary_Rich.html</a></p>
<p>Large commitments have been made by foreign businessmen with records of making payments to government officials to gain influence. Gilbert Chagoury, for example, who has sponsored speeches by Bill and committed $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative, has a long history of association with corrupt transactions in Nigeria.

           "A politician from India donated some $5 million to the Clinton Foundation — which would have amounted to nearly his entire net worth, a new book about the Clintons claims. The Clinton Foundation in 2008 reported that it had received a contribution of between $1 million and $5 million from Amar Singh, a member of India’s Parliament and a pal of Bill Clinton. The size of the donation relative to Singh’s net worth raised questions about whether Singh was the true source of the cash, according to “Clinton Cash” author Peter Schweizer . The 2008 contribution was made as Congress debated approval of a nuclear agreement between the United States and India, which then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton eventually supported."

           "Clinton supporter Ira Lessfield was listed last year as a $250,000 to $500,000 donor. His Leesfield Foundation was listed as having given just $1,000 to $5,000. However, the latter’s tax filings revealed it has given at least $200,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The updated donor list merges the two, putting “Ira H. Leesfield and Leesfield Family Charitable Foundation, Inc.” in the $250,000 to $500,000 category.

           Hillary Clinton's campaign has received 2.5 mil from a hedge fund called "Renaissance Technologies." This is run by a man named (((James Harris Simons.))) He also runs Euclidean Capital which has donated 7 mil to her campaign. In 2014 a Senate committee found Renaissance Tech had effectively dodged over 6 billion dollars in taxes. I wonder why they're donating to her. Isn't she supposed to be breaking up hedge funds that do this shit not get funded by them.

           In a previous thread, people were wondering who has donated to Hillary and ended up dead afterwards.
Mrs. Alix was an active fundraiser for Democratic races, hosting First Lady Hillary Clinton in her home on two occasions and raising funds for presidential, Michigan legislative and Detroit mayoral races.

           Large commitments have been made by foreign businessmen with records of making payments to government officials to gain influence. Gilbert Chagoury, for example, who has sponsored speeches by Bill and committed $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative, has a long history of association with corrupt transactions in Nigeria.

            As George Webb stated T or W....we need the 1100 'hidden' donors that gave to CF through CGSGI Canada as part of the $31M Guistra gave to CF...which they kinda sorta tried to hide. Guistra said he doesn't have to disclose...but listed about 21 of the biggest donors....but there were supposedly 1070 plus more that he didn't list.  He said Canada law prohibits disclosure...but that was a lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Separate CGSGI Canada agency was formed so they could "take advantage" of Canada tax break for charitable giving...but it also allowed donors to be both "separate" and anonymous as it is not a part of US operation so disclosure not enforced.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb said yesterday (or day before) that many, many of those hidden donors will be brownstone victims...CEOs, mid level diplomats etc...but there is no list.  A lot of them were likely at a Clinton Guistra fundraiser gala in Toronto in 2008...but there isn't a list to be found, nor any pics....
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb gave a whole bunch of 'here's where to look and why" but it amounted to reverse engineering energy and trade deals and disappointments...and then connecting it to Hillary appointments and travel...and Bill speeches.
Tedious ar best...heartbreaking frustration is more likely.  I took a brief stab but quickly ran out of enthusiasm.
