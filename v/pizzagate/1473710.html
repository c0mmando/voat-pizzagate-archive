<h2>I learned everything I could about PizzaGate and also have been going through the Podesta Emails like crazy.</h2>

<h2>I\'m good at figuring things out and piecing things together, that\'s what I do. So when I saw most of the Podesta emails not being investigated enough, and also saw there was a huge amount of evidence missing, I decided to start investigating to see what I could find.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>One thing didn\'t make sense though. I know the entire history of the CIA, and all they do is hurt and kill people, and they only help people if it helps them to hurt and kill people, or to over throw a nation. Then there\'s the FBI involvement that doesn\'t make complete sense, because of how the FBI has always been known to cover up pedophiles and pedophile rings. Especially the ones in government.</h2>

<h2>At first I shrugged it off, because times do change and there could be internal struggles that we don\'t know about.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>However, I just found out Obama signed away our rights in America, and for the rest of the whole world. The FBI can now remotely hack any phone, email, and computer in the entire world and without any permission. Also, they now created X-Ops, that will go anywhere in the world to kill people on the spot without an arrest or trial, simply because they don\'t like them or don\'t agree with them and labeled them a terrorist out of suspicion.</h2>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo_7hsSiRe8">Losing Your Rights in the Name of Fighting Terror</a> <em>(This week Obama signed away all of our rights)</em></h2>
<p>-
Then before that, I got the whole true story about Julian Assange</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvC6_JIjdPA">Wikileaks &amp; Julian Assange Update - Full Timeline of Events</a> </h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>And now with the mainstream media attacking social media with &quot;Fake News&quot; claims that will remove freedom of speech from everyone and allow the mainstream media to lie all they want with the military industrial complex propaganda to incite violence and wars. Things are starting to connect.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9i0t8E6Ws">Countering the Real Fake News</a></h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>And of course the masterminds in their war games just need to add the final touch. Do you all remember The War On Terror? Those of you that remember the Zeitgeist video from 2007, you\'ll remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGYf3DDypSE">this scene</a> where Nicholas Rockefeller mentions using &quot;War On Terror&quot; phrase in mainstream media news and politics to invade and take over other countries.</h2>
<p>-
So here is the new 2016 version of War On Terror!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIWJzRMTekM">Documentary Explaining Pedophilia Cannot Be Defined And Is Everywhere</a></h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>What that documentary shows, is that the term &quot;Pedophile&quot; or &quot;Pedophilia&quot; is a vague word with different descriptions and meanings to everyone and in different places. It also shows that it is everywhere, and in every single religion.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>Pedophilia is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with, but at the moment, it\'s a new version of War On Terror, and we are being used to bring down America and all religions with it.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>I\'ve actually been sitting on this information for a whole day. I don\'t know how I feel about it.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>Do you all remember the creation of the FCC? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvPVAOklx20">Watch This!</a></h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>In America we will have Martial Law very soon. Trump can save us and turn this all around, but America is at war right now, and the world bankers want to remove Trump and not in a good way.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2> #FakeNews is trending right now, as the mind games of mainstream media fabricate lies for the public, and the public fights back to reveal their lies. This is why they are doing it though, and #PizzaGate was set up as bait, even though it is real, the people in government live by CIA rules. The idea that they have no records or convictions, and leave no evidence. I keep digging and digging for hard evidence, and we found a lot of good information, but what if all of this is just for nothing and we all end up being the victims?</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>FaceBook has already started censoring posts and links a day ago, to silence anyone they want to silence.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>I say we continue #PizzaGate, or use variations of that hashtag if that one gets blocked, but we need to be very cautious from now on. It\'s more important now than ever that we rely completely on facts and that we do constant fact checking.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>Just browsing #PizzaGate on youtube, I\'ve seen many videos showing and talking about stuff that was uploaded by other people or posted on the internet, without verifying the information and sources first. Resulting in false planted information to discredit #PizzaGate.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>Oh, and there is one last thing that just doesn\'t add up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovRCTGsRPyU">The book, &quot;A Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley was the blue print for the New World Order</a> they want to create. Well, you might want to watch the movie if you haven\'t already.</h2>
<p>-
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek5vse2_Aq0">Aldous Huxley\'s Brave New World</a></p>
<h2>It shows a new world where kids are taught to have sex at an early age.</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>So if that is still their blueprint, and if it is impossible to defeat pedophilia, then a war on pedophilia will only create more pedophila. Much like how the war on drugs created more drugs and the war on terror created more terror. Sounds like we may be playing right into their trap. Are we?</h2>
<p>-</p>
<h2>Like I said already, I don\'t know how I feel about all of this. I\'m trying to see the bigger picture.</h2>

              Dude, you still sound like a shill. You're trying to say catching Pedophiles shouldn't be our highest priority. That's wrong! There is no higher priority than catching pedophiles. Full Stop.

               I'm still trying to put all the pieces together, but you obviously don't know anything about psychological warfare. Let me explain it to you like this. The war on drugs was to make a big deal about stopping drugs, but while police were running around and doing all they could,
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB6cINE6x0k">
                those in high government positions were supplying all the drugs
               </a>
               and could never get caught.
              </p>
              <p>
               So what I'm saying, we need to focus on the top, because the bottom is a distraction.

                I agree with you on the drugs thing. The Clintons were basically working for the CIA during Iran/Contra. Check out the Mena Drug story:

                . My point about Pedophilia being the most important issue is that it's unassailable, meaning no one can argue with opening an investigation "just to make sure". PizzaGate needs to be "sold" to the general public to win them over. Right now the MSM has "Fake News" keeping the lid on things..

                 The problem is, America is and has always been a communist controlled country, under the illusion of democracy. So most people in America are brainwashed to hate anything nudity or sex related. Show American's a nude statue in a museum, and they'll all form a mob and charge at it to destroy it or to put clothing on it. So when people use words like "Pedophilia" that have no strict or specific description, it leaves it open to a citizen (self-policed) thought police state, where everyone attacks everyone for everything, while the ones at the top laugh and hide behind closed doors out of sight and out of mind, safe from the chaos they created.

                  Whether you are legit or not doesn't matter. You can't attract people to the PizzaGate cause with stuff like "communist controlled country". You lose immediately with that to the point I'm wondering if you're a shill. Sorry, this is about hunting Pedophile's not Communists. We've seen that movie before and it's a deal breaker. Still to protecting children. ;-)

            Millions of kids are waking up. The program to dissociate their personalities is backfiring. The subjects of the experiments are no longer controllable by the establishment. They are more aware and more powerful than those weak old men ever imagined and they are waking up.  Time to wake up the rest of the kids.

            Another theory: All what you say is correct but pizzagate
            <strong>
             never
            </strong>
            was a factor in their plans. Neither was Trump or Brexit. These three events only serve to accelerate the process of absolute control and appropriate "cleansing " for the NWO.
           </p>
           <p>
            The consequences of both Brexit and Trump were to make people skeptical of the MSM they watched during these events, especially considering the absolutely useless responses by Cameron and the Cons plus Clinton and her Pedosta Campaign. Not to mention the response of the MSM, who, after personally watching the live feeds that day closely, obviously had no idea that Trump could win.
           </p>
           <p>
            The third punch was the release of #PodestaEmails28, a day I certainly remember clearly, and pizzagate has snowballed from there, through unbelievable coincidences in names and events, plus the ineptitudes of the leading cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have been served the Holy Trinity, so to speak, of preemptive attacks, the attack which is coming up prematurely in the form of an overturned election, an attempt to cause the ultimate shitstorm and give our armed forces a reason to subdue us. Pizzagate is just our collective alarm system saying "wake the fuck up idiot"!! And not just for the common person, but for all the armed forces of the USA to see and judge for themselves whose side they are on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate was simply a preemptive wake up on our collective consciousness in preparation for that attack, with the aid of Julian Assange, Snowden, WikiLeaks , the Twitterers and you. We have been given a chance to change the tide against our controllers before they can subject us to their fist.

            We were told by the media (who is owned by the wealthiest people in the world) that terrorism is a legitmate threat to our country. They lied. They simply lied. I have studied 9/11 for a decade and the same people running this pedophile ring in our government, oversaw 9/11.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think that Pizzagate is a psyops operation. If we were being led to have a "war" on pedophilia, I wouldn't have 200 shadowbanned reddit accounts. I don't think that they would have decades of history killing investigators doing work which would spark a so called "war on pedophilia". I see what you are saying, but I do not think you are right.

            This movement is coupled with things like "abolish the CIA" and "institute a new government".

             I agree as well, I also want to add that we have more public support than we realize on a global scale. The pope making a statement on fake news really confirms it. They are doing damage controls and that is when they make mistakes.

              You already fell for their tricks. They created the #FakeNews hashtag to attack independent news on social networks. The pope didn't say that against the Mainstream Media News, he said that against all Independent News on Social Media to help push global censorship on social media.

             Make sure you copy everything and copy links to all videos. I'm sure there are people that didn't want this Psyop to be exposed, and especially not this early. I might have put my life in danger.

            This is spot on.  I have been aware of the intent and motive of the NWO ever since the Franklin Scandal.  Unfortunately, nearly every time I attempt to explain the depth of their plan, it overwhelms people nearly 100% of the time.  Pedophilia and torture is the MORTAR to the wall that the NWO has erected around themselves and between populations and democratic rule.  It's deep, it's real and it will only accelerate from here. Everybody needs to be aware. Everybody needs to own up to reality and face their responsibility in confronting this evil force that is controlling our world.

             I'm a nervous wreck right now. My heart is racing. The elites have been trying so hard to take down America for the last few generations. They are way off schedule, but seems like they may have finally played their final card that we can't do anything about and I have the worst fear that the history of JFK is about to repeat.
