            What I found quite strange with JP's interview was that they had shadows on the left and right of JP and the Interviewer....the shadow on the right looked like a mother with a baby carriage and the one on the left I could not make sense of.....it also reminded me of the CPP "shadow machine"....just seemed odd and not sure of what it might signifiy.

            Whether there is a basement or not is really irrelevant to the whole idea of pizzagate/pedogate. Some had theorized that they engaged in evil activities in the basement, but that was just an idea. Later discoveries of tunnels, related properties (Buck's, Pegasus Museum, etc.) made it clear that the evil acts did not have to occur AT Comet Ping Pong. Further investigation by on-site researchers revealed the presence of many backrooms which were hidden by curtains, with young children regularly moving in and out of these rooms, sometimes unaccompanied, sometimes with adults showing up to the place at late hours. So there are plenty of ways for the sick pedo behavior to still occur on-site in these hidden rooms or by simply going over to Buck's. Buck's is easily connected/accessed as the launch party for CPP literally told guests to enter through Buck's Fishing and Camping:
            <a href="https://artzeeeye.blogspot.com/2006/06/transformer.html">
             http://artzeeeye.blogspot.com/2006/06/transformer.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis did state that the place has a basement in this 2015 article:
            <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/">
             http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/
            </a>
            . Even though he was discussing CPP, he may have been referencing storage at Buck's. Again, it is not a requirement for CPP to have a specific basement in order for the evil that we have uncovered to be real.
           </p>
           <p>
            My theory has been that CPP is more of a transactional front for the buying/selling of CP and for child trafficking. In fact, the on-site computer which was discovered by hackers to apparently house CP showed the computer itself to be a primary piece of evidence...destroyed in the staged shooting incident:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1640039">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1640039
            </a>
            . I tend to believe that it lacks a basement since Alefantis made this a MAJOR point of contention to debunk the pizzagate idea. They created this straw man: "The conspiracy kooks allege that Hillary Clinton has been RUNNING a pedophile ring out of CPP's basement." Nowhere can they document that this is the core of the claim as it is false, but they then claim that Hillary has never set foot in there and that there is no basement...ergo debunked! Because that was the narrative of the debunkers, I tend to think CPP does not have a basement (at least any more).

            Since this was posted after PG broke, I'm flairing it "accuracy in question". Also fwiw, the guy I interviewed that worked at CPP said the basement is in Buck's.

            John Podesta clearly said in his last interview that , (and he seemed very credible) (veeeeery) "i dont even think they actually have a cellar"

              As has been stated already here, I'm very skeptical of this one. Anything after Podesta email leaks should be treated with extra scrutiny.

              Strangely, I was tagged in this post going around Twitter...and I have no idea why. Especially considering I'm dubious about it. Because I was tagged, I can see that it has been gaining traction on Twitter and I'm not sure how I feel about being tagged in it.

            It seems this band is just fucking with people. It was posted in January, so they may have known about the story circulating. When Alefantis said "basement" in the past magazine article it may be that he was referring to his other restaurant, not comet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is real, but there is MUCH better and more compelling evidence than the basement idea.  Example -- Alefantis's own instagram pic is a statue related to pedophilia; Silsby being arrested for kidnapping kids, kids being transported into a warm pool with adult men as "entertainment," Podesta's artwork featuring images of abused and restrained children, and so on.

            Also a few months back I watched a YouTube of three sign carrying protestors outside comet, this was before the false flag shooter setup, in the video James talks openly in answering the protestors questions about how he cans tomatoes in the basement.also,   Funny thing is in John podestas first television interview from a week ago; in his first real public attempt at resetting the narrative , I found it funny how, out of the few facts he chooses to state, he makes sure to mention the restaurant " doesn't even have a basement by the way."

             Came here to say the same thing about Podesta mentioning the basement in the interview. Here's the point in the video where he mentions it and quickly disclaims that there's a basement
             <a href="https://youtu.be/GbSjlHfipao?t=1m58s">
              https://youtu.be/GbSjlHfipao?t=1m58s

            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta said, "...to do a self-investigation of what was going on in the basement of the pizzaria. I don't think the pizzaria had a basement by the way."
            </p>
            <p>
             If there's no basement, why would he mention it in the first place?

             Buck's does have a basement.  The back party room where smaller bands play is down a short flight of steps, but not a basement.
