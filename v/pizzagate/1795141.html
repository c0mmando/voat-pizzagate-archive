            I already posted this with additional information:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1795882">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1795882

           <p>
            Is Alefantis still on the list, still visiting?
           </p>
           <p>
            President Trump has ordered that the white house visitor list be kept secret for at least 5 years.
            <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-14/trump-white-house-will-keep-visitor-logs-secret-from-public">
             https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-14/trump-white-house-will-keep-visitor-logs-secret-from-public
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that James Alefantis was a guest at the white house during the Obama years, and we know when also, because the guest list was public.
           </p>
           <p>
            But that was before pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, the fronted reason is that it is suddenly in the interest of "national security" to keep the names of people who visit the white house secret:
            <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-will-not-release-white-house-visitor-logs/article/2620305">
             http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-will-not-release-white-house-visitor-logs/article/2620305
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people think it is because Trump has his old friend, Felix Sater (interesting last name--sounds like satyr) of the Russian mob, over as well as other criminals:
            <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/04/15/trump-moves-russian-mafia-into-white-house/">
             http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/04/15/trump-moves-russian-mafia-into-white-house/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            More on Sater: " The relationship between Donald Trump and Felix Sater, whose father is a reputed Russian Organized Crime boss, represented a rather direct link between the presidential candidate and Russian Organized Crime. The Russian émigré — a twice-convicted felon with ties to the Mafia — appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.” Trump confused when asked under oath in a 2013 about his relationship to the Russian émigré.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sater served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, “I’ll kill you. I’ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.” Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bayrock Group LLC was a real estate development firm that partnered with Trump on numerous projects after renting office space from the Trump Organization. Sater is a top Bayrock executive in the Bayrock Group, which is headquartered in Trump Tower. The founding chairman of Bayrock is Tevfik Arif, who has reputed Russian organized crime ties. In 2010 he was charged in Turkey for smuggling underage girls into the country for prostitution. Another principal in the deal is Russian émigré Tamir Sapir, who also lives in Trump Tower. Sapir’s executive vice president and top aide, Fred Contini, pled guilty in 2004 to “participating in a racketeering conspiracy with the Gambino crime family for 13 years.”

           <p>
            Like Jared Kushner, Sater is involved with Chabad and was once their "man of the year":

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Tevfik Ariv is another interesting guy, who likes to pimp children:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ariv did the same kind of thing earlier on a different yacht, but was acquitted (!):

           <p>
            I wonder if the secret white house guest list might be hiding Alefantis and his ilk as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does the list have to be secret? They are guest's to the white house, after all.
           </p>
           <p>
            What other names are they hiding?"

            This very discussion confirms to me why President trump prefers to hold high level meetings at Mar A Lago. Snoops and spies crawling the White House. There are two facts to keep in mind-Obama and people like Clinton and their cabal were NOT on the side of the American people so their secrecy was all about coverup. President trump IS passionate about working FOR the good of America-his secrecy is all about protecting national security and the security of those he meets with. Look what happened to JayZ-he met with Trump-was blackballed and sent to a mental hospital for brainwashing. Ditto so many others who were attacked visciously by the tyrants and their mobs just for meeting with Trump or being supportive. It is a Saul Alinsky style social manipulation coup going on out there.

             that's the point exactly and why I made this post (with additional information about Trump's "associates" :

            I personally believe this is being done by the other side....they have already been doing dry runs of Trumps assassination and now they are covering up for who ever is getting inside to do who the hell knows what....Trump has been staying away while the trolls are out pushing the he's vacationing with our tax money and complaining about Malania and Baron being at Trump tower instead.

            I remember there also being an issue with the WH logs with Bush the younger and that male hooker who pretended he was a journalist. He was admitted to the WH several times with no record of him coming back out or something if I remember correctly. His name was
            <a href="http://www.salon.com/2005/02/15/guckert/">
             Guckert
            </a>
            . 
And you know there was lots of chicanery during the Clinton regime too.

            The only relevance to pizzagate is he wants people protected for privacy concerns. Why did he drop on Syria? What did he say? This must be a Snowflake c ia post. I am speaking out to help anybody drawn to this nonsense. Hinder researchers hahahahahahaha lololololol. *sigh WTF are you researching? Dig where it counts. Besides and aside from that, it's interesting News.

            This means nothing. There are many ways around putting someone down on the visitors logs in the first place. Obama was a pro. The logs we do see are incomplete.

             Yes, I figure there are plenty of "visitors" that aren't logged in so it's pretty irrelevant.
