            This subverse is compromised. We need something decentralized.  The mods are trying to control the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            I posted information that mod Phobos_mothership didn't approve of.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            " Post links and reliable sources backing up your claims and support the fact that this is related to pizzagate, and I will stop deleting these posts. But since you probably can't, I probably won't."
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So then I posted this and factually sourced ever single claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then he used this excuse instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            " This is not a Satanism investigation subverse. Read the rules"
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "That is not what I said. I said prove a direct link between ANY of this bullshit and PIZZAGATE. THIS IS NOT A SATANIST INVESTIGATING SUB."
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So at first he said he was censoring me because I wasn't sourcing my claims, and then after I source everything he says that Pizza isn't about Satanism, which we all know is bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's deleting other people's comments as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            " my bad, comment was deleted in error as I was deleting the post (its been a crazy day, if you look at the modlog for removals)"
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And this next comment explains his mentality.
           </p>
           <p>
            " the burden of proof is on you, shillfuck"
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277080">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277080
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the mods attempting to control the narrative. They're the gatekeepers.  Funny how his first excuse was that it was wasn't sourced, then he says Satanism has nothing to do with child sacrifice and pedophila.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is fucking disgusting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Btw, I'm fairly certain that he's the other mod KingKong.
           </p>
           <p>
            I going to start running the mod's comments through a speech analysis program to identify patterns and figure out which mods are using alts to pose as different mods.
           </p>
           <p>
            This subverse is compromised and I'm going to expose everything. I won't give up.
