            No Bolton!  I'll never forget at his party when he left the Bush administration the military ate all the cashews out of the bowls before he got there. Whatever they could do to show their displeasure. Our men and women have been through enough already. Please, no Bolton.

            The General did more for freedom in those few weeks than he did his whole lifetime of service.  His oath was never broken, he saved lives and we owe him deeply.

           <p>
            I would just like to add some of my own ideas here:
           </p>
           <p>
            The background is that this occurred around late December, when Obama formally accused the Russian GRU and FSB of "hacking the US elections," after which he instituted sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats. General Flynn then allegedly called a Russian diplomat, informing him that the Trump administration would take another look at the sanctions once in office, giving the Russians cause to believe that the sanctions would be reversed and playing into the meme that Trump is a stooge of Putin. Unlike all past incidents, Russia did not expel US personnel in a tit for tat move, but did nothing, except for tweeting an image of a "lame duck" from its embassy account.
           </p>
           <p>
            General Flynn was a private citizen when he called the Russian diplomat and he did not officially speak for the US government, potentially violating the Hatch Act. Then Flynn allegedly lied to Pence about what he discussed with the Russian ambassador, and Pence went public to explain for Trump, saying that Flynn did not discuss sanctions with Russian diplomats. Trump and his team then did nothing further. The Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, allegedly then told the Trump White House that Flynn could be leaned on by the Russians, because Flynn
            <em>
             did
            </em>
            discuss sanctions according to information she had (been fed on purpose by Trump?). Trump then again did nothing. A week or two passed the story about Flynn came out in the Washington Post. Later, after Yates (who  was an Obama appointment who was still serving as acting Attorney General) did not agree to argue the case for the 90 day travel ban from the seven Muslim countries on the basis that she thought it was not legal, and Trump fired her. When Trump fired Yates, he did not just accept her resignation, he said she "betrayed the Department of Justice".
            <strong>
             So, Sally Yates was likely a main source of the leak.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Sally Yates was the #2 of Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General under Obama. Lynch had a highly suspicious meeting on the tarmac of an airport with Bill Clinton. Many have speculated that Bill Clinton (ordered?) Lynch to not pursue charges against Hillary Clinton, even if FBI director Comey recommended them, so if Comey recommended charges against Hillary, the charges would come to nothing and Comey would be at high risk under a future Clinton administration.
           </p>
           <p>
            If
            <strong>
             Sally Yates
            </strong>
            is the leaker, then by leaking she has violated 18 U.S. Code § 798 (which carries a potential prison sentence of ten years, plus unlimited fines) as well as possibly 'theft of government property,' which is another ten years maximum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sally Yates may have fallen into a trap set by Trump and Flynn, and will now have to choose between cooperating with the Trump administration in any investigations they pursue against Loretta Lynch, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, or face being prosecuted by Jeff Sessions in an airtight case which has a potential 20 year prison sentence. In other words, General Flynn may have successfully trapped the second in command within Obama's justice department into being forced to cooperate with any future prosecutions they are planning - if they are indeed planning prosecutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            We should all be aware, however, that if there are prosecutions of high level politicians and spies for Pedogate crimes, it will potentially be the most destabilizing event since the Civil War, and the plan may be to simply stop the exploitation of children and then sweep the whole affair under the rug, letting the high-level perpetrators remain free as long as they don't cause trouble. I hope not, but we should be aware of the possibility that this could be the plan.

             Sally Gates may have been "a" leaker but she was not "the" leaker.
            </p>
            <p>
             A trap has been set (maybe Friday's National Guard story) but that wasn't it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, the story they tell about lying to Pence is not why Flynn was fired.

             Outstanding! Great ideas and possibilities.  Trump is certainly capable of "trapping the rats".
