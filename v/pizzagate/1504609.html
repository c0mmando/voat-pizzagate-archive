<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458823">Wanted: VOAT moderator to appear at pizza gate debate</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Looking for a moderator who has the balls to show in person, come out from behind their internet security blanket</em> and participate in a fact based debate about the legitimacy of the accusations being leveled against the principles of pizza gate. This will take place in Washington DC at a public location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original request is asking for someone to come to DC, lose their anonymity, and become the face of #pizzagate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once <em>we</em> have confirmed participation of a leader of the pizza gate community, we will set up a venue (public) and a date and time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the OP identifies himself as &quot;we&quot;, meaning either James, an employee, or legal team and they are seeking out the &quot;leader(s)&quot; of pizzagate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>we</em> can get you a plane ticket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again with the &quot;we&quot; and an offer to pay for a plane ticket.  That\'s how bad they want to identify someone with the added bonus of getting someone\'s name and address immediately upon purchase details.  After nobody took the bait, they have basically quit posting and are simply lurking.  In several articles James has made it known that he and others are lurking all of these sites.</p>
<p>Lately, I\'ve read a few articles on Comet and what their current PUBLIC tactics are:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Kl5KL">Fake News Onslaught Targets Pizzeria as Nest of Child-Trafficking</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To combat the fake news tide, Mr. Alefantis has contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local police, and he has asked Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit to remove the articles.</p>
<p>Parents, who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution, have hired lawyers to get the photos removed.</p>
<p>After employees and Mr. Alefantis complained to Reddit about how Comet Ping Pong was being targeted on the site, the #pizzagate discussion thread posted a warning that revealing personal information about individuals was prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/BUjkZ">Comet Ping Pong Has Legal Options, But They Won’t Make “Pizzagate” Go Away</a> from Dec 9, 2016</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alefantis, who declined to comment for this article, has not said publicly whether he intends to take legal action. But if he did, the first big questions would be who to sue, and how to break through their user names to find the actual people behind the Pizzagate campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated above, getting someone to show up at a &quot;debate&quot; does this easily, especially if they purchase a plane ticket for them.  If anyone (especially a mod) were to show up at a &quot;debate&quot; they will DEFINITELY be the fall guy and get hammered in the media.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Imagine Comet Ping Pong v. ‘John Doe,\'” Clare says. “File the action, and you use that lawsuit to take some discovery and issue subpoenas to Reddit and try to identify specific speakers who you believe are at the root of this.”</p>
<p>But Clare, whose firm represented former University of Virginia Dean Nicole Eramo in her recent successful libel case against Rolling Stone, says that a court would likely side with Comet Ping Pong in getting social-media companies to turn over the relevant information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the other way they could get users info (email, IP address, etc) and her professional opinion a judge would require websites with pizzagate info turn over user data.</p>
<p>But THIS is the most important paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reddit shut down a page devoted to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory on November 22, but rather than end the chatter, users of that page have largely retreated to a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">r/The_Donald</a>, a section populated by President-elect Donald Trump‘s most fanatical supporters, or decamped to <strong>Voat.com</strong>, a Reddit-like message board with even less moderation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>VOAT is specifically mentioned and we know that EVERYBODY is monitoring all sites.  This confirms they know about VOAT and this very sub.</p>
<p>So that being said, how does one defend themselves against the onslaught of counts of libel?  VERY SIMPLE actually but will take a little work.  We need to gather into a single thread/document/webpage a list of all pizza places busted AND REPORTED ON BY THE MSM for child porn and/or pedophilia.  This adds credibility to the claim that this isn\'t about a specific business and pizza places are often a cover.  We also need to report on all government/political busts REPORTED BY THE MSM.  I\'m thinking like Terry Bean, Jeffrey Epstein, Carlos Carrion (NASA), Anderson Cooper\'s report on the 5,200 Pentagon Employees that went unprosecuted, the National Enquirer article about Hillary fixer arranging sex for her with men and women, the cover up while Hillary was secretary of state and one of her agents got in trouble on a trip for prostitution (rumored underage), etc.</p>
<p>If we gather a single document with each individual case in a bullet list with links to articles, if and when they come after VOAT users, moderators, or VOAT site owners, instead of trying to explain a bunch of theories and connections, simple CONFIRMED and VERIFIED evidence can be produced.  Added to that all of the information we have on Comet (pictures, videos, etc) it is pretty tough to prosecute when what is presented is the stuff that JAMES and his associates made public on their very own, that almost all of the articles fail to acknowledge exists.  When you add the Podesta emails with coded messages and the verified FBI list of code words, it shouldn\'t go very far.  Most importantly, they have to PROVE that the person they are suing is the originator of the libel claim.</p>',
