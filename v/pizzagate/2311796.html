             I don’t know how to start a new link... does anyone have any information about Father Pucci abusing boys in the Pittsburgh PA diocese? I’m asking for a friend whose son was shot in the head of a catholic school bus. The boy survived however the shooter shot him self and was ritually abused. I have a copy of the police report
            </p>
            <p>
             Also could someone start a new subject for me. I’m not computer savvy. Thank you

            Pizzagate is about the tunnels under the block of land that Comet Ping Pong and Fox sit on. I know it will change as people are exposed, but pizza gate was about the tunnels under the pizzaspot. Isn't that strip of D.C. owned by a Saudi?
           </p>
           <p>
            Edited to add- also, that the tunnels led to Pegasus. Pegasus is involved in the Embassy Art Program which is how a lot of this human trafficking gained it's steam. Any who! Nothing to see here!

             Fair enough, and I get where you're coming from with this about the tunnels, but I recall reading somewhere about how many satanic crimes get zero traction because when you remove the satanism from the crime, which was the motive of the crime, the case for prosecution falls apart. Those that perpetrate this sickness will try and turn "religion" into a hot potato just so you can look away from the actual cause of the behaviours but that was the intent of calling things like Thelema or Satanism a
             <strong>
              religion
             </strong>
             -so that it will have some form of protected status when all the evidence points to the satanism. The MO in a crime is always the most important thing to keep in awareness IMO.

              It's her own baby, and she admitted she has it in an interview. I wish I kept that but I'm sure it's here somewhere on voat like you said.

               Thanks for verifying.  I have read it more than once or twice.  It is still sick.  But what do we expect from her.  Some suspect her to be the daughter of Aleister Crowley.  What a father he would make.  That would explain the baby in a jar.  Eleanor Rigby kept something in a jar by the door.  Not the same exactly but odd nevertheless.

                   Well, that is a pretty good case to prove that she is his daughter.  I think the media has been kind to her by painting her as having really no voice but I believe there is a lot more going on with her than we are allowed to see.  You don't have a father like that and sit around knitting and baking cookies for the grandchildren.  If that is what they want us to believe, I am not into it.

           <p>
            So in addition to the children they kill during the ceremonies, they require additional body parts for these ceremonies. Didn't know that. I always thought they would always kill on spot (for the pleasure of torturing someone to death) and then use the body parts of the people killed.

             yes, unfortunately. Just on principle I refuse to actually look at any of the "magical working texts". I feel like it's just a bridge too far for my soul's progress if you know what I mean. I will admit that I did own in the past several books on magick that show exact information on what was done, but I got rid of them long ago. From memory, each "demon/intelligence/angel" requires different sacrifice I think. Since I wasn't interested in "conjuring" anything I didn't focus on what was what, but I think that these things each have multiple names including Molech/Baal.

            And what you're leaving out are the number of SRA'd children that say they gave birth during a ritual or had the baby aborted and delivered into the hands of the abusers. It's sometimes where these body brokers get their hands on fetuses or the members of the cabal also. Remember the pineal gland.

             The only reason these facts don't convince you is because its not in the nature of whites to machinate and cheat and be greedy. Whites can be convinced that Utopia is when there are no whites: just a "mocha" colored mix.
