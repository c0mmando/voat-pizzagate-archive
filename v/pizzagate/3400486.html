           <p>
            Option #1. JE killed by another inmate, meaning perp got out of own cell, entered JE's locked cell, overpowered and killed JE, returned to own locked cell and successfully feigned innocence
           </p>
           <p>
            Option #2 JE committed suicide by successfully  fashioning noose out of strong material,  effectively maneuvered  himself to cut off air supply and broke several bones in his throat in the process
           </p>
           <p>
            Option #3. Black hats successfully engendered an assassination attempt wherein strictest supervision and isolation were overcome and JE was murdered by staff at MCC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Option #4. JE was extracted out of MCC in early AM hours by white hats for as yet unidentified reasons.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-should-be-recognized-as-ludicrous">
            1 should be recognized as ludicrous

            2 is likewise not credible for several reasons, not the least of which JE's personality type was extremely narcissistic, unlikely to kill self

            3 seems to have fired much of the public's imagination (thank you, decades of Hollywood fantasies), but here is a sure fire way to know #3 is not valid ... you will not see numerous "suicides", "heart attacks", "car crashes", "falling out of helicopters" (this, BTW, was the fate of 2 of the highest trained FBI agents shortly after the Boston Marathon " bombing") or any of the myriad mishaps we have all seen dating back at least as far as November, 1963 to people even peripherally associated with major  events of this nature.
           </h1>
           <p>
            Any supposed insider involved in killing JE would themselves be terminated toot sweet ... and they would (should?) be well aware of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            So ... we are left with #4 as a possible happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reports in the NY Post had rumors of Barr visiting the MCC 2 weeks before JE's "demise".
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a very legitimate sounding 4chan post at 0733 from a supposed insider claiming JE was removed from his cell via wheelchair just after 0415 count and removed from the building via a trip van.
           </p>
           <p>
            JE was removed from the building at least twice for court appearances, so I do not know why anyone would consider it a big deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Biggest challenge, if - indeed - JE was extracted by white hats who wanted it to remain a secret, would be to concoct and maintain a credible narrative to have the wider public remain misinformed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Motives/purposes for all of this are unknown.

              I have litterally never seen the phrase "tout suite" written out -- had zero idea it is a borrowed Frenchism.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've learned something today... thank you! :D
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the JE "suicide"........ I agree with the OP in that JE was too narcissistic/ egotistic to kill himself.
             </p>
             <p>
              The optimist in me is screaming that JE was extracted by "White Hats," who have before told us that "disinformation is necessary."
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope they're waterboarding the piss out of him until he names every person who has ever set foot on his kiddy-diddling island &gt;:(

              You can't technically torture someone who is legally dead.........right? ;)

            I've posted previously on this. Some other events where surveillance cams were not working: The White House when Vince Foster abandoned his half-eaten lunch in his office and ran off to get Arkancided in the park; The Pont du Almy tunnel in Paris when Princess Diana and Dodi were murdered. Though the French claimed the cameras were ordinarily switched off at night. The Paris Ritz, owned by Dodi's pops, did have cams working to see them leave; The street cam at Comet Ping Pong was turned away at some point, then turned back; Did any cams catch all or part of the last moments of the journeys of Seth Rich, Andrew Breitbart or Michael Hastings. There's also the matter of the FBI seizing all the surveillance vids around the Pentagon on 9/11. After a much public pressure they did release a few seconds of "something" zipping across a highway at low altitude.

             Michael Hastings' death was captured on surveillance camera, though not in great detail. It was on YouTube; I don't know if it is still up.

            The article states, "It was not immediately clear why some video footage outside Epstein's cell is too flawed for investigators to use.."

            Maybe because it might have shown what really happened.
