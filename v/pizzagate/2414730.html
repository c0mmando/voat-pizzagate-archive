<h1>The Operator</h1>
<h1>David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood</h1>
<p>The Roxy had its grand opening on September 20, 1973. It was to be a major success and broke Doug Weston\'s monopolistic hold on the Los Angeles club scene. It was quite an achievement for a man who was only thirty years old.</p>
<p>But on that night, something happened to Geffen that was far more important than any business deal he had ever consummated. He found true love, but one that would eventually almost crush him. ,,,</p>
<p>Geffen had met Cher more than ten years previously at Phil Spector\'s studio, where she was a backup performer. As her star ascended, he had once tried unsuccessfully to convince her to record a Jackson Browne song. But tonight he was seeing her in a different light, and love was in the air.  ...  
</p>
<p>Sonny Bono and Cher were at that moment the most popular TV couple in America, thanks to the success of their CBS variety series, The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Now in its third season, the show was a ratings powerhouse, and the couple was wowing viewers with silly sketches and rollicking renditions of their saccharine hit &quot;I Got You Babe.&quot; They broke box-office records when they played Las Vegas and had earlier that year appeared on the Academy Awards....</p>
<p>After a moment, Lou Adler arrived, and soon joined Cher and Geffen in the dining room. Geffen was funny, Cher thought, and she laughed at his jokes. Adler soon excused himself to check on things at the Roxy.</p>
<p>After dinner, Geffen and Cher retired to the living room. There, America\'s beloved TV comedienne opened up her heart and spilled a host of painful secrets she had been keeping for months. Her marriage to Sonny Bono, she said, was in tatters. On television, Sonny and Cher appeared to be the perfect couple. Off camera, however, they were barely civil to each other. They had moved into separate wings of the Carolwood house and now exchanged few words.</p>
<p>Cher told Geffen that Bono was a dictator who had made her life a living hell. He had destabilized her to the point that she could hardly eat or sleep. She was anemic and had been driven so hard by the grind of TV tapings, Las Vegas engagements, and recording sessions that she frequently fell ill. From time to time, the exhaustion forced her to be hospitalized.  ...</p>

She was anemic and had been driven so hard by the grind of TV tapings, Las Vegas engagements, and recording sessions that she frequently fell ill.   ...</p>
<p>Geffen told Cher that she had to demand that Bono tear down Cher Enterprises. There could be no deal, Geffen said, unless Bono agreed to start anew with contracts that gave Sonny and Cher equal votes in setting the agenda and freedom to do outside projects. ....</p>
<p>Geffen hired Milton A. &quot;Mickey&quot; Rudin, a fierce Hollywood attorney known for the work he had done for Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball. He told Rudin that Cher never meaningfully assented to the terms of the contract. He also maintained there was an obvious conflict of interest with Spiegel representing both Bonos, now that their marriage was collapsing.  ,,,</p>
<p>Back in Los Angeles, Mickey Rudin drew up divorce papers charging Bono with causing &quot;involuntary servitude.&quot; Cher held that Bono &quot;unlawfully dominated and controlled my business interests and career.&quot;</p>
<p>Bono was shocked at Cher\'s accusations and believed that she and Geffen had manufactured the notion of him as a slave master simply as a public-relations ploy. He countersued Cher for fourteen million dollars, demanding damages for the projected earnings that he would lose as a result of a split. Bono next dropped a thirteen-million-dollar lawsuit on Geffen, charging him with interfering with his contractual relationship with his wife and seeking a temporary restraining order.</p>
<p>As the legal wrangling was going on, Geffen was talking to CBS, promising that if the network would release Cher from her contractual obligations, he would return to negotiate a new solo show the minute she was ready to work again. CBS had no choice: Without Cher, there was no TV program. They decided to pull the plug on the show, avoid a costly legal fight, and cross their fingers that Geffen would keep his word.</p>
<p>News of the separation made the front pages of many papers across the nation. Sonny Bono\'s life with Cher was coming to an end. But his battles with David Geffen were just beginning. .... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum up, Cher was hurting and Geffen fed her a stupid line to explain him being. Yeah, the right woman will change that ... No, the MONEY will change it! And if he had to screw the Pope, he would have done so. I\'d also like to point out that Sonny &amp; Cher\'s daughter Chastity was three of four at the time (born on March 4, 1969). Remember when we all thought that transgenders were just born that way? No, it seems they\'re shaped by interfering monsters. It\'s what locks are for. Then there\'s Cher and the very real possibility that she sold her out. Why do I say that? Well, because the affair with Geffen culminated in Cher getting a BUTTERFLY tattooed on her butt. </p>

<p>A Monarch butterfly? Was Chastity the sacrifice though? She looked so much like Sonny and there was fame waiting for Cher. And because of her deal with the The Devil, she\'s received the de rigueur Oscar all these whores receive -- even though she\'s the worst actress in the world. And the PR machine churns out stories of Cher\'s conquests even though she\'s admits to being a lesbian. But the affairs she\'s sad to have had provide a cover for such stars as Tom Cruise. But let\'s get back to Geffie. </p>
<p>From the above link, there\'s a synopsis of how he pulled off the miracle of starting an empire. </p>

<p>The 1974 Grammys were a heady night for David Geffen. He had risen meteorically in the record industry during the previous half-decade, and that night he had a major star on his arm: Cher.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, Geffen had entered the music publishing side of the business when, as singer-songwriter Laura Nyro\'s manager, he created a publishing company for her songs. That was his first big break as a businessman. He sold the company to CBS for $4.5 million in stock in 1969. Geffen got half, and that allowed him to form Asylum Records with a roster that would come to include Joni Mitchell and the Eagles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don Henley? Joni Mitchell? In the other link, you\'ll see Linda Ronstadt mentioned (along with Elton John). Yup, this is proof that the conjecture about Henley being the A-lister singer in CDAN\'s article as true. This article: </p>

           Relevancy: Geffen is always where the pedos are. The first thousand times it could be a coincidence, but then you have to wonder.

            The 1974 Grammys were a heady night for David Geffen. He had risen meteorically in the record industry during the previous half-decade, and that night he had a major star on his arm: Cher.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the late 1960s, Geffen had entered the music publishing side of the business when, as singer-songwriter Laura Nyro's manager, he created a publishing company for her songs. That was his first big break as a businessman. He sold the company to CBS for $4.5 million in stock in 1969. Geffen got half, and that allowed him to form Asylum Records with a roster that would come to include Joni Mitchell and the Eagles.

           Don Henley? Joni Mitchell? In the other link, you'll see Linda Ronstadt mentioned (along with Elton John). Yup, this is proof that the conjecture about Henley being the A-lister singer in CDAN's article as true. This article:

            Geffen hated The Operator and he paid to have author Tom King murdered for writing the book. King was poisoned and Geffen paid to have it done.

             Oh, really? Well, there's another post right there. It was a great article ... and probably a great book .... so no wonder he reacted that way. But then again, DG seems to react that way to everything and anything. If you're breathing and not under his control, he probably wants you dead. Found some stuff in Datalounge last night about his controlling ways. Scary stuff. DG is definitely scary and yet Cher is still going strong? It's even more reason to wonder exactly what went on and what role she played/is playing that is so important to him.

              I read about Geffen killing Tom King on Crazy Days And Nights also another site can't recall but he hated the book and Tom King was young and healthy there was no reason for him to drop dead it was an obvious death by poison made to look like natural cause of death. I want Geffen arrested and prosecuted but he's so wealthy he can pay off any prosecutor with so much money they can't resist the bribe to let him go maybe Trump can nail Geffen finally.

                  Here is the new Geffen blind from Data Lounge and Crazy Days and Nights blog he definitely had Tom King killed
                 </p>
                 <pre><code>187. The Cold Case Payouts: What do you do if you are one of the richest, most powerful men Hollywood has ever seen? Well, if someone does something you don't like and the entire world is discussing it and you, then you take matters into your own hands. Almost two decades ago, that is exactly what happened. The person who did the something the whole world was discussing was found dead. No reason was ever given. None. Every single person interviewed said the deceased person had been in perfect health and took no drugs. Every single person interviewed was shocked that the person died. This was not a nobody who died. Our powerful man in Hollywood had him killed. Six months after the death, the two police detectives who had been handling the case got themselves contracts paying them $500K a year for 5 years working for a shell company owned by the powerful man. Probably just a coincidence. Before they left the force, they made sure the case was closed and that they took anything that could possibly lead back to the powerful man. David Geffen/Tom King

Also, geffen was Ahmet Erteguns protege. Ahmet is the link between old world nobility, D.C. diplomats, and Music Industry Mk Slaves.

            Lovin' it. Great work. So great to see people taking this seriously and putting the work in. You can really see the effort.  It's good to see someone taking the pieces of these CDAN blinds and creating a cohesive storyline together even BEFORE the BIG BREAKS come, I was thinking the same myself but I am glad to see someone else trying to take those twisted stories and making sense of them for us here in CT land, it's not an easy task and I commend you for it, taking that jumbled throbbing mess that is Hollywood and chunking it down into digestible pieces so that we can see, these assholes are simply just human pigs, not some big powerhouse, it only appears that way, because like the wizard of Oz, the man behind the curtain can afford alot of toys to make himself appear untouchable, but all in all he is nothing but a little man.

            I find it interesting as well to learn that Geffen was not primarily GAY. The possibility of Cher's child Chastity being around this kind of freewheeling sexually 'liberated' and oversexed 60's and 70's deviants and subsequent molestation very well may have decided her sexual orientation, as a subconscious show of disgust for Geffen or whoever else.

            Once again, awesome thread, keep peeling back that curtain.

             Hey, thanks for taking time to comment and for the good words.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm convinced that transgender is caused by sexual trauma. It fractures the psyche and causes self-identification to go askew. There's also another phenomenon that happens that is rampant among the cabal victims. If I ever get time, I'll post what I've found.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, we get a glimpse behind the curtain, but we also got a glimpse as to why the political landscape looks the way it does. The political opponents have been culled. This includes members of this cabal's own party. Why? Because they were probably independent thinkers who would have put up a fight. They won't allow that. And what you see and hear is the result.

              Very well said.  It's important to remember that this struggle is about saving the children yes,  that is a worthy and righteous goal and should never be abandoned. But this battle also extends much further than just the abuse of children,  it encompasses each and every one of into the age old paradigm of the battle between good and evil.  It puts the responsibility of it all squarely back onto each and every one of us on a personal and introspective interpersonal level based on our own deeds in this life.  For longer than we can imagine,  children have been used to compromise politicians so that they could be controllable in their respective governments,  passing or bypassing laws that effect each and every one of us on levels unfathomable. Laws that have made or broken certain echelons of society. Once people understand how deeply this effects their everyday day to day lives the stakes become much much higher.

               Completely correct.
              </p>
              <p>
               In freeing the children, we free ourselves. The entire system is meant to enslave us. While they talk about diversity, the agenda is to reduce everything to one government ... one ruling class ... a handful of scumsucking Cannibal Elites making all our decisions for us.

                Yes.  Moreso, child sexual and ritual abuse is their Achilles Heal. Being the toughest and most difficult subject to research because of the horrors that await also provides them with a cover however it is essential to their plans and their lifestyle. They NEED it for their homage to their God (symbolically and metaphorically, I will not even entertain the metaphysical if it exists), they NEED it for their espionage and blackmail, and they NEED it for their frivolous and dangerous pursuit of the alchemical 'elixir of life'. Understanding their dependence on these horrors compromises their safety, weakens them and makes them the scared little pieces of shit they really are.

               Also,  by understanding Geffen and his role in creating music and entertainment,  essentially Roman Bread and Circus's,  folly to keep the masses distracted from any real matters of political importance and responsibility,  and the real role of the entire complex to not only distract but steer, with the element of infused Paperclip nazi propagandists, has worked amazingly well.  The population is a mess.  Through this form of mass communication and technique,  repetitive themes,  peripheral and direct suggestive hypnotic triggers,  we are all programmed multiples with belief systems programmed inside that clash with each other.  We are polarized,  Bi-polar entities that believe one way and act another. It is from our Frankfurt model rockefeller /carnegie public school system,  our entertainment industry,  and our infiltrated government.

               It's all a trick to demoralize us into thinking it is us as a society that is wrong,  it is,  because of the slow long process of brainwashing that have turned us into beasts.

                The trick is revealed and the spell falls away when you know that you were once an empty vessel and THEY tarnished it not you. You were once whole,  innocent, free until they tampered with you with their magick,  to bring you up into a lifetime of blame.  In that sense God understands and you are forgiven for the sins that were unnaturally brought upon you.  Yet as the old adage goes it doesn't come without repentance and atonement.

             Exactly. And Geffen had the freedom. Sonny had moved out. And Geffen? He wanted to put a pyramidal skylight in the house?

              Cher eventually won the rights to Carolwood in her divorce from Bono. By then, she had already taken up with record executive David Geffen, who helped guide her solo career -- thankfully, his plans (as related in a 1975 Esquire story) to open up the house by installing a pyramid skylight never saw the light.

                 Horrid.  Just Plain Horrid.  I think it was somewhat obvious, at least to me.  If Sonny was going to open an investigation into the Drug Running or about WACO we can guess who.  But then of course it will only be a guess.  These people know who it is  especially T Gunderson.

                    They are playing god and feel they have the right to, but they don't. They've just created an underground where all things perverse reign. Honestly, I don't see any of them being taken down. I'm getting despondent again. I don't care how many arrests are promised, all I see are false flags and hired little liars winning.

                     </a>
                     There are articles and advice on how to spot crisis actors and almost all of those videos have been taken down.  THEY are worried.  They do not want us spreading the Truth.  These videos were proof and they are disappearing.  We must keep spreading the word and archiving everything.  There are good comments in here and I am hoping that they will at least make others think.

                     I think they might be real arrests (or even staged)  More crisis actors.  I have been sitting on the fence, but I am about to get down.  There has been nothing done to convince me that things are moving in our direction.

                      I agree. All I see is a known crisis actor starting demonstrations?!!!! This even with him laughing with a bunch of other crisis actors and giving the wrong time in a video he made while the Parkland shooter was supposed to be active. I mean come on! Even with ALL this evidence, people are still not willing to believe he is a paid stooge! And he's not even a good paid stooge!

STOP ALREADY! Remember back a couple of months ago when we thought Weinstein was a big story and a couple of weeks ago when that memo was supposed to get everybody arrested?

                         Yeah, Corey is the smart one.  People are so dumb sending him money. As they say, he will be laughing all the way to the bank.  Really.  Maybe he will get all the material for his movie by reading CDAN Blinds.

             Speaking of, J Bon Jovi just sold his Manhattan condo for $15m.

             Interesting that SO MANY celebrities lately seem to be selling their mansions for a huge cash injections (Ill try and compile a list when I have a moment.) Its almost as if they need the money to hmmm, I dunno. Like, settle a potential lawsuit or...make a bunch of problems go away fast or something. But what do I know? Nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             ANYWAY. Also from that link was this:
             <em>
              "In April, they'll [Bon Jovi] be inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, even though he had insisted in the past that his group was being barred for personal reasons. Guitarist Richie Sambora, who exited a few years ago, will reportedly perform with them..."
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              "Barred for personal reasons...."
             </em>
             Huh?

              I'm continually wondering what lurid details lurk behind this woman Cher and her entourage,  I would dare say a woman of her status and fame,  along with the generation she lived it in,  has missed many experiences morally advisable or not.

              What do you think about the Sonny Bono cause of death?  Murder is my opinion.  I lost all respect for Cher when she hooked up will Greg Allman.  Nothing like walking around with two butt-erflies on your cheeks.

               obviously suspicious! But I do not know much about Sonny. I read he was abusive to her like the Ike/Tina situation, and thought maybe she had him bumped off? Did not know anything about DGs involvement!

                From what I read in the post and links, Cher seemed to be lying about that and his wife after Cher, Mary, was having an affair when she wanted a divorce and lied about his drug taking.  The coroner did not find drugs in his system.  You should read the redditreport linked in the post.  Wow.
