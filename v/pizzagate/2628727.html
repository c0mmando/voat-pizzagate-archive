<p>True Pundit personnel, who have served in varying intelligence capacities and agencies for the United States, were floored this morning when combing the Wikileaks database of John Podesta emails.</p>
<p>Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, in a Feb. 9, 2016 email makes reference to an assassination. Using the term “wet work,” Podesta sent a cryptic email to Democratic strategist and heavyweight consultant Steve Elmendorf. The term wet work is an intelligence slang term with Russian roots. Defined it means to assassinate a public figure, diplomat or someone of political note.</p>
<p>Elmendorf replied to Podesta’s mysterious reference:</p>
<p>“I am all in Sounds like it will be a bad nite , we all need to buckle up and double down”</p>
<p>We do not want to go down the conspiracy rabbit hole here based on one or two comments. However, Podesta’s email
was sent on a Tuesday. By Friday, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia was found dead at a remote Texas resort. To say Scalia’s death was suspicious is putting it mildly.</p>
<p>-No autopsy
-No medical examiner on site to decipher cause of death
-No U.S. Marshal protection detail accompanying Scalia
-No functioning CCTV cameras on day of death
-Scalia found clothed on bed with pillow over face
-Scalia’s body mysteriously cremated before it could be examined
-Resort owner large Obama contributor
-And the list goes on and on</p>
<p>We are not alleging Podesta or Elmendorf played a role in Scalia’s death. That is a large leap and making such a leap is how news sites get a reputation for spreading conspiracy theories. But neither are doing themselves any favors by discussing the topic via email either. And the timing cannot be ignored, even by partisan detectives. Simply put: The optics look very bad.</p>
<p>When public officials and Beltway insiders, especially those working for Hillary Clinton, start and correspond to an assassination-themed email thread, they open themselves up wide for criticisms. Likewise this is the definition of poor judgment by both parties, discussing anything related, jokingly or not, to assassination. Podesta, after all, is running a campaign for the presidency of the United States and therefore his communications are held to a higher standard. And in a functioning Republic where law and order prevail, the FBI would want some answers too to the questions were are posing here. Any competent investigator would, based on the troubling timing alone. But, not Director James Comey’s FBI. Not this FBI.</p>
<p>Just a week ago it seemed likewise unbelievable that Clinton would seek to kill Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange with a military drone per True Pundit. The main stream media quickly labeled the meticulously-documented report as just another right-wing conspiracy ginned up to boost Donald Trump. Until Clinton said she couldn’t recall calling for Assange’s alleged assassination.</p>
<p>If Scalia was in fact murdered, it will remain a secret under this current regime and a subsequent Clinton presidency. That’s not a conspiracy theory.</p>

             The "wet works" email has another explanation.

            It's like the "nothing better than this" email after getting an asset out of North Korea, inconclusive and likely innocent.

              Because this is actually what they were discussing.  The Vineyard is Martha's Vineyard where that photo was taking place.
             </p>
             <p>
              And Podesta surely knows what "wet works" means.  It's quite clear, he's using in metaphorically as he is executing a political "hit" on Bernie.
             </p>
             <p>
              The funny part is Scalia did not die near a winery or a vineyard.  That was completely 100% made up.
             </p>
             <p>
              The whole Podesta-Scalia theory is really mind numblingly dumb.  So you execute Scalia.......and then .......?  What.  You don't force your pick on the bench?  And you choose Podesta as your point guy?  The Seth Rich theory is even dumber.  Do you folks even check the dates on these emails?

            Podesta paid for the hit on Scalia it was disguised as a movie producer (the hitman) telling John how much "the movie" would cost to be produced in the precise location in southwest Texas where the ranch was located that Scalia went to. Podesta approved the hit when he wrote "I didn't think wetworks meant a pool party at Martha's Vineyard" that is evidence that convicts Podesta he should have been arrested long ago for this as soon as Trump was sworn in Podesta should have been arrested the very next day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scalia was a very bad guy so don't mourn for him he ruled in favor of keeping innocent people in prison "because they were convicted in court and even with DNA evidence proving they are innocent they should stay in prison" that is what Scalia wrote in a Supreme Court opinion I hope he is burning in Hell right now for that. He was also into raping boys he went to that ranch in the middle of nowhere for the sole purpose of raping boys and the best guess on who killed him was a teenage boy who went to his room and killed him maybe with poison that is how they did it. Arrest Podesta and the hitman who sent the boy in to kill Scalia it's a very easy case to prove in court.

            If Podesta was really involved in this, the people surrounding Clintons are stupid and reckless. Scalia was old and in bad health, he wouldn't have lived much longer anyway. It gives me hope that these corrupt losers are so stupid.

             The fact that he was old and in bad health and especially that his family didn't request an autopsy makes me wonder if he just had a heart attack. Clinton's people were reckless and stupid, so it wouldn't surprise me if Podesta handled it himself. They operated outside the law for so long they never thought they would be caught. If the Clinton body count is correct one more is nothing.

               Never heard that.  He got his start in McCarthy or McGovern's campaign,  though some think he's the "Skippy" of the Sister Cesnik case.

             And lets not forget the password of JP.  Also the fact that Obama knew HC was operating on a private server.  They thought no one would never be able to hack into it, or that it was all captured.  So ridiculous.  The only thing that has saved them is a corrupt FBI, and LE.

            Amen.  It was hoped that Obama could get in an appointment to the Supreme Court before his reign was over..

             I don't believe Obama was ever serious about an appointment. It would have opened the door for more speculation into the death of Scalia. The plan was to wait for Hillary and storm clouds to pass. After all, they thought she was a shoo-in.
