            Sadly I believe this, can't make omelet without breaking some eggs. I could see them killing some just to show that it was "real". Not like we can request a toxicity report on the dead children, just gotta take it at face value fuck the facts right?

            my first impression as well. sell those on the market, the stuff that doesn't get on tv, like the murdering beforehand. if george webb is right, all that stuff is filmed, goes hand in glove with organ harvesting. it's so fuquing bizarre to even just write that.

            Thanks for these insights; can you tell other medical orgs, spread the news quick? Get this out there, everywhere. This is forensics, the kinds of stuff that works in courts. This was a planned "Ready, Fire, Aim!" situation, if caught they will use fog of war card. , if this is verified, all this footage could be crucial, for professional accuracy; might also lead to footage of snuffing of the kids, which they probably sell on porn market. hope you are paying attention to george webb.  thx again.

            "Actor George Clooney knew that the organization Swedish Doctors for Human Rights had cited the “White Helmets” as child killers when he  produced the Oscar winning propaganda video that may well have led to this latest outrage.  The organization, SWEDHR is very real, their work authoritative and their indictment of the White Helmets for killing children in order to stage propaganda videos would have been known to Clooney and Netflix.  They went ahead anyway.  Why?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Reality Snuff Films and REality News prop? If they're killing these kids, then making videos of them as news, it sure means they filmed the murders as well.  psycho doesn't really cover it, if it's true.

            I read that the majority of "victims" also were kidnap victims from about a week ago, from Hama? I haven't found confirmation anywhere though.

            Randomly, as I was watching some of the scenes I was troubled as all the children's pants appeared to be pulled down? I couldn't understand that at all.

            Thank you, I don't work peds but the injection seems a bit high to me and too close to the sternum. And yes the moving around is bullshit. If you put the needle in the wrong place you remove and reinsert. I've never in my life seen even the worse nurse or doctor move a needle around like that. Not even in clinical would someone do something that silly. The needle is already inserted into tissue, moving it around would not place it in a different are, you're just damaging the surrounding tissue you've already placed the syringe into.

            What about the fact that Trump has been a good cabal lapdog and launched an attack on Syria..
What do we all think of that..
I have absolutely zero faith in this total fucking loser any more.. I'm done with him.. he is a fucking idiot.
And I say this after months of giving him a fair go, holding some hope that he might break the mold and somehow be truely uncompromised and on our side. I defended this arsehole against all my friends and family.
Reminder: he has never said the word "pizzagate".
Shortly after been elected in an interview he said he wouldn't go after Hillary and that he didnt want to hurt her.
I just want to say here.. fuck you Trump.. and Podesta and Hillary and Soros and all the other parasitical career fuckheads and celebrity sellouts.

             4D chess dude. All that Trump did was launch a bunch of cruise missiles against an empty airfield with no casualties. He hasn't even been in office three months nor does he even have full control of the executive branch yet so his hands are still somewhat tied. Like any smart leader he knows what he can control and what he can't and acts accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
             This action does a number of things. It shows he's not to be fucked with. It satisfies the neocons and warmongers temporarily. It opens up the possibility of US-Russian collaboration on the original gas attack which stinks of false flag. And it completely destroys whatever media narrative was being cooked up for this. Because you can bet that they didn't expect this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump may have never said the word Pizzagate in public but he's known about it for a lot longer than any of us.

             OK,for you guys that don't understand 3D chess:
            </p>
            <p>
             The Satanistic Cabal wants to bring Trump down by linking him to Russia ,it's about the only chance they have to bring him down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump "attacking "Syria would complicate things for the Cabal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Facts: White Helmets involved,Syian Observatory for Human Richts(SOHR) brings us the news,both signs of a False flag operation.
            </p>
            <p>
             So,everybody ,including Trump,knows the gas Attack in Syria was a false flag
            </p>
            <p>
             Russia was warned about last night's  attack: a small airfield was destroyed(was it?),and allegedly there were 5 dead Syrians in the attack with 30 tomahawks.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Wow,that's one big motherfucking gamechanger,"think most Zombies
            </p>
            <p>
             But no, Trump is putting up a great show: Trump is against Russia,and attacks Assad.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ones that have the biggest problem now are Trump's enemies,because their narrative falls apart.
            </p>
            <p>
             you guys don't understand the Geo-political implications of this situation,
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump,Russia,Syria,Turkey,Iran and Israel are actually collaborating on the Middle east.
            </p>
            <p>
             How is it possible Assad is still in power after 5 years of war,with allegedly the US,the EU,saudi Arabia,,Turkey and Israel all wanting him gone,why didn't they take him out before the Russians stepped in?
            </p>
            <p>
             Answer ;they don't, because after all they all have the same enemy: the Satanic child torturing Rothschild cabal run from  London.
            </p>
            <p>
             if this attack was a real one,the consequences are huge: probable WW3 because Russia and US will get into direct conflict,and more importantly most people that supported and voted for Trump will turn against him,
            </p>
            <p>
             And that would be the end of Trump ,and probable civil war in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             Therefore by deduction you can conclude the attack on Syria last night by Trump was a fake,and agreed upon, to create a narrative in Trump's and Russia's advantage vis-a-vis the real enemy ,the Rothschild Cabal.
            </p>
            <p>
             in case you missed it:Israel has allegedly attacked Syria many times,and every time they did they hit all kinds of stuff,but never managed to kill any Syrian soldiers or critical infrstructure.
            </p>
            <p>
             better keep an eye on the whole picture instead of knee jerk reactions to everything you are being fed.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a big boys game,and at stake is the future of this planet,so you have to forgive the real players for staging stuff Hoi Poloi can't really grab.

              Sure what you say is possible.. he could be playing a cleaver game of chess.. but I see how he acts.. what he tweets etc (and I don't mean the MSM narrative).. he is careless.. he says stupid thing's sometimes and doesnt back it up.. he brags before taking action instead of just taking action.. like Brierbart his ego gets the better of him.. hes intelligent in some ways but also childish and impulsive.. I think you give him too much credit.. he's just one guy.. and hia families lives depend on him playing ball.. do you really think the deep state can't get to him? I mean really? !
             </p>
             <p>
              Its not one action that is questionable .. there have been plenty of signs along the way.. like when he said right after he got in that he didn't want to hurt Hillary.. the fact he has never personally used the word pizzagate or directly referenced anything were trying to expose. 
I defended him and remained hopeful all along because I wanted to believe.. Sanders is also a puppet.. I suspected Trump was and watching how the media attacked him sure makes him look like a good guy or at least someone whos not controlled. I think he's arrogant and stupid.. I think he loves his family and will do whatever it takes to protect them including betraying the american people. A sad truth. Anyone can be bought or threatened into submission.. Alex Jones, Seaman etc etc.. anyone can change their tune and do a 180 if their lives depend on it, and they do.
Lets be realistic here!
Their hands are tied even if they have best intentions to start with. 
Trumps a player.. Hillary may have been the chosen one .. but it doesn't matter.. the result will be the same.. they are just puppets.. figureheads and lets not forget this .. low level arrests can happen .. high level stuff is actually up to us.. we have to make them accountable.. we have to be an army.. a force to recon with..and it does mean being more than keyboard warriors.. its risky.. its life threatening!
I'm serious here.. NO ONE IS GOING TO FUCKING SAVE US AND PUT THINGS RIGHT OTHER THAN OURSELVES! !!
             </p>
             <p>
              GET THAT IN YOUR HEADS..
We have to take our lives back, step way out of our comfort zones .. grow our own food, get off grid.. move out of the cities.. become independent! !
Stop relying on a corrupt system of debt and mortgages.. and 40+ hour weeks and the whole gamut! 
We have to take personal responsibility back for our lives individually and collectively or we will always be ruled over.
Get it?! I can already hear the excuses.. oh its too hard to change... I'm up to my ears in debt..(fake debt that can be legally nullified with the right education in groups).. etc

              </p>
              <p>
               only keeping an eye on the facts on the ground,related to the big picture can give you an insight into what's really happening.
              </p>
              <p>
               The scenario I describe above has been my opinion for 5 years,I never changed a word,while almost everybody else had to change their opinion according to what allegedly is happening on your TV screen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most people watched The Matrix and Lord of the Rings,only very few understand what these stories are really about.

             This could be my post my thoughts entirely and I feel stupid not because I defended him but because I actually thought for a second he could change something when I have known for a long long time that the current democracies of the west are completely rigged and there is no chance whatsoever that they will allow for change.  I'm sorry to say this but until the day comes when our political elites are decapitated in public there will be no freedom or peace.  My only hope is that the wave of optimism that elected trump will by the next election turn to a tsunami of disenfranchisement and the whole country refuses to votes in protest.

             "Loser" lmao. You may not agree with trump, but he's far from being a loser or an idiot. Calm your autistic beta ass down and goto bed instead of editing comments from an hour ago.

            <p>
             Also why the fuck would he say the term pizzagate? the very first executive order he signed with sessions was specifically dealing with human trafficking. It's been two fucking months you tard. Not even enough time for you to find someone to love you

            Excellent post, thanks. The White Helmets have been exposed by many on-the-ground-reporters for some time now. Vanessa Beeley is one of the top whistleblowers to follow for real "on the ground" news.

             Our fearless mod Millennial_Falcon decided to delete the submission since dozens of children reported dead and missing as part of what looks like a false flag attack, in the same area that the ISIS death cult operates, is "not pizzagate related". Please send a message to Millennial_Falcon to shame them for being so disgusting.

             Moreover, I don't know what kind of sick fuck makes a video like that. What are you trying to show ? What are you trying to achieve ? Women and children have been dying in the Middle East like that for almost 9 years. No one has had so much as fucking peep.

              Except for the 9 years before that. While we were engaged in another equally stupid war started on an even dumber premise. God this world is so fucking stupid. This country truly does not learn from history. How short the collective memory is just flabbergasting.

               it's not just memory but myopia. also, half the working population is working paycheck to paycheck. a hell of a lot of insecurity and instability. trained apathy has a lot to do with it.

            An al-Queda affiliated group funded by George Soros and the British government called The White Helmets have reportedly staged another chemical attack on Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Infowars:
           </p>
           <p>
            The White Helmets, an al-Qaeda affiliated group funded by George Soros and the British government, have reportedly staged another chemical weapon attack on civilians in the Syrian city of Khan Shaykhun to lay blame on the Syrian government.
           </p>
           <p>
            A day prior to the attack, Gulf-based Orient TV announced “Tomorrow we are launching a media campaign to cover the airstrikes on Hama country side including the usage of chemical warfare against civilians.” This shows clear foreknowledge that the rebels were going to stage an attack by Orient TV.
           </p>
           <p>
            The White Helmets filmed much of the footage being released on the chemical attack. They have also been known to stage “rescue” videos in the past. However, this time it appears children were indeed killed in the making of this “media campaign.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Several children appear in the videos suffocating from an unknown chemical substance, while others appear to have unexplained head injuries. It is known 250 people were kidnapped by Al-Qaeda last week from the nearby city of Hama, which is the same number as the current body count of wounded and killed civilians.
           </p>
           <p>
            In another “coincidence,” a Pakistani British doctor who at the time of the attack was taking interview requests instead of helping the injured who were flooding in, and additionally received gas masks from a British organization three days prior to the attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            The doctor, Shajul Islam, is being used as a source by US and UK media, despite facing terror charges for kidnapping and torturing two British journalists in Syria and being struck off the medical register. The organization responsible for sending him equipment is under fire for using donations meant for refugees.
           </p>
           <p>
            In another suspicious event, the White Helmets operating in the same quarry near the attack received sarin-protective respirator suits one month before the attack, even though the Syrian government no longer possesses sarin.

             Millennial_Falcon decided to delete the submission since dozens of children reported dead and missing as part of what looks like a false flag attack, in the same area that the ISIS death cult operates, is "not pizzagate related". Please send a message to Millennial_Falcon to shame them for being so disgusting.

              Millennial_Falcon decided to delete the submission since dozens of children reported dead and missing as part of what looks like a false flag attack, in the same area that the ISIS death cult operates, is "not pizzagate related". Please send a message to  Millennial_Falcon to shame them for being so disgusting.

             You make a very good and disturbing point. I'm no doctor either but that looks like it would affect some organs the way he's twirling it around in there...
