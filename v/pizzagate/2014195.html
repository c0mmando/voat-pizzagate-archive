            Mental conditioning is really hard to break. From birth we are taught to trust, police, teachers, media, books, government and when those things conspire to hide the truth it's a steep hill to climb.

            Well, there are a couple reasons for that, and I hate to say it, but one of those reasons is a bunch of you guys. We need to stop straying from the main point of this board, and every day I see stupid shit like "THIS PAIR OF JEANS HAS A SPIRAL TRIANGLE ON IT", and that's the fucking information you give me to go by? Fuck you! This isn't an episode of fucking LOST you faggot!
           </p>
           <p>
            It really seems like some of you promote bum leads on purpose and it is pissing me the fuck off.

            We need to stop getting religious about the symbolism. That 2007 FBI report was not to imply that the symbols shown are always to be associated with pedophilia. Spiral triangles are one of the oldest patterns that mankind has ever known, not unlike the swastika. The focus needs to be placed on actually getting these people caught. We keep finding all of these loose ends, but haven't resolved shit, because the content the posters provide is nothing. Work with what we have, and then move on later.

            You are told lies all your life so when the truth does stick its ugly head you are told again by those who want to think they are lies. Why on earth would anyone think this is far fetched even if it was so we are talking about decades even centuries of child abuse by the power that governs and controls what is told you,

            Some of the comments in this thread are an attempt at gaslighting this community and its work.  I have also noticed a significant number of new accounts crop up and many an opinionated newcomer and I don't believe this is just co-incidence.  Along with the supposed incoming Swordfish69 revelations, this all looks like a new barrage strategy to derail the motivation of long standing contributors and undermine the efficacy of the investigation.  Those involved in these heinous crimes know that we know and it's important to remind ourselves of this.  They do not have unlimited chances and infinite space to run &amp; hide and thus eventually someone, somewhere will fuck up.  We need to be watching when this happens!

            Because people found the weak link in Comet and Alefantis. That's why the MSM won't accurately report on it to exonerate James Alefantis. Their objective is to keep repeating a brief summary of the investigation which they can easily "debunk" while ignoring everything else. This just wasn't meant to happen. It seems clear that Alefantis simply cannot face any investigation for what he knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think his role in this is why he hasn't be killed yet. Too valuable to them and so its better business to protect him rather than lose him.

            It IS about money laundering!! and drugs! AND sex trafficking- DUH
criminal syndicate, anyone? organized crime, ring a bell?? mafia maybe? surely street gang you have heard of..... negative forces who desire $ and power will do anything to get it, and anything to satisfy their increasing desires for the taboo.... the powerful then prey on the less powerful to perpetuate the cycle and perform the functions needed for the criminal enterprise.... the johns, the addicts, the blackmailed, the lost souls, the pedophiles, the mentally disturbed, the sadists, the weak, the poor, the orphaned....

             I guess I must not have made my point clearly enough. On the first day of PizzaGate, there was a list of food-related words and their supposed child porn code word equivalents posted, which fueled a lot of the early development and gave the theory its name. For example, this website lists some:
             <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Pedophile_codes#Phrase.2FWord_Codes">
              http://pizzagate.wiki/Pedophile_codes#Phrase.2FWord_Codes
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             My question is what would have happened if, on the first day, the supposed code words equivalents had been about something other than child sex trafficking? Would PizzaGate have been about whatever the other thing was instead?

              we seem to be forgetting the instagram and art evidence, the many emails, the hankies... code cheese pizza for child porn has been known for ages, CP~ get it?? yeah. also later used for drugs as it filtered into the slang... i don't know any PG researcher worth their mozzarella who gives a crap about what walnut sauce or pasta really mean... the context and evidence are what matter. the breadcrumbs lead to sex and kids. period. and, oddly enough, pizza parlors! pizzagate.

            It's far fetched, because the evidence is tissue thin.  And people are building massive constructs of connections and links and conjecture and leaps on logic upon tissue thin evidence.

             That is called investigation, that which the authorities are supposed to do. The masses have been manipulated into thinking that if there is no concrete evidence in the beginning, there is no investigation, that is absurd. If that were the case, we would not need detectives. There is mountains of circumstantial evidence, that any genuine investigator would tell you is more than enough to move forward; not proof of anything yet, but evidence that something is going on.

              There is certainly not enough to start an investigation.  And there is certainly not mountains of circumstantial evidence.  There is mountains of suspicion. And tons of evidence that is absolutely ignored and other evidence that is viewed through the most extreme and distorted lens.  And the start of this "investigation" is based a fake list of code words.  There's no suspicion at all without this fake list of code words.  The authorities are not supposed to go poking and prodding into people's lives based on the suspicions of an irrational group of internet conspiracy theorists who pretend they are detectives.  They are not a "prove my suspicion is wrong force" and they never should be.

               You see, you are running with half information claiming that there is not enough to go on, like most out there. That is not where it started, the code words were one small part that got focused on, along with Comet, to distract those like yourself who might take them at there word. There is so much more to the story. This is where it truly began for genuine investigators, and not YouTube personalities like Seaman, who use this to disgustingly further their careers.

             I can see where you are coming from, but when the Welch kid went onto the pizza parlor and miraculously, with one shot- hit the hard drive in Alefantis computer, what do you think the odds are? Million to one? Zillion? When does it become unreasonable to say hmmm? And three points for the use of big three dollar words.

              This is just an example of confirmation bias and what is known as anomaly hunting, it's the looking for the odd detail that can't be explained while ignoring the other mass of evidence that does cohere.  I mean think about it.  You think they staged that whole thing to get rid of a hard drive?   Really?
             </p>
             <p>
              If you wanted to get rid of an incriminating hard drive, what would you do? You could come up with dozens of ways of doing this without drawing attention or involving a massive amount of risk. What if an off duty cop was walking by?  Or an armed citizen?
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean why not just take the hard drive home?  Or the whole computer home?
             </p>
             <p>
              A hard drive will fit in your pocket and computer in a small box.  You don't need extraordinary means achieve this goal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where did you see he hit the hard drive?   The pizzagate wiki doesn't say that. It just say it went though a computer.  Not hit the hard drive.

            It would definitely be seen otherwise if the media wasn't pimped by the deep state.

            Many people still trust the media,  who's been massively suppressing the whole thing.

            As someone who has followed Pizzagate since its inception, it's easy to see why people think its far-fetched. We can look at the bullshit interviews Alefantis had on TV, we can look at the false flag gunman.  There's also the fact that every time someone see's a symbol that's marginally related to the list of pedo symbols on the FBI list, everyone is like, "INVESTIGATE THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS!" - not every use of those symbols is going to give you something, you people need to realize pedo's co-opted them, not created them. The movement can be its own worst enemy at times, and combine that with the bad optics the media is able to portray, and you have something that looks far fetched.

            It's considered "far-fetched" among the sheep who are afraid to face the horrifying consequences of what Pizzagate implies (this is known as Cognitive Dissonance)

            People who are not afraid to look truth squarely in the face, no matter how ugly and horrifying that truth may be, don't consider it far-fetched.

             This fear is one of the primary barriers, and will ultimately be one of the primary causes of
society's collapse if not dealt with properly. A completely mental deference to the entities they've decided have power over them. No true sovereignty over themselves. "The foundation series" by Isaac Asimov has hidden insights on the matter

            Because it's obviously bullshit. The whole thing originated in a troll post on 4chan instructing people to replace food-related words with child porn-related words - voila, a child-porn conspiracy is born. That is the standard of evidence for PizzaGate: troll posts, and blog entries written by Voat users citing Voat comments as their evidence. Plus no victims have ever been identified. Plus the community is obviously very partisan; see for example how Milo Yianopolous expressed blatant pro-child molestation views but he's still revered; see also how, as soon as an individual becomes known as a political opponent of Donald Trump, they then get smeared as a pedophile. That and members of the community have been imprisoned for being gun-toting, violent nut jobs. And as any adult knows, Satanism isn't real, Satan doesn't exist and people don't worship him. Plus there's a bunch of connections to other obvious lunatic bullshit - the more frequently your community mentions the illuminati, Mossad, CIA, Jews, etc. the less likely there is to be any real substance to the allegations.

             You speak the truth. A hard truth is that humans are biased at all times and it's clear many of these people who believe the crazier things you listed will never have it occur to themselves that they could also just be wrong about any of their views, even when presented opposing, concrete evidence that would sway any other logically thinking person.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's why this community pats each other's backs so much like you state, because they use each other's "evidence" to back their own "evidence" which makes them seem right even though mental gymnastics are required to even consider what they call "evidence" as tangible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just stated what you said today, and was called myself a kid fucker by a user here because he claimed Jews killed the lead singer of Linkin Park because he was about to blow open a child porn conspiracy ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like what the fuck. Was Robin Williams in on it too since he was a Hollywood celebrity?
            </p>
            <p>
             In the end I am sure this child porn shit does happen among higher ups where it's easily covered up, but the reason PizzaGate is so far fetched to people is because everyone and anyone who even disagrees slightly is accused of being in on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was called a shill today too by a user here even though I voted Trump and stand by it.
            </p>
            <p>
             End rant, many users here are just as toxic and loony as Reddit.

              I didn't say pedophilia doesn't exist, I said PizzaGate is bullshit. There is no conspiracy involving the Clintons and random pizza store owners to traffick children into Satanic sex abuse situations.

              What does my post have to do with liberals? I laid out an argument against PizzaGate on its own terms - regarding the "evidence" and the community. Your post is yet another indicator that this whole thing is just partisan politics.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, the only group that is going to expend any money on PizzaGate is law enforcement, to monitor you nut jobs to make sure another one of you doesn't shoot up a pizza store again. There are no paid shills because PizzaGate is 100% fake, so there is no "other side" to take an interest. I wish I was a paid shill, though; getting money to point out the obvious glaring logical problems and lack of evidence in this special ed conspiracy theory would be the easiest job ever.

              A second reply to this one: here's a thought experiment for you. Although I don't believe that there was any sort of food-based code in the Podesta emails, let's say for the sake of argument that there was. The 4chan post that started all of this off said that the code was related to child porn. What if the 4chan post had said that the code was for money laundering instead? Would PizzaGate be about money laundering? And a second thought for you, again assuming that there was a code: how do we actually know what they intended by the code? What makes you so sure that they were using the word "pizza" to refer to child pornography and not, say, bank robbery? Seriously, what actual evidence or even reasonable suspicion do you have that there was a food-based code for child porn?

              The ones where 4chan instructed people to replace food-related words with child porn-related words and then said it was evidence of a child porn conspiracy? That it was a troll post, and that the code they came up with was purely the invention of author of the troll post. In short, "walnut sauce" really just means "walnut sauce" and not something related to child molestation.
