This discussion demonstrates a genealogical link between the British royal family and another 18th century kabbalist, known as Baal Shem Tov. A quick genealogy search shows that the Windsors seems to be blood-related to Baal Shem Tov an Ashkenazi Jewish mystic, born in today’s Poland. Baal Shem Tov is considered as the founder of the Chassidism and revered as one of holiest Jewish mystics by the Chabad movement. Here is more about him:

             Uncovering the connections between pedophilia and occult/satanic practices is crucial in understanding what's going on. There seems to be a strong correlation between power (political, media, cultural, financial etc.) and pedophilia. So much is clear: "child-abuse" is at the core of satanism. No matter what any particular satanic cult call itself, it's usually perpetuated as a "tradition", going down from one generation to the next. Child abuse is "hereditary" also in the sense that it generates its own cycle of self-perpetuation. No way to understand the present if we don't understand the past. Should we limit ourselves to investigating catholics, masons, CIA, and generic illuminati, while giving kabbalists a pass over (so to speak)?  If some passages in the talmud expressly authorize pedophilia (with boys under 9, girls as young as 3 etc.), it's not anti-semitic to point this out. When it comes to exposing child-abusers no one should be off limits.

              The connection between pedophilia and power is that sexual response and social dominance are both behaviors which are controlled by the reptilian complex of the triune brain model. Whenever the reptilian complex dominates over the the limbic system and the neocortex the survival behaviors must be expressed; in this context paedophilia is simply the expression of sexual response combined with an extreme form of social dominance.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Hebrew idiom the heart is the seat of both the intellect and the emotions, i.e it represents the behaviors governed by the limbic system and the neocortex, i.e. paedophilia isn't compatible with a properly functioning "heart".

               A physiological explanation has its place. The problem is that it doesn't go far enough. If your contention is that pedophilia is just a chemical imbalance and another form of heart/body disfunction, you are leaving out human agency. Not so fast. Child sacrifice is as old as humanity itself. Historically, it's been even frequently institutionalized. Among others, by ancient Israelite rulers as well. After looking in horror at the persistence of child abuse throughout the centuries, I'm more and more inclined to think that pedophilia is the ultimate deal (with satan/lucifer/devil, ... fill in a dark deity), to reject G_d.  Hurting or corrupting an innocent child is the definition of absolute evil. And since the absolute evil is a reality we observe daily, G_d must be equally real. In case you are not convinced, I suggest you take a closer look at the esoteric ramblings of satanists such as Alister Crowley. To be defeated, evil should be recognized for what it is. Then confronted and annihilated.

                The value of the physiological model is that it maps directly into the natural heart of man (but not the human heart, which is driven only by emotion and is devoid of reason).  The human condition most probably arose in Rome, but humanism has met with much success in convincing people that the condition is a universal one.

              Fair, but let's also remember not all Jews are into the Talmud, either. What you describe sounds like an extremist, twisted interpretation of a religious teaching to suit their sick purposes. It's like a Jewish form of ISIS, but with child rape instead of beheadings. Religion can be weaponized into a dark, brainwashing force, especially from a position of trust.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, sometimes people are just sick, depraved, psychopaths who harbor no compassion, empathy, nor morals--or, in fact, corrupted versions of such concepts. There is no objective reasoning for their actions, only excuses for their behavior or rationalizations to themselves, at best. These are the darkest of our species, and are nearly impossible for a normal member of the species to accept as being in existence.

               Absolutely. Besides, not even all talmudic jews have necessarily heard of Sanh. 55a, 69b etc. (the particular passages justifying pedophilia). It's important to understand that to satanists, child-abuse is a "sacrament" of sorts  (supposedly) conferring to them power, fame, money and other worldly benefits. Pursuing those is not an irrational behavior. It's the act of desecration of G_d through hurting a child that is inherently, absolutely and irredeemably evil.

            Nothing discredits voat/pizzagate more than the fact that it is increasingly infected with obsessive anti-semitic lunatics. If I see much more of this I will have to leave.

             The habitual whining and accusations of anti-semitism show usually a shallow mind and a propensity to manipulate. Every single point in my OP is substantiated and verifiable. Feel free to disagree or to argue your position. Don't try to censor. This is not 4chan.  Blackmail also wouldn't work here. If you feel it's better to leave, just go without making a scene. It will be a terrible loss, but we'll eventually recover.

             No particular race is targeted or even concerned. Kabbala occultism might be a sect, a cult or even a "religion", but one thing it's not, it's not a race.

            JUDAH (JEWS) RULE THE WORLD.  It's in the Bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Genesis 49 8-12 -
           </p>
           <p>
            “
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Judah,[a] your brothers will praise you; /
    your hand will be on the neck of your enemies
             </strong>
            </strong>
            ; /
    your father’s sons will bow down to you. /
9 /
            <strong>
             <strong>
              You are a lion’s cub, Judah; /
    you return from the prey
             </strong>
            </strong>
            , my son./
Like a lion he crouches and lies down, /
    like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? /
10
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The scepter will not depart from Judah, /
    nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet
             </strong>
            </strong>
            ,[b] /
until he to whom it belongs[c] shall come /
    and
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the obedience of the nations shall be his
             </strong>
            </strong>
            ./
11
            <strong>
             <strong>
              He will tether his donkey to a vine, /
    his colt to the choicest branch; /
he will wash his garments in wine
             </strong>
            </strong>
            /
            <strong>
             <strong>
              his robes in the blood of grapes.

              True -- from what I've read --
             </p>
             <p>
              but also reports that Princess Diana just before her wedding was escorted into an area where the Queen and Philip showed themselves as Draco-Reptilians.  Charles and Camilla were also there -- this was, of course, before their marriage and it was announced to Diana that Camilla was Charles consort.
There have also been rumors of Putin having seen some "flash" of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              I put this into a search "Princess Diana reports British royals are draco-reptilian" and I'll give you the search page
link but for some reason doing that hasn't worked lately . . .

            You are very wrong on this. The inner circle of Hitler &amp; the top SS were in fact occultists or Satanists.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact Aleister Crowley the self-identified "beast and 666" was himself involved in the occult and inner circle of Hitler and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were involved in black sex majick rituals. The very practices of the Black Sun which is the actual swatstika in the Outer symbology of the black sun itself.

             According to this author, the relationship between the Nazis and occult was way more complicated.  Meaning that some Nazis were pro-occultist while others were against it:

             Although I don't care for either group, the Nazi stance towards occultism, Christianity, etc. has never been fully agreed upon scholars as far as I can tell.

            THANK YOU, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! You just solved part of a huge puzzle.
           </p>
           <p>
            First off, his name Baal Shem Tov;
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">
             Baal
            </a>
            is the Canaanite god known for child sacrifice, blood drinking and cannibalism. His symbol is the bull and his title is sometime Moloch. The world Cannibal means the Priesthood (Cain was the first Priest) of Baal. Shem was one of three son of Noah. Tov mean good in Hebrew.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chassidism is Hassidism (the Jews with the curly locks) known for sucking the blood of infants after circumcision. The adrenochrome (a derivative of adrenaline) in the blood gets them high. Seriously. They do it to get high.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's right there in the wiki;
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Disputes with the Frankists and death (this was a fake dispute in order to hide their ranks and keep them safe from persecution while legitimizing normal Jews.)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The Besht took sides with the Talmudists in their disputes against the Frankists (Jacob Frank's cultist movement which regarded Frank as the Messiah, modeled after Sabbatai Zevi.) After the mass conversion of the Frankists, the Baal Shem Tov allegedly said that as long as a diseased limb is connected with the body, there is hope that it may be saved; but, once amputated, it is gone, and there is no hope.[16] Baal Shem Tov died shortly after the conversion of many Frankists to Christianity.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A Turkish occupation of Podolia occurred within the Besht’s lifetime and along with it the influence within this frontier territory of Sabbatai Zevi and his latter day spiritual descendants such as Malach and Jacob Frank.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Shabbatean Frankists are the most bloodthirsty savage child sacrificing Satanists (Baal worshipers) to ever exist. They are crypto-cultist who follow Baal worship. They convert to other faiths in order to infiltrate and subvert them from within. If Baal Shem Tov "converts them to Christianity" that is a false conversion. Many Shabbatean converted to Islam and formed the Donmeh.

             That was an excellent follow up. So many people have automatically excoriated Jews as being one monolithic group and this simply not true. The Frankists as you point out are the most savage Baal (Satan, Molech, etc.) worshippers there are. The adrenochrome part of this that comes in drinking blood is observable in these days. This is a reason for intentionally traumatizing a child or baby the more trauma the higher adrenochrome. Adrenochrome is addicting and said to make the person feel powerful. Of course this always happened at child sacrifice so evil was invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wont go further but research adrenochrome. Research movies where this was demonstrated.

            Yeah I couldn't believe a huge section of Jews follow the satanic Talmud, no wonder Jesus berated them for betraying God, Bibi wants Talmudic law for Isarael as well kinda puts Islam and Judaism in the same boat, both the Talmud and Hadith have eerily simililar laws 
1. Pedophelia isn't a crime 
2. Oral law supersedes Gods word
3. The permission to kill non believers
           </p>
           <p>
            Google for yourself the Talmud is evil af and it's such uncommon knowledge, HOW!?

            This is the truth that everyone must understand. The Ashekenazi are Kabbalist or Satanists at their core. They became Royalty and owned all the central banks. They supported the Nazi's in WW11 or financed them look at the ending of their tribal names Nazi's.

            They are the Rothschild's &amp; others. They are not Jews and never were. They are from the khazar region proven genetically in 2013.

               A 1999 study titled “Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes” (M.F. Hammer et.al, Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences 6769–6774, doi: 10.1073/pnas.100115997) found that:
“[D]espite their long-term residence in different countries and isolation from one another, most Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level.
“Admixture estimates suggested low levels of European Y-chromosome gene flow into Ashkenazi and Roman Jewish communities . . .  Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations were not statistically different. The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora.”

               A November 2001 study titled “The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East” (Almut Nebel et. al., American Journal of Human Genetics, Nov 2001;  69(5): 1095–1112) found that in most Jewish populations, male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern.
The study found that Ashkenazi Jews in particular “share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East.”

               A January 2009 study titled “A genome-wide genetic signature of Jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full Jewish ancestry in a large random sample of European Americans” (Anna C Need et.al., Genome Biology, 2009; 10(1): R7. doi:  10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r7) found that “individuals with full Jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no Jewish ancestry.”
This study showed that in DNA terms, Jews, both Sephardic and Ashkenazim, cluster as a distinct group—something that, if the Khazar theory was true, would be impossible.

“Jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other, clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure. These results support the view that the Jewish populations largely share a common Middle Eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with non-Jewish populations of European descent.”

Behar, et. al., Nature 466, 238–242 (08 July 2010) doi:10.1038/nature09103) analyzed individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genome-wide diversity with those from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations in order to “provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa.”
The results identified a “previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East” and that “Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster,” and that “trace[s] the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.”

               A June 2010 study titled “Abraham’s children in the genome era: major Jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle Eastern ancestry” (Atzmon et al., American Journal of Human Genetics, 2010;86:850-859) refuted the idea of large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry.
This study found used genome-wide analysis of seven Jewish groups (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek, and Ashkenazi) and “demonstrated distinctive Jewish population clusters, each with shared Middle Eastern ancestry, proximity to contemporary Middle Eastern populations, and variable degrees of European and North African admixture.”
This paper specifically excluded the “Khazar theory” as an origin for present-day Jews, saying “the genetic proximity . . . is incompatible with theories that Ashkenazi Jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.”

                 Elhaik’s arguments did not go unchallenged. In a detailed review in the Proceedings of the Russian Academy of DNA Genealogy, Anatole A. Klyosov dismissed much of his analysis as mere acrobatics. However, since this article appeared in Russian, it got little attention. Recently, at least two studies have come to similar conclusions. A scientific team led by M. Metsapalu announced that it has found “no indication of Khazar genetic ancestry among Ashkenazi Jews” (the paper is forthcoming). Meanwhile another team led by M. Costa has argued both that there is strong evidence of the admixture of European women in the ancestry of Ashkenazi Jewish women and that there is no evidence for significant Khazar ancestry.

                What you miss in your argument is that the original Khazar were indulging in (satanic) occultism already on their own. Yes, Jews of the Edomite branch apparently did make it to the Khazar region as well. However, it were the Khazari natives and their King that were posed, by the Russians of the time, to drop the Satanism and take up on one of the 3 primary regigions at that time; Islam, Christianity or Judaism. The involved king chose Judaism and adopted the Babylonic Talmud. This is how Khazar (the present day Ukraine) descendants and present day Ashekenazi show the gene mixture of the research you posted. Point here is that this Khazar king resumed his occult school, hidden mostly from view (an initiated inner circle, while commoners followed a much more tame version of the scripture). The migrated Jews did not 'replace' the Khazari, they intermixed with. It's the original Khazar that made the occult religion big in the area, likely having it inherited from these migrated Jews.
               </p>
               <p>
                If that King would have chosen any other religion, it would, at present, be that religion used a sheep's cloth to the wolf that is that satanic core. It's also why the Ukraine plays such a big role in today's geopolitics. The Khazari descendants are pissed. Pissed with the Russians and would want nothing more than to conquer and claim that country. They've already tried TWICE. First time right after the 1st WW; in the form of Bolsheviks murdering a 100 million Russians. The second time during WW2. But the Nazi project failed at that, which was supposed to be a forced conquerment and unition of the European continent. (Here in Holland we had the 'NSB' party before and during WW II. This party was Nazi-Germany aligned and was 'ready' to take the Netherlands into this new Europe. Things didn't turn out too well.
               </p>
               <p>
                So now they're setting the stage (globally) for their 3rd attempt at having a go at Russia. Hence (again) with the Ukraine as a center-point to force this conflict. The take-down of MH-17 was a carefully designed 'master-plan' to coax the world into believing the Russians commited war-crimes sufficiently to warrant unimpeded NATO attack and invasion.
               </p>
               <p>
                Luckily not everyone bought the propaganda and mainly due to our modern information era, a good number of articles and circumstantial logical / evidential material cropped up showing an entirely different story from the official narrative (of a Russian imported BUK having shot down MH-17), namely, a take-down by Ukrainian fighter jets that escorted MH-17 shortly before shooting it down under cover of flying through a cloud.

                A March 2012 study by Christopher L. Campbell et. al., titled “North African Jewish and non-Jewish populations form distinctive, orthogonal clusters” (Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences,   doi: 10.1073/pnas.1204840109) found that genome-wide analysis of five North African Jewish groups (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Djerban, and Libyan) “demonstrated distinctive North African Jewish population clusters with proximity to other Jewish populations.”
Furthermore, the study showed, the Sephardic Jewish genome is “compatible with the history of North African Jews—founding during Classical Antiquity with proselytism of local populations, followed by genetic isolation with the rise of Christianity and then Islam, and admixture following the emigration of Sephardic Jews during the Inquisition.”
Finally, this study added “These populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish group.”
(*Endogamy: the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships.)

                In his book, “Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People”  (Oxford University Press, USA; May 2012), Harry Ostrer, a professor of Pathology and Genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Director of Genetic and Genomic Testing at Montefiore Medical Center, Medicine, concluded that “Jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature.” (Jews Are a ‘Race,’ Genes Reveal–Author Uncovers DNA Links Between Members of Tribe, The Jewish Daily Forward, May 04, 2012).
Ostrer, who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center, said in his conclusion that “Jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race.”
Ostrer also deals specifically with the Khazar theory. He pointed out that the findings from the Jewish HapMap Project (see below) completely refute “the theories that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.” (Jews: A religious group, people or race?, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012)

                The Jewish HapMap Project, a joint project of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York University School of Medicine, was created to “understand the structure of the genomes in Jewish populations” and is an outgrowth of the Human HapMap Project.
According to this project, “Jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic, cultural, and religious traditions over 4000 years, despite residence all over the world.”
Its findings, based on first hand DNA studies amongst Jewish populations around the globe, found no evidence to support a Central Asian DNA origin for Jewry.
According to the Jerusalem Post, the “Jewish HapMap Project in New York City has so far shown “in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century. Jewish populations from the major Jewish Diaspora groups – Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi – form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to Semitic and European populations. Within this larger Jewish cluster, each of the Jewish populations formed its own subcluster.

                  “A high degree of mixing of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Syrian Jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to Middle Eastern, Iraqi and Iranian Jews. This genetic split seemed to have occurred about 2,500 years ago.” (Jews: A religious group, people or race?, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012)

                DNA Studies Find that Ashkenazim Jews have 30% European Admixture
               </strong>
              </strong>
              Both the Behar study (section 7 above) and the Atzmon study (section 8 above) were commented upon by the British former deputy editor of the journal Nature, and currently the scientific correspondent for the New York Times, Nicholas Wade, in an article in that newspaper as follows:
“Jewish communities in Europe and the Middle East share many genes inherited from the ancestral Jewish population that lived in the Middle East some 3,000 years ago, even though each community also carries genes from other sources — usually the country in which it lives,” adding that a “major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two Jewish communities of Europe, the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim.”
Wade pointed out that the two studies “refute the suggestion made by the historian Shlomo Sand in his book ‘The Invention of the Jewish People’ that Jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in Europe and Central Asia who converted to Judaism at various times.
“Jewish communities from Europe, the Middle East and the Caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the Levant; Ethiopian Jews and two Judaic communities in India are genetically much closer to their host populations,” Wade wrote.
“The shared genetic elements suggest that members of any Jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population, which is about 10 times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of New York City.
“Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews have roughly 30 percent European ancestry, with most of the rest from the Middle East, the two surveys find. The two communities seem very similar to each other genetically, which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long.” (Studies Show Jews’ Genetic Similarity, Nicholas Wade, New York Times, June 9, 2010).

             I can always depend on you to teach plainly and clearly.  I have heard bits and pieces before, but never the whole story.  It was you the other day that made me wake up about the Natzi in AshkeNazi.  Bingo.  It hit me like a ton of bricks.  I have learned so much from you. TY.

              The Nazi in AshkeNAZI is correct.  I have been posting that on here for a month.

              You need to INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY instead of taking his/her "educational materials" at face value.  That poster has NO CLUE what s/he is talking about and is full of "ASS TALK."

               Aww equineluvr actually said someone other than himself is right. That's odd but take it as a compliment since hs spewed Jew hatred every post he makes and attempts to tell everyone he is smarter than all of us.
