            Interesting read. In 1977 they discovered a giant ring of pedophiles. Check out Page 8, column 2 - where you might notice some common terminology.

            Ultimately, investigators gave contact information for these people, including a lot of Congressmen, to the State Department at the behest of the FBI. The State Department destroyed the evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has been going on for quite a while.

            playing devil's advocate, could this be a psyop? Please just watch RitchieinBoston's YT video,

            I'm not saying the OP is wrong, and Ritchie is right; I just have a hard time trusting anyone these days! If this counter coup is working with and 'through Julian Assange', then wouldn't he be able to tell the public WHERE JA is, and the status of him???
           </p>

            I just am putting it out there, as I think we've all been played too many times to be played again.

            Listen, THINK. Has Wikileaks ever released anything DAMNING on Israel? No its only been on the enemy of Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian has finished his mission, Netanyahu will knight him with a 1,000 little virgin boys in Tel-Aviv.
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA/MOSSAD arrested all the wiki-leak anon's all over the world mid October, the so called dead-mans switch was killed. Selectively only podesta leaks were release, they carefully avoided anything that would tie Epstein ( MOSSAD AGENT ) to Trump. They started pizzagate in July with the fbiANON posting on 4chan ( owned by US-NAVY-INTEL) one of the largest armys of super-soldiers and a bigger MK-ULTRA program than even the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Netanyahu won Trump is now in, and under Trump Palestine will be removed from the map, and millions will die, and nobody will care because TRUMP will call it "Draining the Swamp"

            How can you expect the FBI to clean the swamp when the say there is NO SWAMP OFFICIALLY?

            Scholarly and law enforcement investigations
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeffrey Victor reviewed 67 rumors about SRA in the United States and Canada reported in newspapers or television, and found no evidence supporting the existence of murderous satanic cults.[148] LaFontaine states that cases of alleged SRA investigated in the United Kingdom were reviewed in detail and the majority were unsubstantiated; three were found to involve sexual abuse of children in the context of rituals, but none involved the Witches' Sabbath or devil-worship that are characteristic of allegations of SRA.[149] LaFontaine also states that no material evidence has been forthcoming in allegations of SRA, no bones, bodies or blood, in either the United States or Britain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kenneth Lanning, an FBI expert in the investigation of child sexual abuse,[150] has stated that pseudo-satanism may exist but there is "little or no evidence for ... large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies".[46]
           </p>
           <pre><code>There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true....I believe that there is a middle ground — a continuum of possible activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be "contaminated" or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe that the majority of victims alleging "ritual" abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma.[46]
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Lanning produced a monograph in 1994 on SRA aimed at child protection authorities, which contained his opinion that despite hundreds of investigations no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.[54]
           </p>
           <p>
            Reported cases of SRA involve bizarre activities, some of which are impossible (like people flying),[116] that makes the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse questionable. In cases where SRA is alleged to occur, Lanning describes common dynamics of the use of fear to control multiple young victims, the presence of multiple perpetrators and strange or ritualized behaviors, though allegations of crimes such as human sacrifice and cannibalism do not seem to be true. Lanning also suggests several reasons why adult victims may make allegations of SRA, including "pathological distortion, traumatic memory, normal childhood fears and fantasies, misperception, and confusion".[89]

           <p>
            6) What the Petraus investigation looked like (bazillion pages)
           </p>
           <p>
            The above 3 prove corruption within FBI, and Federal Government as a Whole, has been 100% accomplished by ~2014
           </p>
           <p>
            7) May 2015 Baltimore - Beginning of Soros funded attempted FEDERALIZATION of police. This is an attempt to usurp States rights by the Federal Govt./Soros. Basically, this is the LAST ELECTION, LAST CHANCE - Trump has been pushing this for a long time now.
           </p>
           <p>
            8) Donald J. Trump made honoraria FBI asset - he was RECRUITED by patriots within the FBI to do what he's doing. His uncle was well respected. They knew his dad. He's clean. They needed him. That's from the FBI Honoraria tweet. Here's some Alex Jones insider info. Trump has been many steps ahead of the game this entire time, like a prophet. Connect the dots. Dr. Steve Pieczenik is the direct link from Intelligence Agencies to Trump, he has been advising Trump for decades.

            9 ) How operations run by FBI but outside of FBI look (Trump campaign - Trump has been getting insider info all along - the Tweeted document shows it's legal to give him classified info in this case) -

            10) Stay-Behind Agents - activation of patriots embedded in enemy occupied territory within other agencies of Federal Govt. to help. Secret Service. NSA. Etc.

            11) Social Networking - /pol/ ,
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">
             r/the_donald
            </a>
            conscripted to help BY FBI ANON, confirmed by EXACT 11AM TIME OF TWEET - Social Networking and Viral news is the only reason any of this has even been possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            12) Physical fitness program - this was the Hillary health leaks, accomplished by above FBI operation/conscripted parties
           </p>
           <p>
            13) FOIA - this was the Wikileaks, same as above (I previously proved Wikileaks was leaked by US AGENTS because NO CLASSIFIED MATERIALS were leaked - our boys are by the fucking BOOK)
           </p>
           <p>
            14) FBI Seal - this is the FBI coming into the open about all of the above, via this tweeting and Dr. Pieczenik - We are part of a legitimate FBI by-the-book Operation against DOMESTIC enemies.
           </p>
           <p>
            15) FBI now conscripting all of us (students) to help with the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            16) Find AND EXPOSE the smoking gun...
           </p>
           <p>
            17) ...In the Clinton Foundation.

            1 Who exactly is this FBI??
           </h1>
           <p>
            The FBI was created in 1911, renamed itself to FBI in 1930's and put J Edgar Hoover in power for 50 years a man who fucked little boys in the ass and collected child-porn to compromise politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI is nose deep in the Child Sex Slavery racket.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1911 the FBI called themselves "American Bureau of Investigation", ,rename to FBI in 1930. In 1960's ADL/JDL/AIPAC took over the operation of entraping politicians, that's why today AIPAC rules USA and gets to choose our president, they chose Trump.
