<p>This is my research into the instagrams that where being associated with JA in the beginning of the investigation. It started with an artist collective called wildtorus. That was a touring artist collective and every single &quot;artist&quot; branches out into a huge web of cultists basically. Also there was people like Izzete Folger and pandaheadmorgan who also where some kind of art promoters. Sashalordpresents. Those accounts where how I found the others and it is a huge web of cultists. I also had been aware of a satanist named blissgod before pizzagate raising hell and associating with the oto and the freemasons on instagram. So when I saw that pizzagate involved shady instagram activity I knew it was like blissgod so that is why I still think a huge part of this is their instagram or otherwise their cult that uses instagram to show each other what they are doing and paying homage to darkness. </p>
<p>What frustrates me is that if people just would manually scroll through some of these accounts they would find a thousand posts by themselves. I intentionally ignored screenshot some of the posts because of the fact that it seemed redundant. So for every screenshot is maybe 1 or 2 more that where taken along with the initial posts.</p>
<p>this seems like a lot of work but in reality it was something I passively did while listening to something to keep my mind occupied in the background. Its extremely easy to find more posts and please someone look into these accounts because this is not even 1% of the satanic shit going on on social media.</p>',

             The reason I am even putting it into something to download is because its easier than manually uploading 1400 screenshots. If I can upload them all at once to imagur or something like that I will do that aswell.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its NSFW because for example the wildtorus adult performance artist screenshots have naked guys in bodypaint,
