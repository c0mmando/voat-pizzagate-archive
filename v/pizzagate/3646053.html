<h2 id="md-liverpools-mayor-joe-anderson-says-government-request-will-not-be-carried-out">Liverpool\'s Mayor Joe Anderson says government request will not be carried out</h2>
<p>The city leader was responding to reports that <strong>councils around the country have been ordered to fly the flag from town hall buildings on February 19 to mark the Duke of York\'s 60th birthday.</strong></p>
<p>Councils have received an email from government telling them to mark the occasion - despite the Queen cancelling the formal celebration for her son\'s birthday following his disastrous Newsnight appearance.</p>
<p>Responding to the reports today, Mayor Anderson made it absolutely clear that Liverpool Council will not be obeying any such requests from government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He said: &quot;No, we won\'t be doing that.</p>
<p>&quot;I don\'t think that would be appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;This isn\'t to do with being anti-royal, we have flown the flag for the Queen before.</p>
<p>&quot;But Prince Andrew isn\'t a major royal, he\'s not a significant member of the Royal Family.&quot;</p>
