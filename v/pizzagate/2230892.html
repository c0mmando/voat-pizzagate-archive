            I wondered about some of the videos myself as sick and weird as they were I didn't get it.. makes sense now what they're pushing.  It does NOT take long to seemingly watch an innocent video and have it link to more depraved content. I think more parents should know this... how many people just send their kids off to their rooms or wherever and as long as they're quiet they're fine right? NO NOT FINE!! GRRR.

            I’ve seen a ton of the videos done by this family. You can find them under Skylander girl, skylander boy, skylander Mom and Dad. Also FGteev. My kids love to watch their videos. Since I became aware of Elsagate and other disgusting perverts on YouTube, they have to watch videos on the TV so I can monitor who they are watching. Honestly, I don’t think they are intentionally trying to groom kids. They have made millions from the videos and we have all seen the evil that comes with money. I don’t think anything could surprise me at this point. I have watched hundreds of their videos and haven’t picked up on anything weird.

             I do not mean to offend you, but in my opinion, you are missing the forest for the trees. At the very least, they are exploiting their children.

              I totally agree with you about exploiting their children. Seeing this post honestly made me rethink what I feel is okay to watch. They are very popular with young kids, I’m sure you can see by the number of views on their videos. I’ve researched the parents but there isn’t a lot of info out there. The worst thing I did find was a rumor on a forum started by a neighbor that said the Mom screwed around with everyone in the neighborhood. It’s been awhile since I’ve looked them up but I believe they lived in Connecticut and moved to NC within the last couple years. I have a subscription to Been Verified and put it to good use. But I’m definitely not disagreeing with you, maybe more wishful thinking. Or kicking myself in the ass for being too naive? The things I’ve read in the past year scare the hell out of me.

            As esoteric mentions, the ethos of satanism involves inversion of natural laws, a defiance to God and his creation. Everything holy will be mixed with what is unholy and filthy. Thats why modern art usuallt feels wrong at the first glance

             1) When my 18 year old daughter was at college The Art teacher there used to have headless manikins hanging upside down from the ceiling in the Art Room.  He once related to the students, that the 'Best Art Performance' he had ever seen was of a whitewashed stage, with a sole man naked painted white.  The whole performance was that this man cut himself and walked around the stage with blood dripping!  He proceeded to say, the man could only perform 3 times a week because of the amount of blood loss!  I complained to the Head teacher, as just before this (and the reason my daughter telling me the story about him) he had given my 12 year old daughters class an assignment and given them links etc., for them to do their own research.  When my daughter went onto the the site, it was full of filthy art, paintings bodies in all sorts of awful positions exposing everything! - when I asked my older daughter about this she told me that story of the whitewashed man.  Around the same time my son said that this teacher had had a breakdown in front of his whole class, shouting and ranting and raving that an ambulance had to come and take him to hospital.  The Head was grateful for the information and that teacher never returned to the school.  I hear much later that he was privately torturing a 12 year old boy, then I heard that he had committed suicide.  I don't know if the last 2 statements are true though.
2) At uni my daughter went on to uni Art classes, one of the days she refused to distort her drawings of people or rip up a drawing she had done as the teacher had told her too.   Then the Art Teacher tried to belittle her in front of everyone, saying to her 'you will never be a real artist if you can't even do what you're told and  your work is too pretty pretty anyway!'  She replied, 'it's my art not yours or anyone elses.  Art is personal interpretation of MY work, not forced interpretation of yours!' ....She did finished the course with a 2.1 Grade, which is the 2nd highest grade! This was excellent since she was away so much of the time because she didn't work well under that teacher.  - How do these teachers get away with teaching our children their warped fantasies?

              Its really awful how they denigrate and label everything that is good and pure. I go to exhbitions a lot and sometimes i see things that are straight satanic. I remember i went to see Ron Mueck once and almost vomit from so much evil. Thank you for sharing that story.

               I know, some art is absolutely repulsive.  For her end of year art piece they had to make a corset, convenient for pervs.  Oh boy, my eyes needed scrubbing after seeing some of the other stands and for the displays they had a photo shoot and they hat to model in them or get a model to model to model them for them. (my daughter asked me to go to the photo shoot with her, which was private, but still) anyway, hers was the only beautiful one there that, while still very feminine, covered everything!  I guess these peres do it because they get away with it.

                Modern Art is such a blatant hoax. I really love art in all its forms. But they way the term has been conciously distorted by (((their))) establishment makes my eyes bleed.
Take a look at this:

            That has all you need to know. It's a sick rabbit hole leading to actual soft-core CP channels where kids "play doctor" in their underwear and fake inject each other with drugs.

             Roblox is a channel for paedophiles. It allows for text talk within the game and it's 'free'. It is almost as if it were designed from the ground up specifically for this purpose

The channel is here:

             I feel really sorry for those kids.  I have seen the dumbest parents lately.  They have to have their 5 seconds or minutes of fame.  They make stupid idiot videos that go viral and just as dumb parents and people contribute to the 1M views of something so dumb I can't even believe it.  People do not know how to parent these days.  They think their parents are dumb and do not follow their example.  I have heard them talk about it.  This guy is so stupid and his wife is dumb too for letting him. I don't know if she is thinking boys will be boys or what.   I have a feeling it is mostly him.  What is he going to gain from this?  I think if he does this kind of stuff he can easily be swayed into something more nefarious.

              Idk, carmen. Do you think it's really just a stupid dad? He's done other videos. It feels a lot more sinister to me. I could easily see this as being child grooming materials because there are
              <em>
               so many
              </em>
              by this one user and they ALL feature kids and feces. It becomes more explicit the more you look. I had to stop. I was becoming distressed. I really feel bad for people who investigate crimes against children. How do they ever scrub their brains clean and go enjoy life?

               Oh no, I did not see the others!   I am sure it was disgusting and horrid. I was already so upset with what he was allowing the boys to do, piling the carts full of bags and bags of candy.  I think I missed the feces part.  Oh land sakes alive my Grandma and Other Ladies would say.  Yes, as you say, there are some that are grooming their children.  I don't know how we all manage from day to day.  The story about the 7yr. old girl murdered in London a few days ago just tears your heart out.  Yes, we have to put up with a lot on here, but somehow we keep going, for the children.

                Indeed. I red flagged the videos I came across, but we all know that's like cutting heads off the hydra. God bless you carmencita!
