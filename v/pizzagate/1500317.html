            no I am not paid by anyone to do anything, and not looking for an "internet job" but something else entirely having nothing to do with crime or politics.

            I remain curious about why bill Handel's YouTube has been linked in your several duplicative topics and why you maintain he or some other bill Handel has anything significant to do with VCU.
The only guess I can venture is that you could be working for him or his employer, or advertising on his YouTube channel, which I'm sure has gained views through your efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can get a handle on who your  "Handel" is and document a relevant role in a relevant organizaton, other than what's his "tribe" and that level of bs, it would add to your credibility.
           </p>

            Show me any source that states that the Pax2 protein acts as any kind of drug. Otherwise, none of this is relevant. Based on your article, it kinda sounds like Pax2 would give you cancer if you injected it!

            Again, how does any of this address the point that it would be easier to cook the protein in vats of GMO bacteria, rather than kidnapping people?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're saying that they want PAX2 mutations for the physiological effects on the children themselves, fine. I'm just trying to point out how unlikely the drug angle is.

            Pax2 is a transcription factor. It's not orally active, and more importantly likely wouldn't do anything to adults anyway. It's not a psychoactive drug. I've been saying that (if there is any connection to coloboma at all), the correct gene is OTX2, which causes delayed puberty. Obviously something that would be of interest to pedophiles.

            I don't believe the drug angle- elites already have access to any pharmaceutical they could want, through normal manufacturing processes.

            We used to extract insulin for diabetics from dogs or pigs. Now we grow GMO bacteria in vats that produce insulin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would elites sacrifice humans to harvest a product that they could just cook up in a vat,
            <em>
             legally
            </em>
            , with much less hassle?

            So now you are throwing hunter Thompson and adrenochrome into the pot of
Shit you started stirring with your earlier foolish genetics thread....why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why why  why?
           </p>
           <p>
            And why this fantasy about bill Handel having a relationship to VCU? There is no such relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please explain yourself or delete this poor posting!
           </p>
           <p>
            Or at least explain the seemingly idiotic Bill Handel trolling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you get paid for Handel's YouTube you linked in the earlier post?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you fail
Out of VCU?
           </p>
           <p>
            What is the deal?
