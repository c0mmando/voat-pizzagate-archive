            Schills keep saying that things like this are "coincidences" or accidental uses of common shapes. They can only be one of three options....
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Insanely gullible and ignorant of the real underbelly of society.
            </li>
            <li>
             They are actual schills.
            </li>
            <li>
             They are pedo sympathizers.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Listen up, companies all over the world select "good causes" to support because they know citizens who ALSO support those causes will be swayed even more to buy and support their products if some of the proceeds go to support the cause in question. (Pink ribbons, aids, cancer, autism...)
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, think, for once in your life use your sheepish herd mentality brain on your own....
           </p>
           <p>
            What would happen if they came out with a "pedo bear pin" and companies rallied for pedophilia rights? They would not gain support - they would be run out of town.
           </p>
           <p>
            So how do businesses who are sympathetic towards thenpedo movement gain support? They use symbols that are recognized by their supporters and NOT the rest of society. And in this way they can raise funds without brandishing their horrific cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those sympathetic to pedophelia and those who want it to be socially acceptable will direct their money towards those companies who also share that goal.

             Not ignorant of the underbelly, but i disagree that this is proof of any collusion with pedophillia, its paper thin evidence to be frank, but you actually did make a very good point about how the symbol could be used to display to pedophiles that they support their cause, though i gotta be honest, i highly doubt even a minute minority of pedophiles actually use or know about those symbols, its not a centralized religion with widespread codes of conduct, its a seedy sexual practice performed by hollow people, the ties just dont do anything for me im sorry

              The fact that it seems so outlandish is why it works. It's the art of keeping a secret.  Pedophiles and sexual predators and "progressives" who want more and more sexual depravity in the open in society and just ignorant liberals who live under a "relative" code if morality (hypocrisy) are not in the minority. These people REALLY believe they protect the idea of TRUE love between a grown man and a 6 year old and your a bigot if you don't.
             </p>
             <p>
              The agenda is a complete breakdown into moral depravity.  It's funny because people predicted pedophilia would be the next abnormality be normalized and guess what....
             </p>
             <p>
              The same nay sayers called them paranoid conspiracy theorists. Now it's happening and elevery industry is infested with them and no one knows why.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's because they know and support each other through symbols while the average citizen is clueless.  It's possible. It's happening. Believe it or not. It's happening.

               right, well in that case industry pedophiles WOULD gain from the symbols to show and support eachother, but that would be more to do with pedophile cult practices, what i was saying is that regular run of the mill pedos wouldnt have anything to do with the symbolism because they are just private perverts.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wouldnt call those who predict pedophillia being the next 'new norm' for liberals conspiracy theorists, that sentiment comes from the slippery slope argument that liberals use for all of the other perversions, alot of the arguments for homosexuality also apply for pedophillia, incest and heck probably even beastiality, their excess in promoting their depravity show that they are desperate to spread their illness and want it to infect as many as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course the next step is to promote sexual perversions as normal to children who are very susceptible and take alot of information from authority figures for granted, this is the current lgbtqpbi agenda, its in fact VERY obvious what their next move is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hell, the rampant sexuality displayed in pop music through dance and lyric and the promotion of such smut to children is damning enough, i see children dance now in such a way that a whore wouldnt have 50 years ago and it sickens me. I remember someone saying a while back that the promotion of pedophillia will be pushed by children infected by smutty media and the argument will be something along the lines of "its oppressive to say what they can and cant do". The promotion wont be about predators wanting children, it will be children wanting predators.
              </p>
              <p>
               That along with the 'body positive' shit, i mean, this is a thing, teaching toddlers to touch themselves -

              </p>
              <p>
               My problem with the symbolism is that it does and says nothing, while it very well may be a sign used to promote pedophiles (a possiblity that i am not dismissing), there is no proof and it is just as, if not more, probable that it is just a coincidence.

            Waste of time. This is NOT how you use symbols! the icons pedophiles use i imagine they use to be able to identify eachother, what the fuck would this mean if it were even accurate? nothing. what, the big boss is trying to let all the pedos know that he fucks kids? no. The symbol is just an icon for identification between pedos, it might make sense if it were part of a residence, place or something personal but this is just retarded

             It's to laugh in our faces. They get off on that. It's a form of magick to express dominance. They're that twisted where they think they've won if they get people to consume regular goods with their symbol on it. It's branding. They went out of their way to make those shaped things not just look like a triangle, but the inner
             <em>
              L
             </em>
             swirl triangle. That took a lot of effort and planning so that the end result WOULD exactly resembled the boy lover symbol. Not a mistake nor mere coincidence.

              Bingo.  They have been hiding in plain site and now they no longer can. The best way to inform the public and not be shut down is to hand out flyers to just let them know about sex trafficking and include the FBI notice of Pedo symbols.  Simple. They have not had all these symbols broadcast before.  We can plaster them everywhere.  We could have a special day to spill the beans on the pedos but go low key.  As you say, they also want to make their designs mainstream.  Yeah, I don't believe that is the same design, why would they do that?  How could they get away with that?  NAAAAAHHHHHH.

             Right. I mean, because symbols are rarely used in society. Hardly ever in history do groups use symbols to identify themselves.....

             Yeah.. I disagree.  I don't think you understand how far along the TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICA is, or the willingness the Elite rulers of the Pedo Cult to infiltrate every corner of society. This 'dumb shit', as you call it, is a huge red flag as to the INGREDIENTS in the 'food' they are processing for consumption.

                  The burden of proof is not on me... I'm not the OP. You need to substantiate the existence of a symbol with supporting evidence. Linking processed ingredients to pedogate via the shape of a corn chip is retarded. Sorry. This does nothing to further our cause.

                     To connect as many legitimate data points as possible, expose the elite and their dark behaviors, dose as many people with red pills as possible... all while we march towards their downfall and hopefully witness these evil bastards being held accountable for their crimes. Whether it is as sinister as the implications around Pedogate, or as straightforward as war mongering, treason, obstruction of justice and all of the other anti-American, constitutionally corrupt actions they engage in to maintain the power structure.

                     I've contributed financially (significantly) to a number of people in here and elsewhere that do good C.I. work, I red pill 1-2 people a week on average, and I've dug up considerable leads since before we migrated to Voat.

             Phase 3 seems to be aimed at showing us evwry irrelevant example of these symbols to  descredit the symbols that we have found in conjunction with other pedophile imagery or suggestion.   What all of these recent posts are missing is some other attachment to suspicious behavior.  Just " see! Those signs are everywhere! Youre crazy"  so obvious

              Exactly... these people are looking WAY too hard at ANYTHING that mildly resembles the symbols, and forgetting that there will be other circumstantial evidence to support this.
             </p>
             <p>
              "LOOK AT THIS LOGO! ZOMG!" is not a valid data point without something else to back it up.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll sustain heat for this commentary, I know that, but, until I'm proven wrong with something worth looking into - the voice of reason will trump the existence of random symbols.

             a triangle chip is common... but with the same lines as the pedo symbol? they had to go out of their way to make the shape look like that. the bit in the middle is especially suspect to me, since in production every little addition can push costs up higher. if they just wanted to make a triangle with 'flavour holes' or 'texture holes' or something, they could have done that without the little L thing that
             <em>
              just so happens

             to look exactly like the pedo logo.

              Again, if there is ANY supporting evidence of anything outside of the shape of the chip... I'll dig into this lead alongside of you. But, to be downvoated for stating the obvious and injecting the voice of reason into this is beyond offensive.
