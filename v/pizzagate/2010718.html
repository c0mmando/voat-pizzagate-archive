<p>What this is intended to do is show where these secret societies are originating from and who is running the &quot;game&quot; behind the scenes.

<p><em>This relates to pizzagate because it\'s important to know your enemy and ultimately the people at the top are the ones using children as blackmail tools.</em></p>

<p>Keep in mind that Georgetown was the #69th ranked law school in 1975 (14th in todays world) and they already had political connections. Why would they choose Georgetown, like so many others?</p>

Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center. In late 1973 her first scholarly article, &quot;Children Under the Law&quot;, was published in the Harvard Educational Review. Discussing the new children\'s rights movement, it stated that &quot;child citizens&quot; were &quot;powerless individuals&quot; and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise, on a case-by-case basis.

<p>It would take a total lack of common sense to ignore that most of our top politicians are being trained at Jesuit/Roman Catholic schools and that orders like SMOM and the Knights of Garter are represented strongly in these schools. More to come in part 2, but first were going to get back to the Rothschilds.</p>',

            The Jesuits have always functioned as the "spy apparatus" of the Vatican state, like a CIA for the pope.  They were banned from becoming Pope for that reason what, 150 years ago or so?  not sure on that date but 100-150 years or so, and have worked to reverse that relentlessly ever since  The current pope of course represents their achievement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having a Jesuit Pope is kind of like having a former CIA director as President - oh, we made that mistake already, no wonder he was called "Poppy", right?

             Thanks VieBleu, the blatant censorship of the last threads should speak volumes to the people who really care about getting to the bottom of who's controlling the pedo blackmail game. I appreciate honest opinions and you've never failed to give me yours. We've had our difference of opinion, but in the long run I believe we're both here to help kids and end this bullshit.

              I wanted to add, I listened to Catherine Austin Fitts the other day talking to black Congresswoman Maxine Waters - they both discussed how those who work behind the scenes do so in their own "tribes"  In effect they said the Jewish cabal for historical reasons is the tool of both the Wasp Cabal and the Catholic Cabal.   Very interesting stuff from two top level commenters with respect from wide audiences.

            This is why the spotlight needs to be on Racine, WI. We know the real secret, and the world needs to know the real truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is a main "Root" and hub for secret societies, most notably Pilgrims Society and Knights of Pythias, but it has extended to include service groups and foundations. Racine is the birthplace and model of Sustainable Development, Community Policing and other parts of Agenda 2030. Racine companies were instrumental in beginning the Art in Embassies program and are linked with the Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation, and other groups involved in trafficking circles. Their real agenda is Global Enslavement, and the Pilgrims Society is closely linked to the Committee of 300, Black Nobility and the Council of 13.
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost all Racine officials have resigned in recent years as those involved became too brazen and began exposing themselves. The most recent is the corrupt criminal mayor who is a low level player in secret societies with mafia ties. He resigned last week amid allegations of racketeering and corruption, and was rewarded with an appointment to control the Great Lakes fresh water supply for his masters.
           </p>
           <p>
            The area is also close to Marquette University (see the Great 28 Jesuit Universities), and the state is widely known to be run by "The Marquette Mafia" such as Scott Walker and most of the area judges and attorneys that include freemasons, Knights of Malta, Knights of Pythias, and members of other secret societies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is also closely linked with the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, and many others in the Committee of 300 and related groups. Racine is one of 13 Bellwether districts in the U.S. and is a main hub for the real collaboration between both Republican and Democrat establishment leaders (Ryan, Priebus, Johnson, McCain, etc and Clinton, Schumer, Aspin, Byrd, etc.). Players such as Podestas, Emanuels, and Ashton Kutcher (see Kabbalah and Freemasonry) serve as middle men to the elite involved linking networks on both sides through DC, NY, Miami, Chicago, and LA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to exposing the real truth and the real agenda of secret societies is exposing the "Root" in Racine, Wisconsin.

              We can back everything we say up, but we also don't have all day for citations and footnotes for those who won't bother to look anything up for themselves. You can verify most of what we say with any number of sources. What links do you need VieBleu - what is it that you doubt exactly? This is a complex network and everything we say is true and can be substantiated.
             </p>
             <p>
              We also know it all to be true from experience, multiple private investigations, witnesses, and other direct sources. We question whether you really want to know the truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              What is it that you need to know to prove we are speaking truthfully? Do you not know about the Marquette Mafia, or do you think the Pilgrims Society is made up?
             </p>
             <p>
              Is VieBleu related to ActBlue? We hope not.

                    Thank you that is good to hear. We understand why people may be skeptical. This is an enormous discovery and hard to believe truth, but we assure you it is not conjecture.

                    There is not one concise link that proves the entire chain of connections. It is a complex network. We have something bigger in the works that will explain everything, but until then, please pick ANY PARTICULAR PARTS that you need to know more about and we will provide you with more information or links to prove it.

                    Anyone that does not want Total Global Enslavement should be involved and interested in this. This could be the one truth that can unite us all and reverse the model.

                What do you know about Racine, Wisconsin? To claim it is a distraction without knowing anything about it and being too lazy to research any part of it shows your real agenda.

            Here's a sample if you're too busy to read the whole thing:  "I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants’ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus."
