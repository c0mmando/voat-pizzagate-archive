<p><strong>I have been researching former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson (2002-2011) in the past four weeks, since he was a good friend of the deceased New Mexico artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._C._Gorman">RC Gorman</a> (1931-2005), who was a pedophile, and whose partner <a href="https://archive.is/BIA3i">was a convicted pedo</a>.</strong> </p>
<p>When Gorman died, Bill Richardson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._C._Gorman">ordered</a> the state flags to fly at half mast in honor of R.C. Gorman\'s contributions, although he must have known that the FBI <a href="https://archive.is/BIA3i">investigated</a> the artist, and stated that it &quot;uncovered credible evidence that Gorman participated in child sexual abuse&quot;. </p>
<p>Despite the FBI\'s findings, Bill Richardson stood by his friend Gorman, and held an eulogy at his funeral, praising him as a great man and artist.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KlasfeldReports/status/1159820230262235138">This morning</a>, a court made a bunch of court documents public in a case where Epstein victim Virginia Roberts-Giuffre sued Epstein\'s alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>We were told that politicians and businessmen had been named in these documents as perpetrators.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Richardson is among them.</strong></p>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p><strong>Virginia Giuffre, who says that Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her to powerful people for erotic massages and rape, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190809184620/https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-unsealed-documents-name-powerful-men-in-sex-ring">claimed</a> in a 2016 deposition that Maxwell directed her to have sex with former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for former Gov. Bill Richardson, Madeleine Mahony, told The Daily Beast on Friday,</p>
<p>“These allegations and inferences are completely false. Governor Richardson has never even been contacted by any party regarding this lawsuit. </p>
<p>To be clear, in Governor Richardson’s limited interactions with Mr. Epstein, he never saw him in the presence of young or underage girls. Governor Richardson has never been to Mr. Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. Governor Richardson has never met Ms. Giuffre.&quot;</p>

<h1 id="md-section-2"></h1>
<p><strong>In this video, investigative journalist Vern Beachy talks about <strong>Bill Richardson\'s friendship</strong> with RC Gorman and how Gorman raped and trafficked kids.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvvv9NiHnhk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvvv9NiHnhk</a></p>
<p><em>(He\'s talking about Bill Richardson from 07:00)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;There was no way that Bill Richardson could not know about that&quot;</strong> [Gorman\'s pedophile activities].</p>
<p><strong>&quot;According to the victims (...) the parties that Gorman would throw would include some underage boys, and he would pass around these boys, and these boys would sexually satisfy the party-goers.&quot;</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Q: So you are saying the Governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson, was a part of these parties, and also participating in these activities?</strong></p>
<p>Vern Beachy: I don\'t know if he participated. ...There is no way I could know that. I know he was a part...was an invited guest at some of the parties.</p>
<p>Q:<strong>So, being an invited guest...he attended those parties?</strong></p>
<p>Vern Beachy: He attended those parties...and participating? I don\'t know  and knowing what I know about Bill Richardson, when I met him a couple of times, I would have to say \'no\', that he didn\'t - BUT - he was an invited guest to those parties, (...) I did talk to the victims who were at the parties (...), and eventually tried to get financial compensation from Gorman for the sexual abuse that they endured as a result of Gorman.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Q: So at these parties, you\'ve got a sitting governor, that probably knows that there\'s illegal activities going on...?</strong></p>
<p>Vern Beachy: Mmm... At the time...he was not a sitting governor at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Oh, he wasn\'t?</strong></p>
<p>Vern Beachy: No. He was a part of...initially the Clinton administration, and the UN, I think Energy Department at the time of these parties, he was not a sitting governor, (...) he has since been elected governor of New Mexico.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Q: Sounds like it\'s a system or some sort of a ring that transports these young boys from Mexico and other places into New Mexico, and then just kind of scatters them amongst these people who are invited to the parties.</strong></p>
<p>Vern Beachy: That\'s what the rumour is, and that\'s what the victims have told me, both when I interviewed them for the Gorman story, and after that, some new victims that have come up - they all said it was a child pedophile ring, that they would get kids from Mexico, bring \'em up, and disperse them from the compound in Taos [where RC Gorman lived], and go from there.</p>
<p>Those were the allegations when I was doing the Gorman story, but my focus at the time was on Gorman, and I didn\'t want to get scattered in 50 different directions, and lose my focus on what I was reporting on at the time (...),</p>
<p>Conran Runnenbaum [a pedo priest friend of Gorman] is one of those names, and others that are named, and I knew about them, but my focus was on Gorman, and (...) I didn\'t want to get lost in the other things (...).</p>
<p><strong>Q: It also sounds like the governor of New Mexico has some sort of knowledge about this ring, so what is your guess - why he doesn\'t go after these guys?</strong></p>
<p>Vern Beachy:  (...) The thing that I would speculate - why Richardson does not come out with his knowledge of this (...) is because of money, he doesn\'t want the coffers to dry up, which they would.</p>

<p><em>Vern Beachy used to work at a radio station in New Mexico, and got fired after he did a 5-part-series about the allegations against RC Gorman. He has been trying to keep the story alive in the past couple years, you can find more info on his website</em></p>

<p><strong>Former Gov. Bill Richardson <a href="http://archive.fo/EAAi1">recalls</a> visiting the southern Santa Fe County mansion of Jeffrey Epstein</strong> just a single time, a Richardson spokeswoman says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Richardson is among the many well-known people listed in Epstein’s so-called “little black book,” containing phone numbers and other contacts, and which has become part of court records.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Epstein also donated $50,000 to each of Richardson’s two gubernatorial campaigns, in 2002 and 2006.</strong> </p>
<p>Richardson re-gifted the 2006 campaign donation to charity as sex-crime accusations against Epstein emerged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mahony said that Richardson, to the best of his recollection, went to Epstein’s Zorro Ranch near Stanley just once, in 2002 during his first run for governor, and that his wife, Barbara Richardson, went with him. </p>
<p>The other people present for a dinner or lunch was a person Richardson understood to be an assistant to Epstein and someone Richardson recalls as an “award-winning scientist,” Mahony said.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-4"></h1>
<p>Fun fact: <strong>Richardson is on the advisory board of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Energy">Genie Oil company</a></strong>, together with Jacob Rothschild, Larry Summers (former Harvard president, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers">sacked for sexist behaviour</a>, flew on Epstein\'s Lolita Express), former CIA director James Woolsey, and Rupert Murdoch.</p>

          <p>

            Bill Richardson is super tied to Doug Band of the Clinton foundation. It has to do with the nuclear energy deal in a run and uranium one and ask for trading energy and technology secrets to sanctioned countries. He obviously was blackmailed and that’s why he went along with it

            Richardson also joined Kissinger McLarty Associates, a "strategic advisory firm" headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Clinton White House chief of staff Mack McLarty, as Senior Managing Director.

             I live in ME. There is a notice by thewebofslime in red for me to see........very odd.(Owner collects IPS of visitors from Voat) Would guess ME has it's share of sex trafficking , right next to Canada..........forests so you can just cross over to Canada without being seen.........david rockefella loved ME so much, he spent money on developing Acadia national park and roads here. Son or grandson lived here and died in a plane crash....he was piloting.Very beautiful as well as proximity to Canada for trafficking.

            "Prince Andrew has denied any wrongdoing and in a 2015 court application, a judge struck Robert’s allegations for being 'immaterial and impertinent.'"  Impertinent indeed. How dare the wench impugn the integrity of Andrew Albert Christian Edward, his Royal Highness the Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. The commoner hussy is lucky the Florida judge, who knows his or her place, didn't summon the royal executioner over from England or feed Roberts to an alligator or crocodile, whichever one it is that they have in Florida.

            <strong>
             Who is Bill Richardson?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            William Blaine Richardson III (born November 15, 1947) is an American politician, author, and diplomat who served as the 30th governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Energy Secretary in the Clinton administration and has also served as a U.S. Congressman, chairman of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.
           </p>
           <p>
            In December 2008, he was nominated for the cabinet-level position of Secretary of Commerce in the first Obama administration, but withdrew a month later as he was investigated for possible improper business dealings in New Mexico.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although the investigation was later dropped, it was seen to have damaged Richardson's career, as his second and final term as New Mexico governor concluded.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-section">
           </h1>
           <p>
            After college, Richardson worked for Republican Congressman F. Bradford Morse from Massachusetts. He was later a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richardson worked on congressional relations for the Henry Kissinger State Department during the Nixon administration.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1978, Richardson moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and ran for the House of Representatives in 1980 as a Democrat, losing narrowly to longtime 1st District representative and future United States Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan (R).
           </p>
           <p>
            Two years later, Richardson was elected to New Mexico's newly created third district, taking in most of the northern part of the state. Richardson spent 14 years in Congress.
           </p>
           <p>
            He became a member of the Democratic leadership as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1997 and 1998, Richardson was U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. The Senate confirmed Richardson to be Clinton's Secretary of Energy on July 31, 1998.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the end of the Clinton administration in January 2001, Richardson took on a number of different positions. He was an adjunct professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a lecturer at the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West.
           </p>
           <p>
            He spent the next year researching and writing on the negotiations with North Korea and the energy dimensions of U.S. relations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richardson also joined Kissinger McLarty Associates, a "strategic advisory firm" headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Clinton White House chief of staff Mack McLarty, as Senior Managing Director.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richardson was elected Governor of New Mexico in 2002.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             In December 2005, Richardson announced the intention of New Mexico to collaborate with billionaire Richard Branson to bring space tourism to the proposed Spaceport America located near Las Cruces, New Mexico.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Richardson won his second term as Governor of New Mexico on November 7, 2006.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             During 2008 and 2009, Richardson faced "possible legal issues" while a federal grand jury investigated pay-to-play allegations
            </strong>
            in the awarding of a lucrative state contract to a company that gave campaign contributions to Richardson's political action committee, Moving America Forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            The company in question, CDR, was alleged to have funneled more than $100,000 in donations to Richardson's PAC in exchange for state construction projects. Richardson said when he withdrew his Commerce Secretary nomination that he was innocent; his popularity then slipped below 50% in his home state. In August 2009, federal prosecutors dropped the pending investigation against the governor.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             In its April 2010 report, ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Richardson one of the 11 worst governors in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Richardson's term as governor.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The group accused Richardson of allowing political allies to benefit from firms connected to state investments, rewarding close associates with state positions or benefits (including providing a longtime friend and political supporter with a costly state contract), and allowing pay-to-play activity in his administration. They also opined that he fell short on efforts to make state government more transparent.

            Bill Richardson is a well known piece of shit. He has also been to the bohemian grove and gave  millions to the ((movie industry)). During his tenure. The man is basically an honorary shoah survivor at this point.

              It woldn't surprise me.  Picasso, Erte, Dali, other artists, had their "students"/"victims" mimic their style in their later years when they became most popular and could command the highest dollar.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't think I would call Gorman's art "kitsch".  Gorman incorporated traditional elements of Navaho, Arapaho, and a little Zuni to more of a "pure" form of Native American art.

            Bill Richardson has been accused of raping boys at the parties pedo artist RC Gorman threw in his home in Taos, New Mexico.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gorman has been accused of having trafficked and raped several boys, the Albuquerque PD also investigated him when a 11-year-old boy was found hanging from a tree. He was never charged though.
           </p>
           <p>
            He settled with several of his victims out of court.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gorman was gay, and his partner, who was director of Gorman's Navajo Art Gallery in Taos, was a convicted pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI investigated Gorman, and found evidence that he raped boys, but didn't charge him in the end, due to the statute of limitations.
           </p>

            Currently sifting through my notes, and going to update the post with more info and sources.
