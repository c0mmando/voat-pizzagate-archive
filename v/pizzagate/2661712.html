<p>We all know that intelligence types covet control over information that the public gets. The CIA\'s Operation Mockingbird, to co-opt journalists, and to embed their own people in news organizations is just one example.</p>

<p>and it\'s not just American media. The same thing happens in Germany, for example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-03-28/top-german-journalist-admits-mainstream-media-completely-fake-we-all-lie-cia">https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-03-28/top-german-journalist-admits-mainstream-media-completely-fake-we-all-lie-cia</a></p>

<p>But what if the Deep State also wanted to influence pop culture, the music and entertainment that sets the mood for a generation?</p>
<p>It makes sense that they would. It\'s well-known, for example, that when American movie producers want to make a movie involving the CIA or any military service, if they want any cooperation they will have to meet with the agency\'s media interface personnel and may have significant storyline editing of their scripts.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cia-has-to-approve-every-script-for-spy-drama-the-a-1677157500">https://gizmodo.com/the-cia-has-to-approve-every-script-for-spy-drama-the-a-1677157500</a></p>

<p>One thing many people aren\'t aware of is that certain families become generationally involved in intelligence and the military, and particularly, many become involved in black ops, false flag operations, and abusive programs like MK-Ultra.</p>
<p>Many of these families also participate in ritual abuse, incest and pedophilia.</p>
<p>As an aside, it should be noted that many Illuminati families involve themselves in military and intelligence. (Yes, Illuminati exist, and, no, they\'re not like they\'re portrayed in media and entertainment.) Researchers might find this account enlightening:</p>
<p><a href="http://educate-yourself.org/mc/mcsvaliinterviewpt1.shtml">http://educate-yourself.org/mc/mcsvaliinterviewpt1.shtml</a></p>
<p>Here\'s a relevant quote from Part 3 of the series: &quot;<em>The Illuminati believe that to control the media is to control the public. This is one of their stated agendas. Remember, finances, media, law, government and education are the areas they targeted as being the best to dominate society</em>.</p>
<p><em>How do they do this? They don\'t go to a film producer and say, &quot;Oh, by the way, we\'re Illuminati members and we want you to make a movie that promotes our agenda&quot;. (Remember, they aren\'t stupid, either). Instead, they will form a small investment corporation that funds movies with ideas that they like. They quietly hire actors and producers and directors and scripts, but they never mention their affiliation publicly or why they are doing this</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>So, it makes sense that there could be an attempt made to influence the direction of the pop music industry.</p>
<p>Now go to Los Angeles, where Lookout Mountain Air Force Station, also known as the 1352d Motion Picture Squadron, was located atop the hill that overlooks Laurel Canyon, a small neighborhood that climbs up either side of its namesake canyon.</p>
<p>Few knew about the station until years after it was shut down. Classified film footage was processed and edited there, along with routine productions such as training films. The CIA used the facility too, I haven\'t been able to find out whether other intelligence agencies worked there, but it would probably be a good guess to propose that the DIA and the NRO did work there. And, in true spook fashion, it had underground facilities and tunnels.</p>
<p>Now, most people are aware today that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a fabricated event that never really happened. The Deep State staged it in order to provoke Congress into the Vietnam War. George Morrison was the officer who commanded the Gulf of Tonkin expedition.</p>
<p>Now suppose that the son of George Morrison was a guy named Jim Morrison, and he moved to live in Laurel Canyon below the Lookout Mountain Air Force Station, where he became the lead singer of The Doors.</p>
<p>That\'s right. The lead singer of The Doors was the son of a naval officer who was in charge of a deep state false flag operation.</p>
<p>Or suppose that the son of a chemical warfare specialist who grew up at the Edgewood Arsenal (famous for its research on chemical weapons, and infamous for it\'s location of abusive MK-Ultra experimentation by the CIA) was a guy named Frank Zappa, who would move to Laurel Canyon, and go on to found a several bands and become a major record producer.</p>
<p>Or suppose the son of a career marine captain, who attended the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, who\'s brother was a marine, who\'s mother worked on secret government projects and who\'s sister worked for the Pentagon, was a guy named John Phillips, who moved to Laurel Canyon and would become famous as the songwriter for The Mamas and the Papas, and infamous for committing incest with his daughter, Mackenzie Phillips.</p>
<p>And that\'s just the beginning. Dave McGowan makes an excellent case that many young generation Deep State offspring suddenly moved to Laurel Canyon, were provided with instruments and financing, and were quickly given recording contracts that usually took bands years to achieve. And that this was no accident.</p>
<p><a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/inside-the-lc-the-strange-but-mostly-true-story-of-laurel-canyon-and-the-birth-of-the-hippie-generation-part-i/">http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/inside-the-lc-the-strange-but-mostly-true-story-of-laurel-canyon-and-the-birth-of-the-hippie-generation-part-i/</a></p>
<p>He also contends that the messaging that came out of the Laurel Canyon music community was no accident. And as you expect with these generational families, pedophilia played a role. Here\'s an example he gives in part 3 about Frank Zappa:</p>
<p>\'<em>as Barry Miles noted in his Zappa biography, Frank’s daughter Moon “recalls men with straggling beards, body odour and bad posture who crouched naked near her playthings …” Also, the “Zappa children watched porn with their parents and were encouraged in their own sexuality as soon as they reached puberty. When they became teenagers, Gail insisted they shower with their overnight guests in order to conserve water</em>.” \'</p>
<p>This is a huge, 12-part series, with masses of references, in David McGowan\'s usual fashion, and it gives one an interesting insight inside the workings of a generational operation, and insight into where some of today\'s pop culture came from.</p>
<p>It also gives insight into just how deep the tentacles of the Deep State reach into our society.</p>',

            Breakdown of the family and traditional gender roles has been a disaster. Now we have dudes who wanna abandon their kids and turn into ladies. The hippies were definitely a creation of CIA and The Beatles were a huge part. Good research on the others.

            I read a really good (although long) article written by Miles Mathis that discusses the whole Manson family phenomenon and the Tate murders. It covers a lot of this same info regarding the 60's music scene, government, and weirdness at lookout mountain. It's really worth a read if anyone is interested:

            The English version is Tavistock Institute of Social Engineering which ran parallel to the military intelligence in the USA.  Tavistock was comprised of mi5 agents.  They supposedly orchestrated “Beatlemania” which was the forerunner for free love in the 60s.

             Sorry for the tortured sentences...not enough coffee. The group is on FB...the more of Dave's material you read , the better they like it.Some of the people who comment on this site knew him...his brother is on it too occ. Laurel Canyon seems to be a nexus....and demonic. Very, Have been reading this link the last few days, it describes the satanic stuff that went on there before the movie business.This link was done in the form of a newsletter, awful grammar at times but I trust it.13 illuminatti families that control the world....the info on the demonic activity in California is probably in the Kennedy section...have read Bundy, Collins Kennedy.Will look for it later on today..https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/FC/FC2F5371043C48FDD95AEDE7B8A49624_Springmeier.-.Bloodlines.of.the.Illuminati.R.pdf

              Unfortunately, everything that Springmeier writes is to be taken with a grain of salt - nowadays he claims to be a spokesperson for the 'Illuminati' because they allegedly admire his courage... Well...
             </p>
             <p>
              I doubt that the 'Illuminati' call themselves Illuminati, and much of the bloodline stuff that circulates on the internet seems to be made up (like the Venice 'Black Nobility').

            The Illuminati you mention is just another name for openly trying to advert attention from masonic families.
It is generational control. Endless power struggles between hundreds of masonic orders. 
All of which, do not like when they are openly spoken about.

            What an odd coincidence!  I began reading about Laurel Canyon on Dave McGowan's website just yesterday!  Only 4 chapters in so far, but it's fascinating reading.  The sheer number of 60 icons (Zappa, Hendrix, Morrison, Mamas &amp; Papas etc.) who came from military and/or old money families is too great to be coincidence imo, as is the fact that they were all suddenly drawn, "like lemmings" as Neil Young put it, to Laurel Canyon (LA was not a centre of pop music at that time) in the mid 1960s.

             From what I remember,  rock was centered around London and Motown (not sure if recorded in Detroit or ny or elsewhere) right before "hippie" music took over. Well, the Beach Boys and surf music was in LA.

              On another note, judging from the number of people who've been whacked in Hollywood, according to Dave McGowan, one really has to admire the guts of entlawyer from the CDAN blog in dishing all the dirt on these degenerates.

            The Navy black ops has its hand all over 9/11 and every major false flag since the start of the US/ Spanish war.  They are just masters at deflecting attention away from themselves and having their operatives/ shills point the finger at others - i.e. 9/11 was Israel/ Saudi/ Muslims etc..

            Thanks for this important reminder. Everything I've read of McGowan's is powerfully comprehensive, while deeply unsettling. He connected the dots, shattering the notion that conspiracy theories aren't, simply, conspiracies.

             I think rap is the way they're destroying blacks and kids these days. The lyrics are ghastly and have been for decades. I actually like some rap. I'm the only boomer I know who does, but the words are subversive AF. The lyrics are criminal. I'll check out Rock Against Bush.

            Providing Instruments and financing wasn't all of it: CIA LSD allegedly made it's way into many of the top recording artists' diet
.Per Mae Brussell : "While pure LSD is usually 160 micrograms, the CIA was issuing 1600 micrograms."
" Managers of seven rock groups, seven different groups, had hired private eye Hall to find out how their stars were getting "stoned."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Turning on or feeling "high" doesn't warrant hiring the professional assistance of a detective. That they were obviously complaining about was that the stars were being altered in such a way that it hampered with their public appearances, credibility, personal lives, and recordings. "

             It's all about maintaining the illusion of control so the people don't rise up. You have to keep the people under control to keep the peace. So you create a lot of fear, and then provide them with ample distractions to soothe their minds when they become too scared to do something about what they think are your black ops. Some of those are probably real but many of them are fronts to scare people while they rake up the money. Sad thing is you can't take it with you so you gotta leave it to your kids. Thus, Illuminati blood lines.

            David McGowan also wrote the book Pedophocracy  which will shed light on the times we all are living through today.

             What laugh! Nothing but conjecture and imaginative invention. It was planned eh? Of course  a lot of 1960's musicians came from military families, their parents fought in WW2 as they were drafted.

            No doubt, the hippie movement was manufactured by certain people within our government (deep state).  That is when Cultural Marxism really amped up.
They needed to breakdown our morals, values and strong families. They sent out their soldiers preaching free sex, pushing drugs on our youth, and spreading the virus. Marriage wasn't cool, god wasn't cool, children don't need rules etc.

            I can't say enough good things about Dave McGowan, he was an excellent researcher. He was so talented at weaving all these webs together in a way that was easy to understand and follow. Sometimes books like these can get a little mundane, it took me six months of on and off reading to get through a novel about the Rothschild's because I would get bored with it.  When I read McGowan's Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon, I would have to force myself to put it down and go to sleep, I just wanted to devour it all in one sitting, of course it helped that the subject matter was fascinating too. Highly recommend!

             Not only the Hippie Movement but the Grunge Movement, as well.  The Grunge movement was particularly insidious because it glamorized heroin and depression in male youth.  No coincidence that 4 of the 5 lead singers of the primary Grunge Bands are all dead: Kurt Cobain from Nirvana, Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots, Jerry Cantrell from Alice in Chains, and Chris Cornell from Soundgarden.

             Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam is the last man standing and he just happens to be the biggest sellout of the entire group.

              Grunge was my era.

              I've read the whole
              <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/inside-the-lc-the-strange-but-mostly-true-story-of-laurel-canyon-and-the-birth-of-the-hippie-generation-part-i/">
               the Strange Times blog
              </a>
              blog, most of the people involved were from elite and/or military families, and with Courtney Love and Dave Grohl you've got the same thing. And of course David Geffen, owner of Nirvana's record label, is a pretty shady individual with all kinds of dubious connections.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember reading an article somewhere about the Seattle scene 10-15 years after Grunge, the reporter was speaking to some guy at a music bar who said that the scenes before and after the Grunge explosion were of a similar quality, only around 1990 Seattle got really big due to the media.
             </p>
             <p>
              IMO the Grunge Movement was mostly authentic, a reaction to the Nihilism of modernity, then the CIA blew it up out of all proportion and inserted their people into it to lead it in a direction that suited them.

               Boeing and Microsoft put Seattle on the map, and it makes sense. But Amazon and Facebook have made Seattle HUGE and turned it into a total San Francisco-style shitshow -- a process that began alongside Grunge. Their insane growth has never made much sense. Clearly, someone decided Seattle was the next city that needed to be transformed/controlled. The question is, why?

                Do they ever really need a reason? Probably simply because it was a popular place. Maybe I'm naive and I'm sure they have other reasons.

               I agree. They target specific bands that already have a following and then send in the comped producers, managers and musicians to co-op the movement. The majority of lyrics of those 5 bands I mentioned all seem to have come from the same source. David Geffen is a murderer and one evil son of a bitch. In my research, I believe he was behind Cobain's death and Benjamin Orr of The Cars.

             I think Morrison and Zappa had real talent. The Mama's and the Papa's were horrid just like the Monkees. All music pushes an agenda, but I can't believe how far they've taken rap. I lived through the 60s, so I will definitely read the suggested book. I've only seen excerpts, but the whole thing is crazy fascinating. There's no doubt in my mind of their music and movie agenda. I used to tell my husband I couldn't stand "blockbuster" big name Hollywood movies because they were so politically subversive. He used to think I was nuts. He's starting to believe me.

              I think Zappa had talent, but not Morrison. The Doors' music is good, but everything was done for them. As McGowan says, his official story is that a guy who had never been interested in music, who had never even been to a concert, denied even wanting to learn to play an instrument, who couldn't read music, went off and wrote a bunch of rock standards. Like,
              <em>
               how
              </em>
              did he write them? Without being able to play, or knowing his notes? The guy who's father started the Vietnam war?
             </p>
             <p>
              The people playing on the records aren't the same people as the ones on the cover.

              That last link was mind boggling. One of the stars who acted in movies made at Lookout Mountain was Ronald Reagan...... Made me think of Brice Taylor's book, Thanks for the Memories.....she was given to him as a MK Ultra slave.At least , he was relatively kind. But she described Edward Kennedy as violent and cruel.
