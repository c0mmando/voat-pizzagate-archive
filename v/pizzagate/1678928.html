            It saddens me that her main point is that these awful crimes wouldn't be prosecuted in the USA because of the statute of limitations. The age of consent is two years higher in the US and the population is higher. So how many people have gotten away with this shit because of bullshit laws.

            I find it exceptionally backwards to be an proponent of women's reproductive health whilst at the very same time advocating to lower the age of consent to thirteen. It doesn't take a genius to understand that if 13-year-olds are routinely sexually active then there will be a significant rise in complicated pregnancies and births, let alone population. If we're talking about children of such an age taking contraceptive pills then we're going to have some very serious problems in no time in respect of birth defects and disease. Her attitude is beyond backwards, rather it is downright malicious.

            I actually had no idea who she was, so I ran a Google Images search. Lo-and-behold there are quite a few pictures which, without actually checking them out, might offer links between her and Jimmy Savile. What with her stupid outlook on life, which frankly comes across more anti-women and pro-rapist in all honesty, I wouldn't at all be surprised if she knew Savile quite well.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Oh, I get it, she was defending him so that's why she's alongside him in pictures.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that I've watched the video, I have to say that there is a fair point to one thing she's arguing,
            <em>
             to an extent
            </em>
            . She mentioned that rape is a felony whereas groping would be a misdemeanour. I think she's technically correct there. That, however, is on a per-case basis - after all, it has to argued that persistent misdemeanour offences will eventually amount to a felony, regardless of whether or not a prosecution has ever arisen. For instance, if a man has deliberately inflicted life-long psychological or indeed physical harm upon dozens of children over the course of a decade then it would be the proper course of action to bring about a case for imprisonment. Granted, if that man is of a frail age then it may not be practical but a criminal record is not out of the question. If we're considering Savile, then it goes without saying that no judge in the country would have gone easy on him had it have reached court before he died, at least not in a moral and democratic society.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, she then goes on to say that it would be wrong to prosecute somebody for a war crime which was committed in the 1940s, this is clearly very bad form. She is absolutely trying to get people off the hook - in fact that is precisely why Operation Yewtree has hit so many barriers, because it is deliberately being obstructed in order to prevent not so much justice in and of itself, but moreover to prevent public knowledge of powerful figures being involved in serious crimes against children. She immediately laughed off "Satanic Panic", even though there have been documented cases going back decades which raise enough cause for concern as to be a matter of public interest, but she clearly has an agenda, possibly even direct orders, to keep it all from scrutiny.

            This chick is 100% a spiritcooker.  This is about the same time the NYT? WSJ? Article came out saying pedophilia was a disorder not a crime, isn't it?

            I figure word came down from ahigh from the global masters to all the countries in the western world that now was the time to start pushing this idea in each respective country.

            Anybody who is allowed to pontificate on the box of lies seems to be part of the movement. To not get all aboard the NWO express means you would not get far in your career. Think of it like the way German doctors around WW2 had to be proponents for Eugenics, if they weren't they were out of work. Eventually, some of the least skilled doctors became the highest paid and top of their profession. Because they gave the master what they wanted and pushed their agendas. Basically, what we are seeing is the weakest and most compromised, and sometimes the most gullible, rising to the top on TV, the Big screen, Music industry etc. And of course scientist and politicians. The shit rises to the top.

            Goes along with this request to investigate Clinton-Obama-Soros overthrow of the pope. New tweets from the pope are saying reduced punishment for crimes. (It's a good read with points on surveillance, financial, etc)

            Why do the 13 yr olds have to suffer?  The old geezers have to keep their pants zipped, that is all.  If not, a chastity lock and throw away the key.
