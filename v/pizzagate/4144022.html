            You know who supports this Adult Baby Diaper Lovers stuff?

           <p>
            Q.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's right.  If you go to 8kun the one site which Q chose as his official home, they have an ABDL board with over 100,000 posts.

            just go to 8kun DOT top and you'll see it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cuteboys board is also to be avoided.
           </p>
           <p>
            At least this better than the stuff that the owners of 8kun used to host.

            Typically people with this fetish are looking for enabling partners who are adult "big, mommy, daddy, etc" and often it doesn't actually include defecation or urination. More often they just want to suck on a binky or do coloring books, sometimes they're looking for milking nurses. It's weird, but it's not targeting actual kids.

            I've seen a documentary many years back about this topic. adults with normal day jobs, mostly tech, who meet up with other adults, dress up as babies and role play all the stuff babies do. it was presented in a way that their everyday life and job puts too much pressure on them, lack of human contact, love etc. and that kind of role play gives them the illusion of freedom and security, like a loved child usually feels. To be honest, this makes sense to me. But like any (borderline) community I'm pretty sure it's also infiltrated with sinister characters.

            The symbolism is quiet clear. And this falls into the grand hole of gateway shit to get you into other shit. Alas the unfortunate tale of unless they make sizes for smaller bondage enthusiasts this is legal. And leather restraint companies have no issue making their product in any size necessary to fit a client (Hospital/KEK) needs.  I was rehabbed at 11 and was put in a set. (Don't spit on the staff, you won't like the outcome.)

            And of course they use a model thats right on the edge of legal. Interested to hear what Etsy's response is.

            Looked around a bit and it seems like some weird masochistic fetish for people that like to shit their pants and be punished like little kids.
