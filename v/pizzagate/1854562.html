Google for streetview: 1823 N Charles St Baltimore, Maryland</p>
<p>Take a look at the fencing in front of the windows, also the fencing on the building next to it. 
1 building have circle spirals in the shape of a butterfly and the other is squere shaped spirals
(Also note in streetview you can see a &quot;human size doll&quot; in front of the window on the 1st floor of Hexagon)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now you maybe think those spirals are just coincidence! and the doll in front of the window is just a little bit scary...</strong></p>

<p>Some &quot;funny&quot; word play...</p>
<p>&quot;The future of this project is sort of a split into alter egos...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m working on a new Teenage Souls record called Mind Reader.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you been doing Teenage Souls..?&quot;</p>

<p>Don\'t forget to put on your tinfoil hat before listening to this filth, and try to imagine you would need to listen one of those songs for one whole day... or even 30min.... i really can only describe it as something out of the hat from &quot;DJ-MKultra&quot; i dont have other words...</p>

            You can't throw random things together and hit all the markers like this by mistake. These are artists. Artists are thoughtful and purposeful. Or, sometimes they are motivated by subliminal impulses and draw from the cues of their upbringing like the "secret pizza party".

            A hexagram (Greek) or sexagram (Latin) is a six-pointed geometric star figure with the Schläfli symbol. It is the compound of two equilateral triangles. The intersection is a regular hexagon.
