<p>A pardon by President Donald Trump last month has breathed new life into former AZ Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his racist crusade to “prove” the hoax and conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.</p>
<p>Arpaio, 85, promised during a Republican fundraiser in Fresno, CA, on Friday night that he would continue “investigating” birtherism claims.

            Barry's whole Presidency is illegitimate. Definitely believe, 9 fonts on birth certificate? All the Scandals? Traitor, Sedition, Logan Act. Against American values. Had that creepy, vile groping pedo evil Biden as VP. Hillary as Sec of State. How much more. Sickening. Capital Punishment deserved.

            Gotta love how they chuck in that word racist. Man, the shills are working hard on this article. I know a lot of black people that think Obama is a fraud. And if we can wake people up to that fact sooner rather than later, we can just nullify his crappy executive orders that solidified a lot of this mess that was made in the administrations before him. It's a significant thing to try to red pill people about.

            <p>
             I came across the press conference video about a month ago, didn't particularly take note of the date though. Then noticed someone tried to bring up the old talking point which tripped me up last year, went back to the press conference video and looked up an accompanying article, noticed that it's just over a year later... curiosities abound...

             It's a little pg related, what with Obama being an often dicussed person and the accusations that Joe supports pedophiles and etc. Just figure it's worth putting this out there, given that some may have missed it - I know I sure did lol.

            Joe was an authoritarian and abused his power. The sheeple got caught up in th ephony left vs right paradigm and some chose to support him because he is "tough" and fighting the "left". Sheeple will be sheeple.

             No, the problem is that OBAMA is an authoritarian.
He wanted to jail Arpaio in the worst way, but he was squeeky-clean...SO, he had an authoritarian whore of a judge declare from the bench, "Joe, no race-based stops of any kind....", then, out of 10s of thousands of stops by county police of all kinds, she seized on ONE and said, "Joe, you violated my order, 1 year of jail for you for contempt of court."
            </p>
            <p>
             Contempt of Court:  The only way to stick a jail sentence on someone WITHOUT A JURY TRIAL. 
It was the only way they could think of to punish Joe Arpaio for simply enforcing the law.
            </p>
            <p>
             If authoritarianism is a problem for you, the systemic abuse of Arpaio is what you should be bitching about. 
Trump's message was VERY SMART:  "If you enforce the law, I got your back."

               Thanks.   Pizzagate related or not, attacks on anti-Globalist actors have to be defended when they are in the right.  The pedos CAN'T fight the Trumps/etal by defending Satanic pederasty.  They do it with "muh Russia" and "you're a racist".  So we have to fight those battles, too....We can assist the anti-pedos by helping them survive politically.

If Poland, Romania, and Belarus were to the south of us instead of Mexico, Honduras,and Guatemala then we be looking for White illegals.

               Most illegals are from Central America, I believe.  If we removed the CIA from Central America, then those people would be able to build the lives they want.  Instead, the CIA steals their natural resources, so the people naturally want to come to America.

               Asking for ID without probable cause is a complicated issue.  There is a lot of case law about it...

               I hope you agree that the U.S. Constitution is where our loyalty should lie.  It is what protects all of us.  This is why certain groups want to do away with the U.S. Constitution.  They are slowly chipping away at it, but the tide is turning because Trump won.  We would have really been screwed otherwise.

                 The purpose of the CIA it to acquire natural resources for the Cabal.  It is what they do.  Are you not familiar with the history of Central and South America?
