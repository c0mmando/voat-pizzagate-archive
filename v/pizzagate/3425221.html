<h1 id="md-epstein-had-close-ties-to-jpmorgan-chase">Epstein had close ties to JPMorgan Chase</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>He now joins a dizzying roster of suspicious deaths connected to JPMorgan Chase – particularly among its technology executives, who allegedly jumped to their death from JPMorgan buildings; died in two separate cases of murder-suicides in seven months; died of alcohol poisoning or, in the most recent case of <a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/us-en/3000414/doug-carucci-jpmorgan">Doug Carucci</a> in March of this year, simply died “tragically” and “suddenly” with all efforts to obtain the tiniest shred of information about what happened hitting a brick wall.</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2019/03/jpmorgan-managing-director-dies-suddenly-has-links-to-other-jpm-deaths/">In the case of Carucci</a>, who lived in Manhattan, even the New York City Medical Examiner’s Office stated that it had no information at all on any such individual, despite the requirement in New York City that any sudden or accidental death must be examined by that office. Raising more suspicions, mainstream media would not touch the story of Carucci’s death despite the fact that he was a high-ranking employee of JPMorgan Chase as Global Head of Currencies, Emerging Markets, and Commodities Technology and Global Head of FICC Electronic Trading Technology.</p>
<p>Suspicions surrounding Epstein’s death have come from members of Congress and former high-ranking law enforcement officials. The U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, has asked the Justice Department’s Inspector General to open an investigation into Epstein’s death. The FBI is also investigating.</p>
<p>Epstein’s ties to JPMorgan Chase date back to at least 2001 when Epstein presided as Chairman over an offshore company incorporated in Bermuda, Liquid Funding Ltd. As Wall Street On Parade previously reported, the company grew to at least $6.7 billion in outstanding liabilities. The company appeared to be propping up dodgy subprime mortgage dealers by giving them loans. Bear Stearns, where Epstein had worked from 1976 to 1981, owned 40 percent of the equity in the company. JPMorgan Chase was one of three banks providing a $250 million liquidity facility to Liquid Funding Ltd. JPMorgan Chase was also listed as its “Security Trustee.”</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S. and is itself a three-count felon. The bank has been compared to the Gambino crime family in a deeply researched book by two trial lawyers, Helen Davis Chaitman and Lance Gotthoffer. The lawyers write that “…like the Gambino crime family, JPMC recognizes that getting caught is just the cost of doing business illegally.” The lawyers then proceed to list a <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2017/09/jamie-dimon-knows-a-fraud-when-he-sees-it-outside-of-his-bank/">jaw-dropping chronology of illegal acts by the bank</a>.</p>
<p>The Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase is Jamie Dimon, who has remained at the helm of the bank despite those three felony counts that happened on his watch. Two felony counts came in 2014 as a result of JPMorgan Chase’s handling of the business bank account of Ponzi master Bernie Madoff where <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2014/01/jpmorgan-and-madoff-were-facilitating-nesting-dolls-style-frauds-within-frauds/">it ignored flagrant signs of money laundering</a> while proceeding to tell U.K. regulators (but not U.S. regulators) that Madoff might be running a Ponzi scheme. In 2015 the bank was hit with another felony count along with other banks for rigging foreign exchange trading. The bank admitted to all three felony counts.</p>

<h1 id="md-in-2013-the-u.s.-senates-permanent-subcommittee-on-investigations...">In 2013 the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations...</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>released a 300-page report <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/REPORT%20-%20JPMorgan%20Chase%20Whale%20Trades%20(4-12-13).pdf">PDF here</a> on JPMorgan Chase’s high-risk derivatives trades in London that cost its depositors at least $6.2 billion in losses (London Whales trades). Since the financial crisis, the bank has paid out more than $36 billion to settle a myriad of fraud charges against the investing public and innocent consumers. The bank is currently under yet another criminal probe for <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2019/06/could-jpmorgan-chase-be-hit-with-a-fourth-felony-count-for-rigging-precious-metals-markets/">potentially illegal manipulation of gold and silver markets</a>.</p>
<p>Wall Street’s self regulator, FINRA, has decided to put up a <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/2095352#examsSection">personal page for Dimon</a> at its BrokerCheck website, where investors go to check on misdeeds by a potential broker they are considering for investment advice. Dimon’s career history had been missing from BrokerCheck for many years – and we can assure you that Dimon has been named in far more legal actions than FINRA lists on its site. But the three most recent disclosures that FINRA does list for Dimon, for 2014, 2015 and 2016, all say “Criminal.” That’s not really the profile one wants to see for the top executive of the largest bank in the U.S. – and yet his <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2018/03/jpmorgan-paid-a-board-member-532500-in-2016-now-the-board-is-getting-a-25-percent-cash-pay-hike/">richly compensated</a> Board of Directors doesn’t sack him.</p>
<p>... In the U.S. Senate’s investigation of JPMorgan’s London Whale trades, Dimon’s name is mentioned 298 times, and not in a good way.</p>

<h1 id="md-mr.-epstein-had-a-visitor">Mr. Epstein had a visitor</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>what the New York Times reported on July 22 of this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When Jeffrey Epstein was serving time in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor, he got a surprising visitor: James E. Staley, a top JPMorgan Chase executive and one of the highest-ranking figures on Wall Street.</p>
<p>“Mr. Staley had good reason to maintain his relationship with Mr. Epstein, who received him at his Palm Beach office, where he had been permitted to serve some of his 13-month sentence in 2008 and 2009. Over the years, Mr. Epstein had funneled dozens of wealthy clients to Mr. Staley and his bank.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Staley is now the Chief Executive of the British bank, Barclays, another of the banks charged in 2015 for rigging foreign exchange trading along with JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Epstein wasn’t simply serving time for soliciting sex from a minor. At the time, the Justice Department had prepared a 53-page indictment against him with evidence that he had sexually assaulted dozens of underage school girls. Why Epstein got off so easy is now also under investigation.</p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported just five days before Epstein’s death that Staley and his wife had also visited Epstein on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James, in April 2015. Staley was no longer employed at JPMorgan Chase at that time.</p>
<p>The Times article also reveals that Epstein was involved with Staley in brokering a deal where JPMorgan purchased a majority stake in the hedge fund, Highbridge Capital Management, which was co-founded by Glenn Dubin and Henry Swieca. The Wall Street Journal reported that Epstein was paid $15 million for brokering the deal.</p>
<p>FINRA data shows that Highbridge Capital had affiliates in secrecy jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Jersey.</p>

<h1 id="md-spokesperson-for-jpmorgan-denies-reported-intervention-to-ignore-10-year-old-recommendations-to-close-esptein-accounts">Spokesperson for JPMorgan denies reported intervention to ignore 10 year old recommendations to close Esptein accounts</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>...two days before Epstein’s untimely death, taking many of the secrets of his relationship with JPMorgan to the grave with him, New York Times’ reporters Emily Flitter and Jessica Silver-Greenberg wrote that compliance officers at JPMorgan Chase had recommended a decade ago the closing of Epstein’s account at the bank because of legal and reputational risks. The recommendations came after his guilty plea in 2008 to sex crimes. According to the report, which a spokesperson for JPMorgan denies, Mary Erdoes, one of the bank’s top executives, intervened to stop the account purge. The reporters add this:</p>
<p><em>“The episode is another example of how powerful institutions and individuals, eager to profit from Mr. Epstein and his network of wealthy acquaintances, looked past his criminal history and sex offender status. As a result, he managed to retain crucial business connections even as, prosecutors said in a federal indictment last month, he engaged in the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note that Epstein has reportedly been seen with younger girls than that.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>JPMorgan Chase has had an uncomfortably cozy relationship with law enforcement through the years. As we reported in 2012, an employee of JPMorgan Chase (along with several other Wall Street bank employees) was <a href="https://www.gettyimages.ae/detail/news-photo/rare-look-inside-the-new-york-police-departments-lower-news-photo/593375466">allowed to sit elbow to elbow with New York City Police officers</a> in a high-tech surveillance center dubbed the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center watching thousands of street-level surveillance cameras as they spied on the comings and goings of pedestrians. As we wrote at the time, “Not only is it unprecedented for corporations under serial and ongoing corruption probes to be allowed to spy on law abiding citizens under the imprimatur of the largest police force in the country, but the legality of the operation by the NYPD itself is highly questionable.” (See 60 Minutes Takes a Pass on Wall Street’s Secret Spy Center.)</p>

             “The episode is another example of how powerful institutions and individuals, eager to profit from Mr. Epstein and his network of wealthy acquaintances, looked past his criminal history and sex offender status. As a result, he managed to retain crucial business connections even as, prosecutors said in a federal indictment last month, he engaged in the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14.”

            JPMorgan Chase has had an uncomfortably cozy relationship with law enforcement through the years. As we reported in 2012, an employee of JPMorgan Chase (along with several other Wall Street bank employees) was

            in a high-tech surveillance center dubbed the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center watching thousands of street-level surveillance cameras as they spied on the comings and goings of pedestrians. As we wrote at the time, “Not only is it unprecedented for corporations under serial and ongoing corruption probes to be allowed to spy on law abiding citizens under the imprimatur of the largest police force in the country, but the legality of the operation by the NYPD itself is highly questionable.” (See 60 Minutes Takes a Pass on Wall Street’s Secret Spy Center.)

             "Yes. And Deutsche Bank also kept his account, and only closed it recently."  So the financial industry should forbid paedophiles from having accounts. How about people that make tasteless paedophile jokes, like james Gunn, or make tastless racial jokes, or own AR-15s, or support WikLeaks and Assange or who are associated with notorious Nazi Trump?

              Err.....the point is that he obviously made at least some of his money from trafficking children, and Deutsche Bank knew about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Speaking Trump, some employees at Deutsche Bank intended to look into his accounts as well, since they figured he might have been involved in money laundering, but the higher-ups decided against an investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              TL;DR - yes, banks should refuse to take money from human traffickers, illegal arms traders, and drug traffickers. And while they're at it, also accounts of anyone who launders money.
             </p>
             <p>
              But then of course they would have to shut down.

            Wow K9, this is a great article. Thanks for crossposting!  We have far too few digs that follow the money.

            I wonder how JPMorgan connects to rise of the globalist cabal that began around the turn of the 20th century. Q has mentioned the sinking of the Titanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I find it interesting that the NYT and LA Times have both busted JPMorgan -- are they part of rival factions among the globalists?

             <a href="https://www.gnosticmedia.com/SpiesinAcademicClothing_MKULTRA">

            <p>
             The entire MKULTRA era is riddled with banking families, and there is evidence that the CIA was aided in its founding by these families.
            </p>
            <p>
             JP Morgan Bank and Gordon Wasson ran MKULTRA subproject 58. The Warburg family funded and ran Sandoz Pharmaceuticals – the makers of LSD, where Wasson was a director.[65] The Mellon family funded the Harvard Psilocybin Research Project, IFIF, owned the Millbrook mansion, and Billy Hitchcock LSD Enterprises, and was tied back to JP Morgan Bank. The Mellon family was also tied directly to the head of the CIA
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA’s Director from 1966 to 1973, Richard Helms, was a regular guest at the Mellon family mansion in Pittsburgh. Even Tim Leary thought that the ‘liberal CIA’ were ‘the best Mafia you could deal with’.[66]
            </p>
            <p>
             ~ David Black
            </p>
            <p>
             One thing that is difficult to understand is the fable regarding Tim Leary’s getting fired from Harvard in 1963 and the exposure by Dr. Andrew Weil. It appears from the evidence that Weil’s “exposure” was just an old trick using the Hegelian dialectic: problem, reaction, solution; – or thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
             Without Leary having been fired from Harvard he’d never have been able to create the appearance of the hippie guru he’d later use to promote the psychedelics to the youth for the CIA and Huxley and Osmond. Weil’s so-called “exposure,” and Leary’s subsequent “firing” (along with Dr. Richard Alpert), created the illusion, in my opinion, that Harvard, et al, were trying to suppress Leary’s “spiritual message”. This gave Leary and the CIA the psychological advantage they’d need to use against the public. And, after all, Leary and the others were nearly all out of the Harvard Social Relations Department under the well-known MKULTRA conspirator, Dr. Henry A. Murray – who headed the department.

             JPMorgan Chase has also through the years maintained a steady roster of former CIA and Secret Service officials. Thomas Higgins, the former Senior Officer and Station Chief in the CIA’s National Clandestine Service, was previously the Global Head of Operational Control for the bank. Bud Cato (link in article), a Regional Security Manager for JPMorgan Chase from 2011 to 2014, had worked for the CIA in foreign clandestine operations from 1982 to 1995 and in Middle East operations from 2001 to 2011.

             After the Justice Department released the charges against JPMorgan Chase in connection with the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, the Los Angeles Times asked in a photo caption of a smirking Madoff outside of Federal Court: “Bernie Madoff: Was he part of the JPMorgan ring, or was JPMorgan part of his ring?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Throughout his serious brushes with law enforcement, Epstein also wore a perpetual smirk in photos, as if he knew his powerful connections would protect him. It’s now time to ask the question, “Was Jeffrey Epstein part of the JPMorgan ring, or was JPMorgan part of his ring?”

            Reported in 2014, JPMorgan had an estimated $180 billion of life insurance in force on its current and former workers.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Making worldwide news last week was the violent deaths of JPMorgan technology executive Julian Knott and his wife, Alita, ages 45 and 47, respectively, in Jefferson Township, New Jersey. However, two other recent, sudden deaths of technology workers at JPMorgan have gone unreported by the media.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knott’s years at JPMorgan in London overlapped with those of Gabriel Magee, a JPMorgan Vice President who worked in computer infrastructure. Magee, aged 39, is alleged to have leaped from the rooftop of the 33-story JPMorgan London headquarters at 25 Bank Street on the evening of January 27, 2014 or the morning of January 28, 2014. Despite initial London newspaper reports that the jump was observed by “thousands of commuters” and JPMorgan colleagues, the coroner’s inquest on May 20 of this year revealed that not one eyewitness actually saw Magee leap from the building. Nonetheless, based on evidence produced internally by JPMorgan, the coroner ruled that Magee’s death was a suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Six weeks before Magee’s tragic death, another sudden death of a technology worker at JPMorgan Chase occurred in Pearland, Texas. Jason Alan Salais, age 34, was standing outside a Walgreens on the evening of December 15 and died of a sudden heart attack according to a family member. Prior to joining JPMorgan in 2008, Salais had worked as a Client Software Technician at SunGard and a UNIX Systems Analyst at Logix Communications. Wall Street On Parade previously reported on the death of Salais.
            </p>
            <p>
             This death has not previously been reported by the media. Richard Gravino, age 49, was an Application Development Team Lead for JPMorgan in Tampa, Florida. His death occurred on June 24, 2014 at his home in Riverview, Florida. The Hillsborough County Medical Examiner’s office said the cause of death is “pending” with toxicology tests not expected back for 8 to 12 weeks.

             In the month prior to Gravino’s death, on May 7, 2014, Thomas James Schenkman, age 42, died suddenly in Connecticut. (Schenkman’s death has not previously been reported by major media.) Schenkman held the high rank of Managing Director of Global Infrastructure Engineering for JPMorgan Chase and had a highly marketable resume. Schenkman began his technology career with Microsoft, where he worked for 11 years. He moved on to Goldman Sachs in 2000 and worked there for six years. In 2006, Schenkman moved to Bear Stearns and was there at the time of its collapse in March 2008. Schenkman had been with JPMorgan for the past six years.

            <p>
             The series of strange deaths has brought unwelcome attention to the fact that mega banks like JPMorgan Chase are allowed to secretly collect life insurance proceeds on the lives of their employees, and former employees, without disclosing the amounts to the families, or the public, or their shareholders. (Other corporations are likewise engaged in this practice.) The payments are a closely guarded secret between the companies and the insurers who collect the lucrative premiums.

             JPMorgan is also listed as one of the largest donors to a nonprofit Foundation that provides college tuition assistance to the children of fallen CIA operatives, the CIA Officers Memorial Foundation. The Foundation also notes in a November 2013 publication, the Compass, that it has enjoyed the fundraising support of Maurice (Hank) Greenberg. According to the publication, Greenberg “sponsored a fundraiser on our behalf. His guest list included the who’s who of the financial services industry in New York, and they gave generously.”

             Hank Greenberg is the former Chairman and CEO of AIG which collapsed into the arms of the U.S. taxpayer, requiring a $182 billion bailout. In 2006, AIG paid $1.64 billion to settle federal and state probes into fraudulent activities. In 2010, the company settled a shareholders’ lawsuit for $725 million that accused it of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation. In 2009, Greenberg settled SEC fraud charges against him related to AIG for $15 million.
