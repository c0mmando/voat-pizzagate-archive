             The corruption in our government is bi-partisan. This is not Democrats vs. Republicans, even when these more directly political battles are going on. It is crime cabal members vs. government officials who are trying to vet them out. It seems to me that the crime cabal members far out number the ones who are working to expose this, by a lot. It also seems like the criminal cartel/crime cabal has more power than the honest ones. The criminal enterprise does not want more exposure, is above the law (if you follow the Congressional hearing which is ongoing right now there is a lot going on within the scope of attempts to cover up pedogate. Also, I was fascinated when during the congressional hearing questioning Comey about his decision to end the investigation into Clinton just before the election, it comes out that there is a government agency that is so top secret that their name is not even allowed to be disclosed to members of Congress during this hearing that have classified some of the wikileaks e-mails between Podesta and Clinton, etc as ORCON (originator controlled), which means that even the inspector general for our intelligence communities is not allowed to know much of their existence. This is complete recognition to the public of a shadow government and how unconstitutionally powerful it truly is. The American publics continued and consistent demand for accountability is the most important factor in whether pedogate just goes ignored and without justice, yet another time. Of the many times pedogate has been exposed and covered up this is the largest impact exposure the common practice of child sex trafficking within our own US government has ever seen. But without media coverage and people truly drawing the links to how large and truly insidious this problem is, it very likely could be swept under the rug with a Trump impeachment and/or continued defiance of the new administration.

             Because pedogate is the exposure of an elite child sex trafficking network that provides child sex slaves to wealthy powerful people, including many politicians. Because the pedophilia in our government is bi-partisan (Democrats and Republicans are involved) they have been scrambling to contain these leaks and cover this up including censorship on a mass scale here in the US. The Trump administration was elected, in part, because of his campaign promise to "drain the swamp" eluding to the fact that he is interested in exposing this group/network. Since elected all we have seen from the MSM is the worst media bias of an elected official I have ever seen. Vladimir Putin has been vocal about being adamantly anti-pedophilia. Russia has also said that the only people in the US who have had contact with the Russians during the elections were Hillary Clinton and John Podesta. Russia was involved in pay for play with the Clinton foundation over US plutonium rights. When you look at the war in the middle east right now and understand the Iraq/Iran/Syria conflicts in light that they are being created by Soros funded groups and if you acknowledge the US'S own involvement in the creation of ISIS........than you can clearly see that there is a dictatorship trying to regain control of the US government to try and cover up pedogate, push quite an agenda and gain control of the middle east so they can build a pipe and gain access to oil/etc. These people want us at war with Russia but at this point Russia understands what the NWO is trying to do and is absolutely against it. So I posted this because the current strategy, if you followed the link, was that wiretaps were planted to make it look like he was colluding with the Russians. They were planting evidence to try and impeach him so they could cover up pedophilia but the plan has been thwarted. Whether or not you support Trump he is America's last hope to try and weed these pedos out of our government offices. They are fighting tooth and nail to plant their own people, change the narrative with their own media, get honest people out and put more pedos in.

             PG/Alefantis/Podesta very likely to have used their power and connections to agencies like the CIA and the corrupt Obama administration (along with Clinton SOS) to squash and repress any investigations into their criminal enterprise.
