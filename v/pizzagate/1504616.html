<p>I\'m at our family farmhouse; niece LM is visiting; I want to use a toilet in the girls\' bedroom, but the bedroom door is missing; I go outside, it\'s dark but with a house light on, I go on a walkway down the hillside with ornamental shrubs around, to a modern well-lit building with big display windows; Mom is with me and we feel behaviorally oppressed by Illuminati handlers; she goes down some steps and before she goes through the glass door she says Don\'t be negative or positive, be resitive, but we both feel terribly oppressed/enslaved; a male handler in a dark suit repeats to me, Don\'t be positive, be resitive, but I don\'t know what it means; I go further alone on the walkway to the far side of the building to the right; it\'s a skyscraper and the ground floor is a college with the same big display windows where mostly young women are going to classes; there are no restrooms on the first floor, so I go up a wide stairway toward the second floor; a young woman coming down says Hi, using my name; I\'m crossdressed in a short dress and I realize I have a nametag on, but I don\'t want to be identified, so I take it off, but have no pockets, so I hold it in my hand; soon I return to the first floor and meet Mom and a younger niece by a food counter (I guess I\'m not still crossdressed); I say we still have hope, but my niece gets annoyed as if it\'s better to be realistic, but I emphasize that we have to have hope; I think I meant hope to be free of Illuminati.</p>
<p><strong>MEANING?</strong></p>
<p>I\'m posting this in this subverse because this is the main one I read and participate in the most. Google says there are 11,600 occurrences of &quot;resitive&quot;, but looking through some of them, I see they\'re obviously mostly misspellings of &quot;resistive&quot;. In one occurrence it\'s in the phrase &quot;Resitive Touch Example&quot;, but I suppose that may also be meant as Resistive.</p>
<p><strong>ILLUMINATI</strong></p>
<p>Do you suppose I\'m supposed to interpret resitive as resistive? In reality I\'m pretty sure my family has no connection with any Illuminati or Illuminists. I don\'t know if the male handler really means an Illuminati handler, or if it means a guardian angel or anything. I read about Illuminists in 2001 or so. I read a woman code-named Svali and I wrote to her a few times. She said she had been an Illuminist trainer who trained her own people using torture that would not leave any marks. They started with 3 year olds and trained them how to be killers or secret soldiers and how to crossdress to leave crime scenes without suspicion or recognition. I don\'t know what the crossdressing was for in my dream, maybe to blend in with the college girls (?). Having read Svali and about Satanic ritual abuse etc, I can imagine how oppressive it must feel to live as an Illuminist or as a slave with them.</p>
<p><strong>MY PAST PRECOGNITIVE DREAMS</strong></p>
<p>I\'ve studied dreams a little in the past but was never able to make much out of them. In my 20s I experienced quite a few precognitive dreams in which I dreamed of events before they occurred. At that time I was praying for meaningful dreams for inspiration or something. Most of the dreams involved our cows getting out of their pens. One involved something I\'d receive in the mail unexpectedly. Another involved talking with Grandma in her garden with me across the fence. And one involved a car owned by a friend of my brother whom we were going to visit in a distant city. Most of the dreams were fulfilled on the day of each dream. The dreams of Grandma and my brother\'s friend\'s car were fulfilled several days after the dreams. This proved to me that it\'s possible for some intelligent beings to know or control the future fairly precisely. In the dream about the car of my brother\'s friend, I dreamed it would be exactly like my brother\'s former car, but it turned out to be light green instead of tan. In the dream of the conversation with Grandma, it occurred almost exactly as I dreamed, even the words she used. How can THAT be predicted days in advance? Amazing!</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD WE HAVE A GROUP EFFORT AT PROGRAMMING OUR DREAMS?</strong></p>
<p>Does anyone want to try a group effort at helpful dreaming? At bedtime you just need to pray or say you want to have and remember a useful dream for helping to solve the human trafficking problem or the major political corruption problem. </p>
<p>I\'ve read about inventors and scientists having made great discoveries thanks to dreams. The inventor of the sewing machine dreamed about being pursued by people throwing spears at him and the spears had holes near the tips. He realized that the sewing machine needed to have needles with holes in the tips instead of in the normal position at the tail ends.</p>',

            It's a cool dream, but don't spam pizzagate with this shit, they got enough spam to deal with from shills and bots, they don't need you muddying the waters. Post to askvoat or some dream related subverse.
