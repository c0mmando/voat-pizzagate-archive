            victor thorn also hit zionism hard.  one can search YT and see his talks on the matter (including exposing links to 9/11 attacks).  i think this and to lesser extent the attacks on clinton (which relate to the aforementioned anyway) definitely played a big part in the 'suicide.'

            Victor Thorn had authored numerous books on Hilary Clinton and was responsible for breaking numerous stories of her illicit activities including deaths surrounding her. He was scheduled to release a scathing book exposing her completely when he just happened to shoot himself in the back of the head on his birthday. He was a hero. I posted about his death here after it happened.

            Btw, what ever happened to the adopted son of Sandusky, I believe his name was Jeffrey.  Was he not arrested on some child abuse suspicions?  Have not heard one little word about it.

              Yes, the piece about Ed Rendell.  I always knew he was a snake in the grass.  "In, a heavily publicized set of flights Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell headed off to Haiti to extract kids from the BRESMA “orphanage” in a privately donated plane . The airport of course, has been non-stop and so to up the chances of actually getting in country, pure political clout was used to muscle their way into the queue, making other planes loaded with humanitarian relief supplies wait in the pattern."  WTH was he going to do with those children?   Where are they now?

              That Savitz guy is as sick as they come. What a bunch of disgusting excuses for humans.  They are really only vile vermin actually.  They rope these boys in and then they threaten them with jail if they don't keep on keepin' on.  It says that Bucceroni's father was filling out the papers to TSM, was the father involved in pushing his kid into this?  IDK, but it has happened before. I hope not, for that is the worst loss of trust, when it is your parent.

            Victor Thorn committed "suicide" on his Birthday.  It is so obvious as to what happened here.  Also has anyone done the timeline on Paterno's cancer?  Did he have cancer before?  All of a sudden he gets terminal cancer and is gone in what?  a couple months?  I know it was a really short time.  Upvoat for this article I never knew it existed.  Thanks a Bundle.

             Thank you! Thank you for all you do. Thank you for believing. I have two friends who have experienced every horrible thing we know is associated with PG, and it gets frustrating, how nobody seems disturbed by this  whole thing but us.

              Believe me there are plenty that are disturbed, at least on here.  I believe that people are so disgusted by these details that their brains just cannot handle it.  We are special people, in that we can get beyond the horror (although it does affect us at times) and push ourselves to keep going.  Why?  Because we know we are needed for others cannot.  That is our lot. We accept it.  Thank you for posting the info.  I am not done with this.  I believe that Fort Meade Army Base may play a bigger part.  Peace to you and your two friends.  I will pray for all three of you tonight.
