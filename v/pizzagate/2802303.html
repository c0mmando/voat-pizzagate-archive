<p>For 17 years, DreamTree Project has provided a safe haven for homeless teens and young adults in northern New Mexico. And, for the same length of time, the nonprofit’s biggest challenge has been getting the word out on the street that there is a place of hope. </p>
<p>The Emergency Shelter provides homeless youth ages 12-17 a safe haven for up to 90 days. It’s regularly near or at capacity — a distinct indicator of the need in the region. Often, the residents move to DreamTree’s Transitional Living facilities, where they begin to solidify their lives with an eye toward independence.
The Transitional Living Program now has 16 units — eight on-site at the La Posta facility and another eight scattered around Taos. </p>

            Don't know if this helps but the distance from Taos NM (Dream Tree Proj) to  Stanley NM  (Epsteins Zorro Ranch) is 112 mi.  Dream Tree is in a very convenient place for trafficking of European Children

            "Reportedly human traffickers use New Mexico when they bring sex slaves into the USA from such places as Eastern Europe, Mexico and Africa.
           </p>
           <p>
            To make things even more interesting the Dream Project is only about 48 mi from that Compound those Children were found at.  Amalia NM.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would wager that DB and JA would be friendly with Epstein.  This Dream Project reminds me of that Ranch that was connected to Steven Pollock too in NM.  A Ranch for Children too.

            USA has been playing the recession game since the inauguration of the Non-Democratically installed President George Bush and its mostly military regime creating chaos in the world market as US industries reorganize to be dominant economic forces.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             At the time, I knew Anthony Blunt to be not only a prominent art historian but the director of the prestigious Courtauld Institute and curator of the Queen’s art collection. I had also read his books on the 17th-century French classicist Nicolas Poussin and on the early Picasso. What I did not know was that he was also the mysterious “fourth man” of the notorious Cambridge spy ring whose other members—Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby—had been exposed by British intelligence (and fled to safe haven in Moscow). All three of the latter—like Blunt himself, they were either homosexual or bisexual—had been recruited by the KGB in the 1930’s, had become loyal servants of the Stalinist regime, and during World War II and later, from their high-ranking positions in British intelligence and at the British Foreign Office, had passed top secrets to their Soviet patrons. The activities of the Cambridge group are now regarded as the biggest case of political treason in the history of England.
            </p>
            <p>
             Blunt had been recruited in the 1920’s or possibly early 1930’s while a student at Cambridge and a member of the Society of Apostles—an elitist club inside an elitist university. The main principle of the society, as Bertrand Russell, one of its former members, later testified, was absolute freedom in discussion and an equal freedom in political and moral attitudes. Politically, most of the Apostles in Blunt’s time were Marxists. As to their morals, they readily assimilated the idea, vouched for in the ancient classics, that sexual love between men is of a higher order than love of woman.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is not surprising that this political/sexual cocktail should have made Cambridge, and the Apostles in particular, a main target of Soviet secret intelligence. Young Marxist sympathizers were an easy prey for political seduction while their homosexual orientation—which until 1964 carried a criminal conviction in England if discovered—provided a convenient weapon of blackmail. Of the four members of the Society of Apostles who became Soviet spies, at least two, it is now known, were recruited by Blunt.

            <p>
             Steve Barr (born 1959) is an educator, political activist, and author, best known as a co-founder of Rock the Vote and founder of Green Dot Public Schools, a charter school organization in Los Angeles, California. He led Green Dot from 2000 to 2009. Barr also founded Future is Now Schools, a non-profit school organization that works on reforming schools from within.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barr worked on the presidential campaigns of two Democratic Party candidates in the 1980s and served as Finance Chairman of the California Democratic Party. After having worked on school reform for many years, in June 2016 Steve Barr announced his candidacy for the 2017 Los Angeles mayoral election, challenging incumbent mayor Eric Garcetti.[1][2] Garcetti won with an overwhelming majority.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barr was influenced by meeting Reed Hastings, education activist and founder of Netflix, and Don Shalvey, the founder of California's first charter school, the San Carlos Learning Center, in Northern California. At an event in 1997, President Bill Clinton announced a federally funded public charter school-grant program.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a result, Barr founded his flagship organization, Green Dot Public Schools, and opened his first charter high school, Animo Leadership High School in Lennox, California in 2000. He later opened subsequent schools, including Animo Inglewood in 2002 and Animo Oscar de la Hoya in Boyle Heights in 2004. By the end of Barr's involvement at Green Dot, his organization was operating 20 public schools under his auspice. He left Green Dot in 2009.

             I have been investigating Project Spade, which appears to be show how the RCMP is willing to go to great lengths to prosecute and end international CP rings. Found this article which ties the arrest of Loskarn, and to a TON of other rings.
             <strong>
              There are ties to UPenn and that scandal (concrete, convicted proof), the Franklin scandal, University of Tenessee, George Bush, Mitt Romney (who purchased Lamar Alexander's company Bright Horizons, Loskarn's boss) and just a whole mess of things.
             </strong>
             Honestly, I am too ADHD to investigate this properly, but this appears to be a very interesting arrest that ties together many rings.

              The December 11, 2013 arrest by U.S. Postal Inspectors of Senator Lamar Alexander’s chief of staff Ryan Loskarn on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography in connection with international law enforcement’s Toronto-based Project SPADE, represents only the tip of an iceberg which connects Alexander to a network of Tennessee politicians and businessmen associated with child sex abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Loskarn, who was identified as a child porn distributor, would have been in a position to identify actual or intended recipients of child pornographic photographs and videos found by postal inspectors in Loskarn’s possession, had he lived.
Loskarn’s purported “suicide note,” which makes no specific mention of an intention to commit suicide, instead contains an effusive apology to his friends, family, and Senator Alexander.

             <p>
              In 1998, Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons, a child welfare service company, merged with Corporate Family Solutions, a firm that provided similar services and which was founded in 1987 by Lamar Alexander and Bob Keeshan, who had been known to millions of American children as television’s “Captain Kangaroo.”  The merged company, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, was acquired by Mitt Romney’s former firm, Bain Capital, in 2008.
Alexander, the Secretary of Education under George H W Bush, has been tied to a network of Tennessee politicians and businessmen associated with government and private companies, including Bright Horizons and Omni Visions, Inc. of Tennessee, as well as state government social service agencies, such as the Department of Childrens’ Services, accused of endangerment and sexual abuse of foster and mentally challenged children....

            Oh, dear God! I'm really starting to doubt everyone's sanity when they can't even spot an obvious shill/troll like Isaac Kappy. I posted this three months ago, days after he appeared as a big smelly fraudulent blip on our radar screen.

            Why is there even a debate on this? The only thing that worries me is that because of people's stupidity in not calling him out, he may have gathered information from victims. If you remember, he was trolling for victims to contact him so he could arrange "safe spaces" for them to go if they told their stories. I was aghast and did my best to warn everyone with that post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I pray no victim confided in him and that no one offering safe spaces did either. I hope it was a failed mission, but why do I doubt that?

               One last thought on this, Jack Burkman is the one who is doing the press conference on this. I worked with him a lot when I was covering Seth Rich’s murder. He is NOTORIOUS for spreading fake news! Patriots, dare I say this is Very Fake News!

               Jack Burkman is the “conservative” lobbyist running the press conference on the sexual assault allegations against Robert Mueller. I’ve interviewed him &amp; talked to him many times in the past. He’s pushed the Russia Election Hoax! He’s notorious for spreading fake news.👇🏻 #QAnon

              JFK Jr. is NOT ALIVE. And if he were, pointing to his closet looking like James Bond's because of a character named Q is a ridiculous fanciful stretch. And she's glommed on a lot of fake stories. She RT's everything so it's curious she's working against Burkman. Well, we'll see if she's right on this. Burkman is not backing down, but neither did the creepy porn lawyer so we'll see.

             Maybe it's not such a bad thing that people continue to defend him because it led me to do some digging.  And that's turning into a mindfield.  Clearly, Brock et al are not very bright.

              It's always a bad thing when people give defend a shill. Your investigation has nothing to do with people unable to distinguish a phony shill.

                You'd be great at it and pull in top dollar. I wonder if I put an ad in craigslist if it would get noticed. Something like:

                <h1>

                 Glad I did not need a sarc tag on that one. Heh heh. You would get top dollar too. I still wonder why no one has reached out, given my otherwise online history of capitalist comments. There is still time, and I still have hope that check will be coming in the mail. I really don't mind who signs the check. Cash is preferable. The Clinton's have been through enough, and they are good people. Those are just jobs that Americans don't want, but it is racist to call USA citizens Americans because that does not include anyone South or North of the racist USA while still being the Americas. Easy.

                     Chump change because of the exchange rate. No. There is money being spent in the USA. Sure, I can't pin it down right now,(bout to pass out) but I will be proven right. Costs more here than there. Why would Soros's son have to borrow Bono's sunglasses? Almost broke.

                      Yes, the payments to ANTIFA probably are more substantial. I was factoring in that most of the misanthropic specimens from the Stanford prison experiments still live in their parent's basement, but left out the big ticket items that Sanders and other socialist gummy bears have propagandized as "FREE"! So the tuition funding at UCLA's Department of Inadequacy still go on and these swollen melons of minds continue to major in Racist America: Studies in how Dirigibles and Balloon-Making Helped Shaped White Entitlement and Shame Lactose-Intolerant Minorities. This twenty-seven-year course teaches among other things the fine art of calling out 9/11 widows as they stand on street corners and wait for red lights to change. It also includes an aerobic-building section that comes in handy when scampering away from the widow's strapping, really pissed off son, but then it's hard to run with a backpack laden with commie pamphlets extolling the virtues of horse-faced ex-bartenders trying to grab their two-seconds of fame in politics by calling for the abolishment of ICE.

Only other to beat the Britain's and the newly formed Federals at the time were the Scots and the Northern Irish.  All three or more still alive, and were former slaves. Which side are you on?

            <p>
             Dame Margaret Eve Hodge, Lady Hodge, DBE, MP (
             <strong>
              née Oppenheimer
             </strong>
             ; born 8 September 1944) is a British Labour Party politician who has served as Member of Parliament for Barking since 1994.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hodge was created Minister for Children in 2003[1] before becoming Minister of State for Culture and Tourism in 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was styled Lady Hodge after her second husband, Sir Henry Hodge, was knighted in 2004, until her appointment as DBE in 2015 when she became Dame Margaret Hodge.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was born in 1944 in Cairo, Egypt, to Jewish refugee parents[4][5] Hans Oppenheimer (1908–1985), and his wife Lisbeth (née Hollitscher).[4][6] Hans Oppenheimer left Stuttgart in Germany during the 1930s to join his uncle's metals business based in Cairo and Alexandria, where he met fellow émigrée, Austrian-born Lisbeth Hollitscher.
            </p>
            <p>
             The family moved to Orpington, London, where the Oppenheimers started their family-owned steel-trading corporation, Stemcor.[8] It is one of the world's largest privately held steel companies, with an annual turnover of over £6 billion in 2011.[9] Hodge is a major shareholder, listing her holdings in the Parliamentary Register of Members' Interests.[10][11] Stemcor was run by her brother, Ralph, until September 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hodge emerged as Council Leader in 1982, a post she held until 1992. Hodge was appointed MBE in 1978. However the end of her service on Islington council prior to her entering Parliament was marred by the emergence of serious child abuse allegations concerning Council-run children's homes in Islington.[20]
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2003, following Hodge's appointment as Minister for Children, Panton went public with his allegations that he had been the subject of abuse in Islington Council care and that although he had repeatedly raised the matter he had been ignored. He identified Hodge's complacency as being ultimately responsible for the abuse that he alleged he had suffered.

             Stemcor is a Steel company owned by the Oppenheimer family that includes both a guest at the villa where Madeleine went missing and a UK MP accused of covering up child sex scandals. Steel is used for pipelines. Viktor Pinchuk is a major Clinton Foundation Donor. Pinchuk made pipeline deals with Iran under Hillary's watch. Stemcor owns Chiatura, which mines manganese. Manganese is an essential component for URANIUM EXTRACTION. Bill Clinton travelled with Frank Giustra in 2005 to begin the Uranium One deal. Viktor Pinchuk fought for privatization of the Chiatura manganese mines in 2005.

              <p>
               Miss Chevalier told the Daily Mirror she regularly visited her brother and the 59-year-old Lord Browne at the peer's two homes in London and his residence in Cambridge.
              </p>
              <p>
               One summer, Lord Browne took her, her elder sister Vanessa and Mr Chevalier to his home in Venice, she said, adding: "Jeffrey even saw Elton John's place in Venice. He said it was amazing inside.
              </p>
              <p>
               "It all seemed so surreal. Tony Blair was often at some of the parties my brother went to. That sort of thing just became normal for him. I'm sure the public won't care about his [Lord Browne's] homosexuality," she said, adding that last year's break-up had hit her brother hard.
              </p>
              <p>
               His profile on the internet networking site includes a long list of "favourite quotes" which include "I am not young enough to know everything" and "No one is useless in this world who lightens the burden of another".

arts and to entertain the fashionable world. Opened to the
public in 1957, it's managed by The Rothschild Foundation, a

             Is Vans "sketchy"? Let's see they cater to childrens footwear needs, hob nob with the pedophile crowd and they arrived on the scene with their name Vans in the 1980's when something known as "the pedophile van" was in the common vernacular.

             Amazon.com: black and white checkered vans That was the shoe that launched them. There was a buyout, but remember that there is a Female ancestor named Joan Lucille Olander. OLEANDER (Heb. הַרְדּוּף mishnaic (harduf) or הִרְדּוּפְנִי (hirdufeni)), the evergreen shrub with rose-colored flowers that grows wild in Israel on the banks of rivers.
Cultivated varieties having flowers of various colors are also grown. Its leaves are arranged at the nodes of the stalk in groups of three. In this respect it resembles the three-leaved myrtle . The Talmud (Suk. 32b) raises the possibility that by eẓ avot ("plaited tree"), one of the four species taken on the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev. 23:40), the oleander may be intended, but the suggestion is rejected on the grounds that the Bible would not have required a plant containing a dangerous poison to be taken (see Rashi , Suk. 32b). A fowl that has eaten oleander "is forbidden because of danger to life" (Ḥul. 3:5). It is, in fact, very poisonous and its ground leaves are sometimes used as mouse poison. One tanna held that it was because of its bitterness that this tree was used by Moses to sweeten the bitter waters (Ex. 15:25) "for God heals with that with which he wounds" (Ex. R. 50:3). The Talmud (Pes. 39a) mentions a bitter plant called hardufenin which is not poisonous and was eaten as a salad. The reference is apparently to the Scorzonera, to which the name hardufenin is given in modern Hebrew. Given lack of family history, link to Hollywood, and federal government(Doral Beach) I am proposing without any empirical evidence that the Doran's are the Olander's through name change. Just a hunch. Doral: Indications, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com. Doral Corporation.  Kaskel and Doral. The Forced Jewish Exodus of Paducah, Kentucky - Civil War ..

             So we involved Alefantis Bill C and Spacey.  What a combo.  I seriously can't imagine either one of them calling for their driver and heading home after an Event.  Serious digging is needed.  We always seem to get back to the Dupont Tunnels but never dig quite deep enough.  DB is still very involved.  Always has been.

               Thank you.  I will try to dig again later tonight.  I have always felt there is so much more to the Tunnels and JA and DB.  This is for sure something else cooked up by the creator of CTR, SB and other Shill outfits he has cooked up.  I was attacked many times as were others on Reddit by CTR.

            Pizzagate - Pedophile Language and Symbols
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I noticed that the Old Vic Tunnels were taken over by the "House of Vans", interesting. I used to skateboard myself yet always hated Vans sneakers because of their icky likeness to the super cheap K-mart skips that existed back then. I started looking into Vans and ties to pedophilia and then found out that, unknown to me was that in the 1980's popular culture was aware of "the pedophile van". Basically a white van with tinted windows.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "A large, older van, typically brown or white in color, and often with tinted front windows and no windows in the back."
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting, the Old Vic Tunnels - "art tunnels" taken over by Vans - a company catering to children's footwear needs, who converted the sketchy Old Vic Tunnels into a playground place for children to play and interact.
