             @HighSociety
            </a>
            , your welcome and i know what you mean, There was a STICKIE (before VOAT was down) which was called "Pizzagate Summery" or something like that, it was an archive, 4,44 GB, and i have had downloaded it, for later view, but never did watch because news were coming so fast, now it seems that most of the information online is gone, screwed with, or is cointelpro... I can not understand the rude comments to your request, seems the moderators have forgotten there own stickies?

            requires linked support for every major claim -- please check out the rules in the sidebar. What backups in particular are you talking about? There are over 33,000 submissions archived here, all accessible by key word search at SearchVoat.co.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sli.mg got taken down and a lot of image links were broken, but most of those images can be found in the backups of Alefantis' Instagram etc. which are still available as far as I know. Please be more specific about what you are looking for.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair so you can add supporting links to this submission. After that, I will have to remove per Rule 2.

             Sorry, I seemed to have been behind a 24 hour block (never used Voat before but I knew about this sub on it.)
            </p>
            <p>
             For reference though, here are the threads and links to all of the backups that are now offline or removed:
            </p>
            <p>
             voat (dot) co/v/pizzagate/1428178 (original thread)
            </p>
            <p>
             voat (dot) co/v/pizzagate/1428191 (backup thread that has the source material expired)
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
             voat (dot) co/v/pizzagate/1428510 (backup thread that does state it was a 24-hour backup only)
            </p>
            <p>
             multimirrorupload (dot) com/nniqzecm9513/pizzagate (dot) zip (mirror that is no longer available)
