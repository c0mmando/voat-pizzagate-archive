<p>I discovered the whole pizzagate thing about a month ago or so. I don\'t really do (social) media, mostly i hang around in places like reddit. i dont exactly remember where i came across pizzagate, but iirc it was on a forum, similar to voat. </p>
<p>at that time i was a bit disappointed that the &quot;big bomb&quot; assange wanted to drop on hillary didn\'t came. no bomb, no nothing. </p>
<p>since i stumbled across #whereisassange and #pizzagate i took my time to read about both topics. apparantly, they have the same root, without assange no pizzagate, and without pizzagate assange probably would be still alive.
i also came across this piece of information (which most of you probably already know): <a href="https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wikileaks-staffer-on-8chan.gif">https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wikileaks-staffer-on-8chan.gif</a></p>
<p>so, if i put all the pieces of information together, everything can be summed up quite easily:</p>
<p>either #pizzagate and #whereisassange is just misinterpretation of information. i don\'t think that\'s likely, honestly, i don\'t think thats true at all.</p>
<p>so, the other option?
pizzagate exposes a whole new kind of &quot;crime&quot;, a kind of crime i never thought about. i picture it as following:</p>
<p>the governments of most countries are tied together via childporn/weapons/drugs/banks. basically, everything needs everything. people who buy drugs run banks, people who run banks got to do with people who buy weapons (on a large scale, ofc), people who are into the drug buisness know where to get kids, and on top of that are the governments that are closely tied to all this stuff (thats very likely, since we know the governments know fucking everything about everybody they either bust those &quot;bad guys&quot;, or they work closely together).</p>
<p>so, if pizzagate would continue to discover all those hidden crimes, would continue to discover all those &quot;swamp people&quot;, and would continue to discover all the ties those people got to each other, we end up where every last bit of trust in THE GOVERNMENTS on a global scale would very likely be lost. 
germany, italy, france, belgium, usa, probably canada, the middle east would be fucked up because of the people losing faith in everything they ever believed in. keep in mind that there are MANY people who are shocked if the POTUS gets a blowjob in the oval office from an intern. how would these people react if pizzagate gets to a state where it gets indeniable? 
thats something nobody really can predict, but i\'m pretty sure that this would lead to the biggest change the world has EVER seen. </p>
<p>i think it is important to keep this in mind while investigating pizzagate. there are people of power who don\'t want this to happen. but things have, probably, already gotten far worse than those guys ever imagined. nevertheless, if those see themselves in too big danger, we really don\'t know how they\'ll react. </p>
<p>i don\'t want anybody to stop their researches because of these thoughts, but i do want you guys to develop a backup-plan. 
things take their time as we can see from the whole &quot;fake news&quot; story. if &quot;those people&quot; would be able, they\'d ban what they call &quot;fakenews&quot; in the blink of an eye. but those things take their time. so you current practice of archiving everything you find is really neccessary. guess it would make sense to connect the people investigating pizzagate on many different platforms, but somehow make sure nobody is left behind (and doesn\'t know what to do next, where to go if voat gets shut down). 
maybe it\'d make sense to post everything to voat, 4chan, and those other two sites i cant remember atm parallel via a self-written browser-extension? possibly read all those infos from all those channels via browser extension? but then you gotta make sure you don\'t miss a thing that doesn\'t get caught via the extension. 
there is a lot more that has to be kept in mind, and i\'m pretty sure that &quot;you guys&quot;/&quot;the crowd&quot;/etc will make the right decisions to keep the investigation well and alive. </p>
<p>oh, and one last thought: don\'t post if you are (too) emotional. this could very likely lead to hatred and would negative affect the whole investigation. stay calm, stay focused. </p>
<p>thanks for reading this far, and if you want to do me a favor upvoat 25 of my comments, so that i am able to downvoat all those racial/anti-semitic shills in the &quot;new&quot; section. 
i\'d recommend to check the &quot;new&quot; section as often as possible to get rid of this shit, but that works perfectly anyways at the moment!</p>
<p>have a nice night/day/evening/whatever!</p>',
