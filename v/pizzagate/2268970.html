<p>The internet should be scrubbed of that iconic 14/fish / photo and the guy should be apologized to over it. The explanation I proffered came pretty easily, just by reading many of his older tweets. His connection to environmental matters is pretty hard to overlook.</p>

<p>THIS all said, IF anyone is actually hurting kids -- I have no problem with anyone continuing to do what we can, to put a stop to it and bring justice about for these priceless souls, but if all we have is a collection of assumptive facts and a fairy-tale narrative, are we doing right?</p>
<p>Yes. The Instagram stuff is beyond disgusting, but that wasn\'t JP. Yes, the bands are sick, but what does that have to do with JP? Yes, the comments by SL are over the top, but that was at CPP, not by JP.</p>
<p>Yes, I find JA to be uncomfortably creepy, but that isn\'t JP. Yes, the artwork is over-the-top disgusting, but that is TP, not JP. Spirit cooking looks reprehensible and gross, but does this prove what it has been assumed to prove?</p>
<p>The photo of the teddy bear in the adult bedroom is bizarre, but bizarre does not make a case such as what is implied.</p>
<p>Yes, I find the debunking and censorship over-the-moon bizarre, and yes, it &quot;feels&quot; like something is amiss in all this -- somewhere, but can we justify tormenting anyone whatsoever without any actual proof of anything at all?</p>
<p>I am not excusing/minimizing or making excuses for anyone. I just know for a fact that PG has gotten it wrong with several so-called smoking gun facts and is very slow to retract them -- and I find that disturbing to be a part of.</p>

            Apologies to Skippy, I am sorry no. I will be honest I thought his hands, meant fishing for teens, but I have seen your explanation before and thought it was more plausible.

            Anyone that has kids ubered to a hottub, for further entertainment, especially when the person sending these kids, has a blog were she is basically selling them, and there is a listing for baby ambien on the same page. That's  enough for me to think he is not only a "foodie." Quite a few photo's of children in the attachments of his emails, that don't contain food at all.

              The "illuminati deepstate" have great influence  in the UN,  and this is what they do, they don't hide it, they blantly put it in your face.  I have actually called out an ambassador on here, for charity fraud .

              Take a close look at music video's with anyone of their stars, the symbolism is important, part of their world, and definetly part pizzagate. Jimmy Comet uses Antinous as a profile pic.

             I think you are right, but if you ask half the people hear what that pic is about, they will tell you it is about Osiris and 14 year old pussy and all sorts of other stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it is really about this:

              http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/

            </p>
            <p>
             Then the mangled hand is certainly a mystery, but we need to be clear on what we are all talking about when viewing that pic then.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've heard explanations ad nauseum about the symbolic meaning of the SYMBOLS on his hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only a handful of people are focusing on JUST the cuts/scars in his hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             And even IF he has cuts/scars in his hands and even if it is for weird/creepy/sick reasons, that doesn't prove what everyone here seems 100% sure of.

            I don't think there's any if about this.  I think this is confirmed.   He's an amateur chef at the gourmet level.  The folks who came up with Pizzagate hated Podesta and looked through his emails looking for scandal.  They didn't find any, so they were forced to make up this fake food code list.  (It's very simple to do, you can use that software people use to make word clouds to look for most used words.)  When actual reporters AND REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES pored over his emails, they main thing they noted was his tips on making risotto.
           </p>
           <p>
            His Mother was known as being a great cook and feeding all of the friends/colleagues of the Podestas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta is Greek and Italian, two countries serious about their food.  In fact, most Mediterranean cultures are known for their cuisine.
           </p>
           <p>
            France, Spain, Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt all have amazing food and not surprisingly folks from those backgrounds talk about food a lot.   The neighborhood I grew up in had a lot of Italians.   It was absolutely routine for folks to go shopping and buy their bread from one place, their cheese from another, the vegetables from a third store and their meat from a fourth.  It was routine.  I used to work near this place and it was the only place I bought my pasta for years

              You have no idea what you are talking about. His hands are the most UNimportant thing about John Podesta. Take the hands away and he is a child killer/trafficker.

            "if anyone is actually hurting kids?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Really? So far There is almost 40 years documented history of as politicians, military officials, judges and law enforcement hurting kids. The clintons run the pedo show and the money laundering operation handed over from HW Bush who set it up with Hoover years ago. No matter what John podesta is there is a picture in safe keeping, to keep him in line. Sign forget the fish. Follow the money. You no longer wonder "if" they are hurting kids.

             Do you have any idea how useless a piece of evidence this is?   It's like saying white people have a 40 year history of hurting kids.   And?   What does the mean for the particular group of white people we are accusing.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see from the rest of your post, you're actually not interested in evidence, but your grand conspiracy.

             We know that there are people who are hurting kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is not in question.
            </p>
            <p>
             I questioned one piece of very-iconic "evidence".
            </p>
            <p>
             Take note of the shit-storm that has ensued.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you stand for that?
            </p>
            <p>
             The 14 and the Fish clearly came from here:
             <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">
              http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             If it means more than that -- so be it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, I wish someone would try to prove it and not just make up fairy-tales about what it COULD mean or what we WANT it to mean.
            </p>
            <p>
             What if it just means exactly as it was stated to mean:
             <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">
              http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             For that one-fact alone, JP deserves further consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not about NOT protecting kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, I don't protect kids, but NOT protecting the truth -- whatever and wherever that truth leads, whether I LIKE it or not, whether it confuses the narrative or not, whether it is POPULAR or not.
            </p>
            <p>
             We must remain OBJECTIVE.

             Fair enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that is not what the 14 / Fish pic has been described to mean.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't find Spirit Cooking to be anything other than deeply disturbing and utterly gross, but whether or not the guy is into it, doesn't mean that people ought literally make up whatever fantasy they want about a picture that has a very clear intended meaning and ruin the guy's life over it:
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             Is he guilty of something? 
Maybe.
Of everything?
Maybe.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, when an iconic piece of evidence like that is easily debunked, I think we ought to pump the brakes a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
             His protesting and nervousness in the recent interview COULD be a sign of guilt.
Could it ALSO be a sign, that the guy is tormented by what ALSO could be false?
            </p>
            <p>
             How SHOULD the guy react if some of this IS false?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Internet has ruined his life. If he deserves it, I'm not complaining.
            </p>
            <p>
             If he does not deserve it, then I don't want that blood on my hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             That iconic photo has been used to much that it has taken on a life of its' own when it just might simply mean this:

              Mariana abromovich is a disciple of Allister Crowley. Nothing about what she does is a joke. These are legit satanists who gain power and life force by stealing the souls of the most innocent. Is any of this hard evidence? No. It requires discernment. This is a spiritual war and these sick freaks are tuned in to the devil.

               I believe that Satanist's exist and are real.
I also believe that people do truly sick shit to others.
I also believe that this whole matter is creepy as hell and makes me shiver with horrible vibes.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I also believe that we have to have the courage to put down facts that may occasionally not be facts, but are merely wild imaginings by people seeking views and attention and that is why I made my post.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am not presently convinced of anyting related to the iconic fish and the 14 image and I'm disturbed that that image has meme-warred individuals nearly out of existence, if the basis to do so is flawed, feigned, imagined and just plan fraudulent.
              </p>
              <p>
               I raised it as a legit objection. It DOES cast some other things into doubt and I don't think anyone here can afford too much doubt about matters as important as the ones here being discussed.

              The folks here are not trying to determine guilt or innocence.  He was guilty in their eyes before the emails were release.  Guilty of something....They are simply trying to find ways to convince you of guilt. You can see in this thread how immune people are to evidence, how easy it is to make up double meanings to that will make him look guilty.
             </p>
             <p>
              The truth is there is absolutely no crimes connected at all to the Podesta emails.

              <p>
               The unwillingness to contemplate dissenting evidence and the visceral attacks levied against someone who does, is a pretty scary thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do believe that something IS amiss in all of this.

              <p>
               There Insta's and all the other stuff is extremely disturbing, I can't explain any of that.
              </p>
              <p>
               But there are some facts that may NOT be as they are purported to be and that disturbs me, because some here aren't willing to double-check their thinking and resent efforts to get them to.

                Let me ask you this.  If this group were trafficking children, do you think they would actually post that stuff on instagram if they were in jeopardy of going to jail for the rest of their lives?  If they actually killed children in a stainless steel room, do you think they would actually post it.   And someone would actually identify as their killroom?  And if some did do that, do you think they would leave it up?  Remember according to Pizzagate folks, these people regularly kidnap, rape, kill and eat children.  Do you think they would for no reason just post evidence of linking them to crimes that could put themselves away for life?  Could put their friends away for life?  Or do you think their might be an alternate explanation for their posts and their comments.
               </p>
               <p>
                Has there ever in history a child trafficking ring that acted like this?   Or are they trying to hide their tracks as much as possible?  In any of the many people arrested has any of those cases resembled this?
               </p>
               <p>
                If you have read my other posts, there are normal and regular cognitive glitches in the brain that help us to believe stuff that is false.   It's not a smart/dumb thing, it's not a left/right thing.   It's a human thing because it's how our brains our wired. Our brains love patterns, they love links and they love stories.   I can give you three random facts and you could link them and make a story out of them with virtually no effort.  But the question is, is the story we are telling ourselves actually true?   Because it will feel really, really true.   Critical thinking is NOT a natural event at all.   You have to learn how to do it and you have to practice it.   It seems to me that you have started down this road.   You need to check yourself to see if your story could be true.
               </p>
               <p>
                So much of the evidence of this case is based on mere linking.   This is often a completely weak form of evidence.   Let's say someone you went to high school with became a murderer?  What does that say about you?   Perhaps you never dealt with the guy.  The link is meaningless.
Or let's say you knew him well, you hung out together.  Later on he commits a murder, are you guilty in some way?  One method of checking yourself is putting yourself in situation, does it still feel convincing.
               </p>
               <p>
                Confirmation bias is one of things that fool our brains and for the most part we are unaware when it's going on.  You reach your conclusion and then every new fact you come across you interpret in a way that supports your conclusion.  Read up about cognitive glitches and conspiracy thinking there's been a lot of study about this in recent years.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another thing in the pizzagate case is that that they claim to have linked Alefantis and Clinton to a real life criminal, Laura Silsby.  This was seen as something very significant.   Both links are completely false.  I completely debunked both of them.   The Jeffrey Dahmer "fact" is also completely false.

                Also consider this, the one piece of code related to child pornography OR CP was Cheese Pizza, this was used on 4chan all the time.   "Cheese Pizza" doesn't appear once in the Podesta emails.  Pizza does.  Do you not use the word pizza?  I'm sure do, I just had two Sicilian slices for lunch.

That is really scary.

            You are imagining that a man with ties to known child trafficking operations like the Clinton Foundation has good intentions. I am imagining that he does not. We are all attuned to different layers of the onion. Maybe a little more tuning would help.

            The "sustainable sea" is a double entendre. The "sea" is the Sea Of Humanity. We are the "fish" that live in the Sea Of Humanity. Their goal is to hook us with their bait. Making the sea "sustainable" means keeping the fish farm (our prison) well maintained so that we can be exploited.
           </p>
           <p>
            When JP says he is worried about the "ocean's sustainability" what he truly means is that he fears his cult is losing control because people are waking up. Actually, he does not fear it, he knows it. His tweets about concern for the "oceans" are signals to his buddies about his fears of losing control of our perspectives and our captivity. He is afraid that too many of us are swimming out of muddy layers and into the clear water of true vision.

            These guys love double meanings. It's possible that the #14 was chosen with the fish symbol and sustainable ocean goal to mean something esoteric. I still think there is a reference to the Osiris myth in that photo.

             Not sure how to find it. I had another account at that time.
            </p>
            <p>
             The debunking was simple.
            </p>
            <p>
             I read JP's twitter feed for as long as I could hold my interest.
His Twitter feed was very passionate about things related to the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was specifically PROMOTING the U.N. Sustainability Goals and the need to protect the environment over quite a lengthy period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Number 14 is this one:
             <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">
              http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at the Icon for Number 14!
            </p>
            <p>
             He drew a FISH and a 14 on his hand as a way to call attention to the need to protect the oceans.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">
              http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             ...and then everyone went ape-shit because they said it meant he liked 14 year old pussy or that it had to do with Osiris and all this other shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't explain the cuts on his hands, but all  you need to do is spend 45 minutes on his Twitter feed and you'll notice two things:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) The guy does seem to care about the environment
2) He used Twitter to promote his concern
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything else said about that photo may just be plain lunacy.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why I am pumping the brakes. I'm concerned that some of this "investigation" has gone off the rails.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've also noted that raising such questions just leads to persecution, which is not the expected result in a place where truth is valued.
            </p>
            <p>
             My contribution would be lauded, not laughed at.

              I am not laughing at you or ridiculing you by telling you that I learned about '14 &amp; the fish' when I studied Egyptian mythology in public grade school(prior to Jimmy Carter &amp; the NEA). Everything the UN does is centered around the 'Mystery Babylon' religion and always has double meaning.  To me this means that you are absolutely correct and so are those who see the secondary meaning of the message.  You did good work, but the layers are many and  the hole is deep.  And please don't give up, this is too important to get 'thin skinned' about.

               Not 100% sure I am on board with the entirety of what the UN does is centered around "Mystery Bablyon", but perhaps it is and I will stay open to that possibility.

I'm just inclined to accuracy.

              NOT my website and that photo is one of the most spurious and circumstantial photographs out of this entire investigation and one that I have never had the wherewithal, evidence or desire to comment or even speculate on. Something tells me you GCHQ fuckers like to focus on these little details repeatedly to set up your cute counter-memes in the MSM. Flog off you flagellate bundle of sticks.

              The original image itself was posted directly on JP's twitter feed, by whomever posts to his account.
             </p>
             <p>
              He posted it to promote this:
              <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">
               http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              He had MANY tweets about the environment and goals around it at that time.
             </p>
             <p>
              (The fingers may be shopper later. Can't remember.)
             </p>
             <p>
              This is why this disturbs me so much.
             </p>
             <p>
              I merely decided not to take anyone else's word for it and read a bunch of his Tweet's going back as long as I had interest.
             </p>
             <p>
              I found that original picture and knew it was about this:
              <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/">
               http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              and have been very sad seeing how it has been used as a bed-rock of the "case" against this guy.
             </p>
             <p>
              That pic is used in meme-warfare to taunt this guy over and over again.
             </p>
             <p>
              Does this make him innocent? No idea.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, that pic may not make him "guilty" in the slightest.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet, that IS the pic that red-pilled probably millions of people.
             </p>
             <p>
              If that is all a ruse, it is sad as hell.

               he will tell you that it is completely photoshopped from day one.  You think Podesta cares about oceans?  Think again.  He cares about lining his stomach with risotto and watching re-runs of x-files pretending aliens are anything more than weather balloons.  That is his one political ambition, to run the FBI and uncover the existence of aliens.  NASA even sent him an alien email.  We know they are honest.  Not.

               <p>
