A single search warrant, multiple computers.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI and other law enforcement agencies will be able to search multiple computers across the country with a single warrant thanks to a controversial rule change that takes effect on Thursday.</p>
<p>The expanded search power, known as “Rule 41,” is intended to make it easier for the FBI to carry out complex computer investigations.

<p>The legal process for government hacking has been a contentious topic, especially in light of a high profile investigation known as “Playpen” in which the FBI placed tracking software on the computers of child pornography suspects across the country. Some of these defendants have successfully challenged their arrest on the grounds they lived outside of the area described in the warrant. But Rule 41 will put an end to such challenges.&quot;</p>

            Someone is claiming that John Podesta has been meeting with Rep. Devin Nunes who made this bill and got it passed INCREDIBLY fast. If true, then either Podesta is planning to use this law against us by turning corrupt FBI agents into a higher-powered CTR, or Podesta is trying to stop this law from allowing the FBI to compile enough info to prove Clinton Foundation corruption.

             I'm pretty sure HR 6393 is different than the Rule 41 changes. I think Rule 41 was something that was already going into effect, but had the chance to be stopped, but nobody decided to stop it.
            </p>

             Edit:
             <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-congress-idUSKBN13P2ER?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_content=583f5b1f04d3013ea077f7e3&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">
              Here's an article on Rule 41
             </a>
             It appears Sen Ron Wyden (D) led the efforts to block it, with help from Sen Chris Coons (D) and Sen Steve Daines (R). Sen John Cornyn (R), however, was the one who allowed it to pass without a vote. The scariest thing about the Rule 41 changes, for me, is that it was proposed by the DOJ,
             <strong>
              approved by the Supreme Court
             </strong>
             , and
             <strong>
              Congress never got to vote on it
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161122/10381536112/bill-introduced-to-push-back-approval-dojs-proposed-rule-41-changes.shtml">
              Another article
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also for the record, I saw Justin Amash (R)
             <a href="https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/804102944857751554">
              tweet his disapproval
             </a>
             of it as well, although he's a Representative, not a Senator, so he couldn't act to oppose it like the others mentioned. We've gotta know who our friends are in terms of advocating for internet privacy, because apparently there aren't very many of them.
