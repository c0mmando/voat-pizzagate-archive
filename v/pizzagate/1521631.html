            "Max Spiers says he has memories of visiting Mars too. " Looking over the "Max Spiers" material one more time - I think he's an actor. I'm not sure "he" died.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not his nationality, per se.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's that he's posing as an "American" Supersoldier - so why would he speak with a British accent. ? Sorry if I wasn't clear on that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The UFO culture and the Space program are very tied up with mind control / fraud / government programs. Those programs are fraudulent, per my assessment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't trust the people who promote UFO material or New Age material, at all. Though there is likely truth in both.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though I've seen myself something which could be described as a "UFO" and was approached by someone who claimed to be a walk-in and who predicted elements of my future.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of thpse who promote this are shady for some reason. It's a huge distraction from political content. "Max" was supposedly "finking" on the people who are doing human trafficking and torture.. Pretty amazing timing, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            My gut feeling is that he is a crisis actor. 100% The UFO phenomenon is connected to "dis-assocition" I could consider he was tortured to dis-assocate and go "UFO" but really he's too poster -boy pretty and he comes off as delivering lines.. Actor. Though I am open to being wrong.

            The NLP is just part of persuasion / mind control. Many assets have dual functions.. "Limited Hang - Out"
When I feel the pace and the words / phrasing are consistent with putting people to sleep - even when maybe giving good info? I turn off.
           </p>
           <p>
            For one: I don't believe anybody is going to Mars - except in a voyage by trance / dream-state..

            Right "Bad" is the wrong word. That construct plays into how they want us to see ourselves. And shows how deep the Mind control goes ? when we use that turn of phrase to describe what should be normal - but because of their work on the psyche of the population, is not.

            FWIW , The "orbs" sighted all around the Twin Towers on the day of the event.? - There was a massive collection - all those vids were deleted from YouTube, back in the day.. There was a purge. Taken down and never put back up. Only some remain. I have a few on my channel. That was in '07. The time of the 9/11 truther purge and the death of Dan Wallace - in his early 20's, father a fire-fighter, gave a powerful speech a few months before about how the Commission Report was full of lies..And how he and his family did not believe a bit of it.  And one day did not wake-up. No explanation nor autopsy. He was not a druggie but the somehow the word was put out that he was.. But he was not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speech of Dan Wallace in December '06 -

           </p>
           <p>
            This relates to "Pizzagate" wherein it points to the extremes the large - scale criminals go to "mop up" the loose ends of their major State Crimes and treason.

            I had my trouble "buying' the stories of "Max Spiers" if that's is/was even his name? 
There was predictive programming about "super - soldier Max" some years ago, which makes me think the drama around him is planned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another main problem I have with his story is he is British. Why would the American super - soldier be British?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't trust the British mi6 - they infilrated and took over American intelligence after the Second WW; which was something always feared by early Americans , that after we made they evacuate - they would return some way or another. The elite there truly "hate us for our freedoms"  I never got past that part; That he was British/ English..
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the way the material is presented seems hypnotic. Massive NLP in his presentations.. as far as I could stand it.

            Certainly they need to hide their activity and fool people.
           </p>
           <p>
            But "what is more important?" in terms of priorities for them?
 I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe they need to bury advanced tech, certainly. But even when it's right in peoples' faces , the suckers will not notice. For example, the destruction of the Twin Towers.. Both an occult ritual and a display of non -public technology.
           </p>
           <p>
            The so-called "secret tech" is right out there, not hidden from anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            They love to hide "in plain sight"
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, much of their most important tech is totally ordinary and mundane; nothing super - secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the Television - hidden in complete plain sight and almost a requisite in every room in every home. The cable companies practically give it away.
           </p>
           <p>
            The TV is massive mind control tech - which people consent to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another point, (and this could be some "occult " issue?), but they love to get the consent of the people they rip off.
If it's going on and you don't care, that is consent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, their AI , "Space tech" and "Transhumanism" tech is mostly bullshit, lies and hype to steal more money and to scare people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their assumptions are wrong about how life "works" - so they hit dead end after dead end with that.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's faked. They can not do AI, as they thought they world, by "2001" (How much of their own bullshit , some of them actually believe? I don't know.). The genome mapping was a dud. "Transhumanism" is their doomed to failure attempt to make themselves G-d.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a farce. And yes it's mostly men :
           </p>
           <p>
            "The foolish acts of fops and flops, lackeys and leeches, dicks and deadfellows".
           </p>
           <p>
            It's disgusting. And their pretentions are to be met with "Laugh Out Loud"

            No, the real thing is that they are psychopathic sadists, who get sex pleasure from hurting and killing others,  So no only do they hurt and kill children, while keeping a smile for the public, but they also control systems of control because of their ruthless personalities. The most ruthless wins. As with organized crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Psychopathic sadists learn to be good actors.. And love to hoax and mock. They show off to each other by parading it in people's faces.. Because psychopathic sadists are so beyond the imagination of ordinary people, no one can see it - It's invisible.
           </p>
           <p>
            A known characteristic of psychopaths : very difficult to spot. 
"Hitler" himself, in his book and Goebbles, his chief of Propaganda both elaborated upon this principle. The common catch phrase of it "The Big Lie. "

            OP, I have to delete this post per rule 2.  Please repost with sources for the claims in this paragraph, particularly the ones I put in boldface:

            <blockquote>

              But when it comes down to pedophilia, this is what happens. Monica Petersen apparently just stopped existing, as no site seems to list her actual cause of death. Andrew Breitbart had his heart shut down.
              <strong>
               2 days later, his coroner was fatally poisoned with arsenic. Max Spiers was found rotting on a sofa after vomiting a black fluid until he died. Jill Dando was shot to death. Nancy and Bruce Schaefer developed a sudden interest in experimental lead-based rapid injection therapy and tried it on each other. Film director David Crowley and his entire family made the decision to historically re-enact the final days of Tsar Nicholas II's reign
              </strong>
              . No matter where you look it's nothing but death. Death, death and more death.

               Looking through your post history i see it's nothing but rehashed talking points made by the regressive left. If you don't want to be labeled as a shill, have a non shill name and original thoughts.

            Before he passed, he said that he was being psychically attacked various times. That caused him to feel less energized/drained. There are things beyond what we can see. I do believe he did drugs to stop having dreams/visions. I don't believe they caused him to die. He was attempting to out a massive pedophile ring before being killed. The black stuff is very odd, the only person I've heard with the same kind of death is Tory Smith, another investigator of the paranormal/aliens/satanic government pedos. He looked terrible after a few months of giving his "readings" same with Max. In Max's last interview he sounded really tired and drained, completely out of it. Very much like Tory.

              Good one. My feeling exactly.
             </p>
             <p>
              Everything all of a sudden made sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another point: When children are involved adult human beings become biologically motivated, instinctively  hyped - up .
             </p>
             <p>
              As far as large State Crimes go: apparently no one gets that passionate about it, and the normal tricks used to stifle the information from spreading (and then making a difference), all work?
             </p>
             <p>
              Once this element comes in, of children, it becomes a catalyst for people who could not give a damn about regular politics / i.e. large State Crimes, to sit up and take notice..
             </p>
             <p>
              So there is more a chance of a large part of their house of cards to come tumbling down, once "the children" element is on table?
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps that is why they kill so quickly with it. ?
             </p>
             <p>
              Otherwise, to cover up other large State Crimes they murder like crazy as well [or maybe stage murders to keep others back from the investigation?]
             </p>
             <p>
              No use pretending they don't kill people easily who could expose their schemes. I've kept long lists, but as I've repeated, my site is down since the 10th of Dec. Though those lists have gotten some thousands of views over time. FWIW]
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, those dead should be remembered. And forgetfulness and time are on the side of the perps.. And power too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just one for example , young people have probably never heard of her:
Dorothey Killgallen - she was a famous journalist and famous as a very smart lady too. She would always solve the puzzles first on the old TV show "What's My Line?"
             </p>
             <p>
              She finagled  the only private interview allowed with "Jack" Rubenstein.. "Ruby" - who was the Mafia man [said to be controlled from Chicago by boss Gianciana] who is said to have shot and killed the alleged patsy "Lee Harvery" on live TV.
             </p>
             <p>
              [It is strongly suspected that for doing a good job Rudy did not die of cancer in jail in TX, but went on to live out a life in Mexico.]
             </p>
             <p>
              Killgallen was working on a book she was certain would be a huge success and break open the "JFK" case. Everyone with a brain back in those days had their suspicions, as they do now, as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              She ended up dead in the ground floor of her townhouse; all her make-up still on and propped up in the bed on that floor. 
Her husband [estranged] and her boyfriend [Johnny Ray] also did not live out full lives. 
Bennet Cerf , a famous publisher of that time, denied publicly she was working on a JFK book - when all her close associates knew she was. And when he himself obviously knew, as well. He was a co - panelist on the TV show.
             </p>
             <p>
              After all is said an done and decades later, her biographer was death threatened for the book she wrote about Dorothey Killgallen and later framed as a "forger" - career ruined.
             </p>
             <p>
              Control of the Media and the book publishing and movie industry [Propaganda] is the biggest lynch pin for the invisible control exerted by the gangs involved in Mega - State crimes.

            There were substantial numbers of people - potential witnesses and researchers relating to 9/11 and JFK that died under suspicious circumstances in the months and years after the occasions. About the UFO stuff- are you sure? Because I never looked too much into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're really invested into animal rights stuff, like the people of the ALF, you are definitely considered a terrorist. 
It's always just the obvious con artists and media-gate keepers that not only get away with their outrageous claims mixed in with partial truths but who can make big bucks by doing so. Those who get rich by promoting extraordinary claims are snake oil salesmen.
