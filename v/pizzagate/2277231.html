            Good point. People need to get out of the left/right distraction dichotomy and into the real good/evil dichotomy. Pizzagate is not about trump supporters attacking SJWs with fake news. Some of those hashtags will lead the clickee to Pizzagate, though. That’s a plus.

            The people of Me Too should be ashamed of themselves. From day one, it was an obvious distraction and attempt at neutralization toward pizzagate. To see it as anything else is very unobservant.

            One after one, directors, actors and well-known personalities fell when it came to #metoo. Had these women spoken up five or ten years ago, they would have been dismissed, blackballed and lost a career.  Why now has it been okay to come forward with allegations?  Don't get me wrong--I'm glad it happened.  But something makes me think it was initiated, instigated, given the go ahead, allowed to happen and encouraged by the PTB.  Why?  Because it netted only the low hanging fruit and not the elites?

             Not a chance this happened without someone unlocking the gate and flipping on the green light.  This hasn't just been ignored and tolerated from the beginning.  It has been a running joke in LA and NYC among the
             <em>
              privileged elite
             </em>
             . There is one thing psychopaths enjoy even more than abusing the helpless.  It is the sense of power that comes with doing it out in the open and rubbing peoples noses in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit:  The implied promise is that this is to desensitize the public for what is to come. We'll see.

            Because the media/LSM/Time Magazine have politicized this issue. The #MeToo examples are purely for an attack of the political right in defense of what is being found about the left/Dems. The LSM is itself involved in #PedoGate, so it needed to paint the whole #PizzaGate thing as a right-wing conspiracy against the left to provide a built-in defense by roughly 50% of the population ("our team"). The reality is that the evil of #PedoGate infects both sides of the aisle, with the complicit media silent to protect their own skeletons...a circle of deceit and control due to fear of exposure. It is the elite's version of MAD (mutual assured destruction): "We all have dirt on each other so can be sure to remain silent and cover this up for all involved."

            You are the first person that asked any question. God bless you. Many statements, little questioning. Questioning, intellectually formulated garners some information. Questions of a deeper nature garner more complex answers. Wow, now we are sitting on the rooftop of the world and because we have been asking, where, what, who, we have totally ignored that we have moved ourselves half way up a mountain. We need to celebrate victory. Maybe before you see it outright. Love and peace to us all. Joy and compassion in this season. Stop and take a look at what you have accomplished. Be beneficent towards your work. And so it is.

            There's no chance of some Hollywood A-lister going to jail for touching a successful 40-something actress's bottom when she was 16 years old, but it occupies the minds of the public with thoughts of lesser crimes to the extent that they don't have space for the serious stuff.

            Pizzagate was never there's, it was organic. They will NEVER support a real organic effort, especially one that threatens their key people.

            The country has been programmed by CIA agents and paedophile advocates to disregard claims about group abuse of children, after the McMartin et al cases showed that it was a real likelihood. The False Memory Foundation, child pornographers like the Eberles, and similar types rained down on any accusations, especially after Aquino and Presidio broke.

             All of the kids talked about tunnels. Guess what: tunnels were found, covered over and hidden for years filled with ritualistic graffiti paraphanelia and cages. Some kids in the McMartin case had obvious physical signs of ritual abuse. I will never get how the “satanic panic” blanket of False Memory baloney syndrome covered THAT up. It is despicable that this strategy is STILL used to silence victims.

             Well, and the name pizzagate is retarded. That probably played a huge factor in discrediting the movement.... I mean, One could argue that was the only thing. But who cares right? Lets stick to our guns and continue to use the retarded name...Wait- that would be retarded, Why would we do that?

             I know as recently as about a year ago, they had university psychologists push false memory syndrome. It was a documentary where it really had no place being, but they seem to control what information gets out there...

            There is a manufactured quality to #MeToo, but also an organic quality. We can use it to push those aspects of PG for which we have the strongest evidence- FBI symbols DID appear as logos on certain businesses. JA DID have unquestionably troubling photos on his instagram. We have a few ritual survivors speaking out now, and they are intelligent, articulate and clearly sane. We have to keep pushing. For me, I try to allow God to lead and I follow.

            MeToo is being weaponized for political purposes. They can put their own spin on it (Men are evil, Feminism is wonderful, you should believe all female accusers without questioning, etc). With Pizzagate, they can't do that, their only option is to try to bury it.
