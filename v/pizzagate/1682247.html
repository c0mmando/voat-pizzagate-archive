            Comey is in until 2023 unless there are proven allegations and he can then be removed. Here is brief explanation: The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is appointed by the President by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate. The statutory basis for the present nomination and
confirmation process was developed in 1968 and 1976, and has been used since the death of J.
Edgar Hoover in 1972. Over this time, seven nominations have been confirmed and two have
been withdrawn by the President before confirmation. The position of FBI Director has a fixed
10-year term, and the officeholder cannot be reappointed, unless Congress acts to allow a second
appointment of the incumbent. There are no statutory conditions on the President’s authority to
remove the FBI Director. Since 1972, one Director has been removed by the President.
Robert S. Mueller III was the first FBI Director to be appointed to a second term, and this was
done under special statutory arrangements. He was first confirmed by the Senate on August 2,
2001, with a term of office that expired in September 2011. In May 2011, President Barack
Obama announced his intention to seek legislation that would extend Mueller’s term of office for
two years. Legislation that would allow Mueller to be nominated to an additional, two-year term
was considered and passed in the Senate and the House, and President Obama signed the bill into
law (P.L. 112-24) on July 26, 2011. Mueller subsequently was nominated and confirmed to the
two-year term, and he served until September 4, 2013.
On June 21, 2013, President Obama nominated James B. Comey Jr., a former Deputy Attorney
General, to succeed Mueller. Comey was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2013, and he took
office on September 4, 2013.
This report provides an overview of the development of the process for appointing the FBI
Director, briefly discusses the history of nomina

            Trump kept Comey for what reason? The same Comey who said nothing to see here on anything, zero charges, case closed. Trump thought he should keep him? Trump does not look very good to me. My patience is wearing thin because not a single meaningful arrest has been made on the PG scandal. Not even search warrants issued. Like they don't have enough evidence for suspicion, and search and seizure of computers of suspects. Looks more and more like nothing will come of this.

            If Comey goes, the Clinton plant Mccabe might step into his position. The same Mccabe who received 650k from the CF affiliate while he was investigating the CF.

             I thought that potus appointed the FBI director, I doubt Trump would promote McCabe. It seemed like Comey worked to some degree to get Trump installed, so the COIs are now kind of moot. With the foundation defunct, or soon to be, the brother's work at Piper is moot, as is Comey's at HSBC. I don't know, maybe he still has lots of friends there.

             The excuse was always that there was "no reasonable prosector" and that excuse is now gone, the rash of busts seem to have tapered off and no big fish are indicted. Why not?

              Anyone with real integrity would have expanded the investigation, answered the questions truthfully under oath, and demanded special prosecutors for the case. If they were concerned about the integrity of the prosecution they would have released all of the emails for the public to know the real truth with the assurance that there are still a few agents and leaders with some integrity and respect for the law, specifically willing to hold those accountable at the top levels who have abused the law and committed heinous crimes and acts of treason under the color of law. Instead they covered up the investigation, turned crimes into perceived political games, and played an embarrassing game of good cop bad cop before the fake news strategy took hold. The only problem was that there actually may have been a few agents in New York that did have enough integrity to stand up for the truth and against the lawlessness and abuse of power that has gone too far. What is going on is sickening, and is destroying the world.

              While unsure about Sessions and the DOJ, Lynch was absolutely corrupt, and we know the FBI is corrupt at the top. We can only hope it is not corrupt all the way through. The only way to restore their integrity is with Racine, Wisconsin - if they cannot figure out how Racine is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, they they are worthless and terminally corrupt.

            Theres a video on youtube of Gowdy VS Comey and Gowdy lays out ALL the evidence incriminating Hillary and asks Comey point blank how this isn't enough for a prosecution. Gowdy even goes as far as saying "This isn't the FBI I knew" basically saying they are corrupt

             Who ever really trusted him in the first place? Anyone who watched those videos of his testimony could tell he was in on it.

             How do we know Comey, McCabe, Kadzik, Lynch and others at the top were all corrupt? Jim Comey and his family such as his brother Peter have a long history of direct connections to the Clintons, and they have protected and enabled the system of corruption while willingly allowing communities, industries and lives to be destroyed. They can claim they have a secret strategy, which is absurd and cowardly, but the real reason they are known to be corrupt and complicit to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption is simple - Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is Paul Ryan's home district near where Reince Priebus and Scott Walker are from. Racine is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and is connected to every aspect of child trafficking, racketeering, bribery, blackmail, extortion and the underground world of satanic groups and secret societies involved. Gowdy and others cannot be trusted either. They are all compromised and playing bad cop for the cameras.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why Racine, Wisconsin is the key to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption - it is the barometer of truth.

              You could go so far as to say that anyone with any power in DC is corrupt. They didn't get powerful positions for being virtuous. DC is just a cesspool. That is how you know the 'terrorist attacks' are all false flags, any foreign enemy would attack the head of the beast, DC, and that never happens.

              Still waiting for a corroborative link on your Raince "insider info."  If it's connected to child trafficking as you say, then there should be SOME connection out there somewhere.  Thanks.  (5th request, at least)

              And a terrific investigation from honeybee uncovered network between the Clinton Foundation, Lockheed Martin, Brian and Don Podesta - podsta brothers, NCMEC board members, CIA black op, WP that ties into blackmail via satanism &amp; child abductions. Brian Podesta has top security clearance - can steal children with impunity! He is using NCMEC to supply Podesta brothers with children, using JA via Comet PP. Don Podesta, father of Brian and alleged realtive of John &amp; Tony worked for WP for decades.

              i know, but I was hoping that the Comey brothers were more ethical and waiting for an opportunity to take action with a new doj, that the attempted kidnapping on them made them sympathetic to abused children and crime victims. An agent told me that James Comey was "a stand up guy" but its becoming clear that FBI is a travesty.

               We should give it a little time. You never know whats going to happen. On top of that, the spiderweb of information links govs to gov agencies, gov agencies to ngos, ngos to non profits, non profits to charities, ect.. I don't think we have enough sway to prosecute other complicit govs, but we should definitely focus on cleaning house in America. I think a docdump is inevitable if they continue slow-walking the investigation. A docdump would also put pressure on the gov to prosecute, but it would probably cause mayhem throughout the entire world.

               I'm not against a doc dump. It would get messy. Sometimes a forest fire is exactly what's needed to let the underbrush flourish into a new forest. I think what the FBI is doing is more of controlled burning method to prevent forest fires from getting out of control.

                you think there would be a leak from someone in NY? 
Maybe the plan is to use Bharara's existing NY case involving UN/Seng Lap/John Ashe/Clinton Foundation to bring her down, but there are so many others...

             I don't think that he's a bad guy. I think he was under pressure form the CIA and DOJ. You can't prosecute without a grand jury. Now that Sessions is in I believe they can build a solid case against the CF, but I wonder how many people are going to suffer between the time they prosecute and the time they take to build the case. Nevermind... there's a COI between Comey, his brother Peter and the CF.

              He lied under oath before Congress, testifying that Hitlery wasn't going to be prosecuted because it wasn't "intentional."  He told Trey Gowdy under oath that intent was an element of the statute and it clearly is NOT.

             Theres actually rumblings of Trump removing Comey. Sean Spicer wouldn't directly answer but the writings on the wall that Trump is considering it
            </p>
            <p>
             Its tricky because the FBI is still currently investigating the Russian connection. If Trump dumps Comey now I'm sure you can imagine the "Trump Fires Comey Because He was Looking into His Russian Ties" Headlines

              Every day he does not remove Comey, McCabe and others involved in the system of extreme corruption and complicity to corruption, we become increasingly skeptical of whether Trump has any real intentions of draining the swamp or if he is just a deal maker who lied his way into office. The barometer for whether Trump is a Real President or a Fake President is Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              If he really wants to Drain the Swamp and Make American Great Again, he needs to start with Racine, Wisconsin to show the people that he is not a liar and understands how all of the dots to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption are connected.
