Olivia Kesslar\'s child was taken from her when she was 16. She is convinced CPS had no intention of returning her child because the adoptive mother confirmed that during a taped conversation. Her family is poor &amp; could not afford to fight CPS. At the time she was a teenagers, cut off from communication from her mother &amp; placed on psychotropic drugs.</p>
<p>The players in this that need to be investigated are:</p>
<p>Ventura County Human Services Agency
Gladys Gonzales, Social Worker for Ventura County
Officer Jenson - LAPD
Jyllian Stephenson - adoptive mother <a href="https://yourtrainer.com/personal-training/california/thousand-oaks/jyllian-stephenson">https://yourtrainer.com/personal-training/california/thousand-oaks/jyllian-stephenson</a>
John Stephenson  ex husband of adoptive mother. I think he is on record as the adoptive father
Mandee Sanders - attorney for Olivia, Olivia\'s sister Phoebe &amp; a stand-in for Evelyn\'s attorney (employed in US Attorneys Office, as Deputy Director Attorney of Ventura County, not sure what law office she was in when Evelyn was taken but is now Director of a C3 that placed children in foster care and adoptions (Ventura County Foster Parent Association)..seems like a conflict of interest to me.  Like the wolf guarding the chicken coup)</p>

<p>Olivia has been recording the adoptive mother\'s (Jyllian Stephenson) conversations with her. A few red flags: 1) she brags that she has family in the police department &amp; a judge. says &quot;you don\'t know who you are messing with&quot;; 2) accuses her ex-husband of sexually abusing Evelyn; 3) talks about another child in her care being traumatized &amp; had broken bones &amp; bruises.  It\'s unclear if she sustained them while in Jyllian\'s care or prior. It is also unclear that the child she is referring to is her own or another foster child. 4) talks about Evelyn being &quot;hard to handle&quot; and needing to lock her in her room all day.</p>

<p>This is all I have so far. It may be nothing. But I think it\'s worth investigating. You all investigate way better than I do, so I\'m asking for help. If it\'s nothing...it\'s nothing. I feel for this girl</p>',
