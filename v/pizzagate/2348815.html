<p>I am frustrated. The harshest words Omaha media has said about the &quot;relationship&quot; between the missing 12 year old Paw Ku, and a 23 year old gang member so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The parents don\'t approve of this relationship, and I don\'t believe even his parents approve of this relationship&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Approve? Isn\'t this ILLEGAL?  <strong>WTH is going on here?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Special Victims Unit at OPD is concerned with her well-being because of her age, but do not consider her to be in immediate danger  <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT3FfabU0AA2J1k.jpgJ">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT3FfabU0AA2J1k.jpgJ</a></p>

<p>She\'s been missing since January 9th, with this man.. nothing to see here, folks.</p>
<p>For some reason, this (first photo below)  was the only picture Omaha Police used when asking for help. They were berated for it and are now using one more. Check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OmahaPoliceDepartment/posts/10156068923734096">Facebook comments section here</a>, everyone is asking questions about why they used such a bad photo, and why it took Police so long to alert the public, among other things... including the fact that the girl\'s Facebook page was filled with pictures of her looking sexualized and much older <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT1jIzdUQAEx5lG.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DT1jIzdUQAEx5lG.jpg</a>, with tons of comments from older men about her appearance.

            I'm digusted beyond words at how poorly OPD is handling this. I'm also incredibly shocked that Lincoln Police have not issued a statement about her or any information at all. I'm not thrilled that Im hearing major local news from Voat before the local police departments.

             THE GIRL WAS FOUND last night at 3 am - NOT IN OMAHA. The cops changed their story to make it seem like they didn't sleep on this, and didn't state only yesterday that they believed the girl was still in Omaha...

            Well the hometown of the Franklin Conspiracy, don't hold your breath. Before that dawned on me I was thinking they are playing it down to keep them in town, but there are occasions police slack off over runaways in general. But it would be statutory rape if there was "consensual" sex involved:

In the United States, the age of consent is the minimum age at which an individual is considered legally old enough to consent to participation in sexual activity. Individuals aged 15 or younger in Nebraska are not legally able to consent to sexual activity, and such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nebraska statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under age 16. Punishments may vary depending on both the offender's and the victim's ages.

            The actual statute is at that site but apparently 16 is the youngest for any US state &amp; others at 18. So he's likely going down on that charge if not others.

            Well done post.  Omaha has been a hotbed of pedophilia for decades according to victim statements.  Law enforcement and media have likely been in cahoots or paid off/threatened/mind controlled/compromised.  This child could have been sexualized in a pedophile ring.  Tragic.  Good to know that public outcry is having an effect.

            I am so livid right now and physically sick to my stomach. I had to force myself to listen to that woman. This is part of the write up: Neither of Paw's nor Ger's parents approved of the relationship and it was Paw's parents who called the police when she did not come home. Scherer said Paw and her boyfriend are likely still in the Omaha area and the police believe the pair does not want to be found. THE police believe the pair does not want to be found. WHAT? Of course we know he does not want to be found. He is a 22-23 yr. old man on the run with a 12 yr. old girl. She has been Groomed and Spirited away from her family with whatever he has promised her. I can almost guarantee that he has had sex with her so once he does that, being that girls quickly latch on more so than boys, she is LockStep In Love With Him. She is way too young to understand about Real Love and a Sexual Relationship. This is all So Very Wrong On All Levels. Also, they could very well be on the way to Canada and already out of the area. He had a job, so how do we know he did not save up some money to tide them over til they are safely over the boarder. They could have taken a Greyhound Bus or any other type of Bus. Relatively Cheap. This is Frightening at Best. People in that area should be getting groups together in their cars so look for this Pervert and his Victim.

             I am so livid and also sich to my stomach. I woke up thinking of this and cannot stop. This CHILD is GONE and all the police are doing is defending themselves and blaming her. The way to police woman says "well, she's run away before" her voice gets all low and judgemental, implying "well you know what THAT means". For FUCKS SAKE running away is part of childhood! We don't now for how long it was, but if running away means the cops will IGNORE when an adult steals you from your parents, we are all in trouble. I have a feeling there is racial discrimination going on here too. If this was a golden haired girl from the wealthy part of town, everyone would be up in arms and this would have been plastered all over the media and nation since January 9th.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now we've got Voaters saying this isn't pedophilia because she MAY have already gone through puberty (she's 12 - puberty onset is between 10-13 normally).
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't even think straight right now. The police scare the shit out of me. They are NOT interested in finding this girl, only defending themselves.

              Yeah, I saw that too.  I think they are either covering for someone or the climate is changing there and everywhere else.  It sounds to me like she is espousing something that has been written up and handed out.  This is really scary stuff people. What she is saying is scripted.  I know one thing, and that is what pedophelia is.  The grooming and sexual abuse and rape of children.  If you rape a child of any age it falls under pedophilia.  This is what we have discussed on here since I came aboard over a year ago.  Now we are parsing words and saying that if a child is before puberty it is pedophilia and after puberty they make their own choices and it is no longer rape.  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO A Thousand Times NO.  They are not old enough to know about those things.  They have not experienced enough interaction with their fellow human beings.  I worked in a school for quite a few years with all grades.  None of the children acted in this way.  None of the boys hit on the girls before high school.  We were still playing with dolls at the age of 12.  AARRGGHH.

                 Oh by the way, i did go dark on twitter after i got nervous about tweeting re this subject, some of those tweets did go to law enforcement twitter accounts, who were tagged on them.

                 Well just now for the first time, twitter alerts me that someone is trying to get into my (closed) account.

                 Yep, we really do. I thought this sub would be the last place we would have this problem. We haven't even begun discussing the strange actions of the Omaha police, because we're busy arguing about whether she's actually NOT a child. I'm gonna be sick.

            That girl is lost. Way to go society in sexing her up at 12. Even if her family gets her back I bet she just finds a new boyfriend and runs off.

             I'm not sure it's she who is looking for a man. This guy happened to live in their house for awhile, I'm sure it was him who began the advances. On her facebook page, men were making comments to her, but there is no indication she was out making comments to men. She is a child, literally.

              Technically, no  it is not pedophilia. The legal definition of pedophilia is an attraction to pre-pubescent children.  Puberty generally starts in children around 10 years old so pedophilia is attraction toe kids younger than that, meaning up to 9-ish.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are both in agreement that it's sick as fuck.  But at this point, it's just a matter of having sex with a minor.

                Why didn't you quote the OTHER part from Wikipedia that stated, "Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11..." way up at the top.  I won't get into the fact that kids seem to be hitting puberty younger and younger.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also stated the LEGAL definition.  In court, there is no test to see if the victim has hit puberty yet.  They don't bring a doctor to verify one way or the other so they typically pick 9 or 10.  But either way, as I stated, the accepted age of the start of puberty is 10 or 11, the girl is 12.  STILL not pedophilia.

                  You specifically asked why pedophilia wasn't mentioned.  I gave you the legit answer.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Pedophilia is an attraction to PRE-pubescent kids.  If she's having "consensual" sex, she's obviously hit puberty.  Age isn't even factored in when this goes to court.

                     Pedophilia is considered a paraphilia, a condition in which a person's sexual arousal and gratification depend on fantasizing about and engaging in sexual behavior that is atypical and extreme. Pedophilia is defined as the fantasy or act of sexual activity with children who are generally age 13 years or younger.

                    Pedophiles also have sex with adults as well as 18 year old smooth asian boys.  I'm just giving the definition that is used in the judicial system.  You yourself have found the definition that it's pre-pubescent kids, which is the same definition supported by the APA.  Nit-pick anything you want with it.  If you want to argue that you didn't hit puberty until you were 17 so someone attracted to anybody under 17 is a pedophile, that's fine.  This is all my fault for trying to have a serious discussion with someone who I thought was asking a legitimate question because they wanted the answer.

                   The American Heritage Dictionary defines pedophilia as: The act or fantasy on the part of an adult of engaging in sexual activity with a child or children.  The children affected by pedophilia are prepubescent boys and girls (13 years old or younger). When post-pubescent teenagers are involved, the proper term is ephebophilia which is not criminal under circumstances where the participants are of the same age or where the persons have each reached the age of consent.

                     Have you considered that the elite/courts are not the best judge of what is or is not pedophilia? I mean, it's interesting details but for our purposes, I think we can speak of pedophilia with more compassionate terms. A 12 year old is a child, this is pedophilia no matter what the courts say. And didn't Sibel Edmonds tell us already that people aren't appointed to high positions unless they've been blackmailed and are pedophiles themselves? I'll link you to her interview if you're not aware.

                      So either the POS skeezy pedo who was arguing with you deleted all their messages or someone else did. Thank GOD I didn't have to read their nasty bs, but seeing what you had to write was enough to let me know what you were up against! You did great!!! You made excellent points, but unfortunately a pedo is only interested in arguing why their perversion is somehow ok! I hate these freaks!

                       Thanks!! I know. I had to actually read a fricking pro-pedophile article on Medium in my research to refute that guy. He erased his comments after i asked him for proof that the courts system only considers those below 10 to be children, therefore it is not pedophilia if older than that. He said this case did not constitute pedophilia. (And remember, all of Omaha is saying the same thing, and THATS what has me so upset!)
