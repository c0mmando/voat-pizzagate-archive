I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular establishment is called SOS Children’s Villages.  Here is the <a href="https://www.sosillinois.org/">Illinois chapter</a>  the likely source of Obama’s celebrated “Pizza and Dogs”
It has chapters <a href="http://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/">around the world </a></p>
<p>Notably, SOS Children’s Villages also operates in Haiti and were involved in the Laura Silsby / New Life Child Refuge (NLCR) kidnapping case. When Silsby was busted trying to smuggle the children into Dominican Republic they were transferred to SOS ostensibly for “safekeeping” but as researchers know… this was just a smoke screen transfer.  As the CIA-mouthpiece New York Slimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/world/americas/05orphans.html">reported</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The children are being taken care of now at SOS Children’s Villages, an Austrian-run orphanage in Port-au-Prince.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our suspicions are confirmed by this 2014 UK article - Procuring Children · BBC Virtual Pedophile Matrix · SOS Children\'s Villages 
<a href="http://www.ukcolumn.org/oldforums/index.php?p=/discussion/8665/procuring-children-bbc-virtual-pedophile-matrix-sos-children-s-villages">http://www.ukcolumn.org/oldforums/index.php?p=/discussion/8665/procuring-children-bbc-virtual-pedophile-matrix-sos-children-s-villages</a></p>
<p>So let’s unpack this a bit more shall we?  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Obama’s closest advisor, confidante and some say, the de facto shadow president <a href="http://www.ukcolumn.org/oldforums/index.php?p=/discussion/8665/procuring-children-bbc-virtual-pedophile-matrix-sos-children-s-villages">Valerie Jarrett</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>United States Marine Field McConnell has linked the British Bankers’ Association to the sponsors of ‘Mothers’ at SOS Children’s Villages in a matrix of pedophile groomers spread across over 134 countries, allegedly directed by Valerie Jarrett, the Chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls.</p>
<p>McConnell claims the British Bankers’ Association agents hired Jarrett to develop SOS Children’s Villages in Illinois into pedophile grooming centers where entrapped clients could be forced to participate in a global BBA Libor Minus Sex Per Cent protection racket.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All of this should surprise none of us who have been closely following the Obama Presidency and his decision to appoint a pedophile advocate Kevin Jennings as his “Safe Schools Czar”
The Washington Times says Jennings\' group made <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/08/obamas-buggery-czar/">sex between children and adults</a> look normal. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Jennings also expressed admiration for Harry Hay, a notorious and extremely prominent supporter of the North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA).  &quot;One of the people that\'s always inspired me is Harry Hay,&quot; he said.  Despite numerous requests to the Obama administration and Mr. Jennings, we have not received any answers to inquiries about these troubling issues. </p>
<p>Now revelations have surfaced that Mr. Jennings not only thought there was nothing wrong with boys having sex with older men (or girls having sex with older women), but he also played a role in promoting such relationships. 
Further intrigue is revealed regarding SOS and HSBC <a href="http://www.abeldanger.net/2012/03/mcconnell-links-obamas-childhood.html">http://www.abeldanger.net/2012/03/mcconnell-links-obamas-childhood.html</a></p>
<p>SOS pedo-traps allegedly sponsored through extorted Signatory Investors in Strong’s $78 trillion Carbon Disclosure Project such as HSBC and Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now what person has recently captured our national attention?  Would it surprise you to learn that FBI Director James Comey was a member of HSBC’s Board of Directors?
<em>Corrupt HSBC Global Bank Exec Arrested, Links to Hillary, James Comey and Loretta Lynch</em></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>James Comey was nominated by Obama for a post on HSBC’s Board of Directors in June 2012, and he was subsequently appointed to the board on March 4, 2013.  He served on the HSBC’s Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee.  Comey’s appointment was for three years, however, he resigned effective Sept. 4, 2013, following his confirmation to serve as FBI Director.
Let’s keep on unpacking shall we?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Frank Marshall Davis, Obama mentor. As one commentator observed regarding an article referencing Davis: <a href="http://www.aim.org/aim-column/was-a-communist-obamas-sex-teacher/">http://www.aim.org/aim-column/was-a-communist-obamas-sex-teacher/</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It glosses over his Communist Party membership and focuses instead on
his role as sex pervert, pedophile, pornographer and mentor to Obama</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toby Harnden of the London Daily Telegraph had written a story about the book and <a href="http://www.aim.org/aim-column/was-a-communist-obamas-sex-teacher/">Davis</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Davis would cruise in Hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with. He derived sexual gratification from bondage, simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on” </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>And finally we come to William “Bill” Ayers, domestic terrorist and bootstrapper of Obama’s inaugural campaign fundraiser – held in Ayers’ living room in Hyde Park, Chicago.
How did this sick bastard get his start and form his worldviews?  Why, by working with toddlers of course! <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-long-strange-trip-of-bill-ayers/Content?oid=876592">http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-long-strange-trip-of-bill-ayers/Content?oid=876592</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>On October 15, 1965, Ayers and 38 other activists were arrested for demonstrating against the war at the Ann Arbor draft board. It was his first arrest, and he emerged from his ten-day jail sentence more committed than ever. He joined the local chapter of the radical Students for a Democratic Society and looked for &quot;socially useful work to do.&quot; Within a few weeks, he was teaching preschoolers at the Children\'s Community School.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creepy dude elaborates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I heard about the school from a guy I had met in jail,&quot; says Ayers. &quot;I visited the school and I was absolutely taken by the kids. Here was something I could do that was socially useful. Here was something I was good at. I felt at home with the kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Within a year Ayers was director of the school, as it expanded to include kindergarten through second-grade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well isn’t that just special?  And know we know.  Obama, Jarrett, Jennings, Ayers, Comey.  I had more to post about Ayers wife Bernadine Dorhn but decided to stop here.  Thanks for reading.</p>',

            Sketchy. This post is very "loose" shall we say. And the title seems to be a mash-up between a Podesta email about the hotdog stand in Hawaii and flying in $65,000 worth of "hotdogs" from the stratfor emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't get it. If there is some other connection with other things, i.e. the SOS villages, locations, who's running them, etc, then I would start another discussion.

             Far as the hot dog stand, I was attempting to use a little /sarc that people here would recognize.  Unfortunately seems to have went over like a lead balloon, lol

             But you're right this post could have been done much better.  I was really pressed for time and wanted to get my thoughts out. Didn't transpire exactly how I planned so maybe a re-write is in order with a better title.   I think the potential leads are all there, just need a better presentation.  Thanks for the input

            I think if you really want to dig deep into Chigago and the relationships of the people involved you have to look at the Hull House. Abel Danger who have unraveled much of the Obama/Jarrett background have named this quasi orphanage as very important.The board of directors have some notable names they were forced to close receiving any knew admissions in 2012 for a reason.

            I just want to point out that on the SOS website (

            </a>
            ), if you scroll the banner images on the home page, the fourth one is of four children sharing pizza. I mean, seriously. Am I just being overly paranoid?

            This is so interesting. I read part so far and have to do a lot more reading tonight. But, even if this isn't related to the hot dogs and pizza, it's still very interesting! It definitely shows that we should continue digging into this. So, I wonder if Michelle Obama is really transgender like a lot of people think. If Obama's nanny was and groomed him then maybe that's what he's attracted to. The deeper we dig, the stranger this world is to me. I had no idea before this how many sick people there were.

              Can you pass to some legit researcher if you have any connections? they still operate so who knows, maybe potential for some legit intel is just sitting there waiting to be found by someone with good research skills

              Can you help? Im not a researcher.. I don't even really know how to use voat, the reason I have this info is because I actually saw their truck parked at my local grocery store (they were buying supplies for their legitimate front-business, they still operate at the airports here) and looked them up online because of the pedo logo I recognized from pizzagate (that's how I found out they share location in NYC with Haitian consulate next to the UN building here.

                Here is everything I know (plus my speculation)--
               </p>
               <p>
                The company definitely currently operates, even though their website is from the stone-age. I saw their truck on my way to work &amp; got curious because of the obvious symbols on their truck (and the truck paint job was clearly old, so definitely pre-dated the "outing" of pizzagate symbols).
               </p>
               <p>
                I googled the company and found a few more strange details - their "caf"e location was in same building as the Haitian consulate in NYC (which is also a few blocks from UN, which is a huge potential customer base if it's a NYC franchise of comet / pizzagate). This location opened in 2009 or 2013 sometime I believe the cafe may have closed a few years ago.
               </p>

                 https://www.yelp.ca/biz/bimmys-food-made-with-love-new-york
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                In addition to a location in the Haitian consulate building beside the UN, they service some area hospitals, and airports (good cover reason to have trucks going in &amp; out of these locations if ever picking up any illegal shipments from airports). They also stated they hire ex-cons for their business, pure speculations but a legitimate food business going to places like hospitals and airports may not neccessarily make that choice, but if you are doing anything shady it might make more sense? If I was making a conspiracy, I'd think maybe they have police connects tell them when an ex-con has violated paroll and is going to go back to prison, and they offer them an alternative (take this job, with decent pay, and look the other way on anything unsavory, or go back to prison).
               </p>
               <p>
                I hope I'm totally wrong about the place, but did not feel right to just ignore (in NYC subways the motto is - see something, say something) so even if it's nothing, better to check right?

              I'm not even sure if it's conjecture. As far as I can tell the only connection between "Hot Dog Friday" at the White House and SOS Children's Village is literally the word Chicago. You could make the same connection by just randomly throwing a dart at a map of Chicago and choosing the closest orphanage or elementary school.

              That's kind of a big stretch don't you think?

            Why does the post start with an email header, when does this email end, it appears to just flow into the post or it only shows a header.. where did this email come from.. hard to follow because I was immediately confused by the email header.

            I thought I would contribute a little about Bernadine Dorns now that we are going there to get everyone a little pumped up? Besides her former career as a member of the domestic terroist group the "Wheather Underground" with her partner Bill Ayers. She just happened to land a job as an "attorney" with a powerful law firm in Chicago. Sidly Austin "Ring a bell anyone,
What is odd is that she does not have a law license and was a previously known member of a domestic terror group that had blown up government buildings.
Stranger than that was a young "lawyer" Michelle Robinson (Obama) just happened to arrive to be mentored by her straight from the recommendation Mayor of Chicago Richard Dayley's office and his assistant Valleris Jarrett. 
So "amazing this awkward young man from Harvard would show up for his mentor shop out of the blue and be assigned to Michelle for training! What a beautiful story you could not wrote a better book. Oh that's right they kind of did "Dreams From My Father."
