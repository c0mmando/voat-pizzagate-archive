Dutroux - convicted along with his wife in 1989 for the rape and violent abuse of five young girls, the youngest of whom was just eleven - now stands accused of being a key player in an international child prostitution and pornography ring whose practices included kidnapping, rape, sadistic torture, and murder.</p>
<p>Dutroux was sentenced in 1989 to thirteen years for his crimes, but was freed after having served just three. This was in spite of the fact that, as prison governor Yvan Stuaert would later tell a parliamentary commission: “A medical report described him as a perverse psychopath, an explosive mix. He was an evident danger to society.”</p>
<p>The man who turned Dutroux loose on society, Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet, soon after received a prestigious appointment to serve as a judge at the European Court of Justice at the Hague. Shortly after Dutroux’s release, young girls began to disappear in the vicinity of some of his homes. Though technically unemployed and drawing welfare from the state, he nevertheless owned at least six houses and lived quite lavishly.</p>
<p>His rather lucrative income appears to have been derived from trading in child sex-slaves, child prostitution, and child pornography. Many of his houses appeared to stand vacant, though at least some of them were in fact used as torture and imprisonment centers where kidnapped girls were taken and held in underground dungeons.</p>
<p>Some of Dutroux’s homes were used in this way for several years following his early release, with a growing body of evidence to indicate that fact to the police. True to form though, authorities failed to act on the information, or acted on it in a way that showed either complete incompetence (according to most press reports), or police complicity in the operation (according to any sort of logic).</p>
<p>Police seem to have routinely ignored tips that later proved to be accurate, including a report from Dutroux\'s own mother that her son was holding girls prisoner in one of his houses. In addition, key facts were withheld from investigators working on the disappearances and lines of communication were unaccountably broken, inexcusably hindering the investigation.</p>
<p>Police did search one of Dutroux\'s homes on no less than three separate occasions over the course of the investigation. On at least two of those occasions, two of the missing girls were being held in heinous conditions imprisoned in a custom-built dungeon in the basement. Nevertheless, the police searches came up empty, despite the fact that the investigating officers reported “hearing children’s voices on one occasion,” according to the Guardian.</p>
<p>It was not until August 13, 1996, four years after the disappearances began, that authorities arrested Dutroux, along with his wife (an elementary school teacher), a lodger, a policeman, and a man the Guardian described as “an associate with political connections” – elsewhere identified as Michel Lelievre.</p>
<p>Two days later, police again searched Dutroux\'s home and discovered the soundproof dungeon/torture center. As CNN reported, three years earlier “police ignored tips from an informant who said Dutroux was building secret cellars to hold girls before selling them abroad.” And in 1995, the same informant had told police that Dutroux had offered an unidentified third man “the equivalent of $3,000 to $5,000 to kidnap girls.”</p>
<p>Incredibly, it was later reported by the Guardian that police actually had in their possession a videotape of the dungeon being constructed: “Belgian police could have saved the lives of two children allegedly murdered by the paedophile Marc Dutroux if they had watched a video seized from his home which showed him building their hidden cell.” The tape had been seized in one of the earlier searches.</p>
<p>At the time of the final search, two fourteen-year-old girls were found imprisoned in the dungeon, chained and starving. They described to police being used as child prostitutes and in the production of child pornography videos. More than 300 such videos were taken into custody by the police.</p>
<p>On August 17, the story got grimmer as police dug up the bodies of two eight-year-old girls at another of Dutroux\'s homes. It would later be learned that the girls had been kept in one of Dutroux’s dungeons for nine months after their abductions, during which time they were repeatedly tortured and sexually assaulted, all captured on videotape. The girls were then left to slowly starve to death. Alongside of their decimated corpses was the body of Bernard Weinstein, a former accomplice of Dutroux who had occupied one of the houses for several years. Weinstein had been buried alive.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, two more girls were found buried under concrete at yet another of the Dutroux properties. By that time, ten people were reportedly in custody in connection to the case. Elsewhere in Belgium, the News Telegraph reported that: “The corpses of two women and parts of a third body have been discovered in a freezer at a Lebanese restaurant in Brussels.”</p>
<p>As the body count mounted, the outrage of the Belgian people grew. They demanded to know why this man, dubbed the \'Belgian Beast,\' had been released after having served such an absurdly short sentence. And to know why, as evidence had continued to mount and girls had continued to disappear, the police had chosen to do nothing. How many girls, they demanded to know, had been killed as a result of this inaction?</p>
<p>Adding further fuel to the fire, as a Los Angeles Times report revealed, was that: “a highly regarded children’s activist, Marie-France Botte, claims that the Justice Ministry is sitting on a politically sensitive list of customers of pedophile videotapes.”</p>

            There is evidence that "Save the Children," an NGO supposedly set up to help these kids, may be compromised and a part of this pedo ring. I am not implying all people, but there is credible evidence that they are one of the implicated NGOs that are helping to provide access to kids and to cover up their evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest using #SaveTheKids, shorter, simpler, and no such baggage.

            Did anyone here the C-SPAN caller on Trumps Inauguration? Saying CPS is abusing their powers and taking children away? She was in tears! All I could think of was what is happening to these kids after they go up for "adoption". Might be worth a look.

            We need to reform the way communities take care of their own. As far as I'm concerned, we need to fire all the police, and take care of our communities in a new manner. We need a distributed means of justice. For example, if there are allegations of dungeons at the neighbor's house. The entire community needs to go there together and look. Care for your family, and care for your community by taking appropriate actions. The world police have effectively destroyed their credibility. Take actions to save your families. It's that simple: the state is the enemy of the family. Once you realize this, decisions to take Care become obvious.

             Absolutely. That is where we are headed. It worked in the past and it will again in the future. I would say though, that there are some good police, and scrapping them overnight might be difficult. Rather, if humanity keeps waking up, then they would slowly become unnecessary.

             I made a post yesterday about the Republic our founders formed. It rested on the Militia of the Several States whereby every male aged 14 to 45 was a vested and acoutred member. The Militia mustered, drilled and marched regularly leaving all of America prepared to handle any emergency ourselves. There was a complete penal system in the Courts Martial of each Militia, a massive force called up ONLY by the Governor of each State. The County and City units could be called up by their respective brass should the Governor need be taken down. We enjoyed complete control of our governing bodies and they were terrified of us. That was freedom. Look up the Dick Act (it's when Congress snatched our teeth right out of our mouths).

            Actually that tragedy was caused by laws against pedophilia.  If consensual pedophilia were legal (with parents consent) then unstable adults would not snap and resort to crime.  They would have no reason to kidnap or kill kids to hide the evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why Dutroux could not reveal where the kids were. That's why the kids died.

              Why are they sick? How are they rationalizations, rather than true descriptions of reality and advocacy of sane healthy practice?  How are these individuals "damaged"?  Do you just vomit out the cliches you know, or can you support your views?

               They're sick because the cycle of abuse is based around the inflicting of one humans sexual will over another human with no choice in the matter. To think that those kind of actions are not abhorant is to be suffering from the same pathology (even if it is by proxy). Do you want rape legalised also? Cus that's what you're arguing for, only the damage is arguably worse because a child's mind is still forming. "Round in circles"? Lol, you're stupid as well as an abuse apologist. I say lol, but it really isn't that funny.

                Sickness is a provable tangible condition of dysfunction but you are attempting a circular definition: saying anyone who believes something you don't is sick. But love is not sick, rather it is healthy. Denying love as authorities and misguided parents do to kids is sick. Consensual sexual contact between generations is good. You are say anyone who thinks differently from you is suffering from the disease you describe. That is also a circular argument you use to dismiss anyone who disagrees with you. Nice trick but not true.
   Can you prove this "damage to a child's mind" happens? Do it.  You try to equate consensual love with rape when it is the opposite. You have never studied the most basic logic. These are just tricks not facts or logic. If it is abuse then how does it abuse. Abuse has to be real harm. Show me the proof.

                 Proof? Ok, how about the endocrine system releasing hormones at puberty that encourage sexual interest? Why not before? Adults 
have already gone through the process so are therefore more interested in sex, whereas beyond fooling around with others their own age occasionally (which I think is healthy generally) kids are more interested in learning about other things. Think about any classic childhood endeavour, climbing trees, games etc. and you have a clue as to what level of development they are at, in the case of physical activity they are learning about the mechanics of their bodies, in the case of games they are learning about social interaction, then comes puberty, and the complexity increases. Imposing a sexual dynamic (and make no mistake, it is an imposition) prior to when nature deems it relevant is damaging because it is forcing a child to run before they can walk. It is based around gratification for the adult no matter how you try to rationalise it with your apparent intellect. Love nurtures, it does not impose. If it wasn't such a serious misconception, your statement about LOVE would be fucking laughable, and I didn't even get round to the physical incompatibilities between adult and child. Now, I'm cutting this off, I have better things to do with my time than debate the obvious, and frankly I feel Fucking dirty talking to the likes of you. Hope you don't have kids, they don't need to raised around pathology. There's enough in the world as it is. Nature knows best, she knows you, and your sickness will be consumed in the fires of evolution. Bitch.

Just because people are different at different periods of lives does not mean they do not have the right to sex if they choose it.

                   Kids choose to do all sorts of stupid shit, even when they have adequate parenting. I think I have made a sufficient argument to allow for the following statement... Leave me the fuck alone you disgusting paedophile filth.

                    Kids also do good and honest and healthy things. And adults also do all sorts of stupid shit. It is not your right to deprive kids of their rights to love and touching. You have made no argument at all. If you want to be left alone, then practice what you preach.

              Wrong never to people like me and no one should be "offered up" by someone else.  Each person should make their own decisions about their body, Something you hate to allow for kids.

              Incorrect again. You are trying to prove your argument by making it a generalization. Then you descend into ad hominem attack.
 It is your responsibility to open your eyes to to true nature and needs of kids and stop harming them by sexual repression.

From what?
You don't have to stop yourself from something healthy and good. 
Yes, is was exactly bad law from a sick society that caused those crimes, and many others from sick deluded societies. 
The murders of children to hide the evidence happens because of bad law.

               From having sex with children. Children should not be engaging in activities with serious consequences until they're brains have developed at least and hopefully they have gotten some knowledge and sense. While the personality and brain structure develops it should not be interfered with, and especially not with an adult for fucks sake.

                You are being irrational. There are no serious consequences from doing something you want to do and which is healthy. OTOH, of course love has serious consequences, that is why human being do it. The serious consequences are the damage done by not allowing them.  This ruins most people for life. Human being a prepared for love from birth or before. Love helps the brain develop, which is why all people engage in it. If you mean there is real damage to the brain then of course you can prove this physiologically and prove you're not just vomiting the usual irrational speeches.

             You are sick to suggest that a child can consent to sexual acts with an adult.Using that argument to justify this pure evil reveals you to be a pedo at heart. You are clearly a pedo based on the history of your postings. If a child consents to be a sex slave, that would be fine in your twisted mind.

              Sick is a dysfunctional condition with a specific cause. Let's see if you have to brains to explain it. 
Yes, all humans can and do consent and withhold consent to a million things. 
Anyone who does not see it is jealous of children and deluded.

            I am surprised that no one has mentioned Dutroux in relation to the recent revelations by Anneke Lucas. It seems that his actions were part and parcel of what she experienced so many years earlier. That means that these networks will not die even if we are able to expose a layer of it here without constant vigilance. This should not be stopped even after we gain some traction.

             Are Islamic Pedophiles included in Islamic terrorists that Trump is going to help the world wipe from the face of the earth? Cause that might be a big dent in the network... Maybe enough to out the rest with information gathering tech these days.

            Pedophocracy or maybe Pedocracy is simpler - I've got to add somewhere - watching the US inauguration, looking at the entrenched class attending the inaugural congressional luncheon, when I see their forced smiles through their puckered, bitter and sometimes bizarre faces, I just can't help but think - pedo, ...pedo, ...there's another one,....pedo... tragedy and comic all at once - the comedy being that we may just have a better ending than we hoped.

              just so many of those old freaky faces, trussed up on their suits to put a gloss over their stained souls.  Heartbreaking, frightening, like an unwelcome Halloween forcing itself on you in the middle of polite society - which is actually the kill domain.
