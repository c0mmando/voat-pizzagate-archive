<p>This centers around the SelfCuttingGirl catfish story, in which a 40 year old man fooled Anthony, and many others, into believing he was a 14 year old girl. Read that post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504231056/https://pastebin.com/FJanjC70">here</a>. Also, keep in mind that <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Pa1ZT">this</a> is who these people thought they were communicating with. </p>
<p>&quot;The Hunter&quot; is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/X49RRSC4ls/">Jordan Hembrough</a> and the other girl-friend mentioned is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107130132/https:/twitter.com/shelbys__tweets/status/341393377616605185">shelbys__tweets</a>; who claims to have turned 18 in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107130321/https:/twitter.com/shelbys__tweets/status/790995708723748864">late 2016</a>, which would have made her around 13 or 14 when all of this was going down. I find it hard to believe that this is a real person, but that doesn\'t matter. It\'s worth mentioning that this is one of the &quot;real girls&quot; Anthony brings up when discussing the reveal on the show. Anthony still follows this girl on twitter, btw, or at least he did before he was banned.</p>
<p>We\'ll start at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235813/https:/twitter.com/shelbys__tweets/status/326358630372872192">the end</a> and then [double back]
(<a href="http://imgur.com/a/zYz4L">http://imgur.com/a/zYz4L</a>) to when Jordan Hembrough, a TV show host in his 40\'s, decided it was appropriate to contact what he believed to be a 14 year old girl, make inappropriate comments, take her on as a pseudo employee, and make even more inappropriate jokes that would make even Chip cringe (It\'s like an Army joke). Oof. You probably noticed a reference to Penn Jilette in there, too. Apart from Anthony and Jordan, Penn was one of the most <a href="http://imgur.com/a/9MHxV">publicly engaging</a> celebrities.  
</p>
<p>Now here\'s the old O&amp;A gang discussing the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqPeHmg_uSA">they\'d been had</a>. The more I listen to this the more I notice how panicked everyone sounds. High-pitch Jimmy denies knowing anything about her while also claiming that he knew she was really a he all along, Opie kinda knows something, but not as much as everyone else, and Anthony tries to frame the conversation in a way that emphasizes how much of a creep this guy is for pretending to be an underage girl, despite the fact that he had been grooming &quot;her&quot; for well over a year. </p>
<p>Yeah, about that: Here\'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107130733/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/36i444/anthony_cumia_hunter_was_host_of_tv_show_the_toy/">an old thread</a> full of information. Linked threads: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131048/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3669l6/2_years_ago_anthony_got_catfished_by_1415_year/">first</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/36b40p/anthony_cumia_responds_to_selfcuttinggirlgate/">second</a>. Here\'s Anthony <a href="http://imgur.com/cfdeesM">denying</a> that he\'d ever been catfished in the first place &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131320/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/2sbni4/anthony_talking_about_reddit_speculations/cno2np8/">the thread</a>. Remember ApologyGirl21? <a href="http://imgur.com/5JEGuCE">This is her</a>. It\'s possible that this girl is one of the &quot;real friends&quot; that Ant was complaining about opening up to SelfCuttingGirl, too. Here\'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131506/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3zjwxv/ant_deleted_his_reddit_post_denying_self_cutting/?st=j2b0lsfe&amp;sh=191fc079">the thread</a> where Ant deletes his denial. Here\'s Anthony claiming that he bought SelfCuttingGirl a macbook because he\'s a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/95wzmAG.png">charitable fellow</a>. Here\'s Ant\'s 17 year old girlfriend, ApologyGirl21, being used to lure in more strays and Ant offering SelfCuttingGirl <a href="http://imgur.com/W5a7hsp">room and board</a>. </p>
<p>Here\'s a section of a blog post by Melissa Statten, one of Anthony\'s ex\'s, entitled: <a href="http://imgur.com/u5f4Bld">Trophy Wife aka My Life With A Shock Jock</a> &amp; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504231925/https://pastebin.com/m2yQ5ZDm">full version</a>, which discusses her finding out that he had saved this 14 year old girl\'s Amazon wishlist &quot;because she\'s a fan of the show and she\'s cute&quot;. Here\'s Anthony publicly <a href="http://imgur.com/8rYmdFT">thumbing his nose</a> at his ex for getting upset that he\'s purchasing gifts for what he believed to be a 14 year old girl. Here\'s a bonus clip of Melissa Statten exposing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MhfFYL6Lvg">Tranthony Cumio</a> as a ladyboy lover and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131632/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/48jyu4/the_transsexual_sue_lightning_anthony_is_accused/">the thread</a>. I should probably clarify why the Sue Lightning/tranny stuff is relevant...<a href="http://imgur.com/aLsqyCK">This is why</a>. </p>
<p>The reason I haven\'t posted any direct communications between Anthony and this &quot;girl&quot; is because at some point during the whole hullabaloo of Ant admitting that he was catfished, then claiming that the catfished story never happened, him saying she was just a girl who the guys on the show retweeted, then claiming that he bought her things because he\'s a charitable guy, and even going so far as to pretend that SelfCuttingGirl was his <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Xt1ip">niece</a> at one point...he decided to <a href="http://imgur.com/a/HRgsJ">wipe his entire twitter account</a> the same way he wiped his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131748/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3zqly0/oh_anthony_how_long_before_you_delete_this/">Vine account</a>. Bonus: His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180107131837/https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/3zspzq/anthony_addresses_the_vine_favorites_social_media/">reaction</a> to the Vine likes. The only problem with wiping your account clean is that all of the @ mentions <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%40selfcuttinggirl%20niece&amp;src=typd">are still there</a>. There are <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4aTFc">some speculative things</a>. I\'m not sure what to make of that. I don\'t know who that message was sent to, but there\'s enough left over to paint a picture of what was really going on. Plus, you\'d be a fool to not <a href="https://youtu.be/yPoC4j1W82s?t=7640">take the man at his word</a>. </p>
