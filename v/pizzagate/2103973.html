<h2>Survivor <a href="https://voat.co/user/Pgategirl">@Pgategirl</a> bravely came forward and posted the story of her childhood sexual abuse in Junction City and on Fort Riley Army Base in Kansas</h2>

</ul>
<p>Here is a summary of the ongoing thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pgategirl reported that she and other girls who were enrolled in a Junction City dance school, called Clarabel\'s Dance Studio, a.k.a. <a href="http://archive.is/cfTuq">Clarabel\'s Performing Arts Citadel,</a> were sex trafficked by a large crime ring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young Mexican girls, who could not speak English, were trafficked with them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She and many other children were further harmed by the creation of child sexual abuse materials, a.k.a. child pornography, duplicated then sold out of a video rental store called Popingo Video located on Grandview Plaza in Junction City</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children were used in Satanic rituals on Fort Riley which were held in old-looking limestone buildings </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crimes against children were committed in the basements of these limestone buildings, as well as inside tan corrugated metal buildings on Fort Riley, and in Junction City</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The children were programmed by the &quot;Johns&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The survivor was tortured with electroshock on the base inside a kind of small clinic that the traffickers called &quot;the hospital,&quot; which was located in a somewhat remote area  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dance studio was walking distance from the Masonic &quot;Union Lodge #7&quot; in Junction City, an archive of their site unionlodge7.ml is <a href="http://archive.is/fEuzU">here</a> and another site is <a href="http://archive.is/1n4vv">here</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comment by Pgategirl:</p>
<p>Was not kidnapped. Trafficked by my own parents. Several other girls who went to the studio were trafficked as well, with their parents knowledge and consent. This was some kind of ring. A big one. This area in Kansas was overrun with organized crime.</p>

<h2>Eyewitness reports of Satanic ritual sites in the Fort Riley base/Junction City area from a Fritz Springmeier book</h2>
<p>Below are pages 19-20 from this 1995 book:</p>

<p>The excerpt with added emphasis, driving distance from Junction City, and notes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>KANSAS</strong></p>
<p>It goes without saying that Kansas City, KS, Wichita, and Topeka have Satanic covens. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Junction City</strong></p>
<p><strong>Satanic covens operate here.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Fort Riley — 15 minutes from Junction City</strong></p>
<p>Every year, the MP\'s and the Army find bodies on the reservation* -- not where the shells impact for testing artillery but in an adjacent area.  An ex-M.P. states that the bodies were not processed for proper identification. </p>
<p>*<em>The Fort Riley Military Reservation</em> <a href="http://archive.is/kQrbM"><em>Wikipedia</em></a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Abilene — 26 minutes from Junction City</strong></p>
<p>Abilene, KS was the hometown of Eisenhower. There are numerous unknown things about Eisenhower, which indicate that Abilene has some strong Illuminati connections. Interestingly, just north of Abilene (Abilene lies just south of I-70) was a Satanic sacrifice site. To get to the site go just 2 miles north of 1-70, and then one mile west to a forested area which is near a creek and a pit. Within this forested area is a small clearing about 30\' x 30\' in the middle.  <strong>Dismembered bodies were in abundance in the area, including children’s bones.</strong>  Coyotes were carrying away human parts from the area. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bushong -- 1 hour from Junction City</strong></p>
<p><em>Note:  Bushong, formerly called Weeks, is a</em> <a href="http://archive.is/RxTDx"><em>ghost town but has around 34 residents</em></a></p>
<p>This tiny village lies west of Osage City, and north of Emporia.  A series of missile bases were built by the government in this county and abandoned.  A large missile base was located at Bushong and operated from 1957-64.  After it was abandoned, the people who owned the properly tried to keep out intruders, but nothing they did could keep out the intruders.  Witnesses who would try to check out what was being done within the <strong>underground tunnels and rooms</strong> would be scared off by cult people guarding the area.  Witnesses could see bonfires taking place within an airshaft.  Satanic symbols and 666 were written all over the site. 666 was written on the big entrance door to the underground installation. A 30\' waterpit near the missile silo was part of the original missile base. It is suspected that bodies or parts may have been deposited down the water pit. It is speculated that the people who bought the property in recent times may be in the process of sanitizing the area of all evidence.  <strong>There was a</strong> <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4335/36794240766_94ea304041_h.jpg">gun emplacement</a> <strong>also at the site and at that gun emplacement a map was found with the following Kansas towns on it, Bushong, Junction City, Ft. Riley, Burlington, Burlingame, White City, and Plymouth.</strong> This is very interesting because <strong>those places have had independent verifications of Satanic activity.</strong>  Most of the sites given in this newsletter on Kansas will relate to this Satanic cult\'s ritual sites which were in use in the early 1980\'s and which correspond to the towns shown on that map. </p>
<p>At the very least, <strong>this group has received police help, but it may go farther, the group’s power may well reach quite high.</strong> This is not a hierarchy group, but <strong>it can be speculated that they may work with the hierarchy.</strong></p>
<p><em>Note:</em>  <a href="http://archive.is/Pp63l"><em>Camouflaged gun emplacement in Kansas from back in 1918, not sure if they still look like this</em></a></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>White City -- 34 minutes from Junction City</strong></p>
<p>A great deal of animal sacrifices occur here.  The baseball field is one of the sites. A local coven is responsible for much of the activity, which is interesting because <strong>Ft. Riley is not far away.</strong> One man who stumbled upon a ritual was tortured naked there.  On Halloween the White City area is tom up, but this is nothing compared to what the Satanic covens do that night in secret with their blood ritual and sacrifice. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Dunlap — 1 hour from Junction City</strong></p>
<p>People have been captured and taken to Dunlap for rituals by a group wearing Halloween masks. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Plymouth — 1 hour, 18 minutes from Junction City</strong></p>
<p>On the north side of I-50/hwy 57 is Plymouth, KS and the south side is the Cottonwood River with wooded area.  About 14 miles west of Emporia, and a half mile off l-50/hwy57, a Satanic group would build bonfires, and then conduct rituals.  Several of the coven’s men would be sent to the highway to tell people to steer clear of that area of road because the big brush pile burning was causing smoke. In Kansas a great deal 
of land and brush is burned during the year especially during summer, so the burning had a good cover story and kept people out of the area.  </p>
<p>Between two poles on the ground ritual victims were whipped and tortured with their arms outstretched on the ground during the ritual dates about once a month.   During the winter months, witnesses saw a big barn near there being used for what apparently were rituals.  A new highway is now being constructed over the area that was used for these open air rituals/bonfires. Obviously, another site is in use now. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Horton — 1 hour, 45 minutes to Junction City</strong></p>
<p>Just east of the Kickapoo Indian Reservation is Horton where a Satanic coven operates. (We\'ve seen <strong>connections to native Indians and Satanism before in ritual sites.)</strong> </p>

             Abilene — 26 minutes from Junction City
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Abilene, KS was the hometown of Eisenhower. There are numerous unknown things about Eisenhower, which indicate that Abilene has some strong Illuminati connections. Interestingly, just north of Abilene (Abilene lies just south of I-70) was a Satanic sacrifice site. To get to the site go just 2 miles north of 1-70, and then one mile west to a forested area which is near a creek and a pit. Within this forested area is a small clearing about 30' x 30' in the middle.
            <strong>
             Dismembered bodies were in abundance in the area, including children’s bones.
            </strong>
            Coyotes were carrying away human parts from the area.

            This tiny village lies west of Osage City, and north of Emporia.  A series of missile bases were built by the government in this county and abandoned.  A large missile base was located at Bushong and operated from 1957-64.  After it was abandoned, the people who owned the properly tried to keep out intruders, but nothing they did could keep out the intruders.  Witnesses who would try to check out what was being done within the
            <strong>
             underground tunnels and rooms
            </strong>
            would be scared off by cult people guarding the area.  Witnesses could see bonfires taking place within an airshaft.  Satanic symbols and 666 were written all over the site. 666 was written on the big entrance door to the underground installation. A 30' waterpit near the missile silo was part of the original missile base. It is suspected that bodies or parts may have been deposited down the water pit. It is speculated that the people who bought the property in recent times may be in the process of sanitizing the area of all evidence.
            <strong>
             There was a

            <strong>
             also at the site and at that gun emplacement a map was found with the following Kansas towns on it, Bushong, Junction City, Ft. Riley, Burlington, Burlingame, White City, and Plymouth.
            </strong>
            This is very interesting because
            <strong>
             those places have had independent verifications of Satanic activity.
            </strong>
            Most of the sites given in this newsletter on Kansas will relate to this Satanic cult's ritual sites which were in use in the early 1980's and which correspond to the towns shown on that map.

            <strong>
             this group has received police help, but it may go farther, the group’s power may well reach quite high.

            This is not a hierarchy group, but
            <strong>
             it can be speculated that they may work with the hierarchy.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A great deal of animal sacrifices occur here.  The baseball field is one of the sites. A local coven is responsible for much of the activity, which is interesting because
            <strong>
             Ft. Riley is not far away.
            </strong>
            One man who stumbled upon a ritual was tortured naked there.  On Halloween the White City area is tom up, but this is nothing compared to what the Satanic covens do that night in secret with their blood ritual and sacrifice.

            People have been captured and taken to Dunlap for rituals by a group wearing Halloween masks.

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            On the north side of I-50/hwy 57 is Plymouth, KS and the south side is the Cottonwood River with wooded area.  About 14 miles west of Emporia, and a half mile off l-50/hwy57, a Satanic group would build bonfires, and then conduct rituals.  Several of the coven’s men would be sent to the highway to tell people to steer clear of that area of road because the big brush pile burning was causing smoke. In Kansas a great deal 
of land and brush is burned during the year especially during summer, so the burning had a good cover story and kept people out of the area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Between two poles on the ground ritual victims were whipped and tortured with their arms outstretched on the ground during the ritual dates about once a month.   During the winter months, witnesses saw a big barn near there being used for what apparently were rituals.  A new highway is now being constructed over the area that was used for these open air rituals/bonfires. Obviously, another site is in use now.

             connections to native Indians and Satanism before in ritual sites.)

I just checked and while I still see some comments mentioning Brenda's name by Commoner, Dark Knight, and Soldieroflight, it appears Pgategirl may have deleted all of hers pertaining to the Jeriks?  I sent a few Jerik items to her yesterday in direct message.  That's probably best at this point, and she can post them if she wants to --

            <p>
             Interstate 70, which stretches across the U.S., running through Junction City from Colorado and heading toward Kansas City plays a large role in local sex trafficking.

             "It’s very, very easy to transport victims,” Peck said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Traffickers often take advantage of a military presence, such as here in Junction City
            </p>
            <p>
             "You’ll see disclaimers on there that state the ad is for companionship time only,” she said. “However, it’s really meaning they’re selling sexual services.”
            </p>
            <p>
             And when it comes to military, many ads will offer discounts to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It’s been here all along,” Peck said. “Its been here under our noses this whole time. We just had not known it because we didn’t know what it was and we didn’t know what to look for.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Children forced to leave their homes by their parents may be left with strong desires for affection, attention and acceptance. And they need a place to stay.

            <p>
             But a majority of patients treated by Peck and her colleagues have been adults.  A large misconception among society about adult victims is that adults can’t be trafficked as they “choose” such a lifestyle for money.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Peck, forced drug addiction often keeps adults from escaping their enslavement to traffickers, who will feed their drug addictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Traffickers, who are often female, will recruit young people to search for young victims at malls, over social media, and other places young people frequent.

             Some "elites" and secret society related history of Junction City, adjacent to the Fort Riley Military Reservation:

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Bartell House Hotel was built in 1880 as an elegant hotel and meeting place for "the elite."  It also reportedly housed performers from the
            <a href="http://archive.is/gb5ip">
             C.L. Hoover Opera House,
            </a>
            a two-minute walk away, which was built at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hotel's dedication included the governor and first lady, and "The owners had invited many guests from outside Junction City.  Railroad officials, newspaper editors, commercial travelers, Fort Riley officers, and representatives of state government attended the affair.  A special railroad car brought guests from Kansas City" (page 4*).
           </p>
           <p>
            The hotel was a
            <a href="https://archives.hud.gov/local/ks/goodstories/2009-02-02.cfm">
             regular meeting place for generals and VIPs' during WW II, including General Patton and Winston Churchill.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Famous guests of the Historic Bartell Hotel include:  Mr. Adolphus Busch, Sally Rand, Gene Tierney, John Phillip Sousa, W.C. Fields, Gloria Vanderbilt, Dan Dailey, and John Wayne.  In January 1872, Russian Grand Duke Alexis was feted with a dinner given by the townspeople, with Mayor Robert O. Rizer as host."

            In 1978 the hotel closed.  In 1980 several businesses were renting space on the ground floor and the upper floors of the hotel were closed off (pg. 7*).

            Junction City Police Detective Jeff Childs will retire to take a job as a teacher.

             Jeff Childs will bring an end to a 32-year career with the Junction City Police Department when he retires on October 1.

             Childs noted he also enjoys working with kids. “That became available so something I had to think about real fast, and it really was an easy decision. It was just time to move on and do something different.”

            The name was on the original post. I just went through every profile with that name and narrowed it down. When I asked the person that posted this, if it was her, she said it wasn't someone she reconized. I will look at the profile now. I missed the comment above.

            The name Crystal Harrison turned out to not be related to our research.
           </p>
           <p>
            At one point some people had thought the former Popingo video store, in Junction City that had sold CP, was still operating
            <a href="http://archive.is/blvqC">
             (it's not,)
            </a>
            and that it was owned by a person named Crystal Harrison.  There was a confusion with similar sounding addresses. 
 But, it turns out Ms. Harrison operates a completely different, unrelated Popingo video store, three hours from Junction City.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the comment you quoted,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Gothamgirl">
             @Gothamgirl
            </a>
            was asking
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Pgategirl">
             @Pgategirl
            </a>
            if she recognized a woman named Crystal Harrison and she replied no.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the (Junction City?) dentist, my spidey sense is tingling too.  Even though the top hats and canes stage backdrop, and possible stage magic themed recital name "Clarabels Magic 2017", look innocent to me, I got some bad goosebumps from some other things you mentioned.  Just a feeling.

            Found some guy called Coach Ray in pictures in both the facebook page for both Clarabel's and the dentist Rik Vande Riet.  I think that Esotericshade is right that there is a connection there.

            One photograph showing the backdrop was "photo credited" to the dentist's wife you mentioned, and the other to someone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't see the evidence that the dentist's wife painted the backdrop herself, (maybe because I'm not using Facebook), but if she did, I don't think it means anything.  Also it appears Clarabels Magic 2017 may be the name of a recital, with stage magic as the theme?
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't see any of the other things you mentioned, templar crosses, dark witchcraft symbols, references to well-traveled pediatric dental patients, etc.  Would you be able to take screenshots for those of us not on Facebook?

            For the normal people who encounter this information, it may seem incomprehensible - quite unbelievable - that parents would be involved in this fashion.
I would point out how Ian Watkins, from the group Lost Prophets, engaged sexually with infants who were readily offered up by their own mothers.

            Thank you to those that are responsible for this wonderful write up.  The work is only beginning.  Hopefully we can all work together to bring justice to Pgategirl and others who have suffered beyond comprehension.  Also I am hoping we will be able to discover who is behind all the horrid crimes they are committing and responsible for.

             Op has stated that the traffickers had "mob connections". Looking at the area around Junction City indicates known mafia stronghold Kansas City, MI to be nearby. The Civella Crime Family are the most likely suspects in terms of the "mafia connections".

             That was my mistake.  That Popingo's Video is indeed now out of business.  My apologies to Crystal Harrison and the store.  I had never heard of the chain and had mistakenly thought that they were a mom and pop business at the time.  The fact that both had "Grand" in the name might have confused me as well.  A dumb mistake and I am truly sorry to all involved.

             I thought I had read somewhere online that the Popingo in Junction City at Grandview Plaza was no longer in business.

              Edit to add:

              @Pgategirl

             Popingo video rental stores appear to be a multi-state chain, in KS, TX, and OK, at least.
            </p>
            <p>
             I noticed the one owned by Crystal Harrison in Parsons, posted in comments on the original thread such as with this link:

              http://archive.is/QwfwA

             --  is
             <strong>
              3 hours and 13 minutes
             </strong>
             from the dance studio.  It's on "Grand Avenue" so maybe people mistook that address for Grandview Plaza?
            </p>
            <p>
             That's why I didn't include it, I just don't see the connection.  But if I get new information that connects it I will add it.

             Thanks for heading us in the right direction.  Those two names will give us a head start as to where to look and also the Civella Family is another place to look.  We can try to connect them to Fort Riley base for starters.  We know that in the past and now as well that the Military bases have been complicit in committing rape and producing CP as well.  Good Luck everyone.

              I was wrong on the Popingo location as the Junction City location has closed down.  I don't want to libel an innocent woman so I just want everyone to know that there is no reason to suspect Crystal Harrison of anything.  My apologies to Crystal and anyone I might have confused with the link to the incorrect store.

            Amazing work. Those odd military deaths sound very close to whats happened @ Fort Hood this past year.
