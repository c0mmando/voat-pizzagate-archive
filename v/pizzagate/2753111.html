            Diane Feinstein: WITNESS....BLAST FROM THE PAST:
           </p>
           <p>
            THE BEGINNING OF A METEORIC POLITICAL CAREER:
"At the time, Feinstein was president of the Board of Supervisors and a confidante of Dan White, the ex-supervisor who quit his seat only to want it back. Moscone had plans to appoint someone else and told Feinstein the morning of the slayings. She tried to track down White to explain the decision. She never got the chance.
She was sitting at her desk at City Hall and tried speaking to White as he walked by. She did not know that he had just shot and killed the mayor.
"I saw him come in. I said, 'Dan, can I talk to you?' And he went by, and I heard the door close, and I heard the shots and smelled the cordite, and I came out of my office. Dan went right by me. Nobody was around, every door was closed.
"I went down the hall. I opened the wrong door. I opened (Milk's) door. I found Harvey on his stomach. I tried to get a pulse and put my finger through a bullet hole. He was clearly dead."
           </p>
           <p>
            ALIBI 
"On the day of the killings, Feinstein had just returned to City Hall after a three-week absence. She had gone on vacation to the Himalayas with Richard Blum, the man whom she would later marry (m. 1980), and had contracted dysentery. She then spent time at home recovering from the infection and an allergic reaction to antibiotics."  Blum founded American Himalayan Foundation. One of its missions involves discouraging CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING in NEPAL. Feinstein's second husband, Dr. Bertram Feinstein (m. 1962), had recently died of cancer in 1978. He was a NEUROSURGEON.

            "Dr Geoffrey Bourne worked at the CIA before becoming Yerkes' director for 26 years until his death. He had advocated development of beings with both a human and nonhuman primate as parents. At the CIA he had led a secret program to create brainwashed assassins. It is the belief of many that Robert Ludlum’s Bourne Identity, made into a movie,was based on his work.
Bourne wrote nonfiction books such as The Ape People.

            Jim Jones and San Francisco politicians:
           </p>
           <p>
            "An African American, Jimmy believed that if he hadn't been adopted by Jim Jones, his life would likely have been one of drugs or poverty or crime. In this way, his story reflects that of his father's followers. The majority of people who joined Jones's Peoples Temple were also poor or working class and black, from deteriorating neighborhoods and broken families, their lives taken over by a man offering a better way of life."
            <a href="https://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/my-name-jim-jones">
             https://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/my-name-jim-jones
            </a>
            "He began life in Indiana as Larry Allen Knox, born in 1960 to a 14-year-old girl who put him in an orphanage. Ten weeks later, a white minister and his wife, Marceline, adopted him and gave him his new father's name: He would be James Warren Jones Jr."
           </p>
           <p>
            "While Jimmy was playing ball and going to movies, his father was courting the San Francisco power structure. Jim Jones was like a ward boss; when people were needed at demonstrations or for election work, he could deliver them by the busload. In return, he pushed for a political post, and in 1976, mayor George Moscone named him to the San Francisco Housing Authority. Jones quickly became chairman, and, packed with his supporters, the meetings became more like rallies. There were other good photo ops, too, when prominent Democrats or activists such as Moscone, then state assemblyman Willie Brown, then governor Jerry Brown, Angela Davis, and Jane Fonda visited the Temple.
           </p>
           <p>
            A hypochondriac to begin with, Jones was already taking fistfuls of medication: painkillers, barbiturates, amphetamines, which accentuated his feelings of paranoia, his tendency to self-aggrandizement. Whether seduced by power or by a genuine belief in his vision, the members of his inner circle—all Caucasian—overlooked or hid his weaknesses, collaborated in his deceptions. And, even as he sat with Moscone or Willie Brown, Jones was preparing to move his congregation again. As early as 1974, an advance group was clearing land and building cabins on the 3,824 acres of land that Jones had leased in the far north of Guyana."

            JIM AND DIANE
Fascinating thread concerning Diane Feinstein’s ties to Jim Jones &amp; the People’s Temple. Interesting, why was she never investigated for this plus for her Chinese spy? Does holding office give you a free pass to break the law?

            accepted a private tour of the People's Temple and voted to both honor Jim Jones with a board resolution and approve Jones's appointment to head SF's Housing Authority.
10. The appointment to the SF Housing Authority is significant. It permitted Jones to stack the Housing Authority by placing People's Temple Members on government payroll increasing the funds available to the People''s Temple.
But that was a debt politicos like

"Feinstein, who has possession of White's diary, said his writings revealed a troubled man.
"It does show somebody who has a psychopathology, probably as a true manic-depressive in a clinical sense," she said.
At the time of his trial, White's defense attorney claimed his client was mentally unstable and persuaded the jury to convict him of manslaughter, not murder, in the deaths of Moscone and Milk - a verdict that set off riots in which police cars were torched and windows at City Hall were smashed. He served a sentence of just over five years."

            "On July 27, 2018, reports surfaced that a Chinese staff member who worked as Feinstein's personal driver, gofer and liaison to the Asian-American community for 20 years, was caught reporting to China's Ministry of State Security.[77][78] According to the reports, Feinstein was contacted by the FBI five years ago warning her about the suspected employee. The employee was later interviewed by authorities and forced to retire by Feinstein.[79] No criminal charges were filed against the individual.[77]"

            Yup, we speculated on why they created that movement. Here's why!
           </p>
           <p>
            Controlled opposition. First, there were REAL victims. Then chief MK Ultra Sex Kitten Handler Alyssa Milano just came up with the idea for the Me Too movement while powdering her nipples. There wasn't an army of strategic planners -- it just POPPED into her brainwashed head. Next thing you know, women who didn't have the car door held open for them were counted as victims. Of what? Their stupidity?
           </p>
           <p>
            Alyssa Milano was the handler for Corey Haim, remember. She's being paid back by being given great cosmetic surgery and oodles of attention. Nonetheless, she admits she suffers from panic attacks that are probably nothing more then her conscience trying to get her to stop being a whore.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the accuser, what's there to think about. Another day, another whore.

            <p>
             I feel bad for all these people I know who say they are victims of sexual abuse on FB, but they have all been fully triggered and just keep posting these "I BELIEVE SURVIVORS" and "IF YOU ARE NOT A VICTIM YOUR OPINION DOES NOT MATTER" memes... just insane logical fallacies
            </p>
            <p>
             it concerns me that these people would even think to post such stupid shit publicly, but like I said they are just completely triggered... #MeToo seems like it accomplished it's goal

              Tried to upvoat you, but, of course, this post has been deleted for some weird reason.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Triggered" is the perfect word. And the thing is, why would anyone want to think of themselves as victims? Yes, I know, if you're assaulted or taken advantage of in some way, it's usually one complete asshole that preyed upon you. But the person is NOT a victim. They were victimized. Let me use n analogy. You're at the grocery store. You buy milk, butter, and eggs, and give the cashier a $100 bill, and she gives you your change. It isn't until you get home that you see she's short-changed you and given you change for a $20. Most people, go "Holy shit! That stupid bitch shortchanged me!" and either run down to the grocery store and get their money back, or get on with their lives. They don't start thinking, "OH, MY GOD!!!! I'M A VICTIM!!! EVERY CASHIER THAT WORKS IN THE GROCERY STORE IS OUT TO GET ME!" Nor do they band with other customers who experienced the same problem.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know that physical assault is way more catastrophic, but it's the mindset I'm talking about. And the dems have done this beautifully to the African-Americans to keep them down. Yes, there is racism, but there is blaming for your lot in life because you believed a lie.

            All the Kavanaugh shit is only happening because they don't want such a comparatively young person in such a powerful position.
He's not one of theirs so he'll inevitably wind up throwing multiple spanners in their works on a somewhat regular basis for years and decades to come.
