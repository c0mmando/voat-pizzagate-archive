<p>&quot;The Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal was a case of child sexual abuses involving a number of children and employees at Casa Pia, a Portuguese state-run institution for the education and support of poor children and under-age orphans.[1] Portuguese Judiciary Police (Polícia Judiciária) officials estimate that more than 100 boys and girls[1] of the 4,600 pupils enrolled in Casa Pia at the time, including some deaf and mute, may have been sexually abused throughout several decades. The scandal involved several prominent men, including TV presenter Carlos Cruz, former Casa Pia governor Manuel Abrantes, and former UNESCO ambassador Jorge Ritto.[2] The trial is one of the longest running in Portuguese history, lasting more than five years, with testimony from more than 800 witnesses and experts.[3]&quot;</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://archive.is/o669l#">Daily Mail</a>: &quot;Instead, arriving at Casa Pia (House of the Pious), a 17th century Lisbon orphanage where more than 4,000 children are cared for each year behind high stone walls, the doctor would summon selected boys and girls from their beds for examinations one night each week.Where possible, he chose deaf-mutes. After checking that the children were not suffering from any sexual infections, the doctor was joined by the orphanage caretaker, known as Bibi, who ushered the unfortunate children outside to a waiting van. With the doctor following in his red Ferrari, Bibi drove the van to the prestigious homes of some of the leading members of Lisbon society - ranging from Portuguese government ministers and high-ranking diplomats, to famous television stars and members of the judiciary..</p>
<p>There, the children were repeatedly sexually abused. Some were allegedly drugged to make them compliant; others were plied with alcohol.
This continued for years. Assaults were filmed; pictures of one attack were subsequently found at the home of a suspected paedophile in Paris.</p>
<p>According to medical records, the victims\' injuries were horrific - and consistent with serious sexual assault and rape. In witness statements, many were able to describe in minute detail the homes where they were taken and identifying marks on the bodies of their abusers.
The existence of this so-called &quot;magic circle&quot; of the Portuguese establishment, allegedly involved in an international paedophile ring using boys and girls from Casa Pia, was last week likened to an earthquake waiting to shake Portugal to its foundations&quot;.</p>
<p>On 3 September 2010, Carlos Cruz, Carlos Silvino, Hugo Marçal, Manuel Abrantes, Ferreira Diniz and Jorge Ritto were convicted and sentenced to up to eighteen years in prison due to crimes occurring in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was the first time an institutional sex abuse scandal had been taken to court in Portugal.&quot;</p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>As if a UNESCO ambassador being convicted in an elite pedophile ring wasn\'t enough, there has been <a href="http://archive.is/58n7b">speculation</a> that Ritto was linked to Marc Dutroux. And let\'s not forget the Podesta trips to Portugal, AND the entire Maddy McCann saga. </p>
<p>......</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/miZFM">Carlos Cruz, faoums TV presenter, convicted</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Dm4FK">Convictions took six years</a></p>
<p>&quot;The trial, in Lisbon\'s top criminal court, is thought to be the largest ever undertaken by Portugal\'s court system. Over five and half years, more than 800 witnesses, including 32 alleged victims, gave evidence detailing how a paedophile ring used the orphanages to source children for wealthy and influential clients. The sentencing document alone, of which judges spent most of yesterday reading a summary, runs to 2,000 pages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;for an elite paedophile ring, which included a former ambassador and a prominent television celebrity, Casa Pia orphanages were something entirely different. They were supermarkets stocked with children to abuse.&quot;</p>',

From my experience, the shitty things that have happened to me (probably paying off karma) always ended up becoming a positive. I'm in a wheelchair from the fall, but I wouldn't trade it to be able to walk yet not have this NDE under my belt.  Unquote

            it is odd and I guess you have to be more deeply involved in behavioral observation to even have a solid opinion.
However my spouse objects still when I point our milky skies and note that there are still planes out spraying and that we are under it.
Took a long time, but finally acknowledged they're real, but still doesn't like the day ruined by my mentioning it.  Very odd, imo.
Perhaps it because the problems are truly so immense they can't imagine tackling them?
           </p>
           <p>
            The only person I'm aware of who attacked Freud was Betty Friend who, they say, "unlaced women from him and dumped him in
the garbage can."  Others observed that she was able to challenge him because she was not trained actually in the rudiments
of psychiatry.  As I see our system of medicine operate, it seems that doctors are highly intimidated by Big Pharma and by general
opinions of the profession which make no sense.  For instance, ophthalmologists will still refuse patients prescriptions for marijuana
to treat glaucoma.  But there are many other examples.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of the Oedipus Complex, I see it the same way that our Constitution goes unchallenged -- 
and I've repeated this often ... but we need people talking about it.
            <br/>
            Neither teachers nor media ever offer any challenge to either.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Founders created an Elite Patriarchy while proclaiming "all are created equal" and they endowed
them with land grants, immense influence and control over our nation's wealth, natural resources and
animal-life.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Founders protected the system of Slavery for Elites even down to the "Runaway Slave Act" and
into another 100 years of Segregation.  This guaranteed the Civil War which also benefited Elites/wealthy
by disuniting the nation into two camps of hatred which still echoes even today.
And, also quite reminiscent of what we are seeing today in the effort to destroy a generation of youth, the 
native American genocide was also accomplished by kidnapping their children and moving them into 
government "church schools" run by the Catholic Church and the Mormon Church.
            <br/>
            These children were not permitted to speak in their own language, their hair and clothing was changed.
They never saw their parents again.  And, they were beaten, hung, murdered and abused in every way
including sexually.
           </p>
           <p>
            Agree with all your comments and Walt Disney was I learned as right wing as General Electric.
Recently in reading "The Devil's Disciple"/Allen Dulles I learned that Dulles had a lot of influence over
Walt Disney, including suggestions about what animated films he would make and some of the details 
of the plots.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, yes, there always seems to be mystery and intrigue connected to bazaars, amusement parks and often
you see this in films.
           </p>
           <p>
            One particular thing that I've always detested about TV and Sit-coms, especially -- now in movies as well -- 
is putting adult words and vocabulary into the mouths of young children.
If you see even old video of "Father Knows Best" or "Leave it to Beaver" or "Opie" you can see that it would
make ordinary children feel that they aren't really very smart.  And perhaps their parents, either!
Then it moved to "wise-cracking" and "one-liners."  And now including suggestive/smutty comments.

            Let me say that I certainly did hear you say that you had a fall and that you are in a wheelchair which is very sad.
Indeed.  If you're up to any more discussion on this subject of "god" in the sky, I'm listening.
I'd suggest however that you not use the Bible as it has no validity.
            <br/>
            It's a very violent book which is best used as an example of what "god" shouldn't be about or should not be saying or doing.

            It is a healthy reaction --- but when it results in walking away from the issue as many do, then it works as a force to stop
investigations and to stop public knowledge.  That is it's purpose.
Children telling a story of sexual abuse by males in their lives -- fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- may have always
been somewhat difficult for the public to totally believe and support, especially when all the perpetrators were male.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freud's lies to the public in the Oedipus Complex was also a betrayal of his own young patients (both male and female) who
had confided in him their sexual abuse by male relatives and male friends of the family.
Freud's argument in the Oedipus Complex was outrageous of course and relied on convincing the public of the grotesque
and glaring lie that it is infants and toddlers and young children who are the sexual aggressors against adult males in their families.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the public couldn't figure out that lie, try coupling it with Satan Ritual Abuse .... where children in the McMartin case tried to 
explain being whisked away into the mountains nearby and onto a plane and taken to Disneyland where Satanic Rituals took
place.  And, especially when this Satanic abuse is linked to religion/church.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can also probably look to RCC's "inquisitions" which would have produced a great deal of information
early on about torture, multiple personalities, fear, mind control .... where new precedents of violence were 
used and records were kept and studied.

            Satan and the Devil and these violent ritual acts rather than being about spirituality are used to frighten the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOOK at how many here can't even view pizzagate material without so frightened that it manifests in physical ways.
That's the purpose of it -- but along with the claim that this violence has something to do with a "god" in the sky.
            <br/>
            Like telling the public that the government needs their sons to fight for "god and country."
No -- our government is not our country.  Nor is "god" directing anyone to war.  That is insanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the same reason that our government was practicing TORTURE at Abu Ghraib.
           </p>
           <p>
            It had little to do with the prisoners there but serves as a threat to the rest of us.
Rather it had to do with making the world more frightened of the US -- and to serve as a warning to US citizens that they may be next.
           </p>
           <p>
            No dictatorship can be run without torture.
All fear is mind control.

            The Bible is contradictory nonsense written by men -- with a warning not to change the writings which were very definitely changed.
It's one of the most violent books ever written, with a "god" modeled on warrior Roman Emperor types.
The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.  The New Testament was written to present "Jesus" as in rebellion against this
oppression of women and the overturning of women.  Joseph's history is actually Mary's lineage, reversed to uplift him.
"Jesus" is a character which has been presented many more than dozens of times with different names, all with the same identical background.
The Old World Religion contained no Satan and no Devil - no boogey men to frighten the citizens.  No heaven and no hell.
Thousands of years later, male-supremacist religion (which underpins patriarchy) presented us with their invention of Satan and the Devil
which are part of the delusion and paranoia and violence of the thinking of these elite males.
And, thus began their act as middle-men to "god" -- and also their presentation to the world of an all-male hierarchy and authority within the church.
Further, the only way that "Christianity" moved around the world was by violence -- "Introducing the cross with the sword."
Does nothing about all of that smell wrong to you?

            Wow! Kudos to 9217! When it comes to red pilling the emus with their heads burried in sand this shoud be the go to source along with Dutreux case. Jorge Ritto linked to Mark Dutroux certainly fits the puzzle. A nail in the coffin to the fake news meme. It is no longer a conspieacy - 2016 Nov, Operation Dark Room and now Casa Pia, along with Dutreux Case (Operation Othelo cover up). Convictions made, sentensea handed out - global pedophile network is a dark reality. Time to take the red pillong to a new level! I will share this info everywhere. Time to double down. Casa Pia - add it to your arsenal! Are you seeing this Megyn Kelly - you disaster of a human being?

            People right at the top tried and convicted for the most horrific of crimes against innocent children and yet you bring up Pizzagate and you're labelled a crazy. How much of this shit, in how many different countries, do the public need to see before they'll believe it?

             Well now we can shove Casa Pia down their throat along with Duteux, McMartin &amp; Franklin! We have the Dr.Phill Episode &amp; Conspiracy of Silence, along with instagram photos of babies with #hoetard next to them. And what do they have - fake news meme that thanks to Trump (intentional?) it fires back at them like a boomerang. Neil Wolfe is planning a world wide march in July. We are comming for these monsters.

            Assigning this to the work of a Devil suggests that human's aren't capable of criminal acts.  They are.

            The fact that the doctor checked the children for STDs before allowing them to be sexually assaulted by these elites just goes to show that not only can they do whatever they want with these poor children, but the elite are also protected from acquiring STDs. Unbelievable.
