<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. —
Four members of a New Mexico paramilitary religious sect rocked by child sexual abuse allegations were arrested while trying to flee the state in two vans full of children, authorities said Thursday.</p>
<p>Cibola County Sheriff Tony Mace confirmed to The Associated Press that the four members of the Aggressive Christianity Missions Training Corps were arrested late Wednesday as deputies tried to execute a court order to pick up the children for interviews from the group\'s isolated compound in western New Mexico.
Arrest warrants had been issued for the four taken into custody. They were arrested late Wednesday on felony warrants for failure to register the births of their 11 children.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;nside the vans were seven children, around $1,000 in cash, luggage and road maps, Mace said. &quot;Basically, you could tell they were getting ready to bug out and leave the area,&quot; Mace said. &quot;I believe that\'s in an effort to try to conceal the kids from us.&quot;</p>
<p>Mace said the children, believed to be ages 4-17, were turned over to the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department. Investigators believe the vans may have been headed to a location in Colorado&quot;
&quot;The arrests came four days after authorities raided the group\'s Fence Lake compound and arrested sect co-leader Deborah Green and two other group members in connection with a child abuse investigation. Another person was arrested in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico.&quot;
&quot;This week, a judge ordered Deborah Green held on a $500,000 secured bond on charges that included failure to report the birth, child abuse and sexual penetration of a minor.</p>
<p>Sect member Peter Green, also known as Mike Brandon, also was being held on a $5 million secured bond and faces 100 counts of sexual penetration of a child after being accused of raping a girl at least four times a week from the time she was 7, according to court documents.&quot;</p>

<p>Possible Child Trafficking : </p>
<p>&quot;Deborah sexually assaulted her daughter\'s 5-year-old girl who they believe was smuggled in from Uganda as a baby with forged documents.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;child sexual abuse say they looking into whether the New Mexico group brought children into the country illegally. Former group members say leaders kept them and the children living at sect\'s compound in &quot;slavery.&quot;</p>
<p>Cibola County Sheriff Tony Mace told The Associated Press Tuesday that investigators found numerous children during a Sunday raid of the armed Aggressive Christianity Missions Training Corps in remote Fence Lake.</p>
<p>Exactly where the children came from is unknown because the sect apparently kept members from reporting births to state officials, Mace said. A former sect member says the group illegally brought at least one child to the United States from one of its foreign missions, which according to its website were operated in Africa, India and the Philippines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;It was slavery,&quot; said 50-year-old Julie Gudino, 50, a sect member from 1984-2004. &quot;(Deborah Green) told me, \'God was angry at you,\' and she made me pull weeds, move rocks and do all kinds of physical work for punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>Gudino said Green kept her 8-year-old son and threatened him harm if she didn\'t complete her chores and later learned that sect members had physically abused the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;They hit him over the head with a board,&quot; she said. &quot;It gave him a gash.&quot;</p>
<p>Former follower Maura Alana Schmierer said she was forced to live in a shed with no toilet and with little food. She eventually escaped and successfully sued the sect in California before leaders relocated to New Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;I\'m so glad (Deborah) Green is in jail where she belongs,&quot; said Carla Dechant Behr, whose brother Chris Dechant was a sect member who died at the compound in 2013. &quot;All they have done is break up families and cause pain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Sheriff\'s Office also charged Deborah with sexual assault of a minor and child abuse. Investigators say in 2001, Deborah sexually assaulted her daughter\'s 5-year-old girl who they believe was smuggled in from Uganda as a baby with forged documents.</p>
<p>That girl spoke told investigators she was treated like a slave and routinely whipped. She also told them Deborah\'s son-in-law Peter Green also raped her until she was 9-years-old. That\'s when investigators say the Children, Youth, and Families Department finally removed her from the home. Peter is now charged with 100 counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor.</p>
<p>\'Knowing that these individuals are in custody now... it\'s a heavy weight off of my shoulders,&quot; said Mace.</p>
<p>A fourth person was also arrested Sunday. Joshua Green is charged with not reporting the birth of his son to the state. Investigators say none of the group\'s members ever got their kids birth certificates because Green allegedly wanted to hide the children from police and CYFD.</p>
<p>The Sheriff\'s Office says there\'s about 18 children still living in the commune, but they did not see any other evidence of abuse or neglect.&quot;</p>

            Notice they use the name Green.  Could we be seeing MKUltra happening? The article says the guy has another name besides Green.  Dr. Green, Mr. Green are used often to train kids in MKUltra.

             ABSTRACT
Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near ½ Hz or 2.4 Hz, such as to excite a sensory resonance. Many computer monitors and TV tubes, when displaying pulsed images, emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation. It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or TV set. For the latter, the image pulsing may be imbedded in the program material, or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream, either as an RF signal or as a video signal. The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program. For certain monitors, pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity.

             "The observed effects include ptosis of the eyelids, relaxation, drowziness, the feeling of pressure at a centered spot on the lower edge of the brow, seeing moving patterns of dark purple and greenish yellow with the eyes closed, a tonic smile, a tense feeling in the stomach, sudden loose stool, and sexual excitement, depending on the precise frequency used, and the skin area to which the field is applied. The sharp frequency dependence suggests involvement of a resonance mechanism."

             "it opens a way for mischievous application of the invention, whereby people are exposed unknowingly to manipulation of their nervous systems for someone else's purposes. Such application would be unethical and is of course not advocated. It is mentioned here in order to alert the public to the possibility of covert abuse that may occur while being online, or while watching TV, a video, or a DVD."
