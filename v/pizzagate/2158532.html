           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Award-winning CNN anchor Anderson Cooper will host, and Founder Sir Elton John and Chairman David Furnish will pay tribute to several esteemed philanthropists by presenting EJAF’s Enduring Vision Awards to long-time supporters Robert Kraft, Diana Jenkins, and Joseph Blount.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bob Kraft has been a loyal and generous supporter of the Foundation for many years, both personally and through the Robert and Myra Kraft Family Foundation. As Chairman, CEO, and Founder of Neuro, and as a private philanthropist, Diana Jenkins has been a wonderful patron EJAF’s work and events in the U.S. and in the U.K. Likewise, Joseph Blount has also been an ardent benefactor to the Foundation since its inception.

            It's safe to discount anything sourced from neonnettle unless corroborated elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's interesting to see so many defend themselves with tales of being molested as a child.  Statistically it is relevant, but specifically in an adult, completely irrelevant.  Psychological imprinting is powerful, but drives only circumvent rational when allowed.  The facts still remains that they've made a reasoned choice to step widely outside of societal conventions and become a predator of its most cherished and vulnerable.  Thus, for society's integrity they must be removed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's sad to see so many lenient sentences meted out to those who hold power.  I wish more would cause an outcry.  This too shakes society's integrity by making a mockery of the tenets of justice.

             The neonnettle article of Downey's supposed expose has been deleted. His attorney probably threatened to sue... He never came out with that info. An anonymous source who many GUESSED might be him, posted that info through a gossip site SUPPOSEDLY written by an entertainment lawyer whose moniker is Enty. The source, rumored to be Downey, goes by the name of Himmmmm.

             Regardless, we know pedophelia and Luciferianism is more than rampant in Hollywood. And your points are well taken and must be kept in mind. Being a victim, tragic as that is, does not give one permission to do unto others as was done onto them.

              ahhh, thanks for the reminder.  I had completely forgotten about those blog posts which had been attributed to Downey.  That was quite some time ago.  For anyone not familiar, here's
              <a href="https://jezebel.com/5892565/is-robert-downey-jr-spreading-insider-celeb-gossip-on-blogs">
               an article on Jezebel
              </a>
              giving an overview.  I never was really convinced that he was the author.  It just didn't read as something he had penned.

              Hollywood is without a doubt wholly corrupted and a driving force towards the normalization of pedophilia, as well as other aberrations to demoralize the individual, and destroy the traditional family.

              I've been following this trail for nearly 20 years now.  I've amassed a staggering amount of data, much of which has been posted here.  I've come to the sad conclusion that people just don't want to face the truth.  Much as Barbara Bush once quipped, "So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?", people don't wish to even consider such a reality as has been very obviously revealed.  It is painful, and there is a sense of hopelessness, but it should inflame and incite towards action.  Yet, we cling to the thin thread of hope that they are just unconnected anomalies and that each one will be the last.  Even the outrage and public demonstrations sparked in Belgium with the Dutroux Affair were quelled by tossing a few low-level operators into the fire, while never addressing the culpability of those who betrayed public trust in higher office.  I don't know what it is going to take, but there is little to do but continue until that point is reached.

               Exactly right. On a walk I needed today in order to clear my heart and mind of all this I came to the sad conclusion that most people want to pretend everything is okay and that this stuff doesn't happen. They don't want to face it. But there's a price for that, and the cost will be that in not confronting it and subsequently forcing it to stop, it will devour all of us.

              Never actually was RDJ. Could have been someone he knew and used his name with an OK knowing he'd publicly have to deny it or kill his career. Can't say you support Trump at all and not risk losing work in the super competitive world that is entertainment. Expanded version of the article above was printed in full on LSA along with a lot of other tales and on Jezebel. It's rumored to actually have been written by 2 men who are from old, old Hollywood families and thus know what's going on in Hollywood. Main purpose is to illustrate pedo behavior by parents/guardians of child stars. Also how willing they are to sell their kids for $$$ and fame.  That's why "stage mother" has such bad vibes. Parents who see their kids as a paycheck started at the very, very beginning of Hollywood. Note what happened to MichaelJackson.

               Agreed on all accounts. Every time a Himmmm thread aired on Enty's and other sites, they got a lot of attention but... no results. Nobody took up the gauntlet to investigate. Instead, they just stood around the car wreck and stared from the safety of the sidewalk. Any time I spoke out, about that or the threads regarding director Brian Singer being a pedo, I got shouted down. Finally, I gave up and left. If we can break through that solid wall of cognitive dissonance protected by the red carpet, we could make real progress.

                 You remind me of the time tee-totaler Gene Simmons (Kiss) accidentally ate a cannabis brownie. He freaked out and called drummer Peter Criss, told him that he (Gene) kept morphing when he looked into the mirror. Criss told Gene "Relax Gene, you're just high."  You gonna be alright?

                      True enough. Lol. It's just mind blowing really after hearing all the stories from the Christian Right growing up, no mind you I grew up in the 90s but I herd the tales of what they used to label KISS as. Now that I'm thinking about it, maybe that's why Gene knew how to market the band, to piss off the right people to get as popular as possible. FFS one of their songs is "God Gave Rock and Roll To You"
