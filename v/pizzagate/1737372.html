<p>Lee Fang has 77K followers. The Intercept boys have been silent about pizzagate, so this tweet was a little surprising. Although it\'s not all that risky since the article he refers to is anti-Trump rather than anti-establishment  (which, one can assume, is the same reason Washington Post is reporting on it whilst they <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1485395">deleted the article about Podesta\'s art collection</a>).</p>
<p>He links to this article: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/labor-nominee-acosta-cut-deal-with-billionaire-in-sex-abuse-case-involving-40-underage-girls/2017/03/21/d33271a8-0d85-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html?utm_term=.c5784c1f7a05">Labor nominee Acosta cut deal with billionaire guilty in sex abuse case</a> </p>

<p>Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17.

            There is NO chance that Trump doesn't know this, so I can't figure out the angle, yet. Perhaps he never intended the guy to be approved, just get the pizzagate questions to the guy in front of the public - and the Congressional perps.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: ANY time the phrase "pizzagate" is used, it's ALL good.  Spread the word, the truth will come out.

            With out addressing the validity or implication of the story. I believe we can expect to see a lot more about this. Simply because it's basic Sun Tzu tactics. Find your enemies strength and make it his weakness. With Trump's strong stand on child trafficking, if the left can tie Trump to child molesters then his whole agenda loses credibility and support. His enemies hate him, if he fails this test his supporters will hate him as well. So far this is his most serious political threat.

            It feels good. Like controlled oppositionlike. When one plays 4D chess mere mortals have to watch and learn. He's not a god and that's the great thing. He's a flawed man. As in the definition of mankind is : flawed. Anything else is ridiculous Mk. Not a politician is immensely satisfying. A layered perversion like this SRA from the highest towers to the deepest gutters is silly to buy into nattering nabobs of negativity. Get real. Get this rabbit outta the hole is the miracle to work towards. Measured by personal moments is simply unrealistic.

            I am satisfied that Trump wont do anything about Pedophilia.  The arrest are just for political cover.  Trump has major deep state help in getting here in the first place.  Now his Pepe the Frog Eye of Horus hand signals make sense.  Trump is just a different side of the Illuminati coin we are fighting.

              he needs to take out the podestas and clintons for his self preservation. Beyond that e could cut a deal with the Rothschilds to limit the number of tentacles he chops off. He is nearly at the point where he can persuade the rothschilds that its becoming a necessity to do something about the level of exposure

            Lee Fang is a very good writer.  Even though some may not agree with his politics, this is a really big deal for him to bring this out into the open. "Pizzagate Person" needs to be tweeted more often.

             He and i have the same politics, I believe. But I have to call the journalists at Intercept out for totally sidestepping anything to do with pizzagate all this time. I do wish they would use "pizzagate person" when it refers to the folks involved in the Podesta emails, and not just mimic the MSM with an anti Trump bias that leaves their journalistic integrity in question.

              I personally think they are all either involved as pedos (MSM) or they know if they come out with the truth they will be ruined and never be able to even fight for their right to publish the truth. This is the first time in my life in this country that I have been afraid that we will not be able to find the truth anymore. There have always been those that were willing to hide the truth when reporting the news, but now I find that  even the ones I have trusted are afraid to step forward.  I hope for our good, that this will change.  But only if we demand it.  Many are too asleep to fight.
