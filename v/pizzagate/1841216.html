<blockquote>
<p>WOONSOCKET, R.I. — A 52-year-old father and his 23-year-old son, each of whom had once been active with the Boy Scouts, were arrested Friday on child pornography charges, according to state police spokeswoman Laura Meade Kirk.</p>
<p>Arthur O. Pare, 52, of 90 Laurier St., Woonsocket, was charged with possession and transfer of child pornography. His son, Nicholas M. Pare, 23, also of 90 Laurier St., Woonsocket, was charged with possession of child pornography.</p>
<p>As part of an investigation into child pornography being shared over the Internet, the State Police identified the Internet connection at 90 Laurier St. as the source and obtained a warrant to search the premises. Investigators found digital storage media belonging to each man that the police said contained child pornography. They also seized 40 other digital storage media for further analysis.</p>
<p>The two were arraigned Friday in District Court, Providence, and released on personal recognizance, with special bail conditions of no internet use and no contact with minors.</p>
<p>The father was Cub Master of Cub Scout Pack 6 in Woonsocket from 2002 to 2004 and Assistant Scout Master of Boy Scout Troop 6 from 2006 to 2014.</p>
<p>The son was a youth member from 2000 to 2012, becoming an Eagle Scout, the Boy Scouts’ highest rank, in 2009. In 2012, he was Assistant Scout Master of Troop 6.....&quot;</p>

             A good way for parents to avoid this on trips is to volunteer to come along.  If parents insisted on helping out and going with their child we would have a lot less of these.  Boy Scouts and Girls Scouts are not baby sitter clubs.  They should include participating parents.  When a troupe has uninterested and univolved parents, it is an open invitation for someone to pick up and notice.  They are infiltrating because no one is watching.More  parents should be Troupe Leaders.  Maybe that should be a rule.

               I believe they created our economic situations to separate us from our children.  Mothers work full time, and Mothers AND Fathers are Overworked.  Less time to watch over their children.  More time for pedophiles to watch our children.  Not good.
