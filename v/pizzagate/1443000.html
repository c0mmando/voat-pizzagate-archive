<p>Well i just found this by accident: [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8iZe_SxiFs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8iZe_SxiFs</a>]
(uploaded 22.11.2015, don\'t know when it aired though)</p>
<p>It\'s a recording of a relatively popular german late night show called &quot;Domian&quot; (also the hosts name),
where people can call him to talk about their personal problems so on and so forth.
In this video he talks to a women (Monika,57) who claims she was part of some kind of &quot;child torture cult&quot; 11 years ago and she still gets threatened by those people up to the point where she wouldn\'t dare to contact the police.</p>
<p>She says that this cult &quot;hires&quot; women to give birth to as many children as possible, so they can offer complete domination over the children to the members.
(Which includes child rape, torture, brainwashing, etc) 
She also describes the regular meetings, which took place in a forest for example, where the members were wearing Robes, gathered around a fire
and where toddlers and children up to 6 years of age were &quot;trained&quot;. She says there were always between 1 and 6 kids present.
They had to complete specific &quot;tasks&quot;, which if not completed, would get them punished.
She describes children being raped, whipped, BURNT with fire.
If they cried or tried to to fight back, the punishment would be &quot;even harder&quot;, ranging up to DEATH
She also states how child sacrifices took place to warn the other children, but that she believes &quot;they were fake&quot; after her therapy.
She claims to be abused and raped herself btw.</p>
<p>When asked how many people were part of that cult, she said that her group consists of &quot;about 20 people&quot; (&quot;her group&quot; indicating that they are only a part of a bigger thing...)</p>
<p>She can\'t remember the cult\'s name, can\'t remember certain information, but she seems pretty fucking disturbed to me if i\'m honest and it looks more like PTSD or something rather than lies.
She could be making this up, this is by no means clear evidence, but the stuff she described seems pretty identical to the claims of all those other victims.</p>
<p>In the past weeks of following #pizzagate actively, and more and more connections and hints coming up every day, i was surprised that nothing indicated connections to germany, considering our government is pretty influential and closely tied with the US, GB, Saudi Arabia etc and giving millions to the C.F. during the election.</p>
<p>There is this guy for example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Edathy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Edathy</a>
Ex-Member of the German Federal Parliament, he was in court for possessing CP, but wasn\'t convicted (surprise surprise).
Backgroundcheck maybe ?</p>
<p>I don\'t know if this helps in any way, but i hope you can use it somehow.</p>
<p>good luck guys</p>',
