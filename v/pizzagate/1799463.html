            This is just a note of caution because the Left loves to turn any argument that the Irish were in many cases

            into proof of white supremacy. It's not at all but just be aware of what could be coming.

            The Irish are not only NOT white supremacists they probably made the difference in securing a Northern victory when the Union Army's chips were down. Some Irish immigrants landing in New York City were walked right from the ships they arrived in onto troop transports headed to basic training in DC, all made possible by their newly minted citizenship papers.

            And to any Deep State lurkers if you cowards don't surrender soon it'll be the legions of pissed off Irishmen recently shat out the bottom of the Middle Class who will probably be the first to form militias if it ever comes to it. The rest will following in short order. The Irish can at times be inflicted with profound anger the likes of which I don't think you can imagine. It's kinda related to the alcohol thing, long story. Just a little word of advice. If you're doubting whether or not a few militias might break into the Beltway from all sides and kill any Deep Stater twice.......well you can figure out the rest.
