   So when exactly did Sy Hersh see this FBI report stating that Seth was in fact the leaker? What part did Comey play in this report and was he at least aware of its existence?

           <p>
            I agree there is a school Play at work here. I first posted School Play months ago and was hammered for suggesting it. School Plays often involve real deaths though and I see that as a real possibility. The School Play part is the set up and casting of the actors such as Joe Capone being in the Whitehouse east wing at the same time as Robert Creamer 4 days prior to Seth's "shooting"  The responding officers mentioned having ties to HRC if they even exist. The fact that a burglary of an FBI vehicle and theft of weapons and equipment happened two hours before the shooting just a short distance away, which was not originally reported and no one has talked about. I found it by scanning logs. The weapons stolen included ones that would be impossible without the keys due to locking mechanisms. There also would have been a massive law enforcement presence in the area by FBI , Washington DC PD, &amp; others regarding this theft for hours and at least all night trying to prevent a thief from using an FBI gun to kill someone.
           </p>
           <p>
            But know none of that happens. They allege Seth walked around for hours and was shot in the back. No cop on patrol sees him, the FBI does not respond in force to make damn sure it wasn't their stolen guns used. Nothing. HRC mentions Seth Rich name from the stage at a campaign stop talking about botched robbery within 48 hours. How the hell would she know?
           </p>
           <p>
            A day and a half later a suspect involved in a massive car theft ring tied to Imran Awan happens to be in DC by the name of Alpha Jollah. He gets in a shootout with D.C. Police and is arrested. He was supposed to be in prison for a long time but had mysteriously been released only a few months earlier. Can you say Informant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly Seth's parents stated they could tell he had fought back because he had some bruising on his face. This was seen by them when the body was sent back for burial. That is a very big lie to tell if they are lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            So why no release of records. They can't unless the entire police department lies. They did no investigation. Can they release the Coronors report? If Seth was in fact shot and it happened to be ammo belonging to FBI gun it would be armor piercing or hollow point. Any rookie doctor, police officer, &amp; especially Coronors would know that and the injuries that would cause including entry &amp; exit wounds would be immediately known. Forensics would also be able to then link to specific gun.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone should start talking is all I am suggesting.

             <p>
              The evidence that Seth Rich is a school play:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Brother laughed through the family interview.
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Brother refused to cooperate with investigator Rod Wheeler.
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Seth's father lip syncs his wife's exact response during family interview. (it looks like they were given a script to memorize)
             </p>
             <p>
              4) Without a Seth Rich "leaker" the press would have to deal with the "real" leaker whoever that was.
             </p>
             <p>
              5) The DC Metro police refuse to release police camera footage. (btw that may have been the reason for another school play in Minneapolis where, oops, the police didn't have their cameras on)
             </p>
             <p>
              6) No Death Certificate
             </p>
             <p>
              7) Hospital he was sent to has a gag order about the story. (no reason has been provided which is odd)
             </p>
             <p>
              8) FBI retrieved his laptop THE SAME NIGHT he was shot. Another very odd bit of evidence considering when Seth Rich was shot no one knew who he was and his shooting was not any different than the hundreds of other shootings in DC.
             </p>
             <p>
              9) FBI took his cell phone too.
             </p>
             <p>
              10) DC police won't release camera footage from any of the stores in the area.
             </p>
             <p>
              I put these in a post here as well:

                  Exactly.  I stopped following Wag the Seth when it became obvious he was not doa.  So this Sy thing pops up and lo and behold, it was a botched mugging.  Sure, and spaghetti grows on spaghetti trees.  Now peeps will be debating who really killed Seth for eons and not seeing what is really going on.  Once I 'got it' the psyops become so obvious.  Oh but Sy is a Pulitzer prize winner...so fucking what.  Bama is a Nobel prize winner...so much for impressive titles eh?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Not a bit different than Wag the Julian that has keep diggers engaged and entertained for months and is still going strong.  And of course the bombshell comes via our fav friend and CIA brainchild wikileaks...why am I not surprised.

                    Interesting theory on the carnival/awan connection.  These days I'm never sure exactly what is going on but if it makes msm then it's choreographed/that much I do know.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Noticed you mentioned SH/discovering it was a psyops.  The false leads were everywhere so ppl kept chasing their tails.  Some nice folks on ATS opened my eyes to psyop early on.  No child was killed, the school wasn't even operational.  Adam's bro, Ryan, was the intended patsy (debatable if Adam ever even existed).  He screwed that up by hearing about it before he was arrested/accidentally killed ya da and tweeted to his friends I've been at work...it wasn't me/which started a mad scramble to make a new patsy.  Before SH the town was a nondescript down and out little nothing place.  It was refurbished...a full blown movie-set for the production.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It does look like some key players are going to be thrown under the bus.  Players that got so full of themselves they didn't follow the rules.  But ppl make a huge mistake if some key players are sacrificed...it goes so much deeper.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As for trump I don't think they had to threaten him with his kids...I think they have some real perverted dirt on him/like possibly raping a 13 year old virgin who just happened to be the same age of his true lust, Ivanka/which could explain the violence of the alleged rape.  The more I have dug into the trump rabbit hole the more I see a man with no conscience at all.  Which of course is reinforced by his bombing of innocent peasants in Yemen and then bombing Syria and Afghanistan.  He is a man with no morals what so ever.  The majority of the trump clan is amoral cept for the cast off daughter Tiffany (too soon to tell with her) and Barron who is too young.  Our fotus is a gold digger soft porn model who sold her soul for blood diamonds (trump's Jewish mafia connections) and other trappings of luxury.  And deep state wanted them in the WH or they wouldn't be there.  First you manufacture dissent then you control the opposition.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The good news is it's such a fiasco more ppl are red pilling.  PG has the potential to blow things wide open.  When the masses really get it what is happening to these children, the awful gory details I don't thing it's something that can be ignored any longer.  As long as pizzagaters can keep the focus and not fall for wag the Julian, wag the Seth and wag the trump there is real hope.

                     Maybe but I don't think they'd leave it up to chance. He was in New York and they would have had to show how he went to Sandy Hook and back again.

                     I think Ryan was part of the hoax from the beginning. It's debatable whether Adam Lanza existed. Who knows. All that matters is SH was a hoax.

                     I agree 100%. Henry Kissinger and George H.W. Bush got sick of Hillary and sold her down the river. I think Hillary looks really pissed because they didn't tell her and she figured it out later.

                     For me the biggest proof the Deep State wanted Trump in there is the leak of John Podesta's emails. It happened right before the election. Since Wikileaks is a CIA psy-op then the CIA leaked those emails to themselves.

                      Yes, that nails it right there.  What I'm not clear on is did they expect all of the SRA would come out?  What are your thoughts?

                       Absolutely. The vast majority of Americans are still gullible enough to believe their government isn't capable of such depravity. Therefor any evidence of such depravity is dismissed as impossible. Even worse it even brands a deplorable making such an accusation as a insane.

                        Well, what you say makes a lot of sense unfortunately.  If that is indeed the case (speculation but deff a possibility) then do you see any possibility of a shift in the perceptions of the masses?

                        I could see Killary and podesta etc being the sacrificial lambs and ppl rejoicing in 'planned' victory...another wag the dog thing.

                        But it might be possible that they start turning on each other/Killary won't go down w/o a fight.  Or podesta for that matter.

                  Very probable, dont forget there are 3-4 hours unaccounted for before his death. Possibly kidnapped, interrogated and killed? Nobody called in the gunshots, an app did it. Seth's defense marks possibly torture marks? I dont know, i am not very informational when it comes to torture.

            I listened to this twice and still could not understand him too well.  But I did hear him saying something about having people that he can get info from (after all he has been at this for decades), so maybe some good people in the FBI, you know lower level but important enough to know the "behind the scenes" stuff.  Other than that, I could not make out whether he outed anyone or department being in on the report. I believe Comey did play a part, I don't think there was too much that Comey did not know or was kept out of the loop on.  He was in deep with Lynch and the Clintons for decades.

              Thanks again.  I have read it twice now and forwarded it to many.  Please pass on everyone.  This will expose the lying MSM.
