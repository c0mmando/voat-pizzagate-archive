I want to put out a working list of therapists/mental health professionals who have a record of: (1) talking about mind control abuse issues, especially regarding MKULTRA government-sponsored mind control, &quot;monarch&quot; programing, satanic ritual abuse-type programming and related issues (2) as far as I know, being publicly and openly &quot;on the record&quot; about these kind of issues. My intention is not to &quot;out&quot; anybody who doesn\'t want to be public about these kind of issues, just to highlight some very knowledgable therapists, who have put out some useful information for abuse survivors. Especially for this forum, I think its worth it to discuss some of these folks:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Colin Ross</strong>
Dr. Colin Ross is a Canadian Psychiatrist, he has been very involved for many years in researching and writing books about government and military mind control experimentation and multiple personality disorder.  <a href="http://www.rossinst.com/about_dr_colin_ross.html">Dr. Ross\'s website</a> He wrote an excellent book called &quot;The CIA Doctors: Human Rights Violations by American Psychiatrists,&quot; that exposes how tons of universities and well-respected psychologists and psychiatrists have participated in many CIA-funded mind control projects over many decades. The penetration of the mind control projects into the academic, medical and military establishments is very, very deep. </p>
<p>In this Podcast from 2013, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHY0h_NS6XI">youtube link </a>, **<strong>Colin Ross said that he was actually one of the therapists who was in the room when Dr. Corydon Hammond gave his infamous &quot;Greenbaum Speech&quot; I discussed in my previous post, regarding widespread mind control experimentation.</strong> Dr. Colin Ross has definitely been &quot;around the block&quot; when it comes to these kind of issues, he is worth looking into.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Pamela Monday</strong>
Dr. Pamela Monday is an Austin, Tx-based therapist. She wrote a forward to abuse survivor Brice Taylor\'s &quot;Thanks for Memories.&quot; 
Brice Taylor (real name apparently was Susan Ford), is apparently now deceased. She claimed to be a victim of trauma-based mind control, and that her systematic abuse beginning in infancy led to her being used as a mental &quot;robot&quot; by incredibly powerful US political and business figures, for the purposes primarily of spying and sexual blackmail at a extremely elite level of political, business, and entertainment circles. Her story, while incredible, I think deserves consideration. She claimed to have re-integrated her multiple personalities after intensive therapy, and while this is the story of an alleged ritual abuse survivor, who may or may not have re-integrated her personalities, her story, which clearly should be taken with a big grain of salt, reveals some very shocking though important info that often lines up with what others have disclosed.</p>
<p>In her intro to Brice Taylor\'s book, Dr. Pamela Monday, goes into great detail about the the various mind control and abuse techniques she personally witnessed in multiple patients, that are used to &quot;manufacture&quot; multiple personality in ritual abuse victims. Her information closely matches up with information disclosed by Dr. Corydon Hammond in his &quot;Greenbaum Speech.&quot; Dr. Monday is another person whose information is worth looking into.</p>
<p>I know this is very short list, but I just wanted to get out some links to knowledgable therapists who have some potentially vital information about these kinds of ritual abuse/mind control issues. Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to building networks to try to fight back against these people. Thanks, and stay safe.</p>',

            Your moving in the positive direction.  In offering a supportive environment we should be very careful what we recommend to survivors. Several people here have reported the writing technique is working for individuals they know.  That is positive progress in my mind from the discussion you sought to begin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like looking for advice on what to eat from the internet, you can get all sorts of contradictory information.  Most of it is self serving, it's selling something.  Mental Health Pro's want to believe their favorite technique is worth the money ($$$/hour) they charge.    Perhaps three years in a twice monthly therapy to make a little progress, is the talk therapists notion of success.  Their wallet stayed fat is most of what happened, no wonder they like it.  I see a trained psychologist about twice a year to get a tuneup. His training included nothing on mind control, that slowly dawning reality came from listening to his patients.   That one person with professional credentials, will talk with me about MK as having been a reality in my life, that is the biggest healing I get out of talk therapy.  It's not an acceptable topic in ordinary conversation and results in permanent social isolation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hypnosis in the hands of the uninformed (meaning they don't get the mind control that's been going on) is like kids playing with dynamite.  Linking our irrational memories back into our rational mind, putting some context around them, this is my goal personally.  It makes me heal up slowly, nothing else worked.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for building community out of survivors, I wish you good luck. Our scars are invisible, distrust is a well earned approach to nearly all of life, especially after remembering begins.  .   We are simply lucky to be alive, that's sufficient.   We can contribute as gentle listeners appear.  Leadership for child protection going forward, needs to be from the MOMS always.  You all got the right instincts.

            Mental Heath Professionals have been at the heart of this problem since WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            A minority of that profession has become aware of their past collusion.  I was most professionally abused by Medical Professionals and deeply distrust the Doctored professions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be cautious about giving advice when you don't have personal experience or professional experience in this area.  Simply listing resources isn't enough.  I find the Brice Taylor stuff too long.  That first video was and hour and a half.  I don't watch that length often.  If you personally know someone making progress and recovering, that's what I want to hear about.

            I'd be very wary of any of this advice. It doesn't sound like OP has any personal experience. If you are a survivor there is a comprehensive network that is setup to funnel you back to your abusers so you can be reprogrammed without incident. You don't want that to happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            OP isn't even a longstanding/trusted contributor...how long have you been thinking about this speaking as if you have been posting more than one singular day!
           </p>
           <p>
            Several people expressed these concerns in "part 1."

            I'm sorry for posting in that way.  Felt bad about it and should have deleted it last night.

            All of us are MK'd these days, it's in the air we breath.  What was a technique used on individuals has been ramped up to the masses.

            Thanks for putting Dr Ross in this documentation.  His work is at a level respected by academics, He put all this on the table with irrefutable evidence.  I've not powered through the entire CIA Doctors, it's huge and painful to read.

            Keep trying please but be cautious of hypnosis.  Lot's of people want to play around with it without skill.  That's how we all got into this mess.  It's real and it works everyday on TV.

            Google Colin Ross MD + malpractice, granted Satanist types use this the lawsuits appear valid. Re Cathy O'Brien she's accused along with Mark Phillips of brainwashing a teenage girl both are sleeping with.

             I'm just stating factual information that's easy to find so the downvoters might state what issue they have. Other SRA/MPD/DID researchers like Fritz Springmeier have also been shown to be flaky &amp; likely dramatizing a bit of their material, a common theme in the genre such as David Icke or Alex Jones, who might use 90% true info with 10% bunk such as "Queen Elizabeth/Reptilian shapeshifter" which then pushes less gullible types completely out of conspiracy theory. Many use the genre like they are rock stars merely out for fame &amp; income selling books &amp; giving seminars. There are highly respected researchers, writers &amp; therapists though &amp; there's a qualitative difference in their work, paper trails &amp; footnotes among other evidence.

            I want to add that when anyone puts lots of verbiage into long paragraphs, I get suspicious.  This is MK tactics.  Intense paragraph lengths and on and on in arguement.   Non the less, it mostly seems a good discussion.
