            If this true, it sure is an interesting development  I believe this will become a very well watched item on tvs, papers and internet.  I know I will be waiting for the outcome of the autopsy.

            Does that prove there's an Illuminati? No.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say it still proves something though. When the psychotic clown fraud is finally brought down in DC I predict a fuck-ton of people are going to be rediscovering religion. The truly psychotic won't but anyone with an ounce of sanity that got caught up in this is going to have some pretty long nights coming up.

            I suppose there can be many reasons to the outcome, but he could have done that without all the blood drawings.  We will have to wait and see.  I am not a football or sports fan, but I really find this very mysterious.

            ' The Associated Press reported previously that the government – and other experts – have debunked conspiracy theories that the symbols on American money – the unfinished pyramid and all-seeing eye, for example – derive from free mason allegiances among the country’s founders. The AP described those conspiracy theories as arguing that “the Seal proves the domination of the United States by a powerful, quasi-religious cult. The Ancient Scottish Rite of Freemasonry is a perennial favorite of conspiracy theorists as some Founding Fathers were Masons and the Seal uses several Masonic symbols” and “that the Seal draws on Satanism or polytheistic ritual to promote a universal new world order under which Earth would be ruled by a single omnipotent government.” The government created an exhibit on the symbols in an attempt to repudiate the myths, AP reports.

            Ok...  if the symbolism on our currency and in our Capitol are meaningless...

            Research what day this happened? Where was his team on that day? He was just found not guilty the week before..

           <p>
            Most importantly to tie it together who is his Attorney &amp; what case in Florida is he most famously involved in the trial involving a missing 3 year old. He took on very powerful corruption.

             I knew Jose Baez was the lawyer of Casey Anthony and now Hernandez.  Looked up where the New England Patriots were the day AH died.  They visited the WH with Trump.  Is there a possible involvement here with pedophilia?  I think the Anthony case somewhat mirrors JB Ramsey case.  Do you think he committed suicide?  Where did the blood come from if he hung himself?  They did not report that he had cut himself.

              Originally when I heard of Hernandez death by suicide... especially regarding hanging by sheets in his cell.
             </p>
             <p>
              First of all the literal impossibity of hanging oneself with a sheet has to be kept in mind. Also that he was in a single locked down cell.
Including the fact he was a huge guy over 6' weighing over 200lbs.  Hanging by sheet nearly impossible.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also had won his court case and had the murder conviction overturned the week before after hiring Jose Baez.
             </p>
             <p>
              Baez has already cried foul. And will be investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Baez representing C. Anthony in the murder of her 3 year old daughter Cayley.
             </p>
             <p>
              This trial was publicized live on tv. Huge followers were allowed to watch the heartbrake.
             </p>
             <p>
              As important was the testimony from the parents &amp; her fathers lies that were found out in testimony.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pundicts and arm chair lawyers called her guilty from the onset but Baez does not believe it &amp; offers the possibily of other suspect.?
             </p>
             <p>
              He took apart the prosecutors one by one. It was obvious from the get go that at least Casey's father was complicit or worse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Followed the case day by day. Jose Baez was good attorney,
             </p>
             <p>
              The links to her father &amp; obvious lies &amp; cover up for father or others was ambitious but failed. Casey was acquitted,
             </p>
             <p>
              The link to illuminati was alleged last few years.... This day to end it strange. Almost like someone made it happen.
             </p>
             <p>
              Writing illuminati signs in blood very strange. This might have been a message to a lot of people. The scripture John3:16 and info in his bible might be part of it or possibly his last message he wanted to share John3:16.....
             </p>
             <p>
              the antithesis of the Iiluminati who worship Lucifer.....

               Thank You. You never cease to enlighten me.  Yes, I never believed he committed suicide, and yes you are right, it is near to impossible. I have always felt that Casey was abused and also Cayley.  The family of AH is now requesting Dr. Baden to do the autopsy.  This will be a stunning revelation, whatever it is.  I do not expect Baden to declare it a Satanic Ritual Murder, even if it was.  I have read three articles and none of them mention him cutting himself in order to use blood on the walls.  There must have been quite a bit of blood to draw what he did.  This still leaves questions, but hope with Baez in charge, some of the truth will come out.  I now fear for his life. Just a wild thought.  Just in case Casey's father did abuse Cayley and was involved in some type of large pedo ring, could this have been some type of pay back to Baez and the way he treated the Mother and Father?  Or a message to Trump?  Just a thought.  Whatever, it was not a suicidal hanging by sheets.

             Thank you for this. It makes me want to research this whole article and it's contents, all the more.  It sure is a very interesting theory.  It makes no sense that he committed suicide.  None whatsoever. He was already serving a life sentence. He won the double murder case, so he was back to square one just like before. So you want to kill yourself when you off on a double murder charge?  I would think it would be the opposite.  If he was so upset with his fate, why did he not commit suicide while in jail before the trial. It is all to easy to just write it off as suicide.  But here is one question, where did the blood come from if he hung himself? Did he cut himself before the hanging?  A lot of unanswered questions.
