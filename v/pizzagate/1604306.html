<p><a href="https://davidshurter.com/?p=7215">Chapter from his website</a></p>
<p>My name is David Shurter and I am a survivor of BOTH cult abuse AND the MKUltra experiments that often went along with this type of abuse. I grew up in Omaha- and am author of Rabbit Hole: A Satanic Ritual Abuse Survivor’s Story in which I detail my experiences with the abuse of children that was occurring in the 80’s which is well known as Franklin Credit Union, (although I have been outspoken that the TRUTH has yet to be presented in this situation and that, up until now, it has been nothing more than a CIA cover-up). I also have a blog DavidShurter.com where you can find myriads of posts about me and my family’s involvement with devil worship and child trafficking.</p>
<p>I could spend this opportunity horrifying and entertaining you about how, under and up to the age of 10- I was forced to murder young boys and then “have sex” with their dead bodies, or torturing them to the point where their screams and cries just blended into one crescendo of pain- at which point they were slaughtered, or perhaps you would like to hear about how after I was forced to drink these murdered boys blood (who were ALL pre-pubescent, by the way)- along with everyone else there- I was always gang raped, but I don’t really see the point. Stories of me being buried alive with a corpse- or having to lay on a grave and listen to see if I could hear the little boy they had just buried scream after I watched him be buried alive only serve to feed this sick need for entertainment and I am not some carnival freak here for someone’s entertainment.</p>
<p>If I sound angry- that is probably because I am. I have ALWAYS known about this mess- as I was born into it. And all I have seen is injustice on top of injustice, and more than that- and WAY worse- is that I have seen people intentionally look away because it makes them uncomfortable. And it should. It is an very uncomfortable situation. But how uncomfortable do you think the children are who are being gang raped night after night? And I can’t help but wonder why no one seems to care about them.</p>
<p>The 80’s wasn’t just about Franklin. Child abuse claims came out all over the nation- but the focus all came out about ONE CASE- McMartin- the longest and most costly court trial in American history with not ONE conviction where the tunnels the children spoke about being abused in weren’t found until AFTER.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just in the United States- as it was happening in the UK and Australia at the VERY SAME TIME with the VERY SAME allegations at a time when there was NO INTERNET.</p>
<p>Society was lead to believe that it was a “mass hysteria” because some people had read books like Sybil and Michelle Remembers- which I guess somehow permeated into the wind and started infecting different factions of people- who had no contact with each other- with this idea that their children were being raped and abused in their daycares by people who were connected to our own government. And this was SO pervasive that it was a global phenomenon.</p>
<p>The effect of this was that therapists, child protective services, and law enforcement became “mind controlled” and became “overzealous” with their investigations concerning children being raped and abused in horrible ways on a mass level, and thus they were BAD, BAD, BAD- and if you have any questions- just watch the HBO movie on McMartin.</p>
<p>So, as a result- we were given the False Memory Syndrome Foundation- a CIA based group of rich, white parents who had all been accused of these SAME ALLEGATIONS- who used the key phrases “satanic panic” and “false memories” to convince everyone that the THOUSANDS if not MILLIONS of people who were complaining of children being raped globaly were delusional or lying.</p>
<p>All because some people read a couple of books.</p>
<p>Now- now we have Jeffery Epstein’s pedophile island where BOTH Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are HIGHLY implicated, Jerry Sandusky’s Second Mile High Children’s charity were he was reportedly selling children to rich men- (or do you REALLY believe that Jerry Sandusky is behind Ray Gricar’s disappearance?), as well as that “rent boy ranch” that Scalia was murdered at that has all of the devil statues and pics and masks, and those are the ones WE KNOW ABOUT. And STILL, according to the statistics that the Center for Missing and Exploited Children report- ONE CHILD is DISAPPEARING EVERYONE 27 SECONDS. And THOSE are just the ones we know about- and that is JUST in the United States and NOT globally.</p>
<p>And what do the people do? Well, from what I can see- you are just going on about your lives while they are teaching your kindergarteners how to masturbate, your fourth graders all about the joys of having anal sex, and sixth graders about the nuances on how to use a strap on dildo. While all of you sit by- either completely clueless or totally uncaring.</p>
<p>I had the experience to be a young man when Franklin hit- and so I have a different perspective on all of this than most. And this is what I will tell you about my personal experience as a victim who has been caught up in all of this since birth.</p>
<p>I watched people- who I was ALWAYS told would never help me- turn away from children being raped, murdered, hunted like animals, and slaughtered in ways that can only be described as completely soul killing. Repeatedly I have seen society DO the VERY THING I was always told that they would do.</p>
<p>And those who HAVE tried to help- for the most part- have either been incarcerated, drugged, and told they were crazy- or they were destroyed financially, professionally, or personally if not flat out murdered. And never a word is said.</p>
<p>For THIRTY YEARS I have watched NOTHING but people dismissing and discrediting the slaughter of children with claims that we are liars, or delusional, or seeking attention- all based on a hysteria that was caused over a couple of books that I guess were completely debunked by a group who were accused of being horrific pedophiles.</p>
<p>It has been NOTHING BUT soul crushing. So many innocents lost and not a person who would help them in sight.</p>
<p>So go ahead- read this book- and educate yourself to the reality of this. But NOTHING you read here will help you understand what it has really been like. To truly understand- you need to experience going to sleep and hearing the constant screaming of children- and what it is like to fight not only the darkness in the world but that within yourself while being companioned by the very person you hate the most- yourself. Until you experience the true balance of conflict and despair- you will never understand my world and what I went through. And I am one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>Most men completely self-destruct by their early twenties- either dead by suicide or locked up in prison. All of us- no matter what sex we may be- who survive and come away from this have so many secret scars that we not only keep from others- but worst of all from ourselves. As a result- we often find ourselves in loveless relationships with joyless lives that we blame ourselves for, and it becomes a never ending self-enforcing cycle.</p>
<p>And many of us never realize that it was NEVER our fault- and that what happened was NEVER because of us as NONE OF IT was ANYTHING ANY OF US would have EVER CHOSEN had we actually been given a choice – but rather- the ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY for absolutely ALL OF IT lies on the necks of those sick ass fucks who lived some sort of sick fuck delusion that they blamed us and everyone BUT themselves for.</p>
<p>I would like to say– with pizzagate and everything we know now about the truth of all of this mess, despite the lies that were intentionally planted into this case- that this time will be different. That society will actually get involved and do something to stop this- and help save the children. But then I guess that depends on all of you.</p>
<p>Just reading a book isn’t going to cut it- and it won’t save ONE CHILD from getting a dick up their ass- so you are going to have to get involved if this is going to change. Knowing about all of this is great- but that doesn’t amount to a hill of beans unless you are willing to DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE IT.</p>
<p>How I have no idea. In the 50 yrs that this mess has been my life- I have had to just feel around in the dark. But I will say- actually, in doing so, I have found that there is no better way to find yourself OUT of the darkness- so I suggest you all do the same- and you start NOW.</p>
<p>Yes- it is ugly. Yes- it is painful. Yes it is scary. And YES- it is worse than anything any of you can imagine. But it is REAL- and it needs to be STOPPED. And it is going to take all of US to stop it.</p>
<p>And, after all is said and done, our children deserve this much, don’t you think?</p>',

            I am from Manhattan Beach Ca and lived there before and after the McMartin case broke. I personally knew children who had attended that preschool and they were seriously screwed up from what they went through. i was the right age to have gone there when the abuse was occurring but fortunately I had a stay at home mom. A family on my street was not so lucky and their son was abused there. I never bought that so many kids simply made up those claims from seeing how these kids were effected. Years later I began following Ted Gunderson and the work he did exposing the cover up and botching of how that case was handled. His documentation is helpful for people to understand how these sick SRA groups operate. Protect your kids people! The elites have set up a society where parents turn their precious children over to sickos as infants for daycare and then school and our kids are at the mercy of this evil.

            It's very brave of you to come out and start to tell your story.  I hope that you have support around you.  Realise that you are the innocent party in all of this. I know abuse can bring with it shame, but that shame belongs to the adults who did this to you, not you.

            I am so terribly, terribly sorry this happened to you. I don't know how to stop it either. The only thing I've come up with is that we have to keep the discussion going and increase awareness.  I believe there are a lot more eyes on this than we know. People close to this in government and academia and other sectors know it's real.

            I am so sorry for what you've been through, as well as David Shurter. Thank you for sharing. I would do anything to save any other child from experiencing this hell on earth. Now that I've been redpilled on this, I won't stop until they are stopped. And I really hope you're right about Trump.

            Yes, this is absolutely unacceptable. I mean, to torture, abuse, rape, cut, skin, burn alive is horrible and painful enough, but to bury a child alive and extend their agony for days on end is beyond evil. It defies human comprehension.

            Here's a link to History of  Australian false memory agenda  exposed to cover-up crimes:
            <a href="https://pedophilesdownunder.com/australian-false-memory-association-exposed/">
             https://pedophilesdownunder.com/australian-false-memory-association-exposed/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            History of American false memory association:
            <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_tavistock04a.htm">
             http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_tavistock04a.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that memories can be difficult but the interesting thing is that the false memory association doesn't equally describe the memory blocks from trauma - which means that there IS TRAUMA.
           </p>
           <p>
            They don't properly describe  ptsd, post trauma and the physiological problem with coming to terms with ones involvement in things that they'd wish they hadn't liked or even were groomed or threatened to  agree  to.
           </p>
           <p>
            A good therapist would know that there is  SOMETHING behind the mental block or confusion of memory.
It could be any number of things,  but it is something dramatic for the child enough to block it or try to make it different.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I know from personal experience is that the child will usually make the perpetrator out to be good, because it's either all they know and/or they want to be loved and accepted.  Or the child pretends the perp is someone good, other than what they actually are.
This is also part of the complex diagnosis of Stockholm Syndrome.
The child usually doesn't know what's right or wrong, because it's been taught not to have personal boundaries or rights that reflect anything normal people view as healthy.
Because  the definition of  healthy are upside down, more confusion arises.
This is even more compounded when  the  body physiologically  reacts to something that's criminal and abusive.  This even further creates conflicting blocks and memory escapism.
In this case,  if the victim has memory problems it would be complete error to say that nothing has happened.
It'd be better to find out WHAT has happened, slowly and in a safe and kind environment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because of the minds ability to protect itself from pain or inflicting personal guilt over things they had no control over, the person might block because they may think they had control to stop it or change it.   This can show up as victims remembering something new 40 years later, with the memory triggered by something they can't even identify.

            If there is one thing that David said that will haunt me now is that they actually bury children alive. We need to double-down and make more noise, guys.

             Fiona Barnett (if I remember right, maybe it was a European survivor)  said  that as a child  she'd watch another kid buried alive and she'd  have to lay on top of the dirt and listen to them die.    That was some type of grooming for leader positions -  to desensitize  and develope the psychopathic nature.

              I don't think it's her. Iirc, Fiona was forced to lay down over a decomposing body (back to it) and be buried with it. She said she died that night (clinically), from fright and that they had to reanimate her. One of her abusers told her that they had almost lost her the night before and that they wouldn't make her go through this again, because their goal wasn't to kill her.

               thanks.   I've watched and read a few testimonies and I'm not sure who shared that.   Of course there's the language/accent barrier too,  and I have trouble  understanding some of the words.  I'll try to confirm who shared that story.

            On one of your videos, you say that you have proof that Johnny Gosch's mother knew of child trafficking in Omaha even though she never mentioned it in public, and then the proof you provided is a letter you wrote to her. If I said this makes you sound less credible, would you understand why?

            David is extraordinarily brave for speaking out about his nightmare but he's wrong about Donald Trump. Trump visited Epstein's island precisely once and upon his return banned him from his properties for life. If there was a single piece of evidence that Trump was involved in this, the intelligence agencies would have leaked it by now. All they have managed to come up with so far is a hilarious piece of fan fiction written by someone on 4chan and embellished by a washed-up former MI6 source. If was there was anything real, the media would have had it long ago and his campaign would have been stopped in its tracks. This was all confirmed by FBIAnon.

            <ol>

              George Webb says that they have a tape of Trump with a minor girl around 1993. Trump didn't really know her age.

              Trump's name is written in the black book that Epstein's butler gave to the FBI. His name is circled, meaning that he knew or participated.

              George is great but for some strange reason he refuses to realize or even look into Ritual and monarch programming. I have mentioned this to him on several occasions. It just pisses me off with so much out there. Don't know what his problem is

               He'll get there. I didn't talk about child trafficking for a month, and I kept hounding him. Now he talks about organ harvesting, which I never knew about, and FBIanon never mentioned.

                yes,  I think some things are real hard for people who don't believe in it.
The thing is,  not believing in it or not agreeing with it  doesn't mean that it isn't happening.
Maybe it's a combo of that and not wanting to accept that things like this are happening,  because then he'll have to investigate the rat hole that is  skull and bones, bohemian grove and masonic   high levels 33 degree elite order, and  Crowley's thelema - and how that involves  wikileaks.
                <br/>
                That's not the same story of patriotism to politicians he was likely raised with - the underbelly of these beliefs are ugly to everybody but those who believe in them.  The rest, like George,  deny.
                <br/>
                I think it's easier that way for some.

                 I basically agree with you, but George is doing great work, 100x more than ordinary people. I think he'll get there eventually.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Wikileaks is
                 <em>
                  filled
                 </em>
                 with occult reference (thelema, minerva, 322, spirit cooking), and so are the #pizzagate instagrams. James A. has a video of a man growing giant Satanic horns. There is no way, in my mind, that this is all fake theater to justify organ harvesting.

              George Webb has just made a couple too many unsubstantiated claims recently, which have not particularly added to his credibility. Did he quote or give any sources?

            I pray every night over this, to rescue, to heal to expose.  I post pizzagate posters up in every public toilet and write it on money and talk to those (few) who will listen.  I hope Trump will expose the clintons/Podesta at least.  I hope with the reality we want to create, our thoughts will create a better world.
