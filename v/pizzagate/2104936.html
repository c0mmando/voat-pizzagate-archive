            I've been watching the series... I can't say Scott is innocent, but his guilt was certainly not proven in court. What really caught my attention was the witness who saw Scott taking his boat out of the marina saying there was nothing in the boat that could have been a body covered by a tarp, as well as the postal carrier who stated the the dog was not in the yard less than 20 minutes after the neighbor had put him back in the fenced in area.
           </p>
           <p>
            also, I have had a long mistrust of Nancy Grace and wondered even then why she bulldogged Scott so severely - clearly trying to convict him in the court of public opinion (very successfully). I even believed he was guilty but still thought she and Kimberly Guilfoyle were so rabid about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I imagined at the time that Nancy was probably cheated on by some guy... but maybe links to satanism? I have to say that the court case seemed very coordinated, down to removing jurors who weren't buying the case against Scott.
           </p>
           <p>
            being a jerk shouldn't get you convicted of murder...

            I was obsessed with this case. I followed it religiously. I believe Scott Peterson killed them. I think her family was sincere. His family was nuts.

           <p>
            I had went and visited a friend for the weekend.  She lived across the street from Amber Frey. I went swimming with her. Crazy! She was like a normal person with little kids riding their little bikes around. I believe the story that we've come to know.

            Amber Frey was always on my radar as being complicit. Peterson never had a chance.

            If Nancy Grace calls you guilty you can almost always assume she is gatekeeping for the high up killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another story that the media covered 24/7 and Nancy did non stop shows on it was the Caylee Anthony child murder story in Florida. The mother was Casey Anthony. The story was insane and the state charged Casey with killing her child. I knew from the beginning she did not do it and showed signs of extreme sexual abuse herself as a child with dissociation and alters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well wouldn't you know it the child(3 yrs) grandfather (George)and father of Casey was a retired cop. Wonder why the cops did such a horrible job collecting evidence which belonged to him?
           </p>
           <p>
            In the trial it comes out he sexually abused Casey. The prosecution still carried on trying to try Casey for Caylee's murder eventhough the grandfather saw her last. No one can figure out who the father of Caylee is, the public is told he died in car accident but family denies it. It gets leaked Caylee might be George's child, that he was still sexually assaulting his daughter even at about 18 when she got pregnant with Caylee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Casey was acquitted after a brutal trial where her own pedophile father and mother took the stand to testify against her. Disgusting. This was only a few years ago. There have been hints since that Casey as a child, then Caylee were used in child trafficking rings in Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            "A friend" told me he knew them and worked in that area in L.E. something was very wrong about this case.

              Jury's have to be picked within the county of offense. The only way that can change legally is if the prosecution, or defense ask the judge for removal to a different jurisdiction due to possible bias and the judge grants it.

            I hadn't thought much about this case until recently.  Something about Peterson in the news recently.  Wasn't her body cut open and the baby removed or something like that?

             I think you correct it was cut open but they claim the baby was found as well as her body that washed up on the shore months later.  I believe that the baby may have washed up OR that the baby was stolen since she was ready to deliver if I remember correctly.  Was that baby sought by the elites? IDK, but that is a possibility or just some crazy SRA Ring.  I believe (don't know if this is correct) that there was a van seen on the street that day....the day she was killed.

               I know.  That is what was reported.  I am just saying that maybe sometimes not all truth is told.  But at the moment we must go with what we have.

              "On April 13, 2003, a couple walking their dog discovered the
              <strong>
               decomposing but well-preserved body of a late-term male fetus
              </strong>
              on the San Francisco Bay shore in Richmond's Point Isabel Regional Shoreline park, north of Berkeley.[13] Although a judge
              <strong>
               sealed
              </strong>
              autopsy results, an anonymous Associated Press source
              <strong>
               revealed that 1.5 loops of nylon tape were found around the fetus' neck
              </strong>
              and a
              <strong>
               significant cut
              </strong>
              was on the fetus' body.[14] One day later, the body of a recently pregnant woman, wearing cream-colored maternity pants and a maternity bra, washed to shore one mile away from where the baby's body was found. The exact cause of her death was impossible to determine as a result of decomposition; the body was
              <strong>
               decapitated, both forearms were missing, the right foot was severed, and the left leg from the knee down was missing. Tape was found around the outside of her clothing on her lower torso as well.
              </strong>
              [15] Later reports from the medical examiner revealed that there were injuries, two cracked ribs, that happened at or near the time of death. DNA tests verified that they were the bodies of Laci and her son, Conner.
              <strong>
               Mother and fetus had not been separated by coffin birth
              </strong>
              , as had been speculated. Rather,
              <strong>
               Laci's upper torso had been emptied of internal organs
              </strong>
              and that allowed the fetus to pass through a perforation in the top of the decomposing uterus.[16] It is thought that the
              <strong>
               1.5 loops of nylon tape became tangled around the fetus' neck after it came out
              </strong>
              of Laci's decomposing body. Forensic anthropologist Dr. Alison Galloway was brought in to examine the remains of Laci and Conner Peterson and was an expert witness at the trial."

               Too early for a consensus but maybe she was a victim of organ harvesting. She was pretty young and I wonder if the baby had any value for them as well.  We know of the fetal value.  This is all so very beyond sad and disgusting.  If he is sitting in jail due to protecting some right or elites it is time to push this to the open and have it re-examined.

                They would have taken the baby as well if it were.  I think it was either 1) a serial killer or (more likely) 2) SRA.
