            "The parents of Madeleine McCann were part of an illuminati mind control ring themselves. They know exactly what happened to her but were powerless to stop it.  I was already aware that by allowing their daughter to be kidnapped, the McCann's were unable to avoid obeying the orders of their illuminati controllers.  I was also aware that innocent Madeleine was intended to become the sex toy of illuminati insider, paedophile, degenerate, former President of Portugal, and leader of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.  This is one reason why the abduction of Madeleine was conveniently arranged to take place in Portugal, and the other is that the police could be relied upon to make a total botch of the 'investigation' into Maddy's disappearance since most of the senior officers as well as the great majority of government ministers, are members of the same paedophile elite ring that Barroso belongs to.  I have to confess that I was not previously aware that Maddy McCann is now dead, but I am not surprised since as long as she remained alive, there was always a risk of the truth leaking out in some way. Moreover, being now aware of the background of both Barroso and the McCann's the manner of Maddy's death in a ritual blood sacrifice to Satan also has a degree of perversion.  Finally, no informed researcher is aware of the fact that the misperceived Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is also an illuminati member and Satanist, who is regularly called upon by the council of thirteen to don her witches garb, and to act as mistress of ceremonies whenever supreme knowledge and imperfection of the Satanic 'art' is imperative. Ms. Rowling was present at the rite in which Madeleine died and her reward offer [after Madeleine's kidnapping] was all even more sickening."
