            I've done more intel on this Craigslist item.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) REVENGE OF OSIRIS 7292 Finns Ln, Lanham - mm4m (Cairo 86637)
           </p>
           <p>
            I went to the Helsinki Finland link: (
            <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">
             http://www.helsinki.fi/
            </a>
            ~jetsu/papers/publicity.html) and I found the following in the references (the link discusses the "Cairo Calendar"):
           </p>
           <p>
            The Number "86637" refers to the Cairo Calendar (see below)
           </p>
           <p>
            Cairo Calendar (Nummer 86637) fanden sie tatsächlich eine Periode von 2,85 Tagen, die mit der Periode des Veränderlichen Algol ..."
           </p>
           <p>
            On the webpage it states:
           </p>
           <p>
            "An ancient Egyptian calendar of Lucky and Unlucky days, the "Cairo Calendar", is the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star, Algol. Modern astronomers made the same discovery three thousand years later. The above figure shows one papyrus page of one such calendar (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Trustees">
             @Trustees
            </a>
            of the British Museum). The stars in the modern Perseus constellation have been superimposed on the papyrus and connected with straight lines. The eye denotes Algol."
           </p>
           <p>
            2) the tilde (~) represents the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://chemtrailsaredemonic.org/demonicStargatePortals.php">
             http://chemtrailsaredemonic.org/demonicStargatePortals.php
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "The tilde key on the computer keyboard is a satanic symbol, or portal. The wavy line appears on many things, think of it as a demonic spirit or serpent. "
           </p>
           <p>
            3) the "mm4m" on the post represents gender preference. (translation: "multiple males" looking for "male"
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Found some interesting documentation on 7292 Finns Ln. It is currently owned by John Frank who bought it in a tax sale in 2015. He is the husband of Jaycee Frank (formerly Jaycee Mitchell--from Jaycee's Palm Reading").
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Found an interesting document. Looks like they wanted to build a 6 foot high privacy fence around the property to shield it from the street.
           </p>

            <a href="http://pgccouncil.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/588">
             http://pgccouncil.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/588
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            (see quote from document below)
           </p>
           <p>
            ""The property is a corner lot with the house facing the legal front street at an angle. Exhs. 2 and 9(A) through (E). There is an existing asphalt driveway on the property that accesses the property from Riverdale Road and runs along the rear property line. Exhs. 2, 5(E) through (H), 9(A) through (E).
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Petitioners would like to construct a 6-foot privacy fence around a portion of the rear and side street yards, but a variance is needed to obtain a building permit. Since the fence would be over 4 feet in height and located in the side yard abutting the street, waivers of the fence location and height requirements for a fence in the side yard on a corner lot were requested. Exh. 11.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Petitioner John Frank testified that they want the proposed fence for security and privacy reasons noting that drivers currently use the driveway in their rear yard to turn their vehicles. He testified that his dog was run over by a vehicle.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Jaycee Frank testified that they have five children and the youngest child is two years old. She stated that the fence is needed to protect the children from the (trespassing) vehicles and from the road. She stated that she is further alarmed because there is a bus stop near the driveway (Exhs. 5(C) and (D)) where people loiter. Appeal No. V-102-15 - 2 -
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              John Frank further testified that the driveway at the rear and a metal chain link fence existed when he purchased the property. He stated that the existing fence next to the driveway is broken (Exhs. 5(G) and (H)) and will be replaced with the new 6-foot privacy fence using the existing fence lines. He explained that there will be a gate blocking off the driveway from the yard to protect the children.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              He explained that the property slopes upward from Riverdale Road and the proposed fence would be located at the top of the slope next to the driveway and Riverdale Road. See Exhs. 5(A) through (K). He stated that the new fence will not block the view for traffic because there will be sufficient clearance between the fence and Riverdale Road."

            This could be something, but, to me, it screams of something more along the lines of the Pink Floyd/Publius Enigma game... the record company planted little clues in a few Pink Floyd concerts that were so obscure and well hidden that nobody ever solved it.
But, something to look into, is mirror flip it, print it out, and use the capital letters from the clues to try and solve it... the ones that are all the same might require solving the others to have some idea what they might be.
Interesting, but not putting much faith in the image itself, though the address part is worth a looksie.

             I think it's a great find!  I'm a long time lurker too and know I don't have the knowledge to fully protect myself.  I've posted once.  I'm so impressed by what's going on in this investigation.  I wanted to say bravo and good find.

             What does "auto misleading" mean? I'm open to this being false flag, but who made it, and why something no one was really that likely to catch?

             Just another way to waste time and distract. Even if it were something, there is absolutely no reason you can decipher it without some form of backdrop or decoder. Pointless.

            This is fascinating because 7292 Finns Lane, mentioned in headline of the strange Craigslist post, is linked to Joseph Scheve, from whom James Alefantis purportedly acquired the Pegasus 'museum' property. More important: the Finns Lane address is where an anonymous source claims that trafficked children are held:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Children are also most likely kept in homes neighbouring 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 which is listed as the residential address of one Joseph T Scheve, Business Manager of the New Hope Educational Institute Inc" (New Hope is affiliated with the Unification Church (AKA Moonies).

            There is nothing Masonic in the picture. It would be a square and compass not whatever that is and compass. It would be a "G" in the middle not a "C". Also it looks like it has been mirrored, so it's a backwards "C" in the middle. Nothing else on the page is even remotely Masonic.

             Although it is riding the "secret society" thing, I think this is the equivalent of turning a cross upside down to represent pop-culture satanism, rather than Christianity. This is a well bastardized version of Masonic imagery. Nothing to do with actual Masons, just avant garde copy-cat degenerates with a taste for debauchery...

              While the all seeing eye is used in masonry, it is also used by so many other groups that I would hesitate to call it masonic without any other masonic ties. The whole picture looks like it is just random "occult" graphics put together.  You got me on the bees, I didn't notice them, but I still don't think the picture has anything to do with the Freemasons.

               You are right! 'All seeing eye' can be found in many occult traditions. I just noticed the 'skull and cross bones' on the Craigslist chart too. Same thing -- found in many occult traditions.

             what ??? 
Nothing Masonic ? Are you kidding ?? Compass and symbols near to masons (all seeying eye, bees, pharao, triangle, star...) . Probably a secret loge.

              No idea. A flash drive? Then anything that disappears you can replace later, and you're not routinely storing anything remotely that would be data-mined.
