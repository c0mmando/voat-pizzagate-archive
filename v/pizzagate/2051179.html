<p>It has been rumored by Trump supporters that &quot;the artist who was reportedly commissioned for Comet Ping Pong\'s wall art is Kim Noble.&quot;</p>
<p>Kim Noble is from Croydon, in London.</p>
<p>Kim is dependent on benefits, supplemented by the occasional sale of a painting.</p>
<p>Kim\'s art has earned praise across the art world and many of her paintings have been shown in 27 exhibitions and galleries across Europe.</p>
<p>Kim has been filmed for the Oprah Winfrey show.</p>
<p>Kim\'s parents were factory workers, with an unhappy marriage.</p>
<p>As a child, Kim was farmed out to friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>It is believed that, from a very early age, Kim suffered extreme and repeated physical and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Her mind splintered into different personalities.</p>
<p>It is believed that the true source of Kim\'s condition is Monarch mind control programming.</p>

<p>As an adolescent, Kim was placed in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
<p>In 1995, Kim was finally diagnosed with DID, at the Tavistock clinic, and began therapy.</p>
<p>In 1997 Kim gave birth to Aimee. </p>
<p>The baby was immediately taken into care by social services. </p>

<p>Donald Trump\'s friend Roger Stone is the \'dirty trickster\' who allegedly invented PizzaGate.</p>
<p>Stone has been accused by the Obama administration of having prior knowledge that Putin was planning to hack the US election.</p>
<p><a href="https://s28.postimg.org/99f9nevwd/575745644.jpg">Roger Stone</a> now claims that he was poisoned by members of the Deep State who wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>Stone says they wanted to kill him so that he could not \'debunk\' their \'lie\' that he knew Russians would hack the US election.</p>
<p>Stone claims that doctors have told him that a mysterious virus he was had in December 2016 was probably polonium poisoning.</p>
<p>On Alex Jones\'s Info Wars, he said: &quot;I had lesions on my chest and my face...&quot;</p>
<p>During a visit to Trump Tower on 6 December 2016, Stone had several small cuts to his face and neck.</p>

<p>The very Jewish <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.com.es/2016/08/lunch-with-roger-stone.html">ROGER STONE</a> had the job of concocting Pizzagate for Trump? </p>
<p>According to Timothy Fizpatrick:</p>
<p>Concocting Pizzagate for Trump </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://archive.is/BoE3V">http://archive.is/BoE3V</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Pizzagate was designed to distract people from Trump\'s promises reversal, and, his Zionist maneuverings.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> In October 2016, John Podesta\'s emails were published on Wikileaks, a suspected CIA/Mossad front.
Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told reporters that Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone may have had advanced knowledge of the breach and the subsequent publishing of the emails on Wikileaks.<a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/#_edn1">[i]</a> </p>
<p>Podesta referred to an August 21, 2016 tweet by Stone in which he wrote: </p>
<p><em>&quot;Trust me, it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>According to Timothy Fizpatrick:</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A lot of Roger Stone\'s skills were learned from his mentor, Roy Cohn.</p>
<p>Retired New York Police Department detective James Rothstein claims that Stone was part of Cohn’s pedophile entrapment ring.

<p>According to Timothy Fizpatrick:</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Roger Stone and Donald Trump work together <a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/#_edn6">[vi]</a>.</p>
<p>Stone implicated Ted Cruz\'s family in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> In 1972, Stone went to work for Nixon and entrapped Richard Nixon\'s opponent for the Republican nomination Paul McCloskey.</p>
<p>Using the fake name \'Jason Rainier\', Stone donated funds to McCloskey pretending it was on behalf of the Young Socialist Alliance.</p>
<p>Stone then told the press that McCloskey had accepted the funds, implying that McCloskey was an undercover socialist. </p>

              As far as I can tell, all the releases have been accurate.  They did not dispute the authentiity of the Podesta emails.  Someone made a great point that there are different groups of elites.  Perhaps one of them is backing him.  I seriously doubt it is a group assoiated with the CIA or Bilderbergers.
