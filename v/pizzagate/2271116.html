            We were all asleep once. I try to remember that and be thankful for whatever it is that keeps me awake. That helps me not be angry at those still asleep. These predators have gotten away with so much because the apathy of the sleeping masses enables them. I had to reign it in more than once when confronted with overwhelming cognitive dissonance. Better to reserve my ire for the unrepentant ones that are trying to cover it up. I saw Alefantis once referred to as "my favorite pedo" in an instagram comment and later, he took a stand against the outraged investigators, putting on a brave face with the song "Born this Way". Had he taken a stand in defense if kids and condemned pedophilia instead, we would have focused on others instead.

            We know there are pedophile rings in the Vatican and Hollywood. We know that plenty of politicians have been convicted of pedophilia, yet suggesting there are pedophile rings in the government is "wacko". How do these people think the Vatican and Hollywood were able to get away with it for so long if the people in charge of the law weren't complicit? Seems pretty obvious to me.

            Neurotypicals (normal people) default to the power structure as part of their survival mechanism. This is why its so difficult to get through to them. Neurotypicals are about 90% emotion and only 10% logic - data that doesn't meet a set of emotional crteria just hits the emotional lymbic system and bounces straight back out. Its why its barely worth trying to convey information that holds no emotional significance to them. In comparison in Psychopathy we will suck up information and process it for any perceivable use or benefit no matter the source or if it contradicts/ stands on it head any previously held views/ ideas or decisions.

            You have only to look at our male-dominated "Christian" Congress to 
see the disdain and disregard tor children -- and women, of course.

            And, INCEST is very common, especially in America -- 
Sexual abuse of children by Fathers, Grandfathers, Uncles -- male friends of family.

               Our function here is to question, investigate and raise awareness. There is the potential for a witch hunt, but n the balance of imperfect human justice, where an adult's reputation or property may be unfairly damaged, what would you have people do? Ignore the potential evidence of trafficking; rape, murder and torture of innocent children? I appreciate a voice of reason. There is need for one on this platform. We are not a mindless mob of torches and pitchforks, though.

                Certainly not from the moment of the creation of pizzagate.  I think the evidence is tissue thin.

                There's no coded language in the Podesta emails.  There's no connection between Clinton and Silsby or Alefantis and Silsby.  Walnut sauce is a non-tomato pasta sauce from Northern Italy like pesto.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yet we have people convinced of the most phantasmagoric of crimes.  This does not come from the evidence but from preexisting stew of conspiracism that people have been marinating in.

               She has eyes to see, and ears to hear. That's all it takes. Just because you're spiritually blind doesn't negate all of the things that are said here, and it certainly doesn't put you above anyone here. You can quote "facts" all day long but it doesn't mean shit. You can parrot the New York Times, Washington Post, HuffPo, LA Times, etc. all you want, but anyone with half a brain knows that ALL of those publications (and more) are sold out to the pedophile elite, and they will NOT print anything that they're told not to print. Quoting "facts" from the system that houses and protects these pedo fucks is not going to convince anyone here to change their beliefs, you fuck. You are a faggot. Please kill yourself.

               Obama visited a pizzeria with a Pedo mind control logo swirl,  plastered on the front of the building. It is never removed from sight, (drilled into the face of the building)
              </p>
              <p>
               The Pizza guy is involved with a few businesses with pedo logos (triangles and swirls) and honestly i believe it goes much deeper then just kids, and maybe goes back to Bush era.

                Do you believe that all spirals are Pedo Logos?  I mean it's a pretty common shape.  Most folks don't even known that pedophiles use this logo.  For example, did you use the word pizza in 2015?  Were you doing anything nefarious when you did it?
               </p>
               <p>
                And the one in that image doesn't resemble the spiral from the FBI document.  It seems to me that you might over-relying on pattern identification and matching and then assuming a match equals pedophilia.  The FBI never even said that anytime that shape was displayed it means someone is a pedophile.

                I not sure what distinction you are making here.  Would it be better if it was sometimes removed from sight?  Should it be attached to the building in a different way?  This seems significant to you in a way I am missing.

               <p>
                You also understand that the Logo is from a different organization and is not run the pizzeria owner, correct?

                 No I sure don't believe all spirals are. It's in the DHS video, not on the FBI flyer.  "The signs are everywhere sometimes you have to take a second look."

                  Hi.   This is simply not irrefutable evidence.  For any of this to even be comprehensible, you already have to be far down the rabbit hole and have accepted as true a mountain of unproven circumstantial evidence. DHS is not releasing hidden messages in their PSAs.  It's not happening.  You're the one finding special hidden meanings
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You seem to be exactly what I thought may be happening, you are over-relying on pattern identification and matching and then assuming a match equals pedophilia.  Matching patterns makes our brains happy.  It releases dopamine in the brain. (Believe me, I know this very well, I'm several hundred levels deep into Candy Crush.)  Telling stories makes our brains happy.  Telling ourselves a story based on matched patterns might feel true, but we might just be fooling ourselves.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I mean this one is practically a Rorschach test.  For your previous post of VOAT you just linked to

                  Obama did not walk past a pedo logo.  You are smearing an organization devoted to helping kids and guy devoted to helping kids on the basis of nothing.  It sure seems to me that you are believing all spirals are pedo logo's, even though you say you are not.

                   Obama certainly did walk past that sign, it sits right next to the front door, then and now.

                     There is pedo logo's, cresent moons, suggestive anal sex logos, look closely at the intials of things (cp) in picture files on that fb. Some of those businesses are fonts that lead to dead ends. In the bible the Lion stands for Satan.

                     On his foundation he has a truly sick kid on a purple spiderman flyer. Her name is used for something entirely different, on another site. Lots of things written in arabic to, and who did I say came from that neighborhood to?

                     Traced another one of his phone numbers back to Alabama. Pizza shop registered to someone else, closed now. Next to a Bob nuts, Funeral home, and a place with weiners in the title. Isn't Obama thought to have hotdog stands?

              They are absolutely not.   The only way they are damning if the claim of pedophilia has already been set in motion and it was. 
That is the context in which people discovered the Instagram.  (I believe this is not organic, but that it was an absolutely seeded and coordinated campaign, but I can't prove that.)
             </p>
             <p>
              What I can prove is that that campaign was well underway before James Alefantis's Instagram was discovered.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's a chart of the trend of the word Alefantis

             <p>
              Notice how it's at zero the last week of October?    The pizzagate campaign was already underway at this time.
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact, if you look at Alefantis instagram it's at zero until Nov 6.
              <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2016-09-01%202016-12-01&amp;q=alefantis%20instagram">

             </p>
             <p>
              People are already reposting Pizzagate stuff before people started looking at Alefantis in late Oct.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's the first Facebook post about pizzagate, it was from Oct 29th. Notice that on October 31st, it's already being reposted.

              The facebook post claims there's proof of Clinton being involved in an international child sex trafficking ring. 
It's from a woman in North Carolina claiming to have have sources with the NYPD.   Sources in the NYPD would become an absolutely coordinated claim that week.
             </p>
             <p>
              4 days before the Instagram hits, on Nov 2, Infowars is broadcasting that Clinton was running a pedophile ring.
             </p>
             <p>
              Two days after Infowars, Erik Prince who was secretly working with the Trump campaign and who's sister is now the Secretary of Education and who

              ](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-gop-quickly-reverses-tax-bill-carve-out-1512188545-htmlstory.html)), went on Steve Bannon's old Breitbart radio show to claim that NYPD sources told him that really damning evidence of criminality.  He said that the NYPD would go public unless there was indictements.
             </p>
             <p>
              There were not indictments.  The FBI closed their case.  The NYPD did nothing?  Why?  Erik Prince was lying, it was all fake.   And all of this was going on before James Alefantis Instagram was discussed.

               Are_we__sure your dark occult masters above you look at you just like they do everybody else. You know what they call the policemen that are part of the dark occult? DOGS. They don't mean "hey dawwg" like bro. They mean a mutt. They call them their dogs. That is their specific name for the police in the dark occult. You are probably lower on the pole than the Dogs even. Why don't you stop living your life in miserable hate and find the light.

               This situation might be backwards you know? We are actually free and you are not. We are free to spread truth, love, good news, and do whatever we please. You are trapped in a dark occult regimen and are actually more of a slave than we are. Find the right side of the world. It will make you a happy person.

            From the article..."Will 2017 be the year that some form of Pizzagate gets revealed as truth and not just mere fodder for conspiracy theorists? Only time will tell. For now, alternative media will continue to receive each allegation of sex with children by Washington’s elite as serious as it views badge abuse, and government corruption. But we cannot help but believe the dam is about to break on the scandals along with the MSM’s practice of rejection, replacement, and redirection. It’s time for someone to blow the whistle, for the sake of the children."  There are people out there that know things, that want to expose it.

            It's not.  It's a hard red pill for people to swallow but at the same time it's the one that sinks in fastest.  I find when I bring it up it's something they don't want to know but also know I ain't making shit up either.

             That's what I'm getting tired of, people not WANTING to know about this shit, CHOOSING to remain ignorant, even though they know SOMETHING is going on. I hate that about the "Average Joe" types, they will go on and on about "Uranium One" and all this other MSM bullshit, and they'll get REALLY passionate about it, but they won't go any deeper than that surface mumbo-jumbo that's put in place just for people like that, so they'll have something to read about to keep them from looking into topics that the elite don't want people researching.

             I also think it's the "Satanic" cover which scares people.
Many people are still involved with organized patriarchal religions - though
hard to figure out why they turn their sons and daughters over to male-supremacists.
Numbers are dropping drastically, however -- "Last kick of a dying mule?"
            </p>
            <p>
             The violence is real, but the "Satanic" cover isn't.
Looks like an invention of the RCC/CIA (Catholics in Action)

               Too much evidence to the contrary that there is an "Alien presence"
and that it has existed on this planet hundreds of thousands of years.
Likely humans are hybrids.

               Satan and Demons were invented by organized patriarchal religion in

                David Icke is the guy who is responsible for the "lizard people" meme. The guy was clearly tapped by some sort of cosmic energy or something and it drove him completely bonkers. He speaks a lot of truth, but just like Alex Jones, he then hits you with a right hook made up of nonsense words.

                 "Alien presence" isn't dependent upon whatever David Icke thinks or says.

                 Our unsuitability for this planet is probably one of the biggest clues.

                <p>
                 There are 1500 people a year claiming to have been abducted in what looks
like a generational program for inter-breeding.
If that isn't odd enough, these abductions are totally ignored by government and science.

                 The Roswell Story continues to echo as a cover up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Disclosure Project shows how many professionals -- both military and civilian -- have 
had sightings and/or have seen evidence of bodies and/or UFO's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many witnesses to this history -- some who were involved in the cover-up, as well, such as 
Lt. Col. Philip Corso who wrote "The Day After Roswell" -- Bob Lazar who was involved with
reverse engineering of UFO's at Area 51 -- and many others whose names aren't as well known.

                   Well, aliens seem to be PHYSICAL enough to have been flying around in UFO's ...
and crashing one in Roswell, New Mexico in '47...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They also seem to be physical enough to be abducting people and 
carrying out experiments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Maybe you're too frightened of these concepts to actually open your
mind to them.

                    Did...did you seriously just refer me to Ancient Aliens? Wow dude. Wow. So you're intellectual for believing in little green men, but I'm frightened and scared for thinking that maybe they're demons? Your viewpoints don't make a lot of sense but you seem to be very offended that I don't believe in your idea of "aliens." Also, UFO's are nothing more than the government testing out experimental aircraft devices, but there is a good chance that they got the blueprints/data on how to build them from something on "the other side." But no, there are no little green men on Mars, or flying around in spaceships. God is real, and so are demons. Sorry if that bothers you. I may be many things--I may even be slightly crazy--but I'm in no way frightened of abstract concepts, you twit.

                     Rumors are that the Reptilians are demons ... :)

                     I'm not offended by your lack of understanding of reasons for keeping
open minded about "alien presence" ... I'm just surprised.

                    <p>
                     Most of what our government has was taken from aliens in reverse-engineering.
If they could do what the UFO's do, they'd be doing it.
Likely they're working with aliens in some way have been for decades -- probably
back to Ike days, at the least.

                    <p>
                     Can you prove that "god" is real -- any god?
And there has never been a "Satan" or "Devil" until organized patriarchal religion
needed a way to frighten members into obedience.  And, sell Exorcisms, of course.

                    <p>
                     More than likely the "god" story has more to do with "alien presence."

            The seven emotional stages of grief are usually understood to be shock or disbelief, denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, and acceptance.  The public is stuck in stage one.   I remember a while back, Denver news did a story on who were the customers of child traffickers.  Average businessmen, they looked as normal as pie.  You would expect them to look evil and sleazy.  All hollyweird/political creeps coming out of the woodwork, people are just getting over the shock of that.

              It is possible to refute. It's hard for people to change deeply held beliefs, but with enough evidence and time to process the new evidence, it's certainly possible.

            Youd be amazed at how many people are willing to listen when you don't use the retarded fucking name pizzagate. Seriously. Stop. Never use the name again. Jesus fucking christ.

              I agree completely. If someone completely goes into Triggered Mode as soon as the words "pizza" and "gate" and put next to each other, that's just proof that the person you're talking to is a braindead piece of shit zombie who isn't going to listen to anything you have to say, anyway. I'm tired of being fucking patient with normies. REEEE.

             You don't have to use pizzagate when discussing the issue with skeptics. You can talk about how the Catholic church protected its pedophile ring for years before it was exposed and that there's a similar ring in the government. Many people find that very believable.
            </p>
            <p>
             But pizzagate is a useful name because it helps to identify those involved. They love to hide in plain sight, which was fun and games until their code words were exposed. Now when you see Miley Cyrus draped in one pizza-related out after another, or the young Olsen twins singing "Gimme Pizza" with it sexually laced and pedo code words, or Stephen Colbert doing creepy pizza sketches, or pizza places using satanic artwork or disguised pedo symbols, red flags go off, showing you where to look further.

              You'd be amazed at what the masses will call "just a coincidence." Everything is meaningless to them, the signs and symbols, they're blind to all of it because they look at the world through their programmed lenses.

             I have friends that won't listen and mock me.  Whenever they post SJW stuff about Roy Moore I tell them it was debunked because politicians can't be pedos.

             EXACTLY.  I have believed the same since the very beginning.  Said essentially the same on a long-ago post and was crucified.  Add the suffix "gate" to any "happening" noun, especially with initial reporting will be seen as a complete mockery.  So, there, I said it again.

            Crazy isn't it. If I talk about local pedo's people will listen.  If I talk about rich, famous pedos, they think I am being an absurd conspiracy theorist .  Anyways I lost all of my friends and family. They think I am nuts now, but when they needed advice before, I was the person they looked for.

             Hang in there. Eventually nobody. will be able to deny it. Its a toss of the dice when we try to expose the truth to someobe. Kydos to you for putting it on the line to make a difference. If you are fortunate, thise people will return to you and apologuze for ignoring your service to them.

              No my relationship is done, like 5 months ago so his family goes with him.  I really don't want any of them back, its been a blessing. My friends they will wake up someday, the problem is so wide spread it's hard to ignore, anymore. Thank you, for the words of encouragement.

             I know how you feel. I'm teetering on the edge of my relationship ending because my girlfriend is a very "asleep" person and she gets infuriated whenever I bring up anything PG related. Especially when I start bringing her favorite false idol, Johnny Depp, into the conversation. It's crazy how much our families, friends, and loved ones are among the "sleeping masses" who worship Hellywood and its minions.

              Choose your battles, friend. Its hard, but maybe they will cone around. You cant know what is in Someone's heart and circumstances change with time. Maybe your GF will start to notice from another source and then you give her the talk when she's ready.

             Look at all the trouble Flynn is in, and rumor is he is taking the fall to protect his son.  The son that tweeted about PG.  It seems TPTB are still very much in control.  Trump has some kahonas though, the muslims tweets showed the man has no fear.

              I think they're  both heroes.  It is a shame what has been done to Flynn, over one false statement.  Waste of time and money, unless it set up to this way to drain the swamp.

               You're misreading the importance of what just happened.
              </p>
              <p>
               Flynn is being charged with one criminal count, but that does not mean he is only guilty of one crime.   He cut a deal for cooperation.  In exchange for testifying aganst others he will not be sentenced for his other crimes and his son will not be indicted.
              </p>
              <p>
               Basically Mueller is controlling the flow of information.  Manafort will likely be charged with more crimes as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               George P. only pleaded to one crime. And he is giving "active coopertion" meaning he probably wore a wire.
              </p>
              <p>
               Manafort and Gates have been charged with many crimes and are facing heavy jail time.  If they got the maximums, they would get over 70 years in prison.
              </p>
              <p>
               Flynn pleaded to one crime and will cooperate.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mueller is letting people know that he now has inside information.   This is a communicating to others to make a choice.   Do you want to cooperate or do you want to face serious jail time.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you were thinking of lying to protect the President, that decision becomes much harder to do if you know an insider like Flynn is cooperating.

               It's weird, how all hell broke loose over the PG tweet.  Like Tom Cruise in that eyes wide shut movie.  Like every reporter that dared to speak about it seriously.  Hell broke loose.  But folks felt safe enough recently to speak out against hillary, that is a sign that power is breaking down...changing hands...

             The tenure of their dependence upon you for advice was bound to be limited.  They had to leave the nest eventually.  In their future endeavors, you have armed them with the truth.  Ashes to ashes.

             Well said.  Opinionated, I have always been, whether right or wrong, however, the discerning difference is the rational, opinionated vocalist is  amenable to LISTENING  to  dissenters who articulate their differences, as in... Hmmmm, maybe he/she made some good points, need to think about that...  Those days are gone.  I don't hear dissenting opinions anymore.  All I have heard is vitriol or complete disinterest from 99% of those either"close" to me or just acquaintances. Gotta keep thinking maybe that the 1% begins to think...Hmmmm, I need to check this out...

              The crazy thing is I can't go back to being one of them anyways, and they want to continue living a lie, because it  hasn't affected them,
and they don't want to put in the time to research, outside of tv. This is the reason it went on so long, and would continue on.

               I feel ya. I stopped talking about it to my family and friends. I finally decided that they would not become convinced and that the support network was more valuable than attempting to continue. It took a long time but the memory of me trying to convince them finally faded and its sort of like it never happened now. But like you said I will never be one of them again. Or for that matter like almost anybody else. The dark occult practicioners call the sleepers "The Dead" for a reason. Your family probably seems almost dead, robotic, and lifeless to you now, as well as most other sleepers. They call the sleepers "Dead" for a good reason.

                for reminding me that I'm not alone for feeling the range of emotions that I experience daily since having woken up. It's a lonely place to be sometimes, but I can't go back.

                  You're not alone, that's just what they want you to think. I have been fortunate to have a husband and some friends and other family who question everything and are truth seekers. What I have found is that most people have been made to feel like their believes and knowledge is "crazy" or "out there" so they stay quiet. I'm always surprised by who I find out is actually awake to what goes on in this world. Don't feel discouraged, you really are not alone!

                 It is lonely yes, but every once in a while I make one of them think.  When I see an article about an accuser that I know will impact them, I call them and say Wow, have you heard this?  I only do it when the evidence is overwhelming, that way they have no recourse.  I just actually did it a few minutes ago.  I have a post up now about a famous conductor who has been accused.  My friend just called and said she had a wonderful time at the Opera, a treat from a friend.  I said Oh, have you heard the story about James Levine, No she said and I read it.  This opened the discussion of statute of limitations and other things.  I know she is not as convinced as I am about all this, but I know I now have her thinking.  Sometimes there is a Glimmer of Hope  :))

                   I really discovered it by accident, the first time it worked.  I thought, Wow, they are asking questions.  Even if they were not the ones I wanted to hear, at least they were not pushing me off.  So I have done this about 3 times now.  No strict converts yet, but at least no cold shoulders!

                I know what you both mean.  You are describing my story as well.  But one thing I have that they don't have is the power to know what is going around me now. I am no longer a walking zombie like they were (although I was always more willing to believe and question) their minds are closed, mine is open.  I have cleared out the cobwebs and they have not.  This is my reward.  Now I have an Inward Smug Feeling and it feels really good.  Enjoy the fact that you Will Never Be Like Them.

            It's not far-fetched. The media is making it seem an impossibility. Look at the way The Pedophile Queen describes it. She gets the audience to laugh at how absurd it all sounds, but then she throws in the kicker. It's that some strange crazy loner actually BELIEVED the fantasy and went down to Comet Ping Pong to free the children!

            You can see how important the false flag was to "debunking" the conspiracy theory. Not only was the hard drive destroyed, but there was tangible proof of how deranged and DANGEROUS it is for people to believe such things. Further, it brands all people that do believe in such theories maniacs.

             A Call For An Uprising mentions this a lot, how anytime PG is brought up by a publication, or mentioned by old KILLary herself, they always describe it as "AN ABSOLUTELY INSANE CONSPIRACY THEORY THAT STATES THAT JOHN PODESTA AND HILLARY CLINTON WERE RUNNING A CHILD SEX RING OUT OF THE BASEMENT OF A PIZZA PARLOR." They do that because, when the story is described in such a way, it triggers the sleeping masses to giggle, shrug it off, and dismiss it. Comedy is a hell of a weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
             Take the Law &amp; Order episode they did about PizzaGate. The guy who is playing the "Eddie Welch" character storms into the pizza joint, pumps his shotgun and starts screaming "WHERE ARE THE KIDS? WHERE ARE THE GIIIRRRLLLSSS???" They make the whole thing seem crazy and laughable, so that when its brought up, people will think of it as being tied with fiction.
