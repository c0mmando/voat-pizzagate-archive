<p>A judge ruled Thursday that federal prosecutors — among them, U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta — broke federal law when they signed a plea agreement with a wealthy, politically connected sex trafficker and concealed it from more than 30 of his underage victims.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said that the evidence he reviewed showed thatJeffrey Epstein had been operating an international sex operation in which he and others recruited underage girls — not only in Florida — but from overseas, in violation of federal law.</p>
<p>“Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him.,’’ wrote Marra, who is based in Palm Beach County. “Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.’’</p>
<p>Instead of prosecuting Epstein under federal sex trafficking laws, Acosta, then the U.S. attorney in Miami, helped negotiate a non-prosecution agreement that gave Epstein and his co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution. Epstein, who lived in a Palm Beach mansion, was allowed to quietly plead guilty in state court to two prostitution charges and served just 13 months in the county jail. His accomplices, some of whom have never been identified, were never charged.</p>
<p>Acosta agreed to seal the deal, which meant that none of Epstein’s victims, who were mostly 13 to 16 years old at the time of the abuse, were told about it until it was too late for them to appear at his sentencing and possibly reject the deal. Upon learning that Epstein had pleaded guilty without their knowledge, two of his victims filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida in 2008, claiming that prosecutors violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, which grants victims of federal crimes a series of rights, including the ability to confer with prosecutors about a possible plea deal.</p>
<p>Marra agreed, saying that while prosecutors had the right to resolve the case in any way they saw fit, they violated the law by hiding the agreement from Epstein’s victims. Marra’s decision capped 11 years of litigation — which included the release of a trove of emails showing how Acosta and other prosecutors worked with Epstein’s high profile lawyers to conceal the deal — and the scope of Epstein’s crimes — from both his victims and the public.</p>
<p>“Particularly problematic was the Government’s decision to conceal the existence of the [agreement] and mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility,’’ Marra wrote. “When the Government gives information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein’s attorneys, scant information was shared with victims.’’ The U.S. attorney’s office in Miami declined to comment.</p>
<p>Brad Edwards, the Fort Lauderdale attorney who brought the case, said he was elated at the judge’s ruling, but admitted he is bitter that the case took 11 years to litigate, blaming federal prosecutors for needlessly dragging out the case when they could have remedied their error when it was brought to their attention in 2008.</p>

<p>“The Government aligned themselves with Epstein, working against his victims, for 11 years,’’ Edwards said.“Yes, this is a huge victory, but to make his victims suffer for 11 years, this should not have happened. Instead of admitting what they did, and doing the right thing, they spent 11 years fighting these girls.’’</p>
<p>While the victims ultimately would like to see Epstein go to jail, the judge’s ruling stopped short of issuing a remedy or punishment. He gave the government and victims 15 days to confer with each other to come up with a resolution. It’s unclear what that resolution would be.</p>
<p>Edwards conceded that Epstein’s sentence isn’t likely to be overturned. He was released in 2009. But victims’ rights advocates say that other charges can still be brought against Epstein if more victims come forward in other jurisdictions. There has been no statute of limitations for sex trafficking since 2002.</p>
<p>The decision follows a three-part series published by the Miami Herald in November, “Perversion of Justice,’’ which detailed how federal prosecutors worked in concert with Epstein’s lawyers to arrange the deal. Since then, the U.S. Department of Justice has launched a probe into whether federal prosecutors committed any wrongdoing.</p>

             Bingo! I believe Epstein was creating the compromising videos that Bill Clinton would vet in his private home theater built by Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein bragged about building a theater in Bill's home so they could watch movies together. I believe Bill was watching different movies, movies to make sure they captured what they needed on film, before they moved ahead putting someone in a powerful position.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is how it works. And this is 'why a server was built' and placed in Bill's basement when he left the White House. To carry on with the Bush CIA program.

              Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you for this. This is 1000% believable for them to achieve what they have. Can you imagine the SICK deprived shit they enjoy eating popcorn watching together. Just like the Podesta underground “media room”. These sick fucks can’t get enough torture and snuff. Again right back to the Franklin case as you well know. Thanks for this.

             Yep. Although I'm still not sure whether they just used this as a pretext, to justify the plea deal. It seems nothing ever came out of the 'info' he allegedly gave them.

            This is a bit frustrating tbh. So they broke the law, but they won't be punished, and the plea deal will not be overturned?
           </p>
           <p>
            This means that victims will probably experience a lot of pressure during the next two weeks.

              I used to wonder that myself. What is coming to light now seems to be that Mueller (head of FBI at the time and friends of the Clinton’s) would have been the one Epstein made a deal with not Acosta. While Acosta was the prosecutor and ultimately the one to sentence and sign off on it, it actually came from higher up on the totem pole...

               Oh it surely is - but make no mistake - Acosta complied, and saved his ass...err...I mean his career. It totally sucks that he was rewarded with the job of Secretary of Labour.
              </p>
              <p>
               And it sucks, too, that the Q followers think that Mueller might be a white hat. At least some of them do, don't they?

                It was a thing for a while, yes. I haven’t heard anyone mention it in a long time. Imagine a group of almost 100,000 people on reddit sharing ideas and theories. One person comes up with a crack pot theory and “evidence” of why they feel that way. Now that gains traction and people jump on board because they can “see” it too. Doesn’t mean it’s true just that some people can be naive and believe anything.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q has never said such a thing Nor hinted at it. Now the media uses that to smear the movement. That’s the internet for you though. One mans delusional theory becomes the media’s weapon. Either way what we are talking about are facts not theories. I like facts.

                 Thanks for clarifying. I thought everybody in the Q movement thought that Mueller is secretly on Trump's side, while seemingly investigating him.

                  A lot of people think Q followers do. 95% however do not. You will find a lot of misconceptions about Q anon. It is really something you have to look into yourself otherwise you are only going to get what the media wants you to know about it. They won’t tell you about all the times Q has been right on months before any media coverage of events.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Anyway screw Acosta. Hopefully something comes from this and he will get punished or be forced to tell what he knows about Mueller, Clinton’s, and isn’t Wasserman from around there? It’s all a steaming pile of corruption.
