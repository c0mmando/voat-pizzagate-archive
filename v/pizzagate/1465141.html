             Me thinks this shit is real, but me thinks that comet-pizza has been a distraction from the Andrew Kline ( besta pizza ) shops all up&amp;down the road owned by the Saudi's. Most likely comet-pizza was a place where the wet-ops just unwound.

             Besides Israel is it that we cannot criticize? Alex Jones is a NEO-CON whore monger for Israel? Yes or NO?

             Well its a PUN on the Bromance between TRUMP &amp; PUTIN, did they ever even meet?  Not, but that didn't stop the MSM from calling it a bromance.
            </p>
            <p>
             U also have to admit that the MSM now has Alex Jones on the defensive, me thinks within a week they'll be accusing Alex of being a PEDO, this is how these people operate.

             On that point say the JOB was to go in and KILL James Alefantis, he may not have been there or maybe locked himself behind that famous hidden door bathroom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once Welch didn't find kids or Alefantis, he gave himself up, which was probably not what the CIA planned, this may very well be an MK-ULTRA manchurian-candidate that went soft on a mission.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there is theory that he thought he was the 'lone ranger' went in to save the women&amp;kids, didn't find anything but faggots ass fucking each other, puked threw his guns down and walked out.
