He has been credited in numerous media accounts with spurring the probe by the US AG\'s office in Brooklyn, leading to Raniere\'s arrest.  (Raniere and Mack stand trial on October 1).  The New York Post identified Parlatto as the reporter who first broke the story last June of women being forcibly branded.
Here is an archive of Parlato\'s extensive investigation from Nov 2015 - May 2018.
<a href="https://frankreport.com/category/frank-parlato/">https://frankreport.com/category/frank-parlato/</a></p>
<p>The prosecution for Raniere and Mack has revealed in a court filing that there are 90 companies of entities &quot;affiliated in any way with Keith Raniere, his teachings, his purported \'technology,\' his purported \'tools.\'  The Frank Report had previously identified 77 companies/ entities months ago.  The government listed them as part of a discovery motion, seeking an order to seal certain evidence from the public - mainly to protect the names of alleged victims.

<p>475 domain names are believed to be registered by Keith Raniere associates such as James DelNegro, Nancy Salzman, Pam Cafritz, and Jness (Robbie Chiappone and Steve Ose originally registered many of the names).

<p>Much information also recently appeared on 8chan about Raniere\'s &quot;companies&quot; with many url\'s provided.  I will highight only a small part of it...</p>
<p>The Society of Protectors (SOP)
It is a secret group created by Raniere to teach men how to be men.  Among the teachings - men control the world; women are subordinate to men; men are polygamous by nature; women should accept the polygamy of men.  The rest is disgusting and can be read. </p>
<p>World Audience</p>
<p>It is a talent management and event production company based in LA.  Its executives have worked with iconic figures in all genres of music who have collectively sold over 250 million records and headline stadiums, major festivals, and the Olympics, as well as won Grammys, MTV Awards, and more.</p>

Has consulted with US legislators, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former State Minority Leader Tom Daschle, among others, as his non-partisan focus advises government leaders on the real world challenges artists face in the current climate of the industry.</p>

She develpped an innovative, patent-pending product that easily helps multiple caregivers track and has an added incentive of a sticker reward for the children at the same time.</p>
<p>There are companies that are all inside of family homes in Andover, MA.  Homeless encampments and weird businesses inside of every single home.  It all started 4-7 years ago.</p>

            Well this explains many of the NXIVM leader Rannier's connections to organized crime among others including Cindy McCain, John Kerry, Clinton's, and Hollywood. This has been going on for a very long time.

             And now we come back to the subject of John McCain…
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bronfman family was the king behind the throne of the organised crime empire in Arizona – a crime empire that spawned the political career of John McCain.
            </p>
            <p>
             A man named Jim Hensley was well known in mob circles as a gangster in Arizona and was exposed in the seventies – by a man who was then killed in a car bombing in 1976. Hensley’s daughter married John McCain and the Hensley family was a key sponsor of McCain’s political career. Like the Bronfmans, Hensley was also involved with alcohol – as owner of the biggest beer distributor in Arizona. But what the media never mention is that the Hensley gangster fortune that backsMcCain is, in fact, a branch of the same bootlegging and racketeeringfortune of the Bronfman dynasty of Canada…

             It was mentioned on the news again this morning.  Again nothing about children.  I guess some of us are getting impatient (myself included).  We have waited so long.  Please Dear God, let this be it.  These bad actors that present themselves as Holy Rollers and Do Gooders, which they are not, need to bet outed.  All of them.  The more their names are in print in conjunction with NXIVM the better.  We must keep posting their involvement.

            Most of the presidents were PRI from what i understand(correct me if i am wrong), and if so then this now turns into one of the largest political scandals in history. It would span both Mexican political parties, and would be  a direct connection to Mexican politics and human trafficking.

             OMG.  I hope this all comes out.  Salinas, Nieto and Fox and who knows who else.  Calderon left Mexico and is living in the US.  They allowed him to live here.  I am sure he must be involved as well.  If all the bad actors are named, there will be a huge stock drop.

            Great post! Here's hoping that the persistance of this pizzagate forum can score some similar results some day. Frank Parloto is lucky to be alive what with his Mexican connections.  All I do is comment but I really do admire and appreciate the work effort of all the Pizzagators. Should we have a logo of an alligator chomping down a slice of pizza?  Or maybe Alefantis  in a pizza costume. I do hope that we can eventually pull Alefantis,, Hillary and the Podestas back into our crosshairs.
