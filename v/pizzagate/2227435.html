           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dr. Manning, being a longtime resident of the Columbia University area, the school that Obama allegedly attended, began an intense investigation into Obama’s educational background and discovered some profound discrepancies.
According to Dr. Manning, Obama (born in 1961) enrolled at the very pricey Occidental College in Los Angeles, California in 1979 where the CIA recruited him in 1980. Since its inception, the CIA regularly recruits college students. He was, by his own admission, a “C” student, a dope smoker and a member of the Marxist Club at Occidental, a co-educational liberal arts college. In 1981, Obama allegedly transferred from Occidental to Columbia University to major in Political Science with a specialization in international relations. It is atypical for a student to begin their education in one four-year school and then transfer to another school. Columbia University requires that incoming students pass certain academic requirements which Obama obviously lacked. However, Columbia had a foreign student program and the CIA has major connections and influence with Columbia and some of the nation’s other educational facilities. Interestingly, Zbigniew Brzezinski, known to have ties to the CIA as early as 1959, was on the Columbia University faculty (1960-1989) and was in charge of the Institute on Communist Affairs. He was also Obama's mentor. Brzezinski was President Carter's National Security Advisor (1977-1981) and recently admitted that his objective was to entice the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan in December 1979.

           <p>
            The CIA needed Muslims or others who could easily blend into the Muslim environment in the Middle East. The CIA persuaded Columbia University to extend their foreign student program to Obama, now a Columbia student, so that he might travel to Pakistan and enroll in the universities around Karachi in addition to the Patrice Lumumba School in Moscow.[1] The school, one of Russia’s most prestigious universities was founded on February 5, 1960 as The Peoples’ Friendship University of Russia (PFUR). It was renamed the Patrice Lumumba School on February 22, 1961. On February 5, 1992 the university re-adopted its former name. According to their web site, “The main aim was to give young people from Asia, Africa and Latin America, especially from poor families, an opportunity to get University education and to become highly qualified specialists. The students were admitted through non-governmental organizations, governmental establishments, and the USSR embassies and consulates.” [2]
           </p>

            Obama, perhaps as an undercover agent, may have been the lead agent in the arms and money supply for the CIA-trained Taliban Army against the Soviet Army war machine. His actions were integral to the Taliban’s success in their opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Officials have publicly acknowledged that Obama went to Pakistan in 1981. There is no way of knowing how often Obama traveled between Pakistan and Russia. According to Dr. Manning, Obama was an interpreter for the CIA during the war in Afghanistan. When Obama completed his CIA operations in the mid-1980s he returned to the United States. Apparently, the State Department then maneuvered his entrance into Harvard Law School. The CIA has always functioned as the president’s personal agency for black operations throughout the world. It also has connections to federal and state politicians. It managed to arrange Obama’s entrance to yet another elite school in 1988.

            Percy Ellis Sutton, a civil-rights activist and lawyer, was the Manhattan Borough President (1966-1977). He was an intelligence officer with the Tuskegee Airmen, the name of a group of African American pilots who were part of the 332nd Fighter Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Sutton entered Harlem politics and became a leader of the Harlem Clubhouse, known as the “Gang of Four” which has controlled Democratic politics in Harlem for at least fifty years. His Clubhouse allies were New York City Mayor David Dinkins, Representative Charles Rangel, and New York Secretary of State Basil Paterson, father of David Paterson who replaced Spitzer as New York Governor in 2008. Percy Sutton wrote a letter to Harvard officials requesting that they admit Obama as a student after a hiatus of five years (from 1983 when he allegedly left Columbia to 1988).
Despite a five-year absence from the rigors of college activity Harvard accepted Obama where he allegedly excelled. On February 5, 1990, students elected Obama as president of the venerable celebrated Harvard Law Review, the highest student position at Harvard Law School, a term that lasts for one year. [3] After graduation he could have worked in any leading law firm except that he lacked the proper citizenship qualifications which would have come to light during the interview and normal background checks pursued by major law firms. Moreover, his academic deficiencies at Occidental College would have disqualified him from the top law firms. Furthermore, he was a CIA operative in the Middle East during the time that he was supposed to be attending Columbia University. Therefore, despite his supposed Harvard achievements, Obama became a Saul Alinsky-style community organizer in South Chicago which alleviated the necessity of providing a legitimate background check. [4]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1990, Obama accepted a job with Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a law firm which represented civil rights cases but also represented Rezmar Corporation, owned by Chicago slumlord, Tony Rezko. The law firm helped Rezmar get more than $43 million in government funding. As early as 1995, Rezko started contributing to Obama who had high political aspirations. In 2003, Rezko was a fundraiser for Obama’s Senatorial campaign as part of a group that raised over $14 million. In 2006, the authorities found Rezko guilty of sixteen out of twenty-four charges filed against him.

            Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood LLP, the same law firm that Harvard graduate Michelle Robinson worked hired Barack Obama for a short summer stint then as an associate from 1988 to 1991. Robinson became his trainer and supervisor and, as such, may have handled any background information. Robinson, through the efforts of Valerie Jarrett, then-deputy chief of staff for Mayor Richard Daley, became an assistant to the mayor. Robinson later became an economic development coordinator. Obama married the politically connected Robinson in October 1992 in the Trinity United Church of Christ, giving him green-card style citizenship and needed credibility. [5] In 1993, according to the Records at the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of Illinois, attorney Michelle Obama became “voluntarily inactive and not authorized to practice law” per her request. After she relinquished her hard-won law license, Michelle Obama worked for the University of Chicago Medical Center where she received a very generous annual salary of $317,000. [6]

            <p>
             With pressure from the Departments of State and Defense, officials issued a new NSC directive, NSC 10/2 on June 18, 1948. It stipulated that the CIA could conduct “covert” and “psychological” operations both of which the US Government sponsors against foreign states or groups. However, these activities should be “planned and executed in such a way as to provide plausible deniability if revealed. Approved CIA clandestine activities, according to the directive, include “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such operations should not include armed conflict byrecognized military forces, espionage, counter-espionage, and cover and deception for military operations.” [17]
            </p>

            During the 2008 presidential change-promising campaign Obama avoided detailed questions about his alleged years at Columbia by saying that he was very anti-social and totally uninvolved with the academic community. Further, he claimed that he lived off campus. For someone who loves the limelight and never misses an opportunity to engage in rhetoric, it is an enigma that he would isolate himself from typical college activities unless, of course, that is simply justification to account for his absence during the time that he was supposed to be attending Columbia.
           </p>
           <p>
            In mid-February 2010, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs alerted the reporters who regularly cover the White House that they were not to ask certain questions including Obama’s job with CIA front company, Business International Corporation (BIC), following his alleged attendance at Columbia University. Nor were they to ask about Obama’s school records during the time that he attended Occidental College in Los Angeles (1979-1981), and his records at Columbia. [18]
           </p>
           <p>
            If Obama was a CIA operative who, with political connections, super funding and media puffing, made it to the White House – is he still a CIA operative bent on destroying what is left of the American economy? Harry Truman, a 33rd Degree Freemason, to implement global governance, established the CIA. Freemasonry is a front group for a certain group of people whose objectives are world governance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wayne Madsen claims that his Kabul sources claim that President Obama has maintained a personal correspondence with a private military company (PMC) whose senior personnel includes numerous Afghan Mujahedeen-Soviet war veterans who fought with the late Northern Alliance commander Ahmad Shah Massoud who became Afghanistan’s Defense Minister in 1992 and who someone assassinated on September 9, 2001, allegedly by al-Qaeda agents. The firm is also involved in counter-insurgency operations in Colombia, where Obama is building seven new military bases, and in Iraq.
           </p>
           <p>
            Henry Kissinger said, “Conflicts across the globe and an international respect for Barack Obama have created the perfect setting for the establishment of ‘a New World Order.” [19]The Satanic Illuminati, whose objective is world dominance through one-world governance, infiltrated the upper echelon of Freemasonry long ago. People claim that Barack Obama is a 32nd degree Prince Hall Freemason. Certainly, Prince Hall Freemasons, Jesse Jackson and Charles Rangel, supported his presidency. [20] Whether he is a Freemason or not, he might indeed be the chosen vessel of the Jewish proponents of a New World Order. There is no doubt that he is a Zionist asset who has surrounded himself with Zionists like Rahm Emanuel, a duel citizen of both Israel and America, a questionable allegiance the Supreme Court would not acquiesce to with our close neighbor, Mexico. Despite his campaign promises, Obama intends to pursue the same Neo-Con policies in the Middle East as the previous administration, as evidenced by his speech before the 2008 AIPAC Policy Conference where he was introduced by his friend, Lee Rosenberg, a fellow Chicago resident. [21]
           </p>
           <p>
            Jerusalem's newspaper, Ha’aretz, dated November 13, 2008, reported, “In the Chicago Jewish community many people really are long-time friends" of Obama. “Some of the older people in the community say that they ‘raised him,’ while others half-jokingly call Obama ‘the first Jewish president.’” Dr. Henry Makow wrote, “The Illuminati can take a particular child and manipulate things from behind the scenes and open all the right doors for this person, and they can get them the grants and the schooling and everything they need and adding impetus to this person’s career is the mind control that is steering them in that direction too. The end product is you end up with somebody who is an engineer or a lawyer or a politician who is very highly qualified for what they are doing. Barack Obama fits this description.” [22]

             Michelle Obama helped to improvise a scheme to shift low-income charity cases to other area hospitals in order to make room for insurance-carrying patients to enhance the hospital’s profitability. She did this under the guise of improving the health care of the Southside residents. In 2006, in conjunction with this scheme, Obama persuaded the hospital to hire lawyer and extremely skillful public relations mastermind, David Axelrod, to conjure up a publicity campaign to market this fallacious program to the poor black community, and make it not only palatable but highly desirable. [7] Axelrod became Barack Obama’s Senior Advisor and undoubtedly masterminded the publicity behind the current healthcare scam the Obamas have hoisted on the rest of the country after its test run in Chicago, a city tarnished by its long-term corrupt political shenanigans.

           <p>
            Dr. Manning, an African American, has called Obama a “good House Negro” and a “long-legged Mack daddy,” and an “emissary of the devil.” When Dr. Manning gave an interview on Fox News, he said, “We also have to talk about his character.” Dr. Manning has also questioned Obama’s eligibility to serve as U.S. President due to the fact that Obama has not complied with numerous requests to reveal his birth records. In fact, Obama has spent thousands of dollars in an attempt to conceal those records.

Dr. Manning, using information from hired investigators declares that Obama never attended Columbia University. He asserts the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) “Columbia University will not divulge whether the “alleged” diploma issued was in the name of Barry Soetoro or Barack Hussein Obama. No public record exists regarding the diploma.”
2) “Obama alleges he attended Columbia in 1982, 1983. But, the investigators have been UNABLE to turn up a single shred of written documentation for the years 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984 that show where Obama appeared on a school roster, register, faculty memo, bulletin board, school awards, dean’s list; where Obama’s name appeared in a yearbook, club record, fraternity record, extra-curricular activity member roster, student newspaper, student radio or TV activity; where Obama appeared in any records as a worker, employee, laborer in or about Columbia University; where Obama enrolled in any sports activity or program.”
3) “As a graduating senior in 1983 he does not appear in any Political Science (his major) or Graduating Class yearbook or invitation records.”
4) “There is absolutely no documentation of any kind to show Obama attended, lived, worked or played at Columbia University during the investigated 4 years.”
5) “Interviewed professors, college employees, students (who were at Columbia during the years in question) have failed to turn up a single person that can remember Obama. This is irrefutable evidence. Think about your own situation if Obama had attended your college? A “now-famous” person went to your school? Many would be able to say, “Of course I remember.” At Columbia, not a single person has been able to say he or she remembers Obama.” [8]
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama’s background would have been relatively insignificant if the bankers had not selected him as a presidential candidate. However, with funding from George Soros and other international bankers who wish to establish global governance, he ran for office. Obviously there would be records that revealed some very personal details of his life. Passport records are particularly revealing. The CIA recruited John O. Brennan, who speaks fluent Arabic, after his college graduation. Brennan became deputy executive director of the CIA in March 2001. In about 2005, about the time that the bankers were interviewing Obama as presidential material, Brennan left government service and became the Chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA) and the CEO of The Analysis Corporation (TAC) now known as Sotera Defense Solutions, quite conceivably a CIA front. At the same time, Brennan began working with the Obama 2008 presidential campaign as Obama’s top intelligence adviser.

            In March 2008, officials cited The Analysis Corporation for penetrating the files of presidential candidates Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and John McCain in the State Department’s passport office. Investigators maintain that the target of this illegal activity was Obama’s passport file for the sole purpose of cleansing the records of information that would jeopardize his candidacy. The breach of the passport records of the other candidates was to create confusion. Passport files include an applicant’s name, gender, social security number, date and place of birth, and passport number. Additional information may include birth certificates, naturalization certificates, or oaths of allegiance for American-born persons who adopted the citizenship of a foreign country as minors. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee oversees the State Department. Joseph Biden, now Obama’s Vice President, was the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the breach. [9]

           <p>
            A State Department employee, Lt. Quarle Harris, Jr., per his supervisors, had access to those records and scrubbed the passport records to erase any mention of Obama’s CIA activities and his personal information. Thereafter, Harris decided to cooperate with the FBI about the unusual break-in. Soon thereafter, someone killed Harris. [10] People discovered his body in his parked car. Someone had shot him in the head, execution style. [11] Obama used the Indonesian passport, originally issued in the name of Barry Soetoro, to travel to Pakistan to assist the Afghan Mujahedeen during the American military buildup.[12]
           </p>
           <p>
            After his election, in late 2008, Obama attempted unsuccessfully to appoint John O. Brennan as the Director of the CIA, perhaps as a reward for his service? Brennan, who supported torture and the transfer of terrorist suspects (extraordinary rendition) to Diego Garcia or other areas where interrogators could torture them, withdrew his nomination. Then, Obama appointed him as his counterterrorism advisor, a position that did not require Senate confirmation. In April 2012, Brennan admitted that the CIA engaged in drone attacks in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. He maintained that these activities should be legal and that they were moral and effective. [13] [14]Brennan also helped to reorganize the process under which officials, via the Disposition Matrix database, added people outside of war zones to the list of drone targets. This reorganization helped to Obama’s power over the life and death of American citizens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama again nominated John O. Brennan as the Director of the CIA. The Senate scheduled a vote on Brennan’s nomination for March 6, 2013. Despite Senator Rand Paul’s 13-hour filibuster defining the Obama administration’s immoral use of drones, the Senate confirmed Brennan for the office. Paul said, “No one politician should be allowed to judge the guilt, to charge an individual, to judge the guilt of an individual and to execute an individual. It goes against everything that we fundamentally believe in our country.” [15] Official swore Brennan into the office of CIA Director on March 8, 2013.

            The CIA is not an intelligence-gathering agency. The Truman Administration authorized “psychological warfare” by the newly established National Security Council in NSC 4-A of December 1947 which allowed covert operations during peacetime. This document made the CIA Director responsible for psychological warfare and placed it under the exclusive direction of the Executive Branch. The CIA has un-vouchered funds which allow the agency to operate without exposure or Congressional oversight. [16]

              Or they were the guys who wanted to free their country from kike banking tyranny and for that reason were attacked by the kike-run world? Don't forget who declared war on whom. International jewry declared war on Germany already in 1933. I suppose you like to blame the victim, though.

             If you really another alt of that loser, then you can correctly answer the following.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Which mod did you threaten with slitting their throat, and why?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Can't answer or refuse to answer and that shall be irrefutable proof that you are an imposter pretending to be that loser Donkeyhote (who named himself after an idiotic loser afraid of windmills). Then again why would anyone want to imitate that piece of shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have the specific comment saved, so I'll know if you're bull shitting me.

              Probably vindicator or MF obviously.  And my name shows I am a well-read individual.  Yours is from a children's comic book and shows you're a normie faggot.

                 Your graphology is completely off compared to that cunt. Why anyone would ever want to be like that pedo is beyond me. Yes, I know some of his dark secrets, like what he had on his computer.
