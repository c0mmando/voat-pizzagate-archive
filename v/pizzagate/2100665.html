She mentions child-sized coffins and exactly how they are used in programming. As we speculated earlier about a child being placed inside with bugs to traumatize them, Hoffman states that she was placed inside during programming and was told that the coffin was where her anger was to stay, but no bugs or other creepy crawlies are used in the process, or at least Hoffman doesn\'t state this in the book. I know this is difficult to understand the process and why it\'s required for the child to &quot;keep&quot; their anger inside the coffin, but she explains it much better in the book. She also mentions how it\'s important that the coffin be snug, so they\'re designed to fit children of various ages and sizes.</p>
<p>I bought it for my Nook at $8.99. I\'m not sure if there\'s a free download like Cathy O\'Brien\'s book, but please post a link if you find one.

<p>Also, I believe there was a thread about this book just recently, but I can\'t find it. When I stumbled upon the book during my Nook search, the term White Witch is a term I remember seeing in a VoatPG title, but never clicked on the thread. If someone can find it, please post.</p>
<p>I probably should\'ve read Hoffman\'s book &quot;The Enslaved Queen: A Memoir about Electricity and Mind Control&quot; first, but didn\'t realize this until I\'d already started to read &quot;White Witch&quot; as she refers to &quot;Enslaved Queen&quot; several times as a means for deeper understanding about what she\'s talking about. <a href="http://us.karnacbooks.com/product/the-enslaved-queen-a-memoir-about-electricity-and-mind-control/35443/">http://us.karnacbooks.com/product/the-enslaved-queen-a-memoir-about-electricity-and-mind-control/35443/</a></p>

           I just started reading "The White Witch in the Black Robe: A True Story of Criminal Mind Control." I'm about a quarter of the way into it. She mentions child-sized coffins and exactly how they are used in programming. As we speculated earlier about a child being placed inside with bugs to traumatize them, Hoffman states that she was placed inside during programming and was told that the coffin was where her anger was to stay, but no bugs or other creepy crawlies are used in the process, or at least Hoffman doesn't state this in the book. I know this is difficult to understand the process and why it's required for the child to "keep" their anger inside the coffin, but she explains it much better in the book. She also mentions how it's important that the coffin be snug, so they're designed to fit children of various ages and sizes.

            The more I'm seeing this white witch and all seeing eye symbolism in ruling elites satanic rituals.  I'm realizing Tolkien and cs Lewis knew exactly the symbols of evil they were fighting.
