<p>&quot;The details of the suit are as follows: AOL maintains a database of hash values assigned to images classified as child abuse so that they are more easily identified/tracked. AOL was simply sending NCMEC the images without bothering to open them and verify the contents. So NCMEC was violating the right to protection from undue searches and seizures by opening what AOL sent.

<p>Steve case is the co-founder and former chief executive officer and chairman of AOL. His name is on the PRISM code words that the NSA monitors. Could he have been involved in the transmitting of CP through the internet while he was CEO of AOL. Why is the NSA monitoring this guys name? As they are with the following words: Soros, Whitewater, DynCorp, Bubba the Love Sponge, Artichoke. Other known CIA program names can be found on this list. Could they be targeting journalists who are onto their case and about to bust them? </p>
<p>I believe this list will be useful in connecting the dots. Ive noticed some words released by the DHS have numerous mentions in music. Specifically the La Familia cartel. Could they be working with the CIA to bring in drugs to the country?</p>
