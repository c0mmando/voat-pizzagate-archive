<p>&quot;In 2014, the staff of Media Matters voted to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Media Matters management had declined to recognize the union through a <strong>CARD CHECK</strong> process, instead exercising its right to force a union election.&quot;</p>
<p>What did FBIAnon say about &quot;the cards&quot; being important? Apparently, in 2014, the management of Media Matters (hello Mr. Brock) opposed joining a labour union on the basis of a &quot;card check&quot;.

<p>All this implies that, based on card checks, Media Matters would have (maybe) had to join a different union than the SEIU. Since management put a stop to this course of affairs, this means that, somehow, management was not happy about the potential outcome of a card check, or management somehow had a preference for the SEIU. Maybe because the SEIU gave them the most money: <a href="http://workerfreedom.org/hypocrisy-matter-media-matters">http://workerfreedom.org/hypocrisy-matter-media-matters</a> ... which casts doubts on the integrity of the union election. Seeing as how this company is run by David Brock, this should not surprise anyone.</p>
<p>Maybe all this means nothing, and I actually don\'t know shit about how unions operate in the US, but the words &quot;card check&quot; got me triggered. So ... what happened here in 2014? Which MM employees felt betrayed, and why? Why was MM management so keen on the SEIU that they risked all this bad press? What alternative outcome of the card check process did MM management want to avoid, and why? What employees within MM had their feathers ruffled over this?</p>',

            FYI some more info regarding cards- near the bottom of the article.  It also highlights Andy Stern's close ties with Obama

            snippet:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Labor's top priority has been a bill called "card check," which would make it easier for unions to organize.

            Interesting on how much money is spent in support of the Dems and how much influence was given in return.

            Here is a story linking unions to cards to Nancy Pelosi's home state of California in a crazy way.   I think it says that the state govt. was trying to lure union employees into a scam... what???

            The "card" clue has always been at the back of my mind, and there are several plausible theories...here's my thinking..maybe

            could reach out to FBI anon and see if he would be able/willing to expound or drop more clues regarding this.  If nothing else, I am generally curious.  I mean, what if it was that pic of Podesta and crew playing cards?  That would be insane!  Or the CARD unit in the FBI?

              "royal family of Qatar had, during 2011, purchased their version of the painting for a record price variously estimated at between $250 million and $320 million from the private collection of Greek shipping magnate George Embiricos."
IMO the painting looks shit, (im not a heathen honest, there is a lot of art i do appreciate)  could the deal involve a container of slaves?  Anyone looked into the shipping magnate?

            I don't have any basis for this, but could it be that some of his "clean-up" men were among the group of 50 employees ?  Was he trying to keep their exposure level down?

             FYI Perkins Coie is also the firm that that has done slews of work for all kinds of Dem pols and their orgs.  DCCC etc.  They are also the firm connected to the woman that was served the papers by Shawn Lucas.  They have a really long history with 'the Democrats.

              Card check (also called majority sign-up) is a method for employees to organize into a labor union in which a majority of employees in a bargaining unit sign authorization forms, or "cards", stating they wish to be represented by the union

              Thank you.  I was up til almost 3 am trying to figure the process out and now due to your comment I get it.  So yes, maybe these are the people that wanted to be part of doing the "dirty work"  or the "clean up" ?
