<p>The mainstream media dutifully reports Epstein\'s previous conviction for soliciting child prostitution, but do not give his whole history.

<p>Epstein\'s companion Ghislaine Maxwell....is alleged to have procured pubescents for the prince....Multiple sources....allege that <strong>[her father Robert] Maxwell was a long time asset of Israeli intelligence.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Wexner &quot;command center&quot; phone numbers (in my humble opinion I doubt this was related to the trafficking of people)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The portrait painted of Epstein prior to his prosecution for pandering is peculiar. He made a fortune managing the money of Les Wexner. In 2009 Epstein\'s phone book was released on the internet.</p>
<p>Wexner\'s name is there with individual listings....There are also two separate phone numbers listed as “command center.”</p>

<p><strong>Friends in the media</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epstein has an armored Mercedes with two phones or two armored Mercedes. His girlfriend\'s father is alleged to have smuggled weapons to Israel and now he and said girlfriend are accused of providing teenage sex slaves to a member of the British Royal Family. <strong>Why the tabloids have not linked all these publicly documented facts together might have something to do with their</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/qBZs8"><strong>being owned by his friends.</strong></a> Epstein\'s phone book proves he has many friends in media <a href="https://archive.is/SmyqZ"><strong>and government.</strong></a> The Mockingbird will examine all 98 pages for more persons of interest in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Did Epstein traffic minors to or from Asia? (also see my comment)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>While Epstein was managing Wexner\'s money it would have been hard for him not to notice that the latter\'s company was <strong>importing clothing from Hong Kong on an airline run by the CIA.  Southern Air Transport....</strong>  Its regularly scheduled flights from Hong Kong for The Limited were the cornerstone of the local development push to convert Rickenbacker Air Base to Rickenbacker Airport in the 1990\'s. </p>
<p>At the same time that Rickenbacker became a transport hub for cargo carried by CIA backed airline that was both known to smuggle drugs and involved in the Iran-Contra affair, Wexner\'s connections to organized crime were <a href="http://archive.is/U0WcS">named in <strong>a Columbus Police intelligence report.</strong></a> </p>
<p>A <strong>trucking company linked to the mob was also named in that report.</strong>  That trucking company carried up thirty percent of The Limited\'s ground cargo. <strong>The CIA handled the air cargo, the mob handled the ground cargo and Epstein balanced the books.</strong> </p>
<p>Southern Air Transport ran into money trouble and it\'s route was taken over by <strong>Evergreen Aviation, which also had a history of connection to the CIA.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Landmark Aviation private terminal is CIA-linked</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evergreen...still keeps one Boeing 747 in Columbus and <strong>still maintains regular service to Hong Kong.</strong> The only terminal that can serve that aircraft is owned by <strong>Landmark Aviation.</strong></p>
<p>Landmark Aviation\'s core business is <strong>fixed base operations....</strong>  <strong>An FBO is a sort of private air terminal,</strong> fueling and maintenance facility for charter, business and private aircraft.  Some FBOs are very bare bones. <strong>Landmark\'s Columbus FBO is a posh facility with showers, conference rooms, a dedicated concierge and even its own Customs Inspection.</strong></p>
<p>Landmark Aviation was alleged to have been the <strong>FBO of choice for the CIA\'s</strong> extraordinary rendition program, known as the <strong>“torture taxi.”</strong>  Under that program, people were kidnapped, flown to black sites around the globe and tortured for months or years. European governments were aware of this program and some even issued <a href="https://archive.is/VbOoI">arrest warrants for CIA officers involved.</a></p>
<p>Landmark Aviation cleaned up its image somewhat....It was sold and split with FBO operations being put into trusteeship. One of those trustees was <strong>former CIA director James Slesinger. It was later sold to the Bush family friendly Carlyle Group.</strong></p>
<p>Landmark Aviation took over its Columbus Customs facility from Lane Aviation less than a year after the latter opened it in partnership with former. Epstein\'s phone book listed Lane Aviation as the sole FBO in Columbus. It is not known if he still uses it, but Landmark\'s facility does have more posh amenities fit for billionaires, princes, presidents and spies.</p>
<p>The allegations being leveled against Epstein include <strong>trafficking minors for sex across international boundaries. The logistics of getting a minor across a border for such purposes would be much less complicated with the help of a Customs facility located in a friendly private facility operated by a company familiar with covert operations and making people disappear.</strong>  </p>
<h3>Taking one step back to look beyond Florida and another step back to look into history and one views a different picture. It is of a billionaire and a spy\'s daughter providing minors for sex to very important people in a house full of cameras. That same billionaire has an armored Mercedes....business relations with multiple CIA backed airlines, connections to the mob, many friends in the media....</h3>

<p><strong>There are important dots to be connected in these fascinating articles by Gerry Bello and his associates.  They are linked as sources in &quot;Columbus is where the Torture Taxi and Lolita Express meet.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Wexner War&quot;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While [Robert] Maxwell’s ties to the Mossad are well-documented....The London Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follows: “He’s Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he’s a concert pianist, property developer, a CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad.” </p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Parties, the Procurer and the Purification of the Prince&quot;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABC News host Barbara Walters, and New York Daily News publisher Mort Zuckerman were....friends of Jeffrey Epstein....Epstein\'s many friends in media (like Fox News owner Rupert Murdock and Mario Calvo-Platero, long time editor of Il Sole 24 Ore) and government are a phone call away, ever ready to clean it all up.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The Shapiro murder file -- Police accidently release a report linking Leslie Wexner and the Mob&quot;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Arthur] Shapiro was a partner in the now-defunct Columbus law firm of Schwartz, Shapiro, Kelm &amp; Warren. The firm “represented the Limited,”</p>
<p>The Shapiro report relied on information from Columbus Police Intelligence summaries...</p>
<p>This team....stumbled on to the....Shapiro report while investigating missing documents relating to escort services and prostitution.  
</p>
<p>The report analyzed “unusual interactive relations between the following business organizations” and then listed: the Major Chord Jazz Club, in which Jerry Hammond was a prinicipal; The Limited; Walsh Trucking Company; the re-named Schwartz, Kelm, Warren and Rubenstein law firm; Omni Oil Company; the Edward DeBartolo Company of Youngstown, Ohio; and local developer John W. Kessler.</p>
<p>Wexner’s business “relations” with Francis J. Walsh, the owner and chief executive officer of Walsh Trucking Company out of New Jersey, were explored...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;From the predicate facts presented, it appears that Les Wexner had established contact with associates reputed to be organized crime figures, one of whom was a major investment partner and another was using The Limited headquarters as a mailing address.”</p>
<p>“It is not known whether there are other such figures among Wexner’s associates, but it can be hypothesized that the Genovese/LaRocca crime families might consider Wexner a friend,” Leupp speculated.</p>

            While [Robert] Maxwell’s ties to the Mossad are well-documented....The London Sunday Times quoted a New York social observer describing Epstein as follows: “He’s Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he’s a concert pianist, property developer, a CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad.”

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            [Arthur] Shapiro was a partner in the now-defunct Columbus law firm of Schwartz, Shapiro, Kelm &amp; Warren. The firm “represented the Limited,”
           </p>
           <p>
            The Shapiro report relied on information from Columbus Police Intelligence summaries...

           </p>
           <p>
            The report analyzed “unusual interactive relations between the following business organizations” and then listed: the Major Chord Jazz Club, in which Jerry Hammond was a prinicipal; The Limited; Walsh Trucking Company; the re-named Schwartz, Kelm, Warren and Rubenstein law firm; Omni Oil Company; the Edward DeBartolo Company of Youngstown, Ohio; and local developer John W. Kessler.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wexner’s business “relations” with Francis J. Walsh, the owner and chief executive officer of Walsh Trucking Company out of New Jersey, were explored...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "From the predicate facts presented, it appears that Les Wexner had established contact with associates reputed to be organized crime figures, one of whom was a major investment partner and another was using The Limited headquarters as a mailing address.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “It is not known whether there are other such figures among Wexner’s associates, but it can be hypothesized that the Genovese/LaRocca crime families might consider Wexner a friend,” Leupp speculated.

            Epstein was a very valuable deep state asset he worked for Mossad and CIA and whoever else wants videos and photos of power players having sex with kids. Epstein should be bumped off it's amazing he's still alive and hard to believe he still does what he used to do but maybe he does. I find it hard to believe anyone of wealth or power would be dumb enough to get mixed up with him after all his negative publicity. But he got off with a slap on the wrist all because of the videos and photos he had hidden away that is what kept him out of prison his blackmail treasure chest in Israel the Mossad has all of it and they know how to use it.

            A probable modus operandi of Epstein: cozy up to as many wealthy people with connections as possible, invite them aboard the Lolita express pedo-plane for some fun and games and partying, and make a secret video. Now he's in position to negotiate (extort) a deal using their legitimate business credentials to make them offers they can't refuse, for drug-trafficking or child trafficking hidden in legitimate shipments of imported merchandise.

            "The allegations being leveled against Epstein include trafficking minors for sex across international boundaries." AFAIK he, allegedly, flew minors around in his Lolita Express; also, allegedly, he was given two (or three) 12-year old French girls as a birthday present; also he, allegedly, had a European 'sex slave'.  It is new to me that he is an alleged child sex trafficker other than those.

            Bob Fitrakis, the writer of that article is a very well known lawyer now in Ohio and together with Cliff Arnebeck are involved in a RICO lawsuit against the co. that holds the info of the exit polls from the 2016Primary.  They have long tried to   get after many of the election fraud actors in Ohio, including Michael Vu who was convicted but escaped jail while his employees went instead.  His reward for doing their dirty work was being sent to LA to do the same there.  And he did.

              You are right!   I remember being on reddit now and following the whole thing about the Provisiional Ballots.  They had white out on the tables while doing the audit.  Dead give away.  Whiting out one and adding it to another.  By law he was suppose to let the pollwatchers go in and observe but he only let them look through a big plate glass window.  That is against their State Constitution.That is what they do slap them on the wrist and then move them around.

            John Ashe was killed last year when a barbell fell on his neck.  He and Lap Seng were expected to be questioned about their involvement .  Another CT  I presume?  I met Wexner while working at VS, so I have a personal reason for seeing him go down. Although the stores were beautiful (that was before the Bordello look) the Mgrs.screamed at us and one even threw a box at me.  Another tidbit was that Epstein bought his largest mansion in NY from Wexner for $1.  This report imo, should be the start of an investigation.

I always wondered if Les used his connections..
This is impressive, and i saved it all. 
you never know what searches will find if you have things like this to start from.
