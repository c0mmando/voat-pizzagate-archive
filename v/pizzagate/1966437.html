<p>at first I was like oh shit nigga, the Dutroux shit is leaking out! Then I remembered it was Daily Mail, and I it got me thinking. Why the fuck is MSM disseminating this info after they never spoke about it back in the day?? I\'m from Canada, but I\'m young, and was just a tyke during the scandal so I obviously don\'t remember shit, but neither do my parents, or anyone else for that matter. No one knows shit about Dutroux, it was memory holed a long time ago, especially when alt media was in its infancy, and way less people knew about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Now all of a sudden this lady jumps on the scene and out of the blue she starts talking about how top politicians used to run a train on her 8 year old self at eyes wide shut parties during Ted Talks, the same ted talks who give praise DARPA, and other liberal faggy globalist bullshit. This doesn\'t sit right with me</p>

<p>Remember the Franklin Scandal, remember how the main leaker was John Decamp... who was John Decamp?</p>

In 1975 he initiated Operation Baby Lift, which evacuated 2,800 orphaned Vietnamese children.[2] He was later assigned to serve as an aide to former CIA director William Colby, who was Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam at the time.

<p>tl;dr: this family with CIA background and connection to Alefantis have an awfull lot of connections to Childprotectionservices. really makes you think</p>
<p>As for John Decamp... I know he doesn\'t hide it (his CIA backround) but what the fuck. What if this whole thing was a controlled limited hangout leak. Remember Ted Gunderson from the FBI? what if he was in on it too? What if you are only allowed into positions of power if you are part of the club. Maybe it was misdirection? You guys need to remember that people like Geraldo Rivera were the ones propagating the Satanic shit, Geraldo was acting like he was on a crusade to stick it to the satanists, look at this shit</p>

<p>Maybe it was just too juicy of a story to pass up, but still, something doesn\'t sit right with me. When MSM media giants invite these people on their show it just feels like one giant game of charades on the public. Idk what to believe anymore, but now I\'m going to be more critical of all this shit, I\'m not going to blindly believe Ted Gunderson and John Decamp or Nick Bryant. Maybe they were good guys... or maybe they wanted to control the narrative</p>',

            <p>
             Why would someone who released all of his material sifted and, according to Zbigniew Brzezinski, actually written by AIPAC and the Mossad, then again by the New York Times, be an enemy of the NWO?  Assange may be running the whole thing, after all, he is a 9/11 holocaust denialist, advocates the persecution of the Palestinian people openly, advocates war on Iran openly, is silent on drug running in Afghanistan and, though he has leaked material, follows Pentagon policy as though he were drawing a pay check....Wikileaks to intelligence professionals is very simple.  It is an Israeli “cover and deception” program, run by them, financed by huge money, backed by Rupert Murdoch, the ADL, AIPAC and continually advocating right wing causes in the US, pushing for world war and covering for serious war crimes while reporting only select minor ones....As for Assange, he is the “mini-me” of Netanyahu, a Romney supporter, Islamophobic, right wing, anti-Palestinian, pro-war and 9/11 holocaust denialist....When the US wants someone, they use rendition, a claimed right, and can get anyone they want, anywhere.  If all the intelligence services in the world want Assange dead, why is he the safest man on earth?

             "I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."---Assange

            Yes PG also sure looks like a limited hangout.. The more i go into the rabbit hole the more it all looks like controlled info..

             yea but it still uncovers a legit pedoring. Remember, Wikileaks are like the top dog zionists. They leaked out the Bilderberg 2008 attendee list, they have dirt on all the elite. They leaked damaging info on democrats because they switched allegiance to the Kosher rightwing (just in time for war)
            </p>
            <p>
             Who is notorious for being the warmongering party to advance their agenda overseas? Republicans obviously. Democrats= subversion and social engineering (destroying nuclear family, fag parades) on the homefront, Republicans= Useful idiots to fight wars

            Ted was married to Anton LaVey’s widow (Anton LaVey founded the church of Satanism) at one point. Ever since I found that out, I’ve been skeptical.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m sure I’ll get downvoted to oblivion for this, but are we sure Wikileaks isn’t a limited hangout? There have been rumors that it was taken over by the CIA last October.
           </p>
           <p>
            I first wondered that when George Webb started drinking and self-destructing after going to DC to investigate Seth Rich. It was after then (I believe) that he started saying he was Mossad and all of that. Is there any chance he stumbled onto something bigger and is now being forced to ruin his own credibility?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have even wondered at some times whether Pizzagate is a limited hangout.

             Pizzagate is 100 percent confirmed psyop/limited hangout, the problem is... it's still real. Trust me bro, I've lost my marbles going down this fucking rabbit hole, it's like 50 percent psyop and 50 percent real. Wikileaks is indeed a mossad front (and has been since its inception) but again, it's still REAL leaks. Read this bro

             reminder that the fitzinfo guy only gets this half right. He thinks that it's 100 percent bullshit, but mossadleaks actually threw democrats under the bus
            </p>
            <p>
             Think about it like this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              -Democrats are going forth with Iran deal to the point where you can hear the oyveyying across the ocean, Jews are pissed!
-Julian Assange (Mr. 9/11 wasn't an inside job) is now tasked with leaking damaging info to cripple the democratic party because the kosher rightwing warmongers are more in line with the Greater Israel agenda
Pizzagate is astroturfed by the likes of Alex Jones and the rest of the kosher media right before the election (strategically controlled leaks, remember this)
             </p>
             <p>
              Then the Edgar Maddison Welch Falseflag happens Proofs:
              <a href="http://archive.is/RTZNo">
               http://archive.is/RTZNo
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Alex Jones is worried about being marginalized by MSM so he backs down (he even interviewed a crisis actor)
             </p>

             <p>
              Washington Post and other CIA outlets run a damaging anti-conspiracy theorist campaign that works because there was a convenient falseflag to scare goyim

              Please provide at least ONE piece of credible evidence that Wikileaks is a Mossad creation. I ask you for this because most of the people involved in Wikileaks are anti-zionist.

                I'm not an American so it's likely that I have a different world view. Publishing diplomatic cables that Netanyahu argues "strengthens" their position is not evidence of Mossad control. You're going to have to do better than that for me, sorry.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wikileaks is releasing cables of what diplomats are saying, they are not "creating" the cables. Again, I ask you for credible links between the Mossad and Wikileaks.

                  Yes, I agree that the Dershowitz "infiltration" of Wikileaks is suspicious but you need to know that most of the people connected with Wikileaks are not Americans. They come from countries that don't have the high level of Zionist Influence (dual US/Israeli citizens.) as the US does.

                  I'm still not persuaded but you have the right your opinion.

              So you’re saying the GOP is working with Mossad to take down the DNC, and Wikileaks is their method? Very interesting, I’ll have to look into that more. But I wonder, aren’t dems and repubs besties behind closed doors? And if the New World Order is the end game either way, why try to take the other one out?
             </p>
             <p>
              I almost wondered if they got caught with their pants down by Wikileaks at first, so they gave Pizzagate up as a sacrificial lamb, of sorts. A controlled sacrificial lamb. Which doesn’t make it any less real, it just makes it a lesser offense that they are willing to give up in order to hide more serious offenses. Hillary &amp; Podesta’s time seems to be running short, while elite families like the Du Pont, Rockefeller, SC Johnson families go untouched. What do you think?

               At the end of the day, it's different factions of pedophiles and Jews warring with each other. Remember, Russian Jew Oligarchs don't wan't the Syrian oil pipeline to fuckup their natural gas hegemony. Both Russian Jews and Liberal Jews pay homage to Israel. Israeli intelligence just switched allegiance to Russia out of the blue. I suspect this has alot to do with Jeffrey Epstein pedo scandal that both Trump and Clinton were implicated in. They have blackmail info on both puppets and then they make them dance. Jews wan't to goad american goyim into fighting for greater Israel, what better way to do that then Install the rightwing warmongers back into power. People like Steve Bannon are wannabe warhawks salivating over the thought of WW3, they can't wait.

            Oh, just so ya know, OP- - Many folks here like to WORSHIP certain personalities and prefer to not hear the truth.  Be prepared for a lot of downvoats.  :)

             Good. David Seaman fanboys can downvote my shit into oblivion. Some of us are too smart to fall for some ex-huffington post Jew cointelpro agent.

            Thanks for your informative post.  I have been wondering about DeCamp because of his Operation Baby Lift involvement.  PLUS, despite being VERY outspoken he is still alive.  PLUS Nebraska is a unicameral state, so legislators there are VERY powerful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ted, OTOH, is DEAD.  He was poisoned with arsenic. AND he found the McMartin tunnels.  AND I know some SRA victims he assisted.  AND he is blasted constantly posthumously by satanists.  (NOT so with DeCamp.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, the Geraldo shows were a circus.  But EVERY Geraldo show was a circus; that's what he was known for.  (see broken nose episode)
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm still clinging to Ted by a tenuous string.  :)

             He was a fantastic actor if he was bs-ing.  There is a real ring of authenticity in his delivery and voice, and material for that matter. - Ted I mean.
