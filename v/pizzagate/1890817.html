            G.W. is not disinfo. You guys are foolish if you do not understand what is going on. The news report that went up on /pol/ last night to be released by an agency today is from him, JASON Goodman, Liz Cronkin, Hagman&amp; Hagman, Dr. Jerome Corsi. All independeant researchers, journalists working in DC right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday he met with Congressman Trey Gowdy, Devin Nunes, and Harbolt (the guy that went on CNN asking for investigation into Seth Rich) This is why he asked he was informed of Seth Rich murder and Awan brothers.,G.W. also got videotape of Debbie Wasserman Shultz practically running from him after confronting her over Seth Rich murder &amp; Awan brothers Pakistani ISI infiltration.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are hundred of people working with and providing him info. He is a journalist that is what they do.

             Makes it hard to come here. Fucking sucks because we were making progress and doing good work. Might just have to resort to good ol' street justice to take these sick fucks down. The pedos will not win.

            I'm sorry but George Webb is a disinfo agent. The majority of what he puts out is good info because that info is sent to him by people legitimately researching and busting their behinds, then giving him the info to report their hard work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Info mostly found on 4Chan.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, when George reports his own stuff, his soliliquies, he puts out stuff designed to demoralize.
           </p>
           <p>
            I swung over there day before yesterday to see what Seth Rich info was available. Made it to about mid-yesterday when he started suggesting that Seth Rich was not really dead and all these people who say he is are in on one big giant conspiracy. KimDotcom &amp; Assange are crisis actors?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, I know he said thats his alternate theory, but does that sound logical?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you saw that, did you feel let down?
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            To build you up, so as to make it possible to demoralize you.
           </p>
           <p>
            George seems a nice, pleasant guy. Of course he is.... would you follow a jerk?
           </p>
           <p>
            When he walks down the street, loudly speaking &amp; recording, why does no one turn and look at him? Not one person he passes looks at him.
           </p>
           <p>
            When he records, he is not looking into the camera that is filming him, he is looking off.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has contradicted himself numerous times.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, the majority of the info he puts out is good because other people have dug it up and given it to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            No skin off my back to anyone who chooses to listen to him, but he has an agenda and is being funded by someone, and is designed to demoralize....he's done it over and over. He emotionally builds, builds, builds to a crescendo, then throws a monkey wrench in it to get everyone emotionally off-balance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just know that if you choose to listen.
           </p>
           <p>
            4Chan usually has all the info George puts out before he gets it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each to his own, and if you choose to listen, best wishes, but be aware everytime he puts forth something that brings you down. That is by design.

            Both Day 214.4 and 214.5 are so dense with information, that I am going to have to listen to them again. He is talking about Dr. Sava, a friend of the Podestas. Then he goes into Kimdotcom, and 'school plays'. Very interesting. (I am not passing any judgement on GW being info, disinfo, or misinfo - as with any source, you can only use your intution on each info bit.)
