            WOWZER ... that right there .... No, I don't think the "liberal" media would want to destroy someone without evidence. It's not what the press is supposed to be doing. The fact you do seems to reflect on your credibility ... as does that rant.

            No one is attacking you, and if you confuse skepticism with an attack, you're out of touch with reality.

            You're a pro-Bernie commie? Even worse! And even worse worse, you're posting here answering a comment from a nobody? Yeah, no, Morgainn, sorry if I'm wrong and causing you pain, but I smell a con. It's the smell I smelled when attending carnivals and getting my newspaper route money siphoned out of my pockets by someone tricking me into paying for those games you could never win. I don't believe this happened, and the fact you're responding to a stupid post on Voat, sort of proves it. And if you're for that wretched Sanders person, you're not a liiberal, you're a commie. Good luck in getting people to believe you.Love how you're so traumatized by this alleged abuse that you put in an advert for your business. Yeah, most kids that are sexually molested would do that ... right ....

            I was on a dating site in the 1990's and Ben Stein contacted me. I live near D.C. and he told me he wanted a companion when he was here. He was married! I know it was him because I talked to him on the phone. He was a creep. I didn't go out with him. I stopped answering the phone and his emails. Why would I go out with a creepy old guy who was married? I probably still have his emails somewhere. I was about 23 at the time. Grosses me out to this day.

            I remember watching an interview on CNN with him and Ron Paul. Ron Paul said something about the heavy Jewish influence in our American institutions and Ben was very quick to scream anti-semetism. Ron Paul called him out on it and defended himself beautifully. The interview shouldn't be too hard to find on the interwebs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure Ben will find some way to scream antisemitism at the victim,

            Interesting that Ben Stein is one of the ONLY conservatives in Hollywood, they are trying to use this  to get rid of conservatism. Predictable.

             One of the only?  It's not the left trying to get rid of conservatism.  PG has little to do with partisanship of any kind.  It's the left and the right.  Both have guilt  Why?  Because it's not a political issue.  As annoyed as I am with some lefties arguing progressive ideas without knowing why and never wanting to work for anything (reminds me of hippies from the 60s).,..I'm just as annoyed with some of these righties who think everyone is out to get them and wipe out their conservative way of life and thought, because in their opinion, they're true Americans and anyone else who has a differing belief is a snowflake or is on welfare.  PG is not about political parties.
            </p>
            <p>
             They're all in on it and they're all in the same corrupt boat (more like a yacht, really...)  They create this imaginary issue of separation of political ideologies to keep the people divided, hating each other and therefore they can control us better.
            </p>
            <p>
             It'd be much better to know that they're all liars and corrupt.  Trump is one of them,  Hillary is one of them.  Obama is one of them.  Bill Clinton is one of them.  They're all guilty, they're all corrupt, they all have power and they want to control you and everyone around you so it stays that way.  It's called being complicit....and they ALL are complicit.

             I remember in 2007 and he was on an economic panel on Fox and he was laughing about a housing bubble.  He said it was crazy talk.  I never thought he was very insightful and always kinda curious why he was even on TV.

             You will never understand Pedogate if you think ((( politics ))) first.  Ben Stein is a talentless creep and he's ugly and unfunny. What else would explain such a long and undeserved career in both politics AND showbiz ?

              I don't, i use good judgement, down with all conservatives that are pedos, john mcccain, graham whoever it doesn't matter, I just see the left playing this political, that is ny whole point. If you think that Bill O is the worst sex offender on tv, come on, but he was taken down with allegations. We have to discern what is real and what the LEFT is using for their political agenda.

            I came across this while browsing the twitter comments on Edward Snowden's post on the FBI child porn site. This woman claimed she was abuses by Ben Stein (some actor) when she was 12.  Might be worth it to contact/look into.
