             Wow, good find thanks! You're on top of my local news more than I am haha.
The mobile unit used to search electronics still gets me....... just what

             Good catch. I don't want the guy to get unnecessary flack for this.
I'm really hoping I'm wrong about this case, that there's no CP and no abuse going on...
But with the FBI getting involved and pulling state police into a small town (population 1,700)............. I just don't know. :/

            Okay -- this one hits a little too close to home, and I'm fairly certain this has a high potential of being Pizzagate-related due to the nature of evidence being collected and the fact that the FBI and Indiana State Police were involved in executing the warrants on January 24th, 2018.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The subject matter of the investigation isn't being discussed at this point; warrants obtained by authorities through Wayne County Circuit Court have been sealed, preventing them from being viewed by the public.
            </p>
            <p>
             Folkner said the investigation began about seven weeks ago, but declined to say whether it involved computer crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It's too early on to disclose what the actual investigation involves," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              At least one investigator was seen transferring an Apple iPad and a laptop between the bakery and a mobile unit often used by police to search electronics by a Palladium-Item reporter at the scene Wednesday night
             </strong>
             .&gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Hagerstown Chief of Police Keith Folkner goes on to state that a theft of Bowman's laptop one month earlier was "unrelated." Bowman's social media page shows concern about the stolen laptop. Could be nothing, could be something. Police/FBI aren't obligated to tell the public the "whole truth" during an active investigation.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Authorities were on scene at the bakery for at least four hours and they also spent time searching a building just south of the bakery that holds equipment and other materials for the business.
            </p>
            <p>
             Folkner said the search warrants were not related to the recently reported theft of a laptop owned by Travis Bowman, the bakery's owner. Bowman initially posted on social media asking for the public's help in locating the device.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It's not linked to the burglary of (Bowman's) business or of his residence last week," Folkner said. "It's unrelated."The residence that was searched by police has not been entered into the public record, and the chief declined to share an address.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Child Services were involved. The FBI was involved. Everything about this incident in the sleepy little town is hush-hush.
What the hell is going on here?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             What agencies are involved?
            </p>
            <p>
             Folkner said the investigation is being led by Hagerstown police, though the department is receiving assistance from the Indiana State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wayne County Sheriff Jeff Cappa said Thursday his agency is not involved in the investigation and has not been formally briefed on its subject matter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Indiana State Police spokesperson Sgt. John Bowling referred all questions about the investigation to the Hagerstown Police Dept.
            </p>
            <p>
             FBI communications specialist Chris Bavender confirmed the bureau was involved in the execution of the search warrants Wednesday.
            </p>
            <p>
             "We were only there as support at their request," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
             She said she could not discuss why the FBI was involved in the investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Indiana Dept. of Child Services was on scene at the searched residence Wednesday night, but Folkner said they did not take a child from the home. It is not clear if the department will continue to stay involved in the investigation

            Here is the link to Bowman Bakery. The only thing I could find in a cursory overview Pedo-logo related are some Swirls on a frog's tongue, and the Heart-within-a-heart "little-girl lover" seen on some Valentines baked goods ------ nothing really out of the ordinary so far as I can tell.

             Please Share, If anyone has any information please please come forward, My house was robbed on New years eve. I went home from work with my laptop bag which has a lot of important information and my laptop for work along with our bank deposit. My house was tossed and they found that hidden in the house and took off with that bag. If anyone has any information please please call the Hagerstown Police department or the Bakery ASAP. I will even offer a reward to anyone who helps us located these. We are begging for the communities help in locating this or the person who did it. It is extremely important. Thank you!

            Very adamant that he get his laptop back... 
Perhaps it is a work-related computer.
Perhaps he didn't want anyone finding something not-so-work-related on there as well. But I don't want to speculate too much without more corroborating research.

            Can I call on the community to dig? More eyes-on could uncover things I'm missing.
I haven't heard any followup from the Palladium Item (Ricmond/ Wayne County Newspaper).
Can anyone find anything about this "Bowman Bakery" that is out of the ordinary? Travis Bowman?
Could be drug-related I suppose, but the fact that they seemed to be carrying out computers as evidence, and the fact that FBI is involved and is making this whole thing need-to-know makes me wonder....
