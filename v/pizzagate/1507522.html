<p>This gives us a time window. The email was sent May 14th 2009. Obama moved into the White House on January 18th 2009. </p>
<p>If this private party took place in or near the white house, it must have been between these two dates, one of 116 days.</p>
<p>Here\'s a (very rough)timeline of Obama\'s first year in office:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/kV3o5">http://archive.is/kV3o5</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>May 9 - Obama speaks at the White House Correspondents\' Dinner, along with special guest comedian Wanda Sykes.[181]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I searched podesta &quot;may 9th 2009&quot; and this is what I found, see last result: <a href="https://sli.mg/QgHqN1">https://sli.mg/QgHqN1</a></p>

<p>May 9th 2009 was also <strong>European Embassy open day in Washington DC</strong></p>

<p>These two simultaneous events could generate perfect circumstances to obscure a high profile get-together.</p>
<p>Additionally, may 9th 2009 had a full moon</p>

<p>Also, may 9th 2009 was a saturday, or a Saturn\'s day

<p>For those who still don\'t know what Saturn is to these people, here are two pieces currently in the Museo Del Prado in Madrid that shine some light on their idea:</p>

<p>Of course, all this proves nothing. But the Stratfor email references <strong>one of these 116 days</strong></p>
<p>If anyone has another candi<strong>date</strong>, let\'s hear them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if this sounds plausible, the WHCA might be a good target to further scrutinize and  research. As it turns out, nowhere I can find information on who else was on the board of the White House Correspondent\'s Association in 2009 besides the presidents. This info should be readily available somewhere, or not? Has it been scrubbed? What\'s going on here?</p>
<p>Chair of Correspondents\' Association at the time was either
Jennifer Loven - Works as marketing consultant director specializing in non profits <a href="http://gpg.com/team/jennifer-loven/">http://gpg.com/team/jennifer-loven/</a></p>

            After the White House Correspondents dinner, Vanity Fair always hosts a party at the French Embassy. It is possible, just like with David Brock's "After, After parties" that the WH party with the kids took place after the Vanity Fair party. If that is the case, we could look at who was at the Vanity Fair party for people who potentially went to this after-after party. I think we should assume that this party took place after the WHCD, it is in many ways the biggest party night in town. Also, it might be worth it to look at the WH visitor logs for this night, although the logs are incomplete, and if they were able to get children inside undetected, then getting pedos in undetected would also be possible.

            My take is that in relates
            <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2008/11/21/obamas-favorite-pizza-comes-to-dc/">
             to this event
            </a>
            where before Obama became president, the Ritz-Carlton hotel threw a party and brought in Obama's favorite pizza chefs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think the guy in that email has any first-hand knowledge whatsoever and is related something he heard.   Unless somebody finds another event it could be, I think it started as this event and through the game of telephone became Obama bring the food in and using the taxpayers to pay for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The White House Chef/Kitchen do have a budget and for a big event dinner, I wouldn't be surprised if they bring stuff in from other cities.  There was a chuck-wagon barbecue scheduled at the White House for a Congressional Picnic on 9/11 where they brought in a Texas barbecue crew.  There had been there setting up since 9/9.  They ended up giving to food to the cops and firefighters.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other possibility to look for would be some Chicago themed event.

            <p>
             Just found this.  Obama did have a pizza party in the White House on April 10, 2009.   Details are different than the gossip in Austin, but y'all can check this date.

            The people writing the email and talking about this are from Stratfor, the private intelligence company. One of them in relation to this email, which is about having their own 'Chicago Hot Dog Friday' says 'If we get the same "waitresses" I'm all for it!' (as in the same 'waitresses' wink wink nudge nudge that Obama had at his WH party). And then even if Obama had spent that much on hot dogs and pizza and flown them from Chicago for a party, why would these Stratfor guys be wanting to do exactly the same thing, getting the food flown in from Chicago, and questioning whether they should use the same 'channels' that Obama used? Come on, who uses 'channels' to order hot dogs and pizza? You call up and order it, there's no need for 'channels.' It just seems incredibly dodgy and is far more likely to be about something that is not actually hot dogs and pizza IMO.

             This isn't office gossip. This is pedophile gossip. He heard that Obama had children flown in from Chicago, and he was assuming that because the kids they had lined up were coming in from Chicago, that it would be the same people flying them in.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are assuming that by pizza/hotdogs he is talking about children. That's kind of a vital component to Pizzagate. There is no scandal if he is not using pizza/hotdogs as code for children.

              Right you are making an assumption. And if that assumption is wrong there is no scandal.  Your first paragraph is a conclusion based on that assumption which might be wrong.

             It's good to be skeptical. Just why didn't you name your account AmISure?

            <p>
             First, it's not some random guy in Austin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, although one cannot deduce this is about children, it is about something.
            </p>
            <p>
             Third, the waitresses part does imply first hand knowledge (how else does the guy know there were "waitresses"there)
            </p>
            <p>
             Fourth, yes it may be office gossip. But Stratfor isn't your average office. It is one of the largest private intelligence firms in the world.

              Yes, it is some random guy in Austin.  So he works at Stratfor and had his emails hacked.
              <br/>
              That gives him insight how?

              Do people not understand jokes?  There's a pivot going on.  From Obama's food to theirs.  Yes, they talk put waittreses in quotes.  After the pivot.

            I disagree. Why would he need to have hot dogs and pizza flown in from Chicago using the same channels if he was really talking about food? Knowing what we know now, about what those words stand for, I think it's crazy to think he is not speaking in code here.

            You're right, 65.000 is not much for these people. Also, I highly doubt they would use taxpayer money for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            It indeed sounds like they're talking about drugs rather than children. Search pizza are drugs or pizza and cocaine. There seem to be many pizza places surviving this economy selling drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in combination with the "waitresses" which were obviously prostitutes. Why would there be prostitutes in an occult ritual, it doesn't make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, it would be good to find out about this party regardless of whether this particular is about children or drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it wouldn't diminish the evidence from the commet instagram in my opinion. Because pics of children with hashtag codes for drugs implicates the same.

            Anyone found any info on the White House Correspondents' Association? I can find virtually no in depth info about this association and of what key people it is comprised of. Am I wrong or is this is fairly powerful association as it has been the direct media link to the president for decades?

             incorporated in 1961.  I don't see anything familiar in the list of officers, but if one wanted to try to connect any of them to this whole shebang, i am sure it wouldn't be too difficult:

            <p>
             this is the opencorporates page for the group - the officers (historical and current) are listed on their 'about' page here:

            Good work. I would like to add that the email also specifically says

           <blockquote>

             I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?

             How anyone can think that refers to actual hot dogs and pizza is crazy to me. Who needs to use 'channels' for ordering fast food for a start?
