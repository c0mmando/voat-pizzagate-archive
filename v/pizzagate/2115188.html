            I'll explain this all here once because many people ask me questions. So I can just say it all once. I also want to weigh in on what the OP said.
           </p>
           <p>
            As most of you probably know by now, Equineluvr, donkeyhote and all the other keyhote alts are the same person.
           </p>
           <p>
            Me and Equineluvr had a common friend. A trustworthy one that has a good reputation here. Before Equineluvr started showing his more psycho side, he was polite when it was just one on one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our friend here doesn't like confrontation or hurting people's feelings so he kept corresponding with Equineluvr. Equine opened up to him. He shared stories about his life and childhood and everything. He didn't admit he was gay tho. I will explain how I know these things to be true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our mutual friend here was tired of equine writing him all the time and equine was interested in a topic or case that he wasn't. I don't remember. But our friend suggested he write me because I was interested in that topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Equineluvr DM'd me months ago. It was before I knew he was a piece of shit. I know it's hard to believe, but he was VERY polite. I asked him why he's so mean in the comments and he told me that it's all part of a strategy. He's really arrogant and tries to say he's been on real murder investigations and is gonna write a book.
           </p>
           <p>
            I should explain, that I wasn't going to forums and social media before the election. This was all new to me. So I was really naive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right after I started talking to Equineluvr, Donkeyhote had a little tantrum in a comment section with me. It was my first experience dealing with Donkey. I wrote Equineluvr and gave him the link to go look at the horrible things that donkey was saying.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is when I first started having a suspicion that Equineluvr and donkeyhote were the same person... After he read the horrible things that donkey said, Equineluvr for the first time, started showing irritation with me. He told me that I needed to go apologize to donkeyhote because he was one of the best investigators here. I have a temper on me and I told him that I'm not apologizing to that asshole. That I didn't care if he was a good researcher. That doesn't give him the right to treat people that way, call women cunts, sluts and bitches, constantly hate on Jews and tear every thread apart with his mean words.
           </p>
           <p>
            From that point on, Equineluvr would bring donkeyhote up all the time. He told me that they DM a lot. He said that donkeyhote is sitting on a huge lead. I asked what it was. He said that he's not ready to share. They are doing more research on it first. So, he was trying to convince me that donkeyhote was this amazing investigator. He kept bringing him up and speaking SO highly of him, that I thought that they are either the same person or they are good friends. They shared all kinds of things about other people. Including DM's with other people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had been polite with Equineluvr, but a royal bitch to donkeyhote when we had the fight. I calmed down a little after equine told me about donkey and even laughed some because I just thought he was nuts, but still a good investigator. Them guess what? Donkeyhote started being NICE to me. He even apologized for calling me a cunt. So obviously the 2 were communicating about me or they were the same person.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all went downhill, when he started talking crap about people here that I knew were not shills. Like sweet Carmencita. I've told her. He hates her. That was our first disagreement. I didn't understand why this sweet woman who's here all the time trying to help, was someone that he hated so much and disrespected. I told him that we need to just agree to disagree on some topics because I wasn't going to argue with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is when it ALL turned around. There was a thread where Carmencita, Jem777, Darkmath, dressage, and I think Jangles. I can't remember the others. He wanted me to go to the thread and basically shill. To correct them and tell them what he told me to tell them. He said that they were shills spreading disinfo. I told him that I had not looked into the Racine issue enough to form an opinion. So, he wanted me to just take his word for it and go correct them and say what he told me.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is when all hell broke loose. I replied in DM and said this... (I blacked out the mutual friends name)....
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/7e62166fc8/42413.PNG">
             https://imgoat.com/uploads/7e62166fc8/42413.PNG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            That made him flip out. He then told me that he was going to go to the public voat comments and tell all he knew about me. He started spreading lies about me to make me look bad. He said I like to ask men about their pythons and the donkeyhote profile was saying that I asked for dick pictures and that he sent me some. So I proved that was a lie....
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/1d0c6e83f0/41553.PNG">
             https://imgoat.com/uploads/1d0c6e83f0/41553.PNG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So because of Equineluvr's threats to tell personal information about my life (he didn't know much, but still), the mutual friend shared a bunch of the personal DM's between himself and Equineluvr. Just in case equine tried to do that to me, I had that as insurance and took screenshots of everything and told him that I know far more about him than he knows about me so if he wants to tell my information then I'm telling his.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's when donkeyhote started arguing with me. Not so much with Equineluvr after I told him what I had. ME and our mutual friend started watching both profiles to see if we could tell if they were the same person. It became more and more apparent. They would also make mistakes and reply under the wrong profile. Here is just one. Equine responds to a comment that I left donkey...
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/416a75f4ce/40680.PNG">
             https://imgoat.com/uploads/416a75f4ce/40680.PNG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            After reading the DM's between him and our mutual friend, and how he acted like himself, talked about his life sincerely, described family issues and shared childhood memories, I believe that the person that he showed our mutual friend is the true person and that was under the Equineluvr profile. Also, when I was talking to him, he told me he had been engaged twice. Other things too. But then I found this....
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.fo/IIvJJ">
             https://archive.fo/IIvJJ
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again he says he was engaged twice, but it was to men! Other than the gay part, most of what he describes on this post is what he shared with our mutual friend. To our friend, he said he didn't have the cranial issue and he didn't mention he was gay. I wasn't going to share it, but he didn't believe me and said he calls my bluff. Share it! So I shared it.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in my opinion, he's a lonely bitter man in his 50's. He doesn't get along with people and we can all see why. He's evil. He is Jewish but hates Jews. He hates women, then I found out he's gay. He was probably picked on and bullied because he describes how he has a big nose and funny looking eyes. So, I think he just spends his free time online where he can be the bully and the smart one. He can put others down instead of the other way around.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found that he goes to the transvestigation sub. So, he obviously has some issues with gender. He may hate women because he wants to be one. He gets jealous when I bring up George Webb. He hates alpha males. I think the only way he can get a lot of attention and be able to feel tough is by being online where he cowardly bullies behind a computer screen.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this makes me believe that's he's not paid. He's not with NSA or anything like that. But, just a shill working for free because he finds it enjoyable. He's really dumb with anything tech related so you don't have to worry about him attacking your computer or anything. He's just simply a little useless bitch that needs a life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't feel that I did wrong by sharing what I've shared because everything about him were links or screenshots to what he had already made public.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why it's hard for me to ignore him. It became personal and I hate him. Especially since last night Donkey said that more American women should be raped!

             Actually, a sad story about the guy. I feel sorry for the underdog and that is what this depicts. He has been picked on and abused his whole life.  Striking out truly is his protective armor. He is still a dick though because he tries to verbally abuse people even though he didn't appreciate it growing up. I usually ignore him by spending little to no effort responding to his drivel. He expects a reaction to his comments. It makes his dick hard.  Just ignore him and it will drive him into the abyss. The unfortunate thing is we are here trying to help this type of person from this type of abuse and yet, he tries to deter this effort.  Maybe one day he will wake up and use his words to protect the kiddos instead of trying to verbally abuse posters. Pray for his soul that will piss him off too. BTW, upvoat.

             interesting. i'm also new to forums but not to cluster B personality disordered people. their first impressions are always charming but quickly devolve into their true, rotten inner state.
            </p>
            <p>
             i still think he's a shill. maybe not paid; i think he's personally involved. he's gay, so a friend of James Alefantis maybe? who knows, all i know is any random person would not spend
             <em>
              as much time
             </em>
             as he does here just to derail, and a regular cluster B would have a bit more varied expression to maximize histrionic tendencies, rather than stick solidly to "it's the Jews." horsefucker also seems schooled in a lot of disinformation tactics, in fact, he and donkeyhole almost exclusively communicate within those parameters. obfuscation comes naturally to all cluster B's but these two (one?) have a purposed, methodical modus operandi that screams shill.
            </p>
            <p>
             any random cluster B would have gone somewhere else already. donkey/horsefucker spend increasingly more and more time here, getting more and more wild and chaotic with very specific shill tactics (did you see the posts recently listing disinformation agent tactics? almost all apply to donkey, horsefuck, and areweshill.)
            </p>

               something else all three of them do - they find the weakest point, the most exploitable flaw or person, and attack it almost to the exclusion of all else. it's what they did to DarkMath - no offense, but despite his dedication he was a walking strawman...

                What do you mean about Darkmath? I never understood why so many people didn't like him. Darkmath was banned from Pizzagate. It should have been them. I'm not weak.

                 YOU aren't weak as a person, but you make yourself a target by arguing with them and showing your hand too often. manipulative people can't manipulate us if we don't give them anything to work with.

                 he was banned again?
                </p>
                <p>
                 he had a tendency to talk in circles without conclusion, speak too soon and say stupid shit that could be used against him later. i kind of liked him, kind of hated him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 edit: wow, really strange he was banned and they've never been reprimanded once. perhaps not all that strange though.....

                  I like Darkmath too. He goes to Pizzagate whatever. I think it's strange that he got banned when the others haven't. Darkmath became nicer over time. He said he's a Christian now. Equine/Donkey constantly picked at him.

                  When I first came here, I used to get my feelings hurt by shills. I know that's so dumb. I just wasn't used to it. I had never heard of people hating Jews either. I toughened up tho. Since it became personal with them, it makes me feel better to tell them off. That other one I was curious about because they've been here for a long time and had a lot of contribution points. So I thought maybe they had me confused with someone else.

                   i'm sorry that happened to you. it's not dumb, you're human. emotions are an aspect of intelligence, never be ashamed of them. it probably would have affected me if i wasn't so experienced in dealing with cluster B psychos...i've seen them all at this point, even know some IRL horsefucker types.

                  <p>
                   i noticed they rack up points by saying a few good things, dropping a few nuggets of truth here and there. horsefucker tried to get on my good side recently by upvoting me and admitting to it. it's a "come closer so i can slap you" technique, like he did to you in PMs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   i'm gonna go look for DM in PGwhatever. my only problem with him really was that he could be derisive towards women. other than that, i liked what he said about God.

             I don't dm with ANYONE YOU STUPID CUNT!  All your "evidence" is total bullshit, yet you cling to it because women are underachievers here.  FUCK YOU! THIS ISNT A CONTEST! You treat it like a fucking game with teams and sides and sportsmanship: THAT is why I fucking DESPISE you -- for being a ditzy, frivolous, annoying, absolutely useless bitch who calls me "shill" just for spite, even when I post concrete locations where kids might be brought.

             You won't redeem yourself for this, you filthy shiksa whore.  You have put SO much more effort into determining unknowable facts, like whether I'm equine, than into PG.  Youre a total disaster of a researcher, relying on YouTuber disinfo artists like Webb, not even understanding why that's bad!

            Yeah, DonKeyhote is an obvious shill buuuuuuttt, why is this your first submission and why is this post all over the place. ANOTHER SHILL POST, But this is a reverse psycology shill post using false premise. People do not fall for this, stick to Alefantis, Podesta, Rothschilds and all of the pedo artists that are good friends with them and the clintons.
