            It just dawned on me the purpose of these shill stories. It's to show and say "hey look at me! I was sex trafficked as a child and I'm fine now. I look good, I go to college" as if to convey to the unpilled that child sex trafficking can't be all that bad because the "victim" looks fine and got on with her life.

            Okay, so I went to her home page and immediately thought that something doesn't look right. She just looks too happy "The Future Is Bright" like what I call a "Googly-eyed" Democrat, i.e. imagine the old-school cartoons where they get knocked out and their eyes begin to swirl. Plus, she looks too fashion "current," etc... for someone who was trafficked her whole life.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I go to the top page picture of her where it's only of her chest area. Notice how her shirt angle and necklace resemble the head area of Baphomet (the way they form two V's), specifically the neck and chest part &amp; how her hair could be construed as the horns?
           </p>
           <p>
            But on another inspection, see the dark brown strand of hair behind her necklace on the front of her neck? Does it look like it would naturally lay that way? Does it not look like the "all-seeing" eye? And after seeing the "eye" I know for a fact that added altogether I've seen the image that it's derived from; it's the Egyptican "All Seeing Eye" where the little eyelash part swirls out to what would be our right (looking at the computer).
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, this girl's story is either false or evil'ly intended.

             She escaped in 2010. Seven years may be enough for some people to recover some form of normality.

              , I noticed that you didn't downvoat "Equineluvr even though he's pretty much laughing at her story, too. It's just that I took it a step further in my observation and basically hit the nail on the head with all the visual cues. LOL, you people crack me up with the way you stick out like a sore thumb.
