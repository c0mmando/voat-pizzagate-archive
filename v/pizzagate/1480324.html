            first time i watched that interview i felt something was fishy when they were being interviewed by someone and kept avoiding certain simple questions. especially the questions about plastic willy where the girl super confused herself. sometimes i got the notion that she just doesnt know the answers to some questions because nothing happened and she was taught what to say. but whoever taught her the answers didnt do a great job and forgot how unreliable children at keeping lies. I wont make examples about why i would never trust a russian woman but i dont trust that russian woman for sure.

            I remain open minded on the subject, but don't consider it a smoking gun.

            I think it's possible that they were abused and then recanted as a part of a psyop to make it seem like satanic ritual abuse isn't real.

            I never watched the girl's interview, but the boy's was incredibly convincing. Then on the 3rd interview, he just all the sudden says it wasn't true. It was the video done by the parents of both the children while on a boat that seemed rehearsed and memorized.

            I disagree. They have no emotion because it became a part of their daily routine... This is the type of in your face testimony that will force those that are buying the fake news line to have a hard second look.
