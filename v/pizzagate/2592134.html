            I have read comments on their Facebook page in REAL time with people volunteering to go down and are on their way down from all over the US. many are claiming to be vets while others have stated they have various knowledge and skills to contribute to the base. I am so grateful for the support they are receiving and hard work they are doing. It is great they are learning and strategizing. I am wary of those who are actively smearing VOP with false stories and outright lies. I can understand healthy skepticism but the way some are spinning this story is amusing, especially those have yet to express real compassion and transparency when dealing with issues such as this. When they have been questioned, they are quick to block and censor while the VOP group keeps open communication. Learn to discern people!

             Lewis is 100% responsible for so many turning against VOP. I look at their youtube update site every day. He may as well be begging for an armed standoff with his beligerent rehetoric.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             He disturbed the "crime scenes", handled the "evidence", and claims to have buried a lot of it. If it was evidence its discredited now.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             He loudly announced to any child traffickers in the area what his intentions are. Now every child trafficker in that part of the desert can make better plans to avoid detection.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             He found a government built fire tower on the Agua Blanca national preserve and immediately branded it as a "gun nest and watch tower for child traffickers." No Lewis, its a government fire watch tower. Lewis colors everything he finds as a child trafficking related nest, tool, or affiliated with child trafficking. He creates tons of confusion and disinformation.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             He found the skull in the desert and kicked it around like a soccer ball and destroyed the scene. duhhhhhhh.....
            </p>
            <p>
             Lewis is a bag full of stupid. Regardless of his intentions, whatever those truly are, Lewis is an idiot rolling around in a bag of his own stupidity.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             They are barging into peoples homes and property, tresspassing, taking items, and creating havoc. Allegedly a land owner with an unoccupied house had a security camera set up and the camera sends images to the land owner's phone. He posted images of damage allegedly done to his camera and claims Lewis and team cut the wires on the camera. Land owner claims to have filed charges. It sounds like something Lewis would do too.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Lewis is making everybody concerned about child trafficking look like unhinged nut cases that are begging for an armed standoff with law enforcement. Lewis's level of stupid is off the charts.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Lewis seems to be playing off the terms "child trafficking" and "veteran" for his own fame and gains. I can't think of a worse person to represent our cause than Lewis Arthur, regardless of hit true motives, whatever those are.
            </p>

             <strong>
              And to top it off, he told people to go search for child pornography. He claims there will be child porn out there somewhere featuring his rape tree and that everybody should go look for it. I'm all for finding child porn producers but Lewis may get some poor sap locked up in prison for 20 years.
