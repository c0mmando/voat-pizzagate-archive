            He's just an egotistical fool. He hasn't done any of the research and his mind is made up beforehand that this issue is just a distraction.

A TONNNNN. a pizza shop owner being one of the most influential men in dc? including funderraisers and george soros donations? come on! and rivero just tried to put a lid on it and gatekeeping. i was astounded. ive been listening to him for years! years! i agree he sold out. he used to broadcast that he needed money. i think its easy for him to silence something he doesnt believe in. this is a spiritual thing. and he hates the idea of religion and spirituality. so i could see him going along with it.
