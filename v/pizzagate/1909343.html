             ONLY
            </strong>
            charities my husband and I ever donate to annually is AGDQ/SGDQ, Awesome Games Done Quick and Summer Games Done Quick.

            It's a week-long video game speed running charity drive, one in January and one in June or July, and more often than not featuring World Record holders, both current and past, that has grown in size, popularity and especially in donations every single year.
           </p>
           <p>
            It began when a small group of speed runners decided to take a weekend of streaming themselves playing games, attempting WR times or just personal best speed runs and raise money for charity, and since 2010 (AGDQ) and 2011 (SGDQ) the donations
            <strong>

           </p>
           <p>
            I personally feel that most if not all runners as well as donators are not aware of this awful information about Dr. Kouchner and the history of his "charity".

            Not to mention the multiple other businesses, artists and individuals who participate, donate items for auction, t-shirt companies that give approx 50% from sales during both of the annual week-long runs;

            I don't even know what to think or say right now. Add one more event that many people felt really good about participating in and donating to to the smoldering pile of burnt offerings covered in broiled demon shit and innocent people's tears.

            Do they already know and do this anyway?

            I believe...have to believe that the demons in the deepest part of hell are salivating at the thoughts of the deaths of all of the people in this world that are profiting from such deeds.
Only true unbelievers could live a life such as this!
What horrors await them!
 And yes these atrocities have to be brought to light.
People need to stop giving their money!!!

              Not religion...but belief in God.
Only people who don't believe there is an eternity would do such unspeakable things.
If there is no hereafter and we just cease to exist...shouldn't they be able to do however they please?
They don't think it's wrong to do what they do.
If you are talking about Jewish people...those who commit such crimes are not true believers but of the household of Satan.
And God is not fooled...He knows their hearts are not for Him...he's always known it.
If you read in the book of Ezekiel 8, God shows Ezekiel what Gods people, leaders were doing in private where they thought no one could see.
Then in Ezekiel 9 he tells a man who I assume is an angel to go mark the heads of the men who sigh and cry for all of the abominations that were going on. That's Voat in my eyes...these men and women care greatly about what is going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              God sees and God himself is judge.
He says He will recompense their way upon their own head. 
And what is waiting is not good.

               Lots (I suspect most) who don't believe in an afterlife are never the less moral people who would not do such unspeakable things.  All too often people who believe in a God come to believe that God wants them to do unspeakable things.  Their holy books many times treat others not of the faith as less than human and therefore things done to them is outside of the morals the holy book promotes.
               <br/>
               Many people don't do unspeakable things because it is not their nature, they have no desire to hurt other people.  OTOH horrific unspeakable things have been done in the name of religion based on the Bible, the Koran and other holy books by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddists etc.  The best of the holy books is followed by those whose nature is to be loving and caring.  The worst of the holy books is followed by those whose nature is to be hateful and mean.  The Puritans left England because of religious persecution and then proceeded to persecute the Quakers....

                I pretty well agree!
But what people do in the name of whatever they do it in is not Gods fault.
I'm not great in quoting scriptures, but in Corinthians it says people who do right just naturally...that it is counted as righteousness to them.
I just prefer because of my own experiences from the age of 19 to now being 62 to having a personal relationship with my creator, savior.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's not in my nature to be violent...but if it were not for my faith I would deeply hate people who hurt children or others, or me and the world can give you plenty of reasons to do that.
But I CHOOSE, because of my relationship with Christ to let him be judge.
I always say that He knows the whole story where in I only know a part.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's been a lifetime for me to realize that human actions are not Gods, whether Christian or not.

                I am related many generations apart from the first woman Quaker martyr Mary Dyer.
I just found that out about 3 years ago.

            A fantastic post.  I knew about Doctors Without Borders and that they were probably involved in human trafficking.  I was not aware that they were so brazenly killing kids and dumping them into the sea after taking their organs.  These sick freaks could not deserve to be taken to justice more.

            Looked into Bernard Kouchner a bit.  He runs the health department (sick irony) of the Agency for Modernization of Ukraine (AMU).  Victor Pinchuk has also given to the AMU.  Pinchuk was the biggest single donor to the Clinton Foundation.

            Also, as is already known, Doctors without Borders is funded by George Soros.  Here is a picture of George and Bernard Koucher together.

             Thanks for this. I was aware of it, but, with your permission, I would like to add your links to the post.

             In Ukraine they are doing unspeakable things for years, even torturing priests. Kouchner has a lot of help form some really evil guys over there--I might do a post on that one day, as it involves human trafficking and sex slaves (minors) if VOAT censors do not delete it instantly.

              I think it is interesting that Dominique Strauss Kahn was having sex with prostitutes in France.  French president Sarkozy (who appointed Kouchner) had nominated DSK him to lead the IMF.  So it makes sense that he was honey-potting and blackmailing him the entire time.  Now that DSK is disgraced he works for Victor Pinchuk.  Pinchuk had a huge history of laundering money with the aid of the IMF.  So Pinchuk is just returning the favor of the IMF helping him rob his country.

            My mind sort of comprehends the depth of their evil, but my soul is unable to. Horrifying. This is why I can't stop thinking about Pizzagate. And this is why I keep going.

            WHO, the World Health Organization needs to join forces with sovereign nations to interfere with such organ harvesting anyway it can. No organs shall be used unless certified to have been obtained thru lawful means. If we can certify organic food or non-GMO food, then surely we  can certify human organs.

             Are you kidding? WHO has done a lot to make sure that this not only goes on but they are the ones pushing vaccines to wipe people out all over the world. They have published stuff about FGM for years, but have never done a thing about it.

            <p>
             Recently, they massacred hundreds of children in Syria with a "tainted" measles vaccine, but you won't read about that in the MSM.
