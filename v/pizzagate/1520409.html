<p>It is interesting to note that the article describes blood being painted on a small icon, whereas the video shows blood being poured onto or hurled at a small statue resembling a mummified child.

<p>There doesn\'t seem to be any direct link between Marina Abramovic and the Satanic Church of Ahriman, and Spirit Cooking obviously predates the &quot;Consumption of Mary&quot;, but I can\'t find any other reference being made anywhere to the act of pouring blood onto a statue.</p>',

            Another aspect not much mentioned about Abramovic's "art" is the similar pretense it shares with Aleister Crowley's public performances of magical theater in the early 20th century. The thing that is not mentioned is it is ritual magic, or witchcraft, that uses the front of "art" or "performance" to ingratiate itself as much as possible among the public and as such bring the public into its rituals.

              Yes, they are magic rituals meant to gain personal will power. Witchcraft is one of those things most people believe is a fantasy but, oddly, the more you believe it exists the less effect it has on you, and the less you believe it exists the more influence it has on you.
