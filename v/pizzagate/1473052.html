            I can not confirm oyster but I just recently read the title of a walnut movie, in one of the threads here, but I forgot it because its not important for my research to verify these codewords. I wont do your own investigative work though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me tell you though that even I am doubtful of seeing these codes as a universal dictionary for precise communication. Such subculture lingo works as a secret code because it is culturally spread, additionaly by parallel evolution because the people have the same ideas. More specific jargon is most surely only a local thing differing from clique to clique.

            The "cheese pizza = child porn" code is more or less confirmed at the very least. There was a post here within the last two weeks or so that included screengrabs from a dark web board that pre-dated Pizzagate where someone was offering "fresh images of cheese pizza" in exchange for bitcoin payment. Some of the creepiest shizz I've ever seen.

            I do personally recall seeing the same double-speak in at least a few mentions of walnut sauce
            <strong>
             and pizza
            </strong>
            .
The problem there though, is that you're pushing a perspective that pizzagate is entirely centered on just the codewords - a couple in particular. This is not the case for a majority of us looking into matters abroad, the core goal, so far as I and many others (am/are) concerned, has always been to connect the dots and expose the international scope of this 'ring'(which is itself dealing in far more than just child abuse and traffiking).
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand where you're coming from when you say that being too outlandish can be bad for PR, you're absolutely right. However, I'll again point out, that the investigation has indeed expanded far beyond the scope of CPP and codewords of a food related nature, these elements remain integral, but have otherwise led to a much bigger scope of investigation which must not be overshadowed by semantics.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are genuine in your presence here, I humbly ask you to read up on some of the latest threads in this subverse, the 'hot' ones also. In the spirit of honesty and with due respect, I must admit that I'm starting to wonder about your motives here in this discussion.

            It's the closest thing I can find to an expert opinion on any of this, but words change as people catch on to the meaning so its not like you're going FBI master list of insidious code words, if it existed its not like Feds are actually going to assist any investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            On that note anyone familiar with the Missing 411.  David Paulides is a credible guy, open minded, gets all his information from witness testimony and Fed/State/Local LEO investigations.  Dude has researched missing cases (trust me I don't think the two are related) spanning centuries.  Still has no clue what happened to any of these people.  Federal government involved in many cases with more information than anyone else.  More than a thousand people dead or disappeared and the only information the FBI is willing to give is, "No Comment."

            You said it yourself in your 3 possibilities, he could be serious. Yes this is speculative, but I implore you to compare the list to that which has been discovered - if you haven't already.

            I know we're always told that "one person can't make a difference", well, maybe they did this time... look at the hundreds upon thousands that have sprung into action and
            <strong>
             dug up so much more
            </strong>
            by putting a bit of faith into the words of some random Canadian and an alleged FBI insider.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's right in front of all of us. Even if we don't want to see it.

            I was highly critical and skeptical of 4chan for a long time too, but, please consider that perhaps an anonymous scumbag came forward after having a change of heart in light of pizzagate revealing the extent of the depravity. Is this not even remotely plausible? I would argue that it very much is plausible and even probable.

            Ask yourself why you're being so dismissive of 4chan... what is it known for? Dissemination of CP... so I repeat, where else might a pedo have the anonymity required, to safely reveal such a list to the public?

            But with an ever changing diction of code words that change with time its impossible to verify any of the words, at least in the emails, for what people think they might mean, that's the whole reason people use them in the first place.  The only circumstantial evidence that is of use is that words in the emails are used in bizarre context but they really could stand for all kinds of shit.  A decent case is all that can be made but definitive proof cannot be found.

            If I recall correctly, there is at least entries on urban dictionary, which predate the 4chan post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have not yet made a personal compendium of the various sources for codewords which might relate to child porn/traffiking, because I'm willing to run with the 4chan post, in light of what was then discovered in the emails and beyond.
           </p>
           <p>
            Questionable at first, but, not any more, not to me anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point, the 'coincidences' are so numerous and sinister in nature, that we've no time to argue the semantics of the codewords' origins, not while childrens' lives are at risk. Paw through the discussions and publications, I will be very surprised if you can honestly question the legitimacy of the codewords after the fact.

            Yes, not to be dismissive, but a cursory search of this subverse will likely bring up a plethora of topics and comments discussing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, 4chan is to be considered a reliable source on all things pedophile, where else can one find such anonymity to allow for the distribution of CP?
