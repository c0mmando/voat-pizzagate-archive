<p>You\'re being thrown bones, by those who\'ll never have the ability to shitpost &quot;anonymously&quot; ever again. They will never be anon on the internet. So, they bring it to you, and if you don\'t get your shit together and stop chasing every single blatant bait thread on this board like seagull looking for PB&amp;J\'s on the beach like last 10 months, the bones will simply, stop coming. See, when people fucking DIE trying to educate the ignorant, it\'s rude to question the FEW who WILL, with targets on their backs (like Kim). You\'re no one to shout larp every time you hear something you\'re unaware of. If you doubt Kim, realize it\'s one thing to anonymously claim you know shit and it\'s another, to be the owner of Megaupload, and actually know shit (like fo\' real). The alphas know what he knows. Assange knows. IF you twats were worth half the credit you give yourselves, you\'d have already questioned what Snowden knows. But alas, here we are... 10 months later. You\'ve missed so much. Kim\'s assets were seized because HIS extradition to the US, is caught on a technicality (((they))) can\'t circumvent right now. Megaupload didn\'t have the bandwidth, infrastructure, storage and security it did (think of the scale of Twitter, now x2), so you could jerk off to Anchorman II, 9 days before it hit theaters. So, that begs the question, if Megaupload wasn\'t just uploading/streaming boots for degenerates, what was ALL THAT infrastructure designed for? Who\'d need that kind of edge/firewall power? Who\'d need all that up/down bandwidth, storage, remote backups and redundancy? For the love of fucking god, /pol/, WHO MIGHT BENEFIT FROM offshore storage and security? Who might have SO MUCH SHIT they\'d need to securely dump in ONE SHOT?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where you think you\'re smarter than you are and it\'s best to listen and sit on your hands. The technicality that they\'re stuck on will never be publicly disclosed because to do so, would also confirm Seth was involved. To charge Kim and have him arrested, they\'d have to publicize the charges themselves, as it\'s a CIVIL case. The same criminal and international laws/extradition request procedures and agreements, do not exist with CIVIL cases as they do in international. So, instead of pushing the Kim issue, they just exhausted every resource they had to strip him of everything he had. They thought he wouldn\'t be a problem... and maybe he wouldn\'t have been one. But he is now. Panda is Seth, the internet still parties and Kim has nothing to lose. He\'s a prick, that\'s certain, but he cares... and now, he has an opportunity he can take advantage of. The best thing he could\'ve ever hoped for was a break like this that swarmed the attention it has in the last month. He knows it\'s do or die. It\'s the only way he can get his life back. He\'s a really hard worker you know I mean, where do you think Snowden and Manning parked their shit for a minute? ;o)</p>
<p>Dig into what Megaupload\'s &quot;storefront&quot; was. Basically, they hosted/streamed shit, you weren\'t supposed to watch or see. Some of that traffic made it\'s way over to the US, broke a few copyright laws, but you can\'t extradite him on some infringement... so what can they do? They CAN take him out by seizing all of his hardware/liquid assets. This gets them the servers/hard drives they might want to look at if tunnel traces and dead end tokens lead them to generic IP\'s back in NZ right before Seth\'s station goes dark on the LAN/WAN to purge his first, second or third round of 10-15k+ docs and e-mails...</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, Kek\'s, you\'re slipping. There\'s talk we should start feeding another board... few of us are old /pol/-souls, so the ones who are, are fighting for it. Don\'t let us down...</p>

            that is probably why he is making these public statements... get it out there before (((they))) can get him under the radar.  If anything happens to him now, we all know why/who.

            Here's the issue I think, if Kim comes forward, the proof may actually expose how Wikileaks and other leakers are moving files.  Wouldn't he have to give the methodology behind how all this is done? Wouldn't that expose future leaks?  Is this worth taking a risk if he's not sure that the Feds and MSM will def follow up? Wouldn't it be better to keep quiet and dripping leaks? Is it a coincidence he and assange are both tweeting about Seth Rich?
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the NWO types always like domino effects. Yes he issue is real, but leave it out as low hanging fruit, force Seths contacts to expose their methods by trying to confirm the rumors.  Then boom, we have methods and tactics of future leaks.  We're dealing with spies who have unlimited budgets and like to rape kids and murder people. You think the tons of posts saying KimdotCom is full of shit are just coincidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or a way to deflate us and taint/ bait Riches contacts into revealing themselves?  Yes the murder was real, we all know who is involved.  But my gut tells me it's an op to get sources and connections to uncloak. Wikileaks is taking the Chinese water torture approach to things. Deep state is good at neutralizing big info leaks as LOL debunked.  Look how many people were murdered around the jFK event?  How many of Kim and Assanges contacts can be killed. They are not working alone and I'm sure they made promises to protect identities and methods no matter what. It's UP TO US to run with the god damn ball no matter what they give. Don't complain that the offensive line isn't opening big holes. We can be on some Barry sanders shit right now. That's what Kim and assange are counting on.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to think like spies or die like slaves.
I'm not on the chans or Reddit.  So if my message makes sense please feel free to repost with our without user name.
Let's not shit on people because they aren't willing to fully reveal without legal aspects being fully taken cared of.   Aka the Feds will completely ignore Kim and will not depose him because it messes up the narrative. And Kim is not interested in having a slip and fall death before he testifies.
           </p>
           <p>
            WE ARE OVER THE DEATH STAR AND THESE BABY RAPERS ARE NOT PLAYING GAMES.  If Hillary got in, these people were ready to go fully HOT with the plan they've been working on at bilderberg. They are PISSED right now.

            Why in the hell would Snowden or anyone else wishing to remain anonymous, use Megaupload? These guys tweet regularly about encryption software and chat programs. Sorry, but this one doesn't work for me, and I want to believe that Kim Dotcom has the goods on all of this. I think he was more directly involved, if he even was at all.

            Mega.nz is an end to end encrypted file storage system.  It is much more secure than the old Megaupload and also more secure than other cloud services.  If you lose your password you can't reset it.  Files are encrypted on the user's computer and the company says that it doesn't even know what data it is hosting.  For transferring large amounts of sensitive data, it seems like a much safer, faster, and more sensible solution than the sort of global sneakernet others seem to be imagining Wikileaks using.

            The shutdown of megaupload was significantly more heavy handed in comparison to similar sites. It seemed odd at the time, but nothing ever came of it as Kim/lawyers have been able to use the technicality mentioned by anon.
           </p>
           <p>
            This anon is saying that Kim was a middleman for large data transactions, specifically, people linking to Wikileaks (Rich/Snowden/Manning), and using Megaupload as a front for the operation. Hence, why they had all the infrastructure anon talks about. At some point, someone in the US government figured out that Kim was doing this. They did not want to charge Kim with anything since it would be a Civil case and they would have to publish the charges (Kim helped Seth steal our info), so they tried to ruin Kim's life and fuck his shit up. Kim's been waiting for a chance at revenge. And now he has it.  Because Kim can prove that Seth was Panda

            For the record it's my opinion that Kim probably has what he says and it makes sense that Megaupload would have been used for transferring huge collections of data secretly. As for this anon - what a cunt.

            I've often wondered how much Assange knows.  He claims WikiLeaks doesn't publish classified information, so he wouldn't/couldn't publish everything they had?
           </p>
           <p>
            These people must think we are stupid with the guesses we are making without all the information.
           </p>
           <p>
            They won't even give us Weiner's emails and data.  How are we gonna get Kim's?
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds like Kim has a copy of the DNC leaks, and possibly more?  Hasn't Assange and WikiLeaks had this same copy, so we are just proving one transfer of it in the chain?   And too bad it's classified for us peons to read it?

             So... how would Kim still have had the systems to be middleman for the DNC leaks, if they were seized in 2012?  Maybe he just set up more, or had backup servers somewhere?

            I believe this too. When KimDotCom releases the proof, the fence walkers in the law enforcement and alphabet agencies will have to commit and go after the perps and criminals since WE will know which side of the fence they stand on! This is HUGE!!!

             Perhaps megaupload has the elite ritual videos that the insider anons say are floating around. Perhaps a brave 4chaner can find them and crack the earth open with them. Perhaps pehaps perhaps.

            Snowden didn't release through Wikileaks, though they did help keep him safe. As far as I know, Snowden's leak happened in the hotel room with Greenwald, Poitras and MacAskill.

            I think that what he is saying is that Seth uploaded all the data to Megaupload (KimDotCom's service) for Wikileaks to access  and that is why 1. The US goverment seized all dot.com's shit in an overt legal overreach and 2.  how Dotcom knows what he knows.

Beautiful and sounds legit man. Yeah any logs that Kim can show IP points on that could sync up with Seth's home or usual IP would be the smoking gun that ends it all

            He's not saying nothing, he's saying he's got the goods and is making arrangements to deliver. He already said Seth was the leaker last week.  This is the official statement that he'll testify.  I think it's A-FUCKING-MAZING.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Russian narrative is now completely and utterly BTFO.  I believe if they don't call him to testify, he'll release the evidence into the wild.  Let's see though.

            So, MegaUpload was streaming CP, snuff films, and other things "you weren't supposed to watch or see" because "who might benefit from offshore storage and security" because they "have so much shit they'd need to securely dump in one shot"?

             I think he's saying that Kim's systems were being used by leakers to get the data to Wikileaks. There was a part missing, which the OP has added. It's more clear what he's saying now.

            Here's some more from this anon - (now added to the OP)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Con't...
            </p>
            <p>
             Does no one on /pol/ actually know ANYTHING about how data works?
             <strong>
              Anyone ever question how 44k+ in e-mails, 17k+ in attachments, including all the images you can't filter and auto-upload icons you can't escape in signatures, gets from one place to another?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Now imagine bigger leaks... like Manning's. How do you think someone like Assange ends up with all that data. It originates from somewhere right? Please don't tell me you think people are sending info like this, to people like Assange on a PNY USB stuck in a bubble-lined envelope, covered in 30 stamps, addressed to the embassy.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              People like Seth, who work with people like Assange, end up working with people like Kim and when people like Kim get involved for the reasons they do, that's one extra vulnerable copy exposed.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Kim has what he needs to make the comment he did today, while legally protecting himself. On top of it, /pol/, we did you another solid. Ironic how the same people who'd benefit from his confirmation which validates your finds (based on your ability to operate a search engine, I mean... let's get real, you haven't found anything that hasn't been sitting out there for 10+ months, waiting to be found), will be just the start of what he has.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Kim can prove, 100% that Panda is Rich, Panda was provided secure connections and tunnels through tokens to download and upload his dump, then scrub the tracks he'd leave, as it was done in several pieces.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember programmers are great at programming, securing and storing the termination of MASSIVE info, isn't there forte. Interestingly enough... it's Kim's.

            Kim had the server infrastructure and trust to be able to transfer these files around and store them.  The infrastructure to manage the large data files involved in WL and other big stories of the past few years is not trivial, and obviously you can't trust dropbox.  Most likely Kim was involved, in fact they're suggesting that's part of the reason he built Mega in the first place.

             He's saying that Kim's MegaUpload systems were being used to get leaked material from the leakers, to Wikileaks. And so, Kim's got a copy of the DNC leak (and others?), and a trail of evidence showing the 'megaupload' of Seths.

               Not megaupload itself, but the systems. Anon in the OP said megaupload was essentially a shopfront.

               And... if he released it into the wild, who would cover it?  The MSM?  It would be ignored and unreported just like the Wikileaks leaks. Left to blow around the corners of the webs. This way, he's putting the ball in the court of the US judicial system.  If they refuse his evidence, it's an admission of guilt and they're fucked.  If they allow him to testify, they're fucked. Like the first night of marriage, as Putin said. Whatever happens... the outcome will be the same.

               Good question. Possibly because he thinks an investigation and inquiry would be the biggest and best way to fuck the Dems proper. He hates them with a vengance and states that 'they took my life'.  He wants it in xxlarge, possibly.

                It appears that essentially they (US Gov) were trying to steal it all back when they raided Dotcom's compound. So now DotCom is saying yes, I've got it, you still want it now that now it proves cover up of murder?

                 So they knew Kim had a copy and that's why they raided his compound, do you think?  I understood that his systems had been confiscated, right?  And if so, how can he still have a copy?  Hmm....

                  Probably back ups somewhere else, I think I read somewhere that he had operations in Hong Kong (I could be totaly wrong). Honestly I don't know anything about anything I'm just trying to parse the info and make some sense of it in conjunction with events as they have occurred and that are the most likely scenario.  I think there is at least one other leaker, maybe more.

                  Also Wikileaks would have their copy, but they will not reveal sources so they could have returned the data to dotcom so that he could.

                   I hear you, I'm parsing just the same, trying to make sense. Kim knew what he was doing for sure, so no way that could have been the only copy, it's true. And yes, that makes sense that possibly Wikileaks passed Kim evidence to maintain their ethos. Nodding... this is making sense.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Ultimately, it doesn't look like Kim's bullshitting.

            He's a relatively credible voice. And definitely knows more about certain things than most people on Earth. Time will tell.

            Personally, even though I expected less than was promised, I was still very disappointed today.

            Yeah I think the gist is that Kim is likely more involved than his anti-climactic reveal suggests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: And yes, he's saying that he believes Kim protects the data's movement to Wikileaks.

             Right. I would have been shocked if he had uploaded proof. If you have proof of a crime you contact a lawyer. 
This was the perfect explination of what kim did and why. Excellent post

            I retract my comment calling Kim a twat, it was more a reaction to pgiz.
