<p>The video site has mix of normal adult pron, bestiality, lolicon, CP, and youtube videos that are pedo oriented.</p>
<p>Both sites have multiple domain names (tlds at least) and use cloudflare. They have sections for &quot;all&quot; and then each country with the top images and videos by hit on each.</p>
<p>These sites need taken down and the people behind the images brought to justice.</p>
<p>The images may not be hosted on these sites but they obviously cater to pedos to make ad revenue. The images are hosted on sites like &quot;pimpandhost&quot; and motherless, pornhost, others.
