             Why did so many Armenians move to Racine? What happened with Lions Gate and Rio Rancho? Why was the city administrator from Rio Rancho recruited to Racine? Why did he recently resign? What happened with the past mayors and administrators? Which were convicted of crimes involving children? Where is the NXIVM doctor’s family from? Why was That 70’s Show set in Racine?

             How are Chris (Ashton) Kutcher, Ron Burkle and Guy Oseary connected? How are Scientology, Freemasonry and Kabbalah connected with the Knights of Pythias, NXIVM, NASA and the Boy Scouts? Who are the four Emanuel siblings and what do they each do? Where did the Podestas get their big break? How is Tom Delonge connected with the I-94 Project and the Fight to End Exploitation with others including Seth Green, Ashton Kutcher, Susan Sarandon, John Legend, Mark Ruffalo and more?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Why did Armenians move to Racine? Who is Azar Torosian and who is he related to? Who are the Masons, Bauers, Johnsons and Rothschilds?
             </p>
             <p>
              Even before the great exodus of Armenians driven out of their homeland by the Ottoman Turks during the genocide of 1915, in which one and a half million Armenians perished, a small number of Armenians were finding their way to Racine, attracted by the growing industry here which did not require skill or command of the English language. These Armenians were hard-working men who dreamed of working and saving their money in order to return to their homeland and live more comfortable lives there.
             </p>
             <p>
              The few Armenian young men who came to Racine before the 1915 genocide were from the province of Kharpert. After the genocide, however, the majority who arrived were from the village of Tomarza, Geseria. They both shared a common language, religion and values. Many men had gone back to bring their wives and children or married survivors of the genocide. Many also had brides brought over for them by friends and relatives. Thus the Armenian community here grew, and the family became the core of the community.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Armenian Work Force
             </p>
             <p>
              The Armenian work force clustered around the growing industries of J.I. Case Company, Belle City Malleable Iron Company and Walker Manufacturing Company. Case’s main office was on State Street.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those Armenians who chose not to work in factories established their own businesses on State Street were the Armaganian/Dadian and the Bornanian Grocery Stores. Also serving the Racine Armenians were two other Armenian grocers located on State Street near Douglas Avenue. These stores, aside from the usual staples, carried on their shelves bulghur, basturma, halva, olives and other foods familiar to Armenians.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other shops, including shoe repair shops, barber shops and dry cleaners, were located on State Street and operated by Armenians. Gulbank Gulbankian was the first Armenian attorney to practice law in the new Armenian community. His office was located a short walking distance on Main Street off State Street. He was joined a short time later by his sister, Vartak. They were a great help to Armenians who needed legal assistance but were handicapped by their language limitations to seek help from an outsider.

               Yeah I have to agree.I mean I see the Racine posts but fuc, it is annoying because they are posted as riddles. Just tell us how this relates to Steve Bing or was it the Armenian Mafia thing? See, it just confuses me

            <p>
             Bing founded Shangri-La Entertainment focused on property, construction, entertainment, and music. His parents: Helen, a nurse, and Peter Bing, a doctor in public health. Peter Bing worked on public health issues for the Lyndon Johnson White House before relocating to Los Angeles. At the age of 18, his son Steve inherited $600 million from his grandfather, Leo S. Bing. The real estate developer made his fortune in New York in the 1920s and gave the young Steve a boost.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bing dropped out of Stanford University in his junior year to pursue a career in Hollywood. Before he finished high school at the Harvard-Westlake School, Bing had already co-written his first screenplay titled “Missing in Action.” It was made into a Chuck Norris film and spawned a sequel. Bing invested $80 million in The Polar Express, an animated film featuring Tom Hanks. The film earned $285 million globally and was one of the top box office successes in 2004.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was also the financier of Robert Zemeckis’ Beowulf and also producer/financier of Shine A Light, a Rolling Stones concert film directed by Martin Scorsese. Bing also financed and produced the independently released Jerry Lee Lewis album Last Man Standing. He also co-wrote both the screenplay and the story of Kangaroo Jack (2003). In the early 1990s, extravagant Bing checked into the Hotel Bel-Air for one night and stayed for nine years.

            <p>
             Bing contributed $10.7million to the Democratic Party in total. The big checks were written in 2002 when he gave $8.2 million to the DNC. He also donated to Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, and Dianne Feinstein. Bing gave $49.5million during 2006 in support of Proposition 87, a California initiative that sought oil production taxes. On December 18, 2008, the Clinton Foundation released a list of all contributors. It included Bing, who gave up to $25million.

             On August 5, 2009, American reporters Laura Ling and Euna Lee returned to America after serving 5 months in jail and hard labor. Both skipped a 12-year sentence for illegally entering North Korean territory “thanks” to Bill Clinton. A 737 private aircraft owned by Bing was used for the return as he covered the $200,000 mission cost. The “rescue” is said to have been a cheap PR stunt by Clinton. The names of the reporters sound familiar to you? These are the same women who appeared in an image inside the Podesta emails leaked by Wikileaks in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             On it, you can see them feasting on pizza along with an unidentified little girl. The email was sent to Huma Abedin, John Podesta, and Clinton’s closest advisors. Bing was also paying $2.5million a year to the Clinton Foundation to be an “advisor” to the former president. They also shared women: Elizabeth Hurley, Naomi Campbell, and Sharon Stone all dated both men. Hurley and Campbell were listed in the Epstein flight logs and Naomi was very active as a procurer of victims and clients…

             Ron Burkle’s involvement with the Beverly Hills firm Patriot Management is suspect. “Patriot Management represents over 45 artists, songwriters, and producers. Patriot’s roster includes Pharrell Williams, OneRepublic, Charlie Puth, Backstreet Boys, Soundgarden, the Estate of Chris Cornell, and more.” One of his best partners is the gatekeeper, Ashton Kutcher.

             Kirk Kerkorian, leader of the Armenian mafia in the US was the owner of the MGM hotels. By the time Kerkorian died, he had transferred his MGM holdings to Jim Murren and Eric Esrailian (Cornell’s family doctor, and Geffen’s lackey via UCLA). Chris Cornell was killed at the MGM Grand in Detroit, Michigan. There’s evidence of a coverup by the mafia owned hotel. Kerkorian financed The Promise, a film exposing the Armenian genocide in which Christian Bale acted and Chris Cornell sang for the soundtrack. Guess who was a producer? Eric Esrailian. The Armenian mafia protects the Kardashians and the members of System of a Down (who are all Armenian).

             Serj Tankian and SOAD are all up to date on what happened to Chris and Chester. Guitar player Daron Malakian has no qualms in sporting pedophilia symbols on his tattoos and guitar. Coincidentally, he worked side by side with Chester and Linkin Park. Who else worked with Linkin Park? Bill Clinton gave the band a $1million grant to Mike Shinoda so he could fund the SRS recycling center in Haiti. Steve Bing not only was close friends with Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, but he was also one of the driving forces to coerce Graydon Carter not to publish a piece on Jeffrey Epstein (and Ghislaine Maxwell) written by John Connolly for Vanity Fair. Small world…

              It has been censored from the internet, but Jeffrey Epstein visited the same bar in Florida that the 9/11 hijackers got drunk at. I can't find the name of this bar anymore (I don't think it's the bar called 251 Sunrise).

              So.. basically the Clinton's got blackmail on Bing and turned him into a ATM machine, anytime they needed.

              The trip the NK by Bill is glaring and came at a time when Clinton public image was deteriorating rapidly.
