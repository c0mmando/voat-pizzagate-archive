<p>In &quot;Windswept House: A Vatican Novel&quot;  Malachi vividly described a ceremony called “The Enthronement of the Fallen Archangel Lucifer” supposedly held in St. Paul’s Chapel in the Vatican, but linked with concurrent satanic rites in the U.S. In the novel, before he dies, a pope leaves a secret account of the situation on his desk for the next occupant of the throne of Peter, a thinly-disguised John Paul II.

<p>Martin\'s accusation of a satanic ritual at the Vatican was also confirmed by John Loeffler, host of the Steel on Steel radio show.  Mr. Loeffler personally asked Fr. Malachi Martin (who had been a regular guest on his show) about the reported dedication to satan within the Vatican: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know Malachi confirmed the dedication of the Vatican to satan in a secret ceremony that occurred unknown even to the Pope at that time, that he managed to pick up. And I did ask him, \'Was this true? Did it happen?\' And he [Fr. Martin] said, \'yes, it did.\'&quot; - John Loeffler (July 29, 2000 radio show) </p>

            Malachi Martin was a ZIONIST infiltrator, NOT a heroic crusader or investigative reporter.

            Ken Adachi said (June 29, 2017):
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I haven't read this book and I'm not a scholar or historian, but anyone can put anything to print in a book. It doesn't mean it's true. You can color a story in any direction desired to fit your intentions. The biggest problem here is accusation without substantiation. Where is the PROOF that the last 4 or 5 or 6 Popes were Freemasons? A photo of the man to become the current Pope is seen in a bus (or subway train) in Argentina reaching into his jacket when the picture was snapped and THAT proves he's a Freemason? A cropped photo (which excludes the husband standing nearby) of a beach scene showing Bishop Woytyla with a woman and a child being playful and affectionate with Woytyla does not prove, imply, or even HINT of anything illicit.
             <strong>
              We find out Malachi Martin was a Zionist plant AFTER he dies, not when he was bad mouthing the Vatican and Papacy during his many lurid interviews with Art Bell 10 or 15 years ago.
             </strong>
             Nowadays, you'll find that in practically every anti-NWO article or Youtube videos (or Youtube comment) the word "Jesuit" is linked to the names of Rothchild, Illuminati, the "Black Pope" etc., and characterized as top architects and planners of the NWO world takeover scheme without even a SMIDGEN of proof of ANY nefarious involvement whatsoever. Are we expected to accept the imaginary fantasies of a Zionist-hired gun like novelist Dan Brown, or that Zionist-hired stonemason-come-"scholar" Eric Jon Phelps as proof of anything?
The Catholic church is not the Pope, the Vatican, the College of Cardinals, or even the Bishops or Archbishops. It's the PEOPLE who go to church on Sunday and call themselves Catholics. It's the people who get married by a Catholic priest, have their kids baptized in church, go to confession and take communion on Sunday. Some are still able to send their kids to the rapidly-dwindling-in-number Catholic schools where they will receive an education that is FAR superior to the garbage that kids are fed in public schools. I don't know what is left of Catholic Charities today, but there was a time when the Catholic church aided and rescued millions of poor people in distress in America and around the world without fanfare or acclaim. THIS is the Catholic Church that is the foundation of Catholicism; the people who believe in the moral lessons explained in the catechism of their youth and carry that morality - and charity - forward into adult life.
The last time I checked, the Jesuit Order was involved in the profession of TEACHING in high schools and universities in America and abroad. If anyone has substantiated PROOF that they are training assassins, or were responsible for the planning and assassination of JFK, or are killing babies in Satanic rituals, or are raping children under the Vatican, or were behind the Bolshevik Revolution and the planned starvation of Ukrainian peasants in the 1930s, etc., etc., etc., then I'd love to see it and judge for myself of their guilt - according to the merits of their PROVEN transgressions.

            Others like James Perloff and Michael Piper Collins have also confirmed Martin's "double-agent" status.

             So you are saying that there is no infiltration of the Catholic Church by societies with other agendas by saying that one of its respected priests (Malachi) was a member of a society with another agenda??   You are proving the point you are trying to disprove.

            Don't be fooled,  the Vatican is freemasonry, along with the Mafia. There are many good Masons that truly believe Freemasonry is a Christian organisation that helps society. Nothing could be further from the truth. The. Masonic leaders hide behind the good causes to cover the pure evil beneath the surface.

            There is a book Scarlet and the Beast, the war between English and French freemasonry. If you want to know who or what is truly behind all of this then read it. Let's just say the Masonic lodges are the key. Yes this includes Skull and Bones. It explains everything nicely, we have all been deceived, we are all blaming different factions, oh it's the jesuits... no no it's definitely the Jews... oh no silly it's the black nobility... no no it's the Illuminati... read the book it explains in detail why we have all been deceived by the Masonic Order, Soon to be the New World Order. Until you truly know who the enemy is, you can't truly fight it. Read it and understand it.

            I remember listening to Father Malachi Martin, he said that the Catholic church was split almost 50/50 into two groups, an honest "Good" group, and a "Satanist / humanist" group. He passed away in 1999, so I'm sure that most of  what he wrote about is now almost two decades out of date, but it does give some insight into the inner workings of the Catholic church. From the recent gay orgy scandal in Rome I would say that it's likely that the "Satanist / humanist" group still has quite a bit of sway inside the church.

              Not explicitly, but a city on seven hills is a good match for Rome and the beasts of the apocalypse are symbolic of predominantly Christian countries: lion -&gt; England, eagle -&gt; US, leopard -&gt; Germany, bear -&gt; Russia. The seven "churches" of the book of Revelation are not Christian churches, these ecclesia (translated as churches) rejected Paul of Tarsus, the source of the central doctrine of Christianity.
