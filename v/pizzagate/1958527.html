<p>I came across this comment on this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Kj-R4Ja08">The Ugly Truth About Justin Trudeau | Ezra Levant and Stefan Molyneux</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Justin Trudeau was my grade 8 drama teacher and was an ultimate frisbee coach for my classmates (I kid you not!). &quot;Mr. T.&quot; was a lazy, narcissistic jerk, and while most of the staff members hated him they kept quiet because they understood that his name enhanced our school\'s reputation. By grade 10 everyone found out that he had lead on some of the female teachers and was an unabashed flirt before he dumped them like old news. It was vile, especially for someone who pontificates about how every man should be a feminist! </p>
<p>As a side note, his best friend was our history teacher -- a guy who had 50x Justin\'s intellect and could have had a prominent future within the Liberal party, had he not gone to jail for distributing kiddie porn. *The more you know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out that Justin\'s history teacher friend was Christopher Ingvaldson who also taught at the West Point Grey Academy when he was a drama teacher there: <a href="http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2013/01/09/vancouver-ex-private-school-teacher-sentenced-to-three-months-for-child-porn.html">http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2013/01/09/vancouver-ex-private-school-teacher-sentenced-to-three-months-for-child-porn.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A search for greater shock value led Ingvaldson to stray from legal pornography to illegal, according to the sentence, where Australian police eventually caught him as part of a 14-member <strong>Facebook group called “Little Girls Love to Play Too</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person who ran that Facebook pedophile group was James Paul Byrd: <a href="https://ten8.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/former-lincolnton-nc-banker-indicted-on-child-pornography-charges/">https://ten8.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/former-lincolnton-nc-banker-indicted-on-child-pornography-charges/</a></p>

<p>&quot;....Byrd, a former owner of Byrd Sundries in Lincolnton and a former banker, is scheduled to appear in federal court on Jan. 10.

            Excellent post. I know someone from the Vancouver Canada who says the place is so corrupt it's basically a Freemason controlled and run city. The men in question are likely Freemasons themselves, the ones being Justin Trudeaus friends. Nothing surprises me here I've heard it all before 100% truth. Apparently his brother died in BC. I also believe very strongly that Castro is Trudeaus natural father. I did not at first but was absolutely stunned when I looked into it further.

             This sounds a bit shady, especially with people thinking Spielberg might be involved.

             One of Starlight's programs was Starbright World, the first-ever private social network, started in 1995 by filmmaker and Chairman Emeritus Steven Spielberg, Peter Samuelson and Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr.[3] It served to connect chronically ill teenagers with life-threatening medical conditions, and their siblings,[8][20] in a safe, online community where they could chat, blog, post content, and meet others who shared similar experiences.[21] Starbright World was taken offline on August 31, 2015.

            I think Trudeau needs a deep look.  I was reading that his father abused him from an early age.  They used to have parties on boats with kids and priests.  But Justin along for the ride minimally.  Most of the foundations to appear to be trafficking fronts or deflection fronts so Starlight is probably riddled with dirt and worth a look.  Well done though...always enjoy your posts!
