<p>Stephen Paddock could\'ve at least been like Whitey Bulger. Like a second Whitey Bulger. Strange a couple of days right after the Vegas shooting there was some shootings with full auto weapons in the Phoenix and Henderson and Tucson area and like 2 weeks - months later some one went up on the storage facility in Vegas Paddock owned and started shooting at people. Clearly CP comped sushi cheese pizza is involved in all this. I think Las Vegas shooting is connected to the sex pedo camp site in Tucson. McCain visit to middle east to Muslim brotherhood is interesting and i think he traded them guns and money for &quot;Maddie&quot; aka Madeline and had his way with her in that camp site sex pedo site. He used the McCain Institute for moving and laundering? Stephen\'s hard drive has video and photos of Madeline Mccain. She was picked up by Muslim terrorists and the rest is history and no wonder the FBI/LVMPD are covering something up. Stephen was like an asset like Whitey Bulger a dirty one at that and so many people with guns went up to the Mandalay Bay because of who was on his hard drive.</p>',

            So, what happened to a link being required in a post? I'm starting to think this site is compromised more and more. This seems like absolute conjecture.
