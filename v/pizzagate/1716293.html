            I'm not going to troll the guy but the more I think about his tweet calling out GOPS and "warning" people not to tag him really pisses me off. I get he was a victim but I wonder as a kid, if he had hoped and prayed someone would help him? I'm sick and tired of actors, politicians, cops, FBI/CIA or any other person who KNOWS what the hell is going on and stays silent as more and more kids worldwide get abused and killed. It's disgusting and disturbing and they are basically abiding and abetting to this crime. In my eyes, they are no better than the vile criminals themselves. May sound harsh bcuz he was a victim, but enough is enough. There are NEW victims everyday this goes on.

            Corey just retweeted this tweet:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/ObamaTruth1/status/841421722167476224">
             https://twitter.com/ObamaTruth1/status/841421722167476224
            </a>
            , which was in response to his earlier tweet ("no man, this is a conspiracy propegated by right wing GOP!"):
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             #PedoGate is a non-partisan evil...both parties infected.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It is very important for the general public to understand that our effort is not a witch hunt against Clinton but a hunt for truth and justice against all involved, DEM, GOP, Labour, Conservative...My guess is that his earlier tweet showed that he had bought into the LSM lie that pizzagate was "driven to show that Hillary was running a pedo ring out of a basement at a restaurant." The fact that he retweeted the above tweet shows him to be a potential ally with a large audience. We should keep in mind that presenting this issue as non-partisan, which is the truth, can really open the eyes of many more people...and part of the explanation to create credibility pulls in the corruption under Bush I (Finders, Franklin Scandal).

            He is a victim. He has no credibility left because his abusers have clowned him. If he talks, he is dead and likely his family and  those close to him as well. Easy for you all to say what he should do. Haven't you ever wondered why more haven't come forward if this really is such a big conspiracy?? Likely he is only alive because he has been smart enough to avoid getting taken out. I do not know how victimhood by a global network of psychopaths would feel. Neither do any of you. Hasnt the guy been through enough? He says what he can which I respect very much. More than most. He is a victim and don't forget it.

            What you should know about C.F. is that he introduced Corey Haim to one of his abusers his name was Marty Weiss. He also introduced Corey Haim to another one of his alleged abusers and that man's name was Dominick Brascia. Corey even took it a step further during an award show for child actors he praised Marty Weiss even thoug he knew Marty Weiss was a child abuser. I have contacted Corey Feldman several times asking him to support the accusers of Michael Jackson, at this time there are now seven accusers of Michael Jackson. when I tweeted him regarding Wade Robson he called Wade Robson a liar and insinuated he was only doing this for was money. He also stated that Wade Robson should get over it and even after all these years with mountains of evidence showing Michael Jackson's inappropriate behavior with children he still publicly bashes any accuser that dares to make an accusation. The other thing you should know is that when Corey Feldman introduced Corey Haim to Marty Weiss it was because Corey Haim according to Feldman was hitting on him. Corey Feldman got agitated and told Haim to go into another room with Marty Weiss. Corey Feldman also has a group called Corey's angels, these young women have to sign contracts and live with Corey Feldman. Corey Feldman is using his Fame and wealth in my opinion to take advantage of these young women. Corey Feldman in my opinion is not the best candidate to be the spokesperson for pedophilia in Hollywood. So before we start shedding tears for Corey Feldman you should know how he is treated other people who have come forward and claimed child sexual abuse. There is no doubt in my mind that Corey Feldman was a victim of child sexual abuse and child abuse in general however I believe he needs to show a little more empathy when it comes to people accusing one of his longtime friends AKA Michael Jackson.

             michael jackson was framed &amp; murdered because he spoke out against Sony &amp; others. Corey probably knows this and refuses to add to that conspiracy.

            There's an understandable reason why bes not naming names.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's say he does.give out a list of names of Hollywood pedos. He has no evidence and this was years ago. At most he has his word against theirs and he could end up dead. If he doesn't say anything he can still wake people up. Him naming names probably won't do anything other than get him killed. Sure we could look into them but it's probably people we can already figure out

            People, time to up your game.  When there's a shill post, take names.  look for the 30 minute old accounts giving posts from the peanut gallery.  Try to figure out the shill account that took the most time to develop.

            He has the right to remain silent and plead the 5th. Older children get coerced into pimping younger ones. Sometimes theyreemotionally attachedtothe abuser for years too. Corey is a good guy I believe who has suffered and survived.

            TBH i think he should, surely there is a way, like having insurance...tho i dont know his situation, maybe he truly feels he cant. However I have more of a problem witht he thousands of other stars who've said nothing Ashton Kutcher in particular, crying in front of Congress when he must know hundreds of victims and abuser personally if he isn;t one or both himself.

            He told me on Twitter that I was a conspiracy theorist and to not put this "pizzagate crap" on his Twitter again. I told him I was shocked and disappointed in him along with a few others and he got really upset. 
I don't understand, I thought he was ready to expose Hollywood? Does he really not see the connection, or Is he really just trying to get publicity? That's really disappointing!

            We're still the problem not corey, we have become complaicant that something is happening we need to march every week until this is sorted out. Society has failed corey and others like him, until we create the enviroment where these people feel safer, it will still be our fault. Once we show them the way is safe these people will spill everything and while world will change.

            Leave him the fuck alone.  If you're gunning for it you've either forgotten why we are doing this (for the victims), or a shill trying to make us devolve into a mob mentality.

            hes playing games hes obviously part of the problem all we can do is speculate so long as he plays games. yeah johnny killed river phoenix big fuckin deal we dont want to single in on one specific thing here. there are so many pedophiles it is so rampant to call him courageous is asinine. why are we taking these peoples word? politicians, actors, ceos, businessmen.................... the bottom line is we are ALL whores for money because that is the way the world works due to many conspiracies or just one big global one u gotta tie together. so if even the smallest man has to trade his time for money aka whoring what do you think these big names are? do you think they will be honest  to lose the spotlight? to martyr themselves? fucking uck no. part of the problem, yes. scum, yes. abused, most likely. honest, no. playing us, yes. jesus.

            For what it's worth I don't think Feldman should have to say anything at this point. He has repeatedly in the past. Now it's our turn to shine the light.

             I upvoted, think its a good conversation to have although i'm unsure of where i stand. I'm not a victim so i can't put myself in those shoes and bash Feldman, but on the other hand if i knew something i would say it, death or not its worth it when babies are suffering. Then again i don't have kids so its easy for me not to be scared for myself.

            If you want to be very disturbed. See the attached videos below of Johnny Depp and Damien Echols (convicted child killer "suspected" of ritual killing.  Released from death row in 2011. Friends with J. Depp who made the movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has given many interviews about his use of "majick" to help himself a nod to Aleister Crowley and Satanic rituals. He now has an art studio of course called Salem that is disturbing to say the least

            Just a thought, but maybe these elite Hollyhell actors should move from California to where the 2nd Amendment is honored and out these fucks. I mean, hell, out them and then pull a few all-nighters with family/friends keeping armed watch.

            Not to mention the propaganda power he's wielded for 40 years. A whole generation with more emotional connection with him via ET, Raiders of The Lost Ark (the scenes in "Temple of Doom" with child slaves and Short Round are very unpleasant), Goonies etc, than their own parents (bearing in mind that the 70's and 80's saw a rapid increase in "broken" families alongside "children as consumers").

            Again those calling for him to name names he has you are not listening. Think of the movie "Stand by Me" with him and River Phoenix who died in the "Viper Room" owned by Johnny Depp.

            S.Sp is also being named. Why would he feel safe to talk when the government itself that makes and enforces the laws are implicated?

            I'd like to put the blame on him, but can't. I understand the predicament he's in. The only way it would work is if a press conference was held and about 25 celebrity victims gathered to announce and detail what happened to them and who was guilty. Now they'd never work in Hollywood again, and I think that's the key. The kids that were abused WANT to be in this atmosphere. They've been groomed, conditioned, and need to stay in the toxic environment/wasteland that Pedoland is. They'd be so much better off on a farm somewhere ... or working in an office, but they like the perks that go along with being a celebrity, knowing they are propping up and keeping alive a system that molests. So yes, he's part of the problem, but until there's a reckoning where a glut of victims is ready to stand up and say, "We're not going to take this anymore and we're not going to allow it to be done to any other child anymore, either!" this nightmare will continue.

             Exactly, like what happened with Bill Cosby, where many victims have come forward. But Bill Cosby doesn't have the same power as Corey's unnamed abusers do. It would take a combo of many victims teaming up with good-guy attorneys &amp; cops to bring the evidence forward &amp; not have it dismissed. Even then, there are no guarantees.

              No I mean en masse ... simultaneously .... all at once. Hold one big press conference ... not trickle the evidence in over the years. The evidence becomes diluted that way. That's what happened with Clinton. A woman would claim abuse or rape and then she'd be ridiculed and torn apart in the press. Then a few years later someone else would come forward. There was no momentum. Think "class action suit". That's what I'm talking about ... not Cosby's situation or Clinton's either, for that matter.

            Kind of. Considering he would be suicided. It's more of a self preservation thing. Someone that famous is going to have a hard time staying hidden in witness protection.

                Yes, its well know faeces smearing and throwing is a sign of deep psychological anguish. It's not hard to believe that Burke wasn't being sexually abused too.

            Crispin Glover (latter-day Hollywood Pariah) wrote an interesting essay in which he questions the motives, influence, and themes explored repeatedly by Steven Spielberg (esp regarding pedophilia and child-murder). Originally read it in "Apocalypse Culture" (ed. Adam Parfrey, Feral House).

             Steven Spielberg produced "Gremlins" and "The Goonies".  "Gremlins" featured Corey Feldman in his first major film role, and "The Goonies" featured Corey Feldman in his "breakout" role that made him a star.  Corey Feldman has a lot to thank Spielberg for.

              Also worth noting the number of inappropriate incidents occurring with children and sexualized behaviours at the start of his films. Start of ET: Eliot's brother calls him "penis breath", in "Goonies", the penis on a statue of Michelangelo's David is broken off and "fixed" in the erect position by pre-pubescent boys, Sam Neill demonstrating what a Raptor claw would do to a young boy's torso cutting up from genitals in "Jurassic Park"...

            Certainly there is a large group of hollwwood entertainers that came up around the same time and in the same circles as he did. It would be nice to think that they could come together and arrange a plan with lawyers and evidence and energy to go for it as a team, full-throttle, to expose these pervs/perps. I betcha he is being monitored by the govt hardcore and has been for a long time, so if a plan was put in motion, the pedos and pedo protectors would know it is coming and do anything necessary to stop him and others from speaking too much or too loudly, tho. How complicated and terrifying that must be for him and others in similar situations.

            No it makes him scared.   He is frankly a hero just saying what he said.  If he pushes too hard he dies.  After all they killed the other Corey as a warning.

            No he would be dead if he did. His interview that went as far as he could was as courageous as anyone has ever been. He did give up names. They were in code. These names will take you right to pizzagate and to the whitehouse in 2009. Corey is best known for the movie "Stand by Me"  The cast of the movie are young boys. Research them. One was River Phoenix who died of an overdose allegedly in an exclusive club in Hollywood called "the Vipers". At that time "the Vipers" was owned by Johnny Depp known for very dark behavior that has been posted.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the interview Corey discusses the very powerful people still in Hollywood and says "there are a lot of vipers" out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            River Phoenix and his brother (very prominent actor) were raised in a cult called "the family"  Very sick ideology of pedophelia. The family was known to the US government and in fact visited the Clinton whitehouse. A picture with HRC in the 90's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward to 2009 and the Obama Halloween party that suppressed extensively. There is a thread on this. Johnny Depp is invited to play in Alice &amp; Wonderland Party. Many others involved and secret parties. Alice &amp; Wonderland is a known pedo story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do the math everyone. Victims speak in code as well listen to them.

             Miles Mathis looked into the Phoenix family. He made some pretty good points. River didn't look physically similar to his brother/s. AT ALL. I think this family in particular clearly links back to the Royal Family/Hollywood breeding circles. We don't know anything about these people really. Possibly made-up surnames, and not real blood relatives. It's very difficult to get to the truth of where they came from exactly.

             Not just him, his friends, family, acquaintances, cousin's kids, cousin's friends. The scumbags will go far to keep someone silenced, killing the person isn't how you silence them. Threatening the lives of those they care about is how you silence them, because if you speak up and your friend is killed because of what you said, then you feel as if you have blood on your hands because you spoke up.

             And in the interest of being factually correct, the club Johnny Depp owned was/is called The Viper Room. River Phoenix died on the sidewalk in front of the club.

             Alice in Wonderland is used in Monarch mind control programming and to reinforce the programming of victims out in the real world. Makes you wonder about ol' Johnny.

              Johnny Depp is a humanitarian &amp; has donated millions of his own money to charities that help children. He has also visited sick and dying children on his own time at the hospital. you're just barking up the wrong tree on that one. &amp; yes you're correct - it was called The Viper Room.

             Saying he knows powerful people who are pedophiles is probably more dangerous than outing them. I just couldn't imagine sitting on this. By all accounts, they have somewhat ruined his life, why not go all out? Go public, others will then speak up, and then they'll tell two friends, and so on, and so on, and so on...

             This pizzagate community was used to prevent Milo from gaining more influence within the general public so that the dominate influence can retain their own influence.  This community should be ashamed of itself for indirectly helping the very power structure that it claims to fight.  Milo's identity &amp; flaws uniquely protect him from the

            <p>
             If you need proof, just look at the original video's comments dated before the scandal broke.  No one, not one person, thought that Milo did something severely wrong by not naming names prior to that date.  Because doing so would be defamation of character and could actually decrease the chances of bringing child predators to justice.  Those names need to go to the local police departments of the perpetrators and not the general public until the case can be brought to trial (think about discovery and jury selection).  These lack of comments before that date prove that you were made into useful idiots through persuasion.

                Once we get passed the conditioned notions of legal and illegal that is when Civil war -2 will finally restore justice. Right now there are road blocks everywhere. In light of CIA hacking capabilities as desclosed by Wikileaks, I am sure that the intelligence community are the enablers of this whole thing.

                 This quote from Stalin illustrates our problem.  For most of the population, these crimes are too large and widespread to comprehend, emotionally and mentally.  I doubt that it will be enough to start a war, despite the size and scope of it.  If they try a civil war, it will be by proxy via persuasion.  Such as, persuading people to think that the people in the government who want to prosecute peodos and people who support this (us) are supporting the next Hitler or something.

                 Their hacking capabilities have been known for a while.  The only change is that we now have better detail and more people talking about it.  You can't fight the agency.  It's power structure is secure and protected by our government, which it controls.  It has to be shutdown from the top by someone who has not been compromised by them.  You will know who is or is not compromised by how much CNN hates them.

                  I was born in a country Stalin is from - Georgia, his name was Juxashvili. Stalin was Jesuit trained but when he found out about the Satanism and every other abomination he turned againsy NWO controllers, sending all top Zionist freemasons to Gulag. 
Our chance if taking down this monstrosity is a massive public awakening. Spread the info, expose the shills, expose the network of secret socities - demand laws that no public servant can belong to any secret society! Huge penalties! Time to take action.

                   I agree.  Common people have communication and information tools that people of that time did not have.  We should make full use of them because lies will be told to preserve power.  However, the powerful still have very effective propaganda tools.  See this:
                  </p>

                   <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/HdNTL6f.jpg">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Regardless of if that particular person is a shill or not, we need to learn their persuasion techniques.  Those techniques, which will be used against us, will become much less effective if people know and expect them.

            If he knows but refuses to name the person then they have been free to abuse others over the years.  I think it would have gone nowhere years ago but times are changing now and I think people would be ready to listen and do something.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, he could also arrange with people who would remain 'anonymous' somehow to keep an eye on and investigate said person to try and find definitive proof if the abuse is still ongoing.

            When you're talking about very, very powerful and wealthy people it is easy to end up a suicide with two bullets in the back of your head.

            Or, since the pedophilia tentacles go to the highest levels of power in the world, your car could mysteriously plow into a tree with increasing speed for no reason.

            Or you could suddenly have a "heart attack."
           </p>
           <p>
            This may be why.

            I fully appreciate that Corey come out about what has been going on. But my point is that he is also allowing this to continue? 
I'm not looking to upset anyone here. I just think that as much as Corey is victim he is also allowing this to continue with others at the abusers hands.

            No. He's got a family, and these folks are killers. He has done more than enough. He has suffered more than enough. Maybe get off your high horse? It doesn't help a bit. Instead, appreciate what news he has given us, and respect the power of the evil at the center of PedoWood and the power of its Lawyers to protect these monsters.

            I cannot put blame on the abused. That is wrong. He knows the threat of Hollywood and those that control it.  We would probably do the same.  Could be he is protecting family as well.  They will sometimes threaten your family to cause more guilt or fear of exposure by victims.
