            The reddit says this was a backdoor directory but that keycode site was accessable from the homepage site menu before the redesign. That’s why it was so weird. Comet said it was backup files for restaurant menus and food photos but the large file sizes didn’t jive with that excuse.

            I wanted to weigh in here, because I was in the PG matrix chats at the time this was happening. The access details to the site (pictured) were shared with the chat participants. The .zip files in the screenshot were not able to be downloaded without individual passwords. However, within a few minutes, an unsecured Amazon mirror containing files with identical filenames was found and those files were downloaded and inspected. The files were not actually .ZIP archives but renamed .PDF files. They contained copy-editor corrections ("proofs" ) to Comet's restaurant pizza menu, apparently from a graphics/web designer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit (forgot the screenshot link):
            <a href="https://kek.gg/i/3wJF5H.png">
             https://kek.gg/i/3wJF5H.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Think rationally and let's break it down: Look at the file sizes in the screenshot (look!). We see files of about 11 Mb, and some at 19 Mb, and biggest at 23 Mb. Notice how several of these files have sizes that are similar with only small byte differences? It's because they are multiple versions of the same file(s), PDF menus for the restaurant, and other mundane things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is it password protected? I can only speculate, but it's not uncommon for designers to give their clients a private area to view changes to things that aren't ready for printing/production/publication.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have to doubt the validity of claims that this 'hacker' found "evidence" of CP, since that's exactly what everyone else in the PG matrix chat was also looking for (at the time when this unfolding) and nothing particularly interesting was found by others in the chat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, why would anyone link CP (even it were password protected) to their business website?  I can't believe anyone would be smart enough to evade detection and then be that stupid as to link right to the thing they're trying to hide.. Makes zero sense.

            He was making it up - he produced no evidence, didn't grab any non CP screen shots and became defensive when questioned about details of how/ what he hacked. Just a plant on the not-so-bright Titus Frost.

            We've been having quite a discussion about this very topic in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2314628">
             this thread

            from a couple days ago. If we can re-research what happened, when, I will interview Bigfish, the original hacker, and see how it lines up with his story.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's really interesting is he did a follow up interview with Frost a couple of months ago, and suddenly -- BAM, people are pushing the menu and this other stuff now, hard, on multiple platforms, with even more people showing up screaming "LARP!". In my opinion, documenting the disinfo shilling would be the best way to get to the bottom of the truth of the matter AND fight the shills.

             I listened to the original interview. FWIW, Anon sounded very credible. He was straight and thorough about PG facts, the hacking attempts, what he saw on the encrypted pages with CP, servers across the globe, including Germany (remember Dr. Pong?), and multiple efforts to report to police with their names, and his efforts to follow up with any LEA. Listen to the Frost interview, decide for yourself:

               A shill is a poser pretending to be a normal person but with the sole purpose of swaying opinions in favor of an affiliated group, company, thing, or person. They usually do it because they have a vested interest in protecting or promoting the thing, such as doing it as a favor for a friend or if they are getting paid. There are many ways to shill. The ones online we’re talking about are paid currently by ShareBlue, who is financed by George Soros, and the Clintons among others, and run by David Brock, James Alefantis’ former partner.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you are just a skeptical person and tend to play devil’s advocate then you’re not a shill even though you come across as one all the time, you faggot.

               You wouldn't be here everyday around the clock, day after day. And you wouldn't be so dense as to think the government doesn't conspire. Only Peter Pan thinks that. That is all a conspiracy is. Two or more people deceiving the public. The theory part is the how and why. So you want everybody to know that you are sceptical that we get lied to and something far worse is happening. You think they would never do that, and you just can't find any evidence that they do bad bad things. You are either from Neverland, a virgin to life(see Neverland), or a shill. What adult would utter that they are a skeptic about conspiracies?

                 It is not plausable that you are sombody that just thinks this is stupid, and chooses to be here everyday and repeat it every day. To daily come here and look for an opportunity to ridicule and attempt to discredit, when people really spend time in things that interest tthem. You feel compelled to be here every day with this same topic, and tell us you still don't buy it. I don't buy the flat earth disinfo psyop, and I might drop by to mock it, but I wouldn't spend a year in a forum like that and daily repeat how stupid it is. If you are sincere, you are...very very very odd?

            </p>
            <p>
             I'm going to give this the "Possible Disinfo" flair because there is no context, and at least one of the two hacks was likely fake to discredit the other one.

             For what it's worth, I was in the first Pizzagate discord when this was found, and it is 100% legitimate. The person who found it by getting past the login for that page allegedly was able to download the files. They disappeared after that as well. This is part of the original screenshot they shared, I remember the non-english language in the search bar.

             I also saw this on their server with my own eyes. The fake ass WeThePizza hack came out right after this and that's where the fake menu came from that people, including Joe Biggs from infowars, started pushing as being from Comet. That's how infowars got sued. This is VERY real.. The menu that people have been pushing is fake.

              Yeah, it has been discussed here at the time, but I admit I got totally confused, since there seem to have been two hacks, as
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">
               @Vindicator
              </a>
              has pointed out, but sadly, I can't figure out  which hack produced which screenshot (edit: if at all).
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">
               @Vindicator
              </a>
              suggested we could try to establish a timeline of these two hacks, and might thus be able to establish whether the hacks were legit or not.
