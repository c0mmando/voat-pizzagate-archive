<p>-James Alefantis was at the Indebleu Restaurant for a YouthAIDS benefit event in 2010. It is interesting that Indebleu is owned by  technology veteran Arjun Rishi. Why would a tech guy want to own a Restaurant in D.C.? <a href="http://blog.executivebiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/060323.html">http://blog.executivebiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/060323.html</a> <a href="http://archive.is/aS4qi#selection-2233.0-2233.45">http://archive.is/aS4qi#selection-2233.0-2233.45</a> (James is listed as being in a picture that doesn\'t show up)</p>
<p>-He had his picture taken with Maria Hutcheson, an employee of CEB, Inc., A global research and advice company.

<p>-Found an ad for purchasing a dinner for 6 at Buck\'s Fishing and Camping. In the description. It says that James Alefantis graduated from Georgetown Day School in 1993.

           The regular web page doesn't list James' name (you have to go to the search bar) so I went to w3.org/services/html2txt and converted the page to text, which does list James' name, and archived it.

            It's always a good idea when researching pizzagate related stuff to use several different engines other than Google.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google are far too handy at removing things from being listed.

            I'd recommend focusing on Gavin first for he is a high ranking person in California. Maybe screen shot the conversion for that shows proof of a coverup of donations. Such a coverup could be used as a weapon against Gavin's election bid due to implied corruption.
