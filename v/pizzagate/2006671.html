In 1986, PERSEREC (Personnel Security Research and Education Center), was established in response to the DoD (Department of Defense) Security Review Commission (known as the Stilwell Commission) which was set up in the wake of an espionage case.  Since 1986, PERSEREC has evolved in response to changing needs and opportunities, focusing on security and clearance programs.  
</p>
<p>PERSEREC is still PERSEREC but it is now referred to as the Defense Personnel Security Research Center.  
</p>
<p>In 1988 a report was done at the request of the Navy Appeals Board which is sometimes required to adjudicate cases of people requiring security clearances who had histories of committing child sexual abuse.  The report is called &quot;The Child Sexual Abuse Offender: A Review of Current Research and Implications for Personnel Security.&quot;</p>
<p>This report\'s conclusion and recommendations were as follows:
&quot;Due to the paucity of good research on offender recidivism and in treatment efficacy, personnel security adjudicates were advised to consult one or more of the books reviewed in the research, consider the special circumstances of each individual case in assessing the personal strengths and weaknesses as they pertain to security reliability.&quot;

            No surprise.  I've heard of multiple, credible stories of adults banging underage step children, etc. who were allowed to keep their jobs and their clearances.
