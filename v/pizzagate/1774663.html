            from  a newsletter describing the  similar California legislation NOW IN PROGRESS     Apr 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            quote "
Four bills introduced into the California legislature represent a concerted attack on the fundamental medical freedom enjoyed by Californians since 1848. An integral, perfectly choreographed new paradigm, planning the removal of the parent from the pre- AB2109 condition of having complete freedom of choice over all health choices for himself and his family, to the post-SB426 world, which promises legalized home invasion for anyone with the temerity to refuse not only vaccines but any recommended treatment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Overstated? Impossible? That's what many of us said when AB2109 was being rammed through back in 2012.
            <a href="http://www.thedoctorwithin.com/newsletters/newsletter-may-2012/">
             http://www.thedoctorwithin.com/newsletters/newsletter-may-2012/
            </a>
            Couldn't happen here, too radical, unconstitutional, etc. Right.
           </p>
           <p>
            FIRST HORSEMAN
           </p>
           <p>
            AB2109 or 'Freedom With Permission' as many called it - breezed right through the legislature and became law with very little opposition. With this law, the parent now needed an MD's permission in order to have a philosophical opinion. The parent alone could no longer opt out of vaccines for the child.
           </p>
           <p>
            The irresponsible, unversed, uninterested legislators on the AB 2109 "Committee" discovered how easy it was to simply ignore a few hundred whiners protesting the bill on the Capitol steps out front. What power did they have? In one fell swoop, 70 years of sane law regarding a parent's right to opt out of vaccines for the children simply vanished in the haze.
           </p>
           <p>
            SECOND HORSEMAN
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing how easily Californians surrendered their rights to make health choices for their own children, the Pan-handlers simply punched up the next of the Four Horsemen: SB277. Stands to reason - if the majority of voters place no value on a parent's philosophical opinion of health choice, well let's just take away the choice altogether. They won't mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            And they were right. The draconian SB277 - the most repressive health bill in US history, breezed right through the CA legislature. The philosophical exemption to vaccines was simply abolished altogether, like it never existed.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIRD HORSEMAN
           </p>
           <p>
            Not satisfied even with this advance toward State control over the individual, we saw in the March 2017 newsletter the next Horseman, now lining up at the starting gate: SB18, the cleverly named Child's Bill of Rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            A not very subtle example of Bernaysian thinktank duplicity, the meticulously vague Child's Bill of Rights is diabolical more for what it does not say than for what it does say.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the Jan 2017 Newsletter
           </p>
           <p>
            “THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
           </p>
           <p>
            SECTION 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            (a) The Legislature finds and declares that all children and youth, regardless of gender, class, race, ethnicity, national origin, culture, religion, immigration status, sexual orientation, or ability, have inherent rights that entitle them to protection, special care, and assistance, including, but not limited to, the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            (1) The right to parents, guardians, or caregivers who act in their best interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) The right to form healthy attachments with adults responsible for their care and well-being.
           </p>
           <p>
            (3) The right to live in a safe and healthy environment.
           </p>
           <p>
            (4) The right to social and emotional well-being.
           </p>
           <p>
            (5) The right to opportunities to attain optimal cognitive, physical, and social development.
           </p>
           <p>
            (6) The right to appropriate, quality education and life skills leading to self-sufficiency in adulthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            (7) The right to appropriate, quality health care.
           </p>
           <p>
            (b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California created by Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009), to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California’s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.
           </p>
           <p>
            SEC. 2.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact appropriate legislation to accomplish all of the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            (a) Develop and put forth research-based policy solutions that will ensure the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.
           </p>
           <p>
            (b) Determine the amount of revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.
           </p>
           <p>
            (c) Identify and obtain the revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Grim enough what the bill says, but far worse is what this vague language implies. A judge might easily say,
           </p>
           <p>
            “Hello, I’ll be your judge today. Oh you haven’t vaccinated your child? Well, according to this new law your child has the legal right
           </p>
           <p>
            “To live in a safe and healthy environment”
           </p>
           <p>
            and also has
           </p>
           <p>
            “the right to appropriate health care.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “An unvaccinated child doesn’t seem “safe and healthy” to me right now, and since I’m feeling frisky, I think I’ll find for the prosecutor – I hereby pronounce you in violation of this law. You have 5 days to vaccinate, or else Social Services will be taking your child from you…”
           </p>
           <p>
            That kind of scenario is completely possible – in fact it’s already happening. But with the passage of these oppressive new laws, it will likely happen with logarithmically increasing frequency in California.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that’s the dark side of the new legislation – the vague, undefined words that make this bill so sinister:
           </p>
           <p>
            “healthy” 
“appropriate” 
“health care”
           </p>
           <p>
            Who’s to say? These words are loaded. They may seem innocuous enough, but it would be the prerogative of a jury or a judge to define them for each particular case. And that could force not only vaccines on any child, but feasibly, any course of drug or surgical treatment recommended by any medical tests, no matter how cursory, or erroneously undertaken. That’s the way this law can be interpreted – it’s wide open.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who’s to say what is ‘appropriate’? What’s the standard? Medical orthodoxy – the same unscientific belief system that makes the US the sickest of all industrialized nations on earth, and presides over the sharpest increase in childhood diseases in US history… ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Kids don’t need the government to suddenly give them any rights – new rights that Americans have never before needed to have enumerated. "
           </p>
           <p>
            END

            Any Ontarioans here?  Do you guys have the equivalent of a U.S. Birth Certificate issued by the government when you "register" the birth of your child?  Given the (secret, real) relationship between our countries, I assume that you do.
           </p>
           <p>
            if you do, then guess what!?  Your registered child IS the property of the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing the law can save a lot of time.

           <p>
            Not saying I agree with it.  Facts are facts.

             Wrong, your LEGAL NAME is a FICTION.  Therefore you adopt a natural name, as a natural living man and reclaim the sovereignty of your mind and body.

            What is even going on? Please parents from Canada, Ontario check bill 89!
I cannot even express my horror!!
It is kind of pizzagate related.. because it gives power to the govt. to make decisions regarding your children!
