            This is exactly what makes him a gatekeeper, speaking truth mixed with lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "code words" can be found all over Hollywood, spanning back decades.  There's no way it's a couple pedos who like to hang around a couple pizza places.  This kind of view is exactly what confuses investigators and leads them down false trails.

            He is trying to divide and conquer PizzaGate, which means he works for the wrong team.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, we can thank him for exposing information to people who know nothing, but he's burying the most important aspects people should focus on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Hollywood normalization propaganda is a huge part of the problem..

            Mike has said some nasty, bullyish shit on social media, and his views on women and hets is timeline established.
I'm convinced he is coat-tailing PedoGate, politics and Trump for fame. But that is just my opinion.

            Cernovich has been a leader in the Pedogate investigations.  I watch almost all his periscopes and youtube, its very clear to those that are patriots that Cerno is a Good Guy.  There has been an huge campaign to smear him over the past few weeks, and this feels like a Lazy attempt to do the same.

            You've said eloquently and succinctly what I've been thinking for months.  Someone on the Rothschild team is leaking bits of info to Cernovich to make him look credible.  His views on rape are disgusting. He's been very open about his adoration of Dershowitz. Cernovich is all about self-promotion and profit. He'll hitch his wagon to anybody or anything which will feather his bed and serve his hunger for notoriety and greed. He doesn't care about rape victims.

             They have deleted the post that links Cernovich to Epstein, and Epstien to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

             We know a deal was made in early election that Trump wouldn't talk about Hillary fucking children, if she didn't talk about Trump fucking children. Trump reneged on the deal and hired these paid dogs to talk about 'hillary', now its time post election to talk about Trump fucking children.

             Russian media is saying that Cernovich is the creator "Pizzagate", essentially also ran
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/theDonald">
              /r/theDonald
             </a>
             on Reddit, and they later sled pizzagate to voat to distance it from
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/theDonald">
              /r/theDonald
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             If it be TRUE that Cernovich has ties to Epstein, then clearly the entire PG program was to focus on comet-ping-pong during the election and NOT focus on Epstein and Trump flights to the Island with his daughter Ivanka and Bill Clinton.

            There is something much deeper going on here everyone. First Cernovich is an attorney himself and Dershowitz was accused after he was involved in the high profile case with the US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dershowitz took the accuser to court and sued for libel after it was found she was being paid by a third party. He won.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not know anything else but can assure you this is much deeper than you think.

            I'm pursuing the truth as well but I'm not so sure about all this.
           </p>
           <p>
            In cahoots, colluding with, and all that seem mostly unsupported. I know that was the argument of the lawyers who argued against Cernovich's motion but I'm gonna need some actual thorough proof of this before I write him off.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've questioned this myself recently and apart from the contentions of the lawyers who argued against his motion there isn't much if any evidence of being in cahoots with or colluding with Doucheawits.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not against looking in to it but these conclusions, as they stand, are extremely weak. Also he seems to be doing good work and gaining momentum. Just my two cents. If you disagree I'd like to see some actual evidence.

             You've got to be fucking kidding. Cernovich wants to make public the same sealed court papers as Dershowitz. Cernovich sees Dershowitz as one of his main inspirations and is photographed with him. We've got Mike's attorneys brown-nosing Dershowitz on their blog. Hmmm, I wonder what could be going on????????? Are you sure you're pursuing the truth?

               Did you even read the original post and the links provided? Do I need to spoon-feed you? Click on "in cahoots" above. Read the court paper. Page 3. Dershowitz inspired Cernovich to go to law school. Now click "sucking" above. Read the blog post. A blanket dismissal of the charges against Dershowitz from one of Mike's attorneys, there's another one of his attorneys in the comments (Wolman). The fact that Randazza calls him Dersh is also very revealing as it suggests he's on friendly terms.

                Yeah I read most of that already.

                It is plausible that the VICTIM's lawyer made the argument for procedural and stratgegic reasons to better serve their client. The fact that the lawyer made the argument that Cernovich's motion was for X purpose does not prove that the motion was for X purpose. Furthermore there is nothing I can see in this particular motion that proves that cernovich filed this motion with the intent of assisting doucheawits. Like I said before, I'm going to need some more context or evidence before reaching that conclusion apart from the contentions of the lawyer who argued against his motion.

                And what I would really like is proof of the claim previously mentioned:

                 This court doc literally spells out that they are working together. You have two sides - Dershowitz or Virginia's. Cernovich is on Dershowitz. Plus throw in that Cernovich tried to claim Epstein was suing him when he was not. But believe what you will.
