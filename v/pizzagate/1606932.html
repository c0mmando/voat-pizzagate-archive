<p>Miller has joined Teneo Strategy as “managing director,” according to his Twitter bio, in a sign that Teneo is “adapting for a Trump-run world,” Axios reports. That’s significant because Teneo was founded by Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton aide who was at the center of Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations.</p>

<p>Miller served as communications director during Trump’s presidential campaign, and was set to join the White House in the same capacity, but bowed out after allegedly being entangled in relationship with an ex- colleague.</p>
