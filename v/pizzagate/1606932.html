<p>Jason Miller, a one-time member of Donald Trump’s inner circle, has a new job at a D.C. consulting firm that was founded by the man credited with running “Bill Clinton Inc.” This is what a swamp creature looks like.</p>
<p>Miller has joined Teneo Strategy as “managing director,” according to his Twitter bio, in a sign that Teneo is “adapting for a Trump-run world,” Axios reports. That’s significant because Teneo was founded by Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton aide who was at the center of Clinton Foundation pay-for-play allegations.</p>

<p>And from the NY Post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teneo, founded by Bill Clinton’s longtime personal aide Doug Band, hired Trump’s former communications director Jason Miller, Axios reported in a newsletter.</p>
<p>Miller served as communications director during Trump’s presidential campaign, and was set to join the White House in the same capacity, but bowed out after allegedly being entangled in relationship with an ex- colleague.</p>
