Here\'s the first Satanic band called Coven.</p>

<p>They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture. ( http://sli.mg/senxlZ)).</p>
<p>Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.</p>
<p>Bill Traut Jewish</p>

<p>Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.</p>
<p>"The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."</p>

<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.</p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.</p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.</p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.</p>
<p>" You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."</p>

<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.</p>
<p>http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>',

            Before you go profiling "jews", it might be prudent to recognize that most religions employ some kind of left hand path to accommodate those who have a desire to make evil. While we CANNOT,  MUST NOT vilify entire races and groups of people, one certainly cannot deny the pure evil that is the left hand path of the Jewish faith.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Although Lilith has become a demonized representation of promiscuity and disobedience, she should instead be seen as a positive figure, a symbol of autonomy, sexual equality, and control of a one’s own destiny. Often associated with the Serpent in the Garden of Eden, in this incarnation Lilith symbolically freed humankind from the tyrannical rule of a trickster god. The expulsion from the Garden should not be looked at a curse, but as the beginnings of a destined journey to consciousness. Lilith is the supreme representation of the left-hand path woman, independent, having discarded the patriarchal yoke, and not afraid to use all the tools available to her, including her sexuality, to gain the most out of existence."

              So what really is the point you are making? (realise this questions comes from an agnost, so I don't accept or deny any religion) People who do bad things, do bad things, they can't claim religion as a reason for breaking the law (not in this day and age I hope)
             </p>
             <p>
              So either come up with some the list of people of interest, you found though this interview and research how it's connected to PG. We are on a child-abuse hunt here, if you want to keep mixing in religion you come across as biased. Let's try not to be, be neutral. Let's find the bastards involved in this scheme regardless of what their believes are.

               They're following their religion. They read a book that tells them what to do.

              man if I didn't really really need my internet to do my job i'd have so much more to say on the matter.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I will say is that anyone who strictly follows the Talmud think that the rest of us are put on this earth just to serve them. We are Goyem plain and simple.
             </p>
             <p>
              But like I said i'm gonna tread lightly here. I know and love plenty of Jews who have little to no real understanding of the Talmud.
             </p>
             <p>
              Personally I think that any religion that believes there is only one RACE of humans who are loved by god and the rest are born to be their slaves is out and out disgusting... just sayin ;)

                 I'm already being monitored and I've been followed leaving the house, and I've also had some other strange occurrences that I won't even mention because nobody will believe me.  I'm not sure if you've heard of me, but basically I've been exposing the Jews for a while now.  I'm prepared to die or be imprisoned for my cause.  I'm not a sitting duck either and used to be an intelligence asset.

                  D'you know if this was a few years ago i'd be writing you off and saying you'd be suicided or something.... but since Savile bit the dust and now that so many secrets have bubbled up I actually don't think you've got anything to worry about anymore.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The problem with having a global secret network of power is that it relies on compartmentalization of knowledge and information and 'whoever' is at the helm has not been able to stay ahead of the technology curve. I know they'd like to think that they will be able to 'control' things but the simple fact is we're moving into a world were technology has allowed the spread of information and enabled global communication instantly.... secrets can't stay secret in a world like that!!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I even think all the effort they're putting into using Pizzagate to lock down this technology is working against them.... mass migration off twitter to Gab,, off Reddit to Voat,,, off Gmail to BitMessage,,, etc etc. that's the beauty of tech and the fact of the matter is the generations coming up born into this world are going to expect a level of transparency that any Cabal of power cannot manage.

                  It's why I loved Trump getting caught out saying stupid shit [which he will be prone to do because he's not a trained politician]. And even better the way the world accepts it,,, the people born into this tech enabled world are different. We know that if you're human then you're gonna have posted/said/been photographed doing some embarrassing or stupid shit. That's all forgivable. What's not forgivable is pretending you are a perfect human being while hiding despicable deeds [if that makes sense].

               You're spot on.

               Jews say they're " the chosen people of God" ,  which means they are God's master race, and Judaism instructs the Jews to control us.  They think they own us through divine right.

               I'm a zio-analyst.  I know all about the Jews. From their religion, to their history, to their genetic composition, politics, everything.
