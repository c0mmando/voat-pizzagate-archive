<p>Made me wonder....Keith Olbermann seems awfully upset these days.</p>
<p>So, I Googled:</p>
<p>Keith Olbermann James Alefantis (Look for Top Poitico PDF Link)  -- Amazing to me that Keith Olbermann would magically be speaking at the SAME event with David Brock, where the subject is FAKE NEWS and specifically Comet Pizza is covered. There are like 7 billion people on the planet. How on Earth is it possible for David Brock, Keith Olbermann and James Alefantis to exist in ONE PDF document??</p>
<p>Google: Keith Olbermann David Brock
Google: Keith Olbermann NAMBLA -- (Maybe weak, but allegations have been around for years.)</p>
<p>Is Keith Olbermann hitting so hard at Trump to defelect attention for all his &quot;pals&quot;?</p>
<p>Making no allegations, but it truly is amazing that when you find that Politico PDF, you will clearly see that these guys surely flock in the same circles.</p>
<p>MODS: This is Pizzagate related due specifically because Olbermann recently spoke at a Politico conference wherein &quot;Fake News&quot; was the subject matter being discussed and the case example of &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot; was front and center.</p>
<p>Keith Olbermann is a public figure and has the potential to lead and/or mislead the public on important matters and has weighed in considerably on James Comey\'s firing as well as matters that relate to this inquiry.</p>
<p>He has come out swinging hard for James Comey and is literally calling on foreign governments to interfere with our Nation. </p>
<p>Is something is WAY out of proportion here. Is he hiding something?</p>
<p>Please dig.</p>
<p>I wonder how he &quot;follows&quot; on Twitter...what music he likes, how he feels about Spirit Cooking, etc.</p>

            I keep track of Olbermann who also appears on Bill Maher (major Killary shill) show. Maher defened pedophilia on his show a few years back. Nothing like pedos in arms! Keith (and Maher) does sound rather desperate. And given Jacke Tapper's &amp; Wife ties to CPP one wonders if all of the leftist (and right) media are not into CPP - again it is not a question of who is part of it, but who is NOT part of it. Thanks for the post, since I have been following that liberal shill since Trump won the election.

             I can't explain it.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is just something so "off" with many of these people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sort of a "False Light".
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a "something" that on the one hand mimmicks "power", but on the other hand, is vacuous and empty; sort of a vampiric black hole.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of them feel so hateable to me. They are so cunningly manipulative, but feel devoid of substance, character or ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
             Empty, vacuous Soul-less people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Abuse victims, all?
Satanists, all?
Narcissists, all?
            </p>
            <p>
             All of the above?
None of the above?
            </p>
            <p>
             I just don't know, but I do know the inner feeling of the "creeps" I get whenever I view any of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wonder how alone I am in these ramblings.

              I share the same intuition. like they are always 'in character,' or 'playing a role.' I strongly recommend you searching up 'when your gut was right' topics on reddit. I think you'll highly enjoy those.

              Also you wonder if most of them come from satanic families (Luzzatto as an example) with alter egos like Podesta / Skippy - it's vicious cycle of abuse/abuser. Firing Comey was one big step, time to really drain the swamp. 
I too sense sone dark vibes about these media celebs - Colbert especially!

                And his 'jokes' are getting more crass and in bad taste all the time it's as if he is panicking! We know he is Podesta's buddy and how Podesta Group funded Colbert's sister's campaign (probably held fundraising at that 'kid friendly' pizza joint. Colbert may turn out to be another Jimmy Saville - looks freakish.

                 Colby teaches sunday school and i'm willing to bet $100 that a student kid not his own has sat on his lap. I was always suspicious of his 'devout catholic' status; apparently, it's a good cover. also, he paraded his disgusting feet on some magazine cover in an article mocking pizzagate.

            Olbermann came into MSNBC directly from ESPN in 2003, then he was back at ESPN from 2013 to 2015. He has been weird every since, and increasingly so. He has been melting down further since the election. No stable relationship with any woman (two brief lavender marriages for show) and no children.

            Your post is excellent, relevant and may be a possible new lead. Let's find out where he gets his pizza, and whatever else.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a little more:
            <strong>
             Olbermann matriculated to Cornell at the age of 16
            </strong>
            (unusual back then) and graduated with a major in communication.
           </p>

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Olbermann
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Cornell is as well known for CIA recruiting and activity as MIT
            </strong>
            --remember that Bill Nye is a Cornell alumnus, and Joan Baez' father worked for the CIA there as well.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He criticized Penn State, with bad spelling not befitting an Ivy League grad:
            <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/02/24/keith_olbermann_suspended_from_espn_after_twitter_fight_over_penn_state.html">
             http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/02/24/keith_olbermann_suspended_from_espn_after_twitter_fight_over_penn_state.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This was allegedly why he was fired from ESPN. Maybe, like Comey, they did something to him before he was an adult, and now it's all catching up.
           </p>
           <p>
            What happened to Comey at 15:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But on the other hand, he was very vocal about how the sex abuse scandal was handled there so he may be on the right side or just disgusted:
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Olbermann may not necessarily like the company he has to keep for his career to be viable. Apparent contradictions merit investigations as they indicate there is a lot we don't know.

            Both are reviled by their own party and that's saying something in a party of Progressives. The Democrat brain trust call Brock "crazy" and "a nut bar".

            And Keith Olberman, a.k.a. "Captain Crazy Pants", couldn't keep a gig on planet Earth's most Left Wing tv station outside of North Korea.

            I wouldn't think he has a wide circle of friends. Never married but has been in two relationships with female newscasters, Katy Tur and Laura Ingram. Neither seem the marrying type. Has one disfunction, and one kink. Not a very nice one either.

            ters wants to set Democrats up with **"Koch Bros." **type financing,
but actually Koch Bros. was financing the DLC, along with other large corporations long, long ago.
In fact, they seem to have recruited Bill Clinton for the presidency.
The Koch Family/John Birch Society have been trying to overturn democracy in the US for about 100 years now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Near end of article, Keith Olbermann mentioned -- as well as Alefantis . . .
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The conference’s more eclectic offerings include a welcome speech from liberal newscaster** Keith Olbermann**; cameos by two Republicans, Bill Weld and Richard Painter; and a session on “Fake News: What It Is and What To Do About It,” led by Brock’s former boyfriend of 10 years,
             <strong>
              James Alefantis,
             </strong>
             owner of Comet Ping Pong, the D.C. pizza place that became ensnared for weeks in #pizzagate, the campaign to spread viral and vulgar fake news stories involving Clinton at the restaurant.&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
             *Why hasn’t the DLC — which was funded by Koch Bros. for one — been thrown out of the Dem Party?
            </p>
            <p>
             *&gt;Holy crap; this is new to me. Didn’t realize that the DLC had sunk so low; had to Google to verify
            </p>
            <p>
             One member of the DLC’s executive council is none other than Koch Industries, the privately held, Kansas-based oil company whose namesake family members are avatars of the far right, having helped to found archconservative institutions like the Cato Institute and Citizens for a Sound Economy. Not only that, but two Koch executives, Richard Fink and Robert P. Hall III, are listed as members of the board of trustees and the event committee, respectively–meaning that they gave significantly more than $25,000.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Koch Industries gave funding to the DLC and served on its Executive Council

            Still questions about Olberman marriage or divorce with Katy Tur.
No children, however -- at least that's clear.
