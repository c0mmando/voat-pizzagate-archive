            This goes hand in hand with their program of gangstalking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's say someone makes an accusation, and files a suit. There are several ways they work to disengage the threat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mental health - claim the person is crazy, or drive them to acting seemingly crazy to either imprision the threat or discredit the validity of the allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drive them crazy from a distance using em weapons, follow them in person, make them increasingly paranoid. Then highlight the person's paranoia and stretch it to back before the allegations were made.

             Thanks, I don't know why archive.is had a problem with it, I'm pretty sure I've seen pdf's on archive.is before.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree with you with regards to gangstalking, if you haven't been at truth seeking for multiple lifetimes and have some type of protection you will likely get hit at some point. I personally think the gangstalking thing has been going on from Day 1 (year 0) of Pisces, people simply didn't know what to call it. People have a history of hearing voices in their head and when they tried to explain it they were thrown in dungeons, mocked, arrested, or these days committed to an insane asylum. The pedophilia thing has been going on the whole time too - ancient Greece, ancient Rome, middle East, even now in the middle of nowhere in Afghanistan they still abuse little boys (they are called "dancing boys").
