<p>So I have been watching her Twitter since she was mentioned the other day and found these all very interesting. Now she keeps saying number 8, which she stated before her Twitter got shut down that she would post dossiers and a whole treasure trove of things, if you will, on the 28th of this year. Didn\'t say if it was November or December but here is why I\'m thinking it has to be in December 28th. </p>
<p>The number 8 is significant in Judaism for one thing: Hanukkah and specifically the miracle of Hanukkah. Now Hanukkah just happens to land on December 24th of this year, and obviously it is for 8 days. Now in Sephardic or Mizrahim (Mediterranean and Israeli Jewish BTW) communities, Hanukkah is treated differently in that we have different customs other than our Ashkenazi counterparts. For instance, we have no latkes during Hanukkah, but we do make jelly donuts, which personally I like much better than latkes. Never had much of a taste for the things. We also do not allow all of the kids to light the menorah until they are old enough to understand, which is around 5 or 6, depending on the kid, and then the child only gets to light the shamash <em>on the fourth day</em>. Now this is guess what, on the 28th of this year! The head of the household or the Jew of the household if the head of the household is not Jewish, will light the candles and say the prayer with the family standing beside them. Our Mezuzahs go left on the doorpost instead of the right, and much like our Mediterranean neighbors, we don\'t get overtly excited over things like those EuroJews do. We\'re generally the more laid back of the communities in the Jewish world. </p>
<p>Anyways, if you look at the pictures that Tzipi Mazuz has posted it\'s of two flowers and two gems. The two flowers are poinsettias, and narcissus, and the gems are Turquoise and Tanzanite. Any ideas or thoughts on what this might mean? Maybe she\'s posting in code? Who knows.</p>',
