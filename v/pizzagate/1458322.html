   Suspicious person blindly defending James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong for 2 days deleted his/her account. Luckily I had a backup. Googled his username, it was tied to the occult.

           <p>
            The protestation that nothing is weird about Alefantis Instagram images and they are "typical of any aging edgy punk rock type" is too specific.  This is the description of a cover, and I believe Alefantis is a covert operator with this cover.  This person arguing with  you sounds like they may be close to him.

            Yep, always look for their horse in the race, skin in the game, etc. My ass they're out there championing free speech and open debate. Check their comment history and you find SJW talking points at the very least. They are outright pedos themselves or active cultural saboteurs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Free speech and open debate does not encompass bad faith and disingenuous argument, or sophistry.

             Ever since Spirit Cooking hit the scenes I've been a firm believer that these elites are a part of a satanic cult. It's what binds them together. The cult offers them power, fame, fortune, but they have to sell their soul to it.

             Well, I know this is probably a rhetorical question, but I'll take a stab at the answer anyway, as some people may not really grasp it.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are two predominating worldviews we can develop through childhood. One is the traditional view of modern society - where everyone is actually a living breathing person. We recognize the consciousness of the individuals around us, and seek to exchange value in one way or another.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other is the power paradigm, which regards everyone as either a victim, or an aggressor. The individual grows up lacking empathy for other people, and may not even consider them real. Some of this is genetic, but for others it is thrust upon them via abuse, lack of counter-guidance when they display aggressive behavior to other children, always getting what they want, and a whole slew of other things. Some of this is very intentionally perpetrated by the parents, but the result is generally a solipsism - the root of narcissism and psychopathy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, people with a solipsistic world view don't generally see the benefit of trading with others, or having mutually beneficial relationships. They do, however, desire power and control. There is no reason to work, when you can get others to do that work for you. There are two tools for this - persuasion and force. Petty criminals learn only a small portion of these two ideas, and only learn it through experience (which often lands them in jail). Other individuals are more privileged, and get access to certain philosophies to help them navigate the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             The occult is powerful in the regard, and should not be dismissed as entirely for kooks. Behind the symbolism are masked methods of controlling your prey, and gaining real world power. The occult is also a mechanism for control in itself - a giant ponzi scheme. If you engage in these practices with others, then you often perform illegal acts which allows you to be controlled. The only way out is for you to work your way up the food chain.
            </p>
            <p>
             The elite in the world operate mostly by the power paradigm. Not all of them are into the occult, of course, but they may very well follow the same ideologies. They know that corrupted people are most easy to control, and so their corrupt narratives are pushed to the masses. Irresponsible behavior is lauded as cool, and occult symbolism runs rampant in media. From childhood to grave, you can be subjected to this propaganda. It's a net to snare people into their ideology, and to have them worship man (ie, the State), and become their fodder.
            </p>
            <p>
             The occult is rising in America, and other countries as well. It's running rampant in Mexico, El Salvador, and parts of South America from what I understand. Many of these people think they're being edgy or something by adopting certain symbols and whatnot, and are actually harmless. Others aren't, and they're actually involved as little foot soldiers in this group.

            Disinfo, but why would he have an obscure divination method as a name if there are satanic elements in pizzagate? They are trying to create an association between ALL the old ways and satanism. Thereby covering their tracks. To understand this whole issue you have to understand the "war" within the occult. This is a game of guilt by association.

             I'm interested in hearing more about this. Care to elaborate?

              Sure. The distinction is between white and black magic. The former works with aspects of the universe serving an objective benefit, the latter with subjective self interest/indulgence.

              Not sure why you were downvoted. I've been doing a lot of research into the occult and Satanism lately because of the connections I'm seeing with it and Pizzagate, and I'm very interested in learning about this war within the occult myself.
