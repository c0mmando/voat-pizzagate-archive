<p><em>Michelle Remembers</em> is a book about a child\'s memories of ritual abuse. She talks about people having their middle fingers cut off.

<p>I notice that every single article about Laurence Pazder\'s book <em>Michelle Remembers</em> refers to it being \'debunked\', \'discredited\' and a case of false memory syndrome.  Pazder was later called upon to act as an expert in the McMartin Preschool trial.   No wonder victims don\'t come forward--they\'re vilified by the judicial system and the press.  They\'re told they\'re wrong, they\'re maligned and branded as \'attention-seeking\' and \'crazy\'.  And their therapists don\'t come forward either:</p>
<p><em>“Good luck with your life,” said another child therapist, one of whose patients is among the children making such accusations. “My car was blown up ten days ago.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jashow.org/articles/guests-and-authors/dr-john-ankerberg/satanism-and-witchcraft-the-occult-and-the-west-satanic-bible/">https://www.jashow.org/articles/guests-and-authors/dr-john-ankerberg/satanism-and-witchcraft-the-occult-and-the-west-satanic-bible/</a></p>
<p>Here is another article with firsthand accounts of child victims of satanic rituals.  It talks about the therapists not speaking because of death threats and threats of violence towards family members.  The children give personal accounts of rituals, being hung upside down, being forced to eat faeces and drink blood and urine. </p>
<p><em>..they take little children and tie them up; put them In cages and tunnels; beat and torture them; turn them upside down and hold them in water; cut, stab and rape them; force them to eat their feces and drink their urine and blood; and disembowel, dismember and kill them while ejaculating</em></p>

<p>Lastly, the following mentions politicians being expected to do things before being chosen to be elected; a city under Washington DC where satanic rituals are performed; Jay Z and Kanye and other artists being raped, sodomised before being allowed to become famous. </p>

            It will be tough for the majority of the population when this finally comes out.  So strange that it's been all around us!  I think that creates a lot of the disbelief.  How could we not know?  Gonna be a rough year for many!  Your post was a hard read for me and I've been awake for a bit now.

              The middle-finger cutting is part of a satanic ritual that is about asking for might and power. The finger cutting is the "payment" for that. These rituals follow a strict precision in that he could not chose a different finger. That is why you can witness repeated cutting: Cut - heal - cut - heal - cut - heal etc.   Much like a heroin addict has his favorite blood vessel location to inject, using the same location over and over until it just won't work any more.

              Yes, he did have surgery. I posted a fb post in a pizza gate group about it. I think that the scarring on his fingers is also from rituals though.

              I got banned from Twitter for posting the emails relating to the surgery on his fingers.

            The bible says that days will get so bad it will be hard for flesh to even live. There is hope in Jesus Christ yet! In the midst of this God protects His own. The deceived and the deceiver will wax worse and worse. God has a peace that knows no fear. Turn to Jesus Christ and have protection under His wings!

            None of these victims are delusional nor crazy or anything else. They're victims even more so due to this state/system demarginalization agenda that's deeply entrenched in fields like Psychology, Mental Health care. These fields are used to discredit victims by their elitist PhD doctors circles to nullify the victims' beliefworthiness with peers. How does this work?
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone attempts to 'validate' any information they learn about, to validate truth there in. When one considers one's beliefsystem to be a, more technically called, a
            <strong>
             truth-tree
            </strong>
            , one can say a few things:
           </p>
           <p>
            Labels like
            <strong>
             PhD
            </strong>
            cause people's 'truth-trees' to be write-enabled to these PhDs or otherwise folk that push PhD endorsed information. What I mean by 'write-enabling' is that people allow this information be shoveled in without any further truth validation. Because well, it's a PhD!
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, when malicious psychologists in mental healthcare label victims "schizophrenic", as whistleblowers are often labeled by a PhD, it in reality 'write-protects' people's truth-trees from the one being labeled schizophrenic. Resulting in peers of the victim no longer accepting any truths from the victim while being all nice and caring to the victim. But they won't take and accept their truths.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             These are neural programming crimes at its worst.

             On his way to the USA to introduce his psych baloney (including "infantile sexuality"), Sigmund Freud said, "We are bringing them a plague".

             His nephew, Edward Bernays wrote the book "Propaganda" (about mind control) in 1928.

             His grandson, Clement Freud, a famous radio personality, known child molester (now deceased) rented his Portuguese villa to the Podesta brothers at the time Madeline McCann "disappeared". He also invited MM's parents, whom he allegedly did not know beforehand to come to his house to enjoy his "cuisine".

              This occulted knowledge is key to planetary enlightenment and global freedom. You are very advanced in your occult knowledge. Can you describe to me how the learning of lower level freemason tracing boards seems to be forgotten (if not outright rejected) by higher level freemasons? It seems like they go through a path of enlightenment, until one day they say fuck it, and go through total spiritual annihilation and global/self-destruction at the top levels. I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation, but I can't figure it out yet. Thanks
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: I just read some of your referenced posts. It seems like brick and mortar / lodge freemasonry is rotten to its very core.

               I see that responding to this degenerate is not worth the time or effort.  Best to ignore these ones.  Although your 3 points are great and you are right, the degenerate has low IQ and very laughable.   Always good to laugh every day and the shills provide just that.

                Absolutely agree, I just thought a cheap laugh was in order. 
Hopefully when ignored they'll disappear, but this one does seem to be persevering.

                Whatever the reason for their writings, at the end of it all, they're the ones who have to look themselves in the mirror. For that, I almost pity them.
