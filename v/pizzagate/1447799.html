<p>&quot;file similar charges against three additional men: former president of BBC Worldwide America Garth Ancier, former president of Disney TV David Neuman, and Gary Goddard, a designer who created theme park attractions for Universal Studios.&quot;
&quot;Attorney Herman called the incidents part of a “Hollywood sex ring” and both he and Egan encouraged other victims to come forward.&quot;

<p>&quot;So far, no witnesses have come forward to corroborate Egan\'s accusations regarding any of the four. But the idea that underage boys were drugged and raped at the Encino estate, and sometimes threatened with guns by Collins-Rector, is hardly new. Egan was one of several young men to make such allegations in lawsuits filed against Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce 14 years ago -- court cases in which the plaintiffs won $4.5 million from Collins-Rector and Shackley by default because the trio had fled the country (Pierce reached a settlement). Egan and other plaintiffs also named several John Does but did not include Singer or the others he now is accusing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is undeniable is the stench that arose from the long-ago parties in Encino. In suits filed against Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce in 2000, Egan and several other young men alleged they were &quot;sexually and physically abused,&quot; &quot;forced … through coercion or subversion to consume controlled substances and/or prescription drugs&quot; and &quot;threatened with physical injury and economic harm.&quot; They cited a list of drugs allegedly pushed on them, including &quot;Valium, Vicodin, Xanax, Percocet, marijuana, hashish, Ecstasy and Rufinol&quot; -- the date-rape drug.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another alleged victim was said to have made similar allegations and shot a video to document the house\'s copious drug supply: a bag filled with Percocet, Vicodin, Xanax, Valium, marijuana and Ecstasy. There also were accusations that Collins-Rector would intimidate his victims by brandishing a gun. &quot;Do you know what I can do with this,&quot; he would say, leveling the barrel at them, &quot;and get away with it?&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After a New Jersey grand jury indicted Collins-Rector in 2000, he fled the country, along with Shackley and Pierce. The trio surfaced in May 2002 in a villa in the south Spanish beach city of Marbella. Police found guns, machetes and child pornography in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pierce\'s most recent bio says he is co-founder of GoCoin, ExpressCoin, KnCMiner.cn and Robocoin Asia. He is described as &quot;a sought-after commentator on the Bitcoin economy&quot; and &quot;a prolific angel investor&quot; who has raised more than $200 million on behalf of his companies and led more than 30 acquisitions during his career.&quot;</p>

            As far as Singer. Trump just appointed someone with connections to X-Men.
