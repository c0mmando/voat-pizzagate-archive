</ul>
<p>Now it\'s time to ease them into #pizzagate.  Don\'t mention Hillary or the Dems just yet.  Simply ask them if they knew that Anthony Weiner was caught sexting a minor.  Show them this article <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/can-anthony-weiner-go-to-jail-for-sexting-a-15-year-old-w441525">http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/can-anthony-weiner-go-to-jail-for-sexting-a-15-year-old-w441525</a></p>
<p>Then ask if they knew about Jeffrey Epstein and show them this <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html</a> then talk to them about the Lolita Express and Pedophile Island.  You\'ll need to add that Jeffrey Epstein was a schmoozer.  So he had lots of flights to his party island that were not pedophile related, so not everyone who flew with him is guilty.</p>
<p>Next, mention this recent story, just to emphasize recent revelations that ARE related to the Dems and Clintons <a href="http://www.advocate.com/crime/2014/11/23/watch-obama-friend-hrc-founder-terry-bean-arrested-sex-crimes-charges">http://www.advocate.com/crime/2014/11/23/watch-obama-friend-hrc-founder-terry-bean-arrested-sex-crimes-charges</a></p>
<p>By now they should be not only ready for more info, but asking you for more.  That\'s when you open up #pizzagate to them, starting with the NYPD seizing Weiner\'s laptop for sexting a minor, and how that opened up so much more.  This is also when you can tell them about the code and show them the Wikileaks emails.</p>
<p>Let me know if you guys have improvements/other ideas.  This is has worked for me a handful of times already with people who were dead set on not believing it.</p>',

            Simply talking about those people who haven't been red pilled and believe the MSM still and all their fake news.  The timid, the naive, the frightened.  There are many in that category, and they need to be shown the light.
