<p>&quot;I\'ve rubbed shoulders with some big names...I know a lot of you are doubting this, but this is the truth. There is a big sting operation going down. It\'s happening. I\'m telling you, man, these pedophile rings are getting taken down. Hollywood ain\'t cool anymore. Hollywood is going down. I still talk to my sources. I still talk to people that are involved and, listen, there is a big operation going down. They are getting taken out. Every day is confirmation to me. It\'s a secretive thing, but I think it\'s going to come out. They say it\'s gonna come on the media when it\'s all said and done and I think what\'s going to happen is going to shock a lot of you...I don\'t think you really understand how prevalent these pedophile rings really are in Hollywood and in the sports arenas and the political arena. It\'s bad. Once this all comes out to the surface a lot of you will be disgusted and feel very dirty for even knowing the information. I gotta tell you, a lot of you don\'t like Trump, but he\'s doing the right thing right now. This guy is spearheading the whole thing and it\'s an amazing thing to watch. They\'re going after the cartels with human trafficking. They\'re going after the child pedophilia rings. All these roads lead to Clinton Foundation and Haiti.&quot;</p>

            He also mentioned Tony Robbins, who works with "Operation Underground Railroad", a "rescue" organization "stopping human trafficking" run by "former" CIA. I suspect they're actually just robbing human traffickers to sell the kids' organs off. A multi-trillion dollar industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Robbins is Satan incarnate. He is literally a human embodiment of Satan. It's surreal to look at this guy talk.

           <p>
            But what you should know....is that people with bad thoughts/desires ARE built up~financed because they are bound by their bad deeds to death. From the controllers point of view they are both cheap/stupid and narcissistic fools.

            Well to bound the (power) of the predators bad actions isnt a new game. A fairly simple tool....if you have the stomach to use it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world is full of sickos...build and finance them to destroy and control your target from the inside.

            (THEY) means nothing, only puppets on a string...why waste bullits when useless filth can be bound for life by their own bad deeds.

            Ill believe it when I see it these people get more power everyday, and im suppose to believe they are being attacked? Pedo gates is plastered all over the media suggesting a vaccine and im suppose to believe this narrative? The only president who ever put their life on the line for my future is JFK the rest are all fake phoney pedo proteting illuminati bitches. How has trump avoided death if hes combating them? how have there not been several hundred attempts at his life? Sorry if it doesnt make sense its not true. If you wanna know whose fighting for you look at who people are trying to kill, look at who they are trying to silence etc, I know its real because I used myself as bait to attract a certain politician and it worked. However NOBODY is standing up to them when they are all one in the same. Now you trump stumpers can believe he is all day but I just dont see it. Everyone always says its going to happen soon then it never does, I hate pedophiles and the power they are allowed to wield they have used that power to commit extreme acts of injustice against me and im still alive.

            You wanna know who is fighting for you? look at jemmy who is dead, look at the panama paper leaker that is dead, If somebody is not trying to hurt, harm, kill you, or derail the quality of your life in a world run by those sick bastards it means your doing something wrong, if they are it means the opposite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im not lying it will be very hard to believe but I was stalked and harassed by MEN cia operatives wearing sundresses and black shades while harassing me. I questioned john podesta about madeline mccan on twitter and had a vehicle purposefully crash into me on the highway to try and kill me.
           </p>
           <p>
            If trump is taking these bastards down then how they hell are they still wielding all that power? JFK is the only president I respect and the only one who has ever done shit that has made my future brighter fuck the rest they are not doing have the shit their supporters think they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            However JFK was the truth.

            The only people capable of stopping these people is a militia formed of not soldiers and bootlicking government pawns, nazis, religious nutcases, or extremists, no it will take an army of normal ordinary everyday people making the decision to go to war against them to stop it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The things causing the problems cannot also be a solution to the problems the solution must come from that which is not a source of the problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            People being made to believe trump is out here saving them it to keep them sitting around "waiting for a savior" instead of becoming saviors themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody is fighting them, at least nobody you think.
           </p>
           <p>
            I chose the name clairvoyance for a reason I see beyond the bullshit and the misdirection trump is not doing a damn thing against those people but you keep telling yourself he is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Snowden literally just said the architecture of opression is being built, I guess he said that because "trump is shutting down the evil pedophiles", pfft wishful thinking  is one way to cope with a grim reality but lets not lie to ourselves.

              How has trump avoided death if hes combating them? how have there not been several hundred attempts at his life?

             There have been multiple assassination attempts on Trump. Three are listed on Wikipedia:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <ul>
              <li>
               June 2016: Michael Steven Sandford, a British national with a history of mental illness, tried to seize a police officer's pistol at a Trump rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, in an attempt to assassinate Trump (then the presumptive Republican nominee). Sandford had reportedly been planning such an action for over a year. The pistol caught in the holster and Sandford was immediately arrested, and eventually deported to the United Kingdom. The incident received less coverage in the United States than in Britain, where it led to a debate over the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and was the subject of a BBC documentary.[100]
              </li>
              <li>
               November 2017: A man affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was arrested by the Philippine National Police in Rizal Park for reportedly planning to assassinate President Trump during the ASEAN Summit.[101]
              </li>
              <li>
               October 2018: William Clyde Allen III, a U.S. Navy veteran, sent a letter containing crushed castor beans to President Trump. The letter did not reach the White House as it was seized by the Secret Service. He sent similar letters to Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson. Allen was arrested on October 3, 2018 in Utah.[102][103][104]
              </li>
             </ul>
            </blockquote>

             Five months ago Trump
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r3Qa2D-fnA&amp;t=5s">
              went to the hospital to see if he'd been poisoned after his food taster became ill
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             One of his secret service agents
             <a href="https://thewesternfront.com/2018/07/19/rip/">

            </p>
            <p>
             Those are just the incidents that have leaked out. The majority would be kept under wraps, I would think.

               Trump is more hated than past presidents and more people including celebrities are calling for his death. They didn't do that with Obama.

              JOHNNY DEPP
             </strong>
             just started an instagram account in an attempt to rehabilitate his image with the normies; look out for
             <strong>
              Spielberg
             </strong>
             to do the same, especially as his step daughter recently tried to out him.

             <strong>
              Instagram

             are what the stars are doing now to groom the non-red pillers into believing their shit doesn’t stink. Interesting that
             <strong>
              Geffen
             </strong>
             is the only A lister on there who’s set his account to ‘private’..can’t imagine how those comments would read! (Probably same as Killarys, LOL)

             Off topic question.. have you seen the new doc "Hellier"? Please watch it.. the witnesses talk about occult rituals happening in cave systems throughout KY and kids being trafficked through underground caverns.. please look past the goblin stuff and make sure to stick through the 2nd season.. theres something there but I dont have the knowledge base to make the connections..
