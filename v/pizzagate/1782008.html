<p>A company called the “Prescribing Psychologists’ Register” has been around for many years, selling continuing education courses to psychologists looking to learn how to prescribe psychiatric prescription medications for mental disorders. </p>
<p>Prescribing Psychologists’ Register isn’t an American Psychological Association (APA) approved sponsor of continuing education at this time. Therefore its continuing education courses aren’t recognized as being officially credentialed by the primary credentialing body of psychologists.</p>

            I need someone's help.  I am sure there will be a line.  I want to put a rope around this guy;s neck and need someone to pull the other end.  Really Tight!  WTH kind of program is this to help a child?  I ended up crying for any child that is in his care.  What can we do to get this guy looked at?  How about a letter writing campaign by any one on here that lives there.  If you live in VA you should contact your State Senator and Rep.  and demand that these types of Fake Degrees must be stopped ASAP.

                That heart and swirl thing was a subset of Chinese Christians that came in a group and upvoated everything they did as a group.  They more or less meant well but were trained by fundamentalist preachers and had very little understanding things Western culture takes for granted - ie you can wear a death metal shirt and not be a literal Satan worshipper because you had a pentagram on your Tshirt or on your Instagram.  And the shills gleefully joined in the upvoating of course to make the forum look bad.  They would literally carve up areas like the suburbs of Portland and go "hunting" for evidence of demons through symbols person by person, place by place.  At first they got people involved in their symbol hunts because sometimes the combination of a symbol and activities with children looked like a lead, but eventually their game ran dry as the regularly posting members took them to task again and again in frustration.  There has been little activity from them lately.  There might have been a connection with them and the person Yoichi Shiamatsu as well - a very aggressive "journalist" who is a Japanese living in Taiwan who I belive was active on the forum and traveled with a harem up upvoting female fans.  Periodically a post would appear that would be all about "How Much Yoichi Shiamatsu Has Done For The Pizzagate Investigation" that would get quickly upvoted - lots of manic links and symbolism in these posts connecting pig farms and people, etc.   There could have been some possible leads somewhere in all that but it was all so poorly executed it was lost in the squeaks and squeals at locating stars on barn doors and such.
               </p>
               <p>
                The problem is the moderation - they would leave the stupidest "symbol" posts up just because they'd be littered with links (instead of actual research - they idea was hey I found this no you go research it all).  Mods claimed they can't take anything down or exercise any minimal discernment because they are always accused of over moderating.
               </p>
               <p>
                tl:dr - Please do not continue on the wrong impression that the forum is populated by people that post the Swirls and Stars=Satan formula over and over.

            Some quotes from Mr. Federici:
           </p>
           <p>
            [The girl] needed a strong male role model. That’s why she was acting out so much. … You know why she liked me? The first time she wouldn’t come in. I dragged her in my office.

           </p>
           <p>
            I like those kind of kids who are non-compliant, that are non-responsive … avoidant, depressed, traumatized, psychotic, whatever they are. Those are my favorite kids. Because you know what? They do the best … sooner or later, they break. 
— “…Treating Multi-Impaired Attachment Disorders” (2004)
           </p>
           <p>
            It is to be hoped that, as the child calms down, he or she will be very insecure, crying, and in need of emotional support and nurturing. Keeping a child in a more infantile state after a hold will serve as a starting point for moving toward appropriate attachment to the parent.
— Help for the Hopeless Child (2003), p. 112
           </p>
           <p>
            Total Adults Only. Isolation from any type of activity, friend or other sibling. Early bedtime, no talking to others, no television, play or any type of recreational activity. No hiding out in their room which is often preferred. Must stay in immediate sight and close proximity of parents or responsible adult at all times. Hard labor activities occupying any and all free time. Awakening early to begin work. Writing assignments or boring, repetitive tasks. Absolutely no stimulation. If parents must leave to go places, child must accompany them but not engage in any discussion or distraction. Again, Total Adults supervision, isolation and continual hard work is [sic] of paramount importance …

           <p>
            More often than not, the child will resist. At this point, one parent … applies gentle but firm pressure on the shoulder in a small “pinch” manner. (Remember Mr. Spock’s famous Vulcan shoulder grip from Star Trek? Think of this.) … Next, you instruct the child to go to his or her knees and ultimately lie face down on the floor …

            As soon as you announce that a holding time is mandatory, a child will often say “I’m sorry, I won’t be bad again” or attempt to run away. To back down and allow the child another chance or to abbreviate the hold sets a precedent for continuing manipulation by your child to avoid a hold.

            S]he was cussing at me in Russian. I said, “Listen. You think that’s bad, hear this.” And I gave her a dose of her own medicine.

            Keep the child guessing. You owe no explanations.

            It is also important for parents to remove any type of stimulation from the child’s room for the duration of Adults Only. This includes books, television, games and toys. Strip things to the bone and start over with the child. Emphasize that “nothing in the world is free” and that everthing must be earned.

            T]ell him he’s going to stay longer and you’re never going to relinquish rights. You’re just going to keep him, declare him disabled and keep him home until he’s 50.

            I might bring [my children] to Iceland. They’re for show and tell. You know what they’ll tell those kids there? They’ll say, “Listen, let me tell you what my dad’s going to do if you don’t stop.” They’ll, they’ll scare them. 
— “…Treating Multi-Impaired Attachment Disorders” (2004)
           </p>
           <p>
            People say, “Well, aren’t your kids getting ready for college there?” I said no. They’re not going to leave home. Because why? They missed forty years of life. Why would I want to send them out when they’re not ready? That makes no sense. So knowing that they need some extra time and training. Get out the old Barney book and pictorial books and show them what things mean.

            Forget school. If they never read, who cares. As long as their language improves.
