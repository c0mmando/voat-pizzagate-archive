            I was wondering about the significance about that info, about the Russian adoptions. I thought she was saying Russia was going to end adopting out their orphans to Americans...perhaps because of what they found out with HRC/Podesta/CometPingPong?

             Because they aren't all Jewish. The Rothschild family didn't even claim Jew until they started hiding behind then.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Recorded in the spellings of de Rothschild, Rothchild, Rothschild and Rothchilt, this is a famous surname of Austro-German origins. It is said to have been habitational, and to originate from a house or houses which had a red shield as the doormarker, and this may well be so. Before the advent of street numbering it was the popular practice to designate a property by some form of display. In time the only properties that continued with the practise were inns and hotels. Most early recordings of the name are protestant, a few Catholic, and sometimes Jewish, and this multplicity of religions can cause confusion, but in fact has nothing to do with the origin. The famous banking family of Rothschild traces its origins back to a Meyer Rothschild, born in Frankfurt in 1743. As to what this family were called prior to this time is unclear, but it is almost certain that Rothschild was a name adopted by them. Prior to this date they would almost certainly have been refugees from the Turkish Empire or Middle Europe.

               Early examples of the surname recording taken from surviving German church registers of the period include: Simon Rothschild, who was christened at Bantrupe evangelical church, Lippe, on April 29th 1714, and Edmund Rothchild, christened at Burgsteirfurt katholic church, Westfalen, on July 14th 1813."

             <p>
              The historical and enchanting region of Austria is the birthplace of the distinguished family name Bauer. Austria, which was originally home to a Celtic people, was conquered by the Roman Empire in about 15 BC. Following the fall of Rome, Austria was repeatedly invaded by barbarian tribes, such as the Vandals, Visigoths, and Huns, who swept in from the east. During the 5th and 6th centuries, the Alemanni, Avars and Slavs settled Austria. The Avars were defeated in 785 by the Frankish emperor Charlemagne, who set up the East Mark, which later became known as the Österreich. Otto I defeated the Magyars in 955. Austria was ruled by the Babenburger dynasty until 1278, when they were succeeded by the Hapsburg dynasty, which ruled Austria until the 20th century.

              The surname Bauer was first found in Austria and Bavaria, where the name contributed greatly to the development of an emerging nation which would later play a large role in the tribal and national conflicts of the area. In later years the name branched into many houses, each playing a significant role in the local social and political affairs.

                The ancestors of the Bundy family migrated to England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. The surname Bundy is for a husbandman, or a farmer. The name stems from the Old English roots bonda and bunda, which were used to indicate such a person.

                The French name Dupont first arose during the Medieval period in the Languedoc region. It is derived from when the family lived in Languedoc.

                <p>
                 The saga of the name Kennedy begins with a Strathclyde-Briton family in the ancient Scottish/English Borderlands. It is a name for a dour or serious person. Further research revealed that the name is derived from the Gaelic nickname Cinneididh, which translates as grim-headed. It is doubtful that there is any ancient relationship between the Irish Kennedys and the Scottish Clan. The Irish Kennedy's history dates back to about 900 AD, and there did not appear to be any direct relationship between the two families. However, in the 16th century, a sept of the Scottish Kennedy Clan did develop in Ulster, but they are undoubtedly migrants from Scotland, and had no previous link to the southern Irish Kennedys.

                    I know you understand that the 3rd world war has been written and is on the works. That's why you're shilling...
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Albert Pike-
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>
                     The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the 'agentur' of the 'Illuminati' between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion. We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.

              You tried to disprove that theyre ALL Jews with ONE counterexample, and even that one you failed to prove, merely citing the existence of nonJews who also had the name.  EPIC FAIL AS USUAL KIKE SHILL.

                The logical fallacy would be attempting to disprove a TREND with ONE example, and its one a dog wouldnt make.  Heres a fact: every Fed chairman of the last 3 decades has been a JEW. Even every VICE-CHAIRMAN HAS BEEN A JEW.  But its more likely theyre all tools of the Rothschilds right LOL
