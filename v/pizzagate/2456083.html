<h1>Production Description</h1>
<p>&quot;A Child\'s Voice,&quot; is a supernatural revenge thriller about a homeless teen that hears the voice of a child who was sacrificed by a cult of satan worshipping, wealthy occultists.

            I saw the trailer! I have been waiting Pedo/Satanist Hollywood to produce a film dealing with pedo/satanism. Major studiod - no chance. Only independent studio would dare (no one has to date) This looks intriguing. Pretty much what PG is all about. Replace the actors with JA and Skippy and life imitates art.

            Have any of you ever heard of a horror movie called Starry Eyes?  It doesn't involve any children, but it is about an aspiring, young actress who has to sell her soul both figuratively and literally in order to achieve stardom in Hollyweird, culminating in her murdering her friends (which I've heard musicians who want to make it into the so-called 23 Million Club are required to do; that or a relative) in what can only be described as a possessed state.

            Upvoat and Thank you for posting this.  Although I watched the Trailer, I won't be able to see the movie.  I am too much affected by violence, especially when it is against Children.  I am already crying.  If anyone sees the film, please recount and critique it.  Thank you.  These guys sound like a God Send.

             I gave my friend to watch Martyrs - he could not get half way. I gave my other friend (female) Audition - she never forgave me. But I have to agree, if Hostel makes you weak in stomach this will be tough.....but here is what I will say 'If you feel terrified, imagine how those children feel?'

              I know.  I would be better off reading a complete story or history of it all than watching a movie.  Not good with the visual.  I know I would suffer horribly.  I even cry while reading books.  I can visualize almost anything.

               When I was six, I read Blue Beard - it's a fairytale but the arch villain is not your typical anthropomorphosed monster but is in fact a real entity, that made it eerily real and surrial at the same time. The scene where his bride enters the forbidden room and catches glimpse of the dead brides hanging on hooks became etched in my memory. It was a Hostel type scene. I knew then that these tales were based on real monsters that walk among us, that we see on television, occupying high posts of every 'venerable' institution. And these monsters in a strange way look more terryfing than Freddy Krueger. Look at the mug of JA or the Podesta brothers - do we actually need more evidence?! Kudos to the film producer. My girlfriend declined to watch it as all of my friends. They said they could not handle it since they all have kids. I am a bachelor (44, never been married, no kids) I guess it makes a diffeerence. I will throw in my two cents when it comes out.

                Wow.  You are right about the monsters that walk among us. When I think of what Paul Banocci (sp) said in an interview that I believe Johnny Gosch was in a dark closet hiding and in came Bush Sr. with a young boy who he proceeded to abuse.  Bush was wearing a woman's dress!  Imagine that Monstrous Sight.  And what he did to that young boy was Monstrous as well.  I will never get over that.  Imagine the Bushes.  Him in a woman's dress and she with her pickled baby in a jar.  Monsters Among Us.

              Thanks for sharing. Will watch and share.  Sadly makes things all the more real, though we know about it, when you see even just a glimpse of what they have to endure its harrowing.  I cried through the little girl in Lithuania being wrenched away from her aunt and 'taken into custody' by the authorities.  :'(
