             really??? Is it online now? Need to watch it! Did they say anything about a grave robbery? Because I remember something like that from a guided tour I did there a decade ago but I can't find anything on the internet. I think it was a king's body that got stolen or something?!

               Thanks. And this article is just a summery from one of the documentaries I shared in this post. They are really very interesting but you won't find more on it. To be exact I found 4 documentaries about this subject. I have been working for media. A subject like this has everything "a good story" needs. It's really striking that we don't get more articles and reports on that.

            I recall watching a documentary on youtube about the dancing boys in Afghanistan.  That might even be the name of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, one procurer of young boys operated a kite stand because he knew that it would attract his prey.  He would get to look them all over before making a selection, who would then be taken and forced to dance for Muslim men.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is funny how shocking all of this was to the invading US troops.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, just replace kite flying with ping pong.

             disgusting. They like to do exhibitions there. Most awkward is to do it in this room. Because this is where the Nazis gathered to actually sacrifice people. I've been to this room. The acustic is horrific. You can't speak there because every sound crawls the walls endlessly it seams. Everything echos for a real long time. When you make a guided tour, before you enter this room they will ask you to hush because otherwise you will be terrorized by sound.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today I think this room would be perfect for MK ultra and who knows?! Maybe that was what the Nazis really did back then?! You have to know that there was a labor camp at Wewelsburg. They had a lot of slaves …

             Not discounting any possibilities... but those concrete ping pong tables are pretty common in Germany. Kinda like how city parks in the USA have basketball courts. Parks and other public places in Germany have ping pong tables with the net made out of a piece of metal. Ping pong is a popular sport and drinking game.

              Right. Ok. That does make sense. I am kind of surprised Ping Pong existed in the 30's, plastic balls and all... but it's NOT surprising that it's very popular in Germany and in fact only lends credence to Dr. Pong being the inspiration for Jimmy's American version because he saw how the game attracted all the young boys:
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Pinging Doktor Pong
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The Obama-Alefantis connection has deeper roots, as shown by the availability of a ham-and-pineapple pizza in East Berlin. Our passage to Hawaii starts below the Berlin Wall, or what’s left of it, into the Death Strip on the edge of uber-hip Green Party stronghold Prenzlauerberg. This section of the infamous wall was preserved as a stretch of open space to memorialize East Germans who attempted escape but were gunned by the GDR border guards.
             </p>
             <p>
              Post-Cold War, the Death Strip is a graffiti-sprayed playground for teens, with its Sunday afternoon Bearpit amateur karaoke show in the amphitheater and outdoor basketball courts (take note, Barry, and be sure to tuck a hankie in your back pocket). Adjoining the Turkish ghetto of Kreutzberg, the Death Strip is a gay-cruising zone for those hankering after Arab, Kurdish, Kosovar, Bosnian or Albanian hot meat on a stick, a spicy kofta kebab slathered with tahini sauce.
             </p>
             <p>
              In year 2000, James Alefantis and partner Oliver Miller discovered Prenzlauerberg, where Miller opened Dr. Pong, a ping pong bar. San Francisco architect Miller had arrived to Berlin earlier, in 1993, when he noticed that ping pong is the only low-cost sport for plebeian youths in every sad town from Muncheberg to Kosovska and Bucak, Turkey. Playing ping pong is an easy way to strike up a conversation with penniless and hungry young kids eager to please an older male who takes them under his wing. In the sexually segregated Muslim realm, sex between an older man and a young boy is taken casually as a misdemeanor that goes unnoticed as opposed to the felony of adultery by a woman, which is punished by the death penalty. The bored boys from nearby Kreuzberg are easy pickings drawn to the bait of ping pong and beer.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just up the street from the Mauerpark market, the ping pong tables at Dr. Pong provided the model for Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington D.C. The Berlin pedo-center is described in a reddit post: “Dr. Pong is a rugged little dingy bar in the heart of Prenzlauerberg, reminiscent of a teenage clubhouse with its minimal decor.” Note “teenage”. Its limited beverage menu is mostly non-alcoholic for entry-level rough-trade Muslim boys circling around the game tables for the next volley in the group game of “Around the World”, a dress rehearsal for a daisy chain.
             </p>
             <p>
              While the Doctor doesn’t do beer deliveries to embassy residences, there’s probably a lot of demand from diplomats for take-out meat sticks, judging from the great reviews on Trip Adviser’s English-language list of the top 10 bars in Berlin. The Top Ten list fails to include the plusher interior of the fetishist KitKat Club. Another telling indicator is that 666 bar-hopping tours stop at Dr. Pong, indicating a connection to the Satanic rites similar to those in DC. What’s intriguing about Dr. Pong is that its male-on-male games may have provided the concept for torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Graibh prison.
             </p>
             <p>
              During the last years of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) or East Germany, Prenzlauerberg was the favored residential district for gays, hippies and avant-garde artists, a tradition that continued after national reunification in October 1990. Prenzlauerberg is also the location of Rykestrasse Synagogue, the largest Jewish center in Berlin, which was restored at great expense after reunification while Berlin was being restored to its former glory as a Jewish capital with coprophilia clubs and fetish bars to degrade the goyem.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oliver Miller’s arrival in 1993 coincided with the massive expansion of human trafficking of children for the European pedophile sex trade out of the war-torn Balkans in the wake of the Clinton-Blair NATO interventions to break apart Yugoslavia. Berlin was a transit point for children transshipped between Belgrade and the UK by the Kosovar mafia and Western military contractors including DynCorp. London is the wholesale global market for child sex slaves through fraudulent NGOs that act as adoption agencies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sadly for Alefantis and Miller, the pair arrived a few years too late to join SchwuP, the Movement for Gay, Pederast and Transsexual Rights, which until 1987 was a wing of the Green Party, itself a product of the sexual liberation and drug experimentation theories of the CIA-allied Frankfurt School. Even after being busted for possession of methamphetamines, SchwuP leader Volker Berg survives as a parliamentarian in the Bundestag as the crusty old chief of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group. Go chew on that, vice cops and DEA agents.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1986, Volker’s “Schwuppies” distributed this Green Party flyer to parliamentarians: “He is a boy, roughly 10 years old, with a pretty face, full lips, a straight nose and shoulder-length hair. The wings of an angel protrude from his narrow back, and a penis is drawn with thin lines on the front of his body.” In any country other than defeatist Germany beholden to the Israeli pedophiles, this sort of drivel is called illegal pornographic trash and justification for SWAT shoot-to-kill raids.
             </p>
             <p>
              The politically ambitious Greens eventually had to repudiate their support for sex with kindergarteners by their founders including Danny “the Red” Cohen-Bendit, the CIA-promoted leader of the 1968 student riots in Paris. The pedophile campaign was carried forward until 2008 by Volker Berg’s partner Jacques Teyssier, a former member of the French intelligence service, who was on board of the Lesben und Schwulenverband in Deutschland (LSVD), the lesbian and gay association in Germany. The German gay movement is obviously a brainwashed arm of the CIA.
             </p>
             <p>
              The darker side of the pedophilic underground has since been carried on by a provocative novelist with the pen name Klaus Wanninger, the Anonymous of the Karlsruhe-based Schwaben-sumpf (the Schwabian Swamp). Sadistic and Satanic imagery was developed in parallel by this deviant strain, which obviously has had a huge influence on the artists and customers at Comet Ping Pong Pizza.
             </p>
             <p>
              In early 2012, Alefantis and Miller teamed up to start a restaurant called Nalu or “wave” in Hawaiian. The partnership in the Berlin restaurant inspired Alefantis to sponsor a “sausage festival” at his Buck’s Fishing and Camping restaurant in Washington DC to honor a visit by Oliver Miller. There is no indication that Nalu or Dr. Pong has ever celebrated Octoberfest in Berlin by adding traditional bockwurst mit sauerkraut und senf (mustard) to their menus. - See more at:

            Oh my, this was hard to read.  So very painful for the victims.  So very painful to hear what they were made to do.  So the point is that they believe it is still occurring at this time? Is Mango still alive? I would love to see him hanged for the heinous things he did to those children.

             I wouldn't like to watch anyone hanged but, yeah he really trains my altruism muscle! The fact that someone got cut out of that sentence is even more interesting. This documentary ends with a criminal report at a police station. I haven't found anything about this case. But it seams like the predator got saved. They had to take out his name. I hate "justice".

            This description of SRA by the Nazis is chilling. Take time to read. The gathering area had black drapes as in Comet Ping Pong, maybe. After the infant was killed and the heart removed and eaten by members there would be alot of blood to be cleaned up like the reference to Jimmy Comets kill room which would be easy to hose down, maybe. The head of this particular cult was named "Mango" , recall Hillary's mangos, and one of the artifacts was an upside down cross like the one Chelsea wears around her neck, maybe?
