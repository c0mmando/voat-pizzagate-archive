<p>&quot;The Washington Pundit......You need to check into Two Boots Pizza and it\'s connection to Standard Hotel in both the NY and LA location. Also, a child sex slave ring was busted a few days ago in West Hollywood that is connected. This will lead you to Max\'s Kansas City project and then to DynCorp. </p>
<p>And apparently electrocution for torture is a favorite at the Standard Hotel because I found a short article that reported an electrocution of someone on the 18th floor at NY location 3/8/17.﻿&quot;</p>
<p>Googling Two Boots Pizza this is the deception of the NYC location.</p>
<p>&quot;Offbeat chain serving cornmeal-crusted pizzas with quirky Cajun toppings in a kid-friendly space.&quot;</p>
<p>It\'s only a a few minutes away from The Standard Hotel New York\'s location.</p>

<p>In the comet they mention a child sex trafficking ring that was busted with ties to &quot;Max\'s Kansas City Project&quot; This is the description of it.</p>
<p>&quot;The Max’s Kansas Project embraces the philosophy of Mickey Ruskin, the creator of Max’s Kansas City, and was established in his memory in 2001. The foundation for the Max’s Kansas Project was laid when Mickey Ruskin opened the doors to the legendary restaurant/bar/club in New York City on December 6, 1965. He was a true patron of the arts who provided a refuge, a home-away-from-home for everybody who was anybody in the arts, many of whom are now famous. Since Max’s was known to cross boundaries of generations, to connect the old with the new and embrace the youth of the future as well as established artists, the Max’s Kansas City Project has expanded its scope to include an interactive online cyber cafe for teens and adolescents, dropin2maxs.com.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://maxskansascity.org/">http://maxskansascity.org/</a></p>
<p>Connecting the old with the youth? Funding projects for teenagers and adolescents. This project works on funding artists and creating youth programs to work close with teenagers and children. It\'s funding multiple projects. The top picture in the art shows a woman covering one of her eyes with a paper fan and making the all seeing eye. Max\'s Kansas City Project was hosted elite parties.</p>
<p>&quot;At Max’s, the regulars would include names like Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, William Burroughs, Larry Rivers, Tennessee Williams, David Bowie, Philip Glass, Halston, Iggy Pop, John Waters, Salvador Dali, Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe, Robert Rauschenberg, Faye Dunaway, Lauren Hutton, Betsey Johnson, Twiggy, Verushka, Nico from the Velvet Underground, Edie, Viva, Ultra Violet (Warhol Superstars) and the list goes on. Aerosmith, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Bruce Springteen, Tom Waits, Sid Vicious, the B-52s and Gram Parsons all played Max’s and Debbie Harry and Emmylou Harris were waitresses there. As Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler said, “You knew even the assholes would be famous one day. It was that kind of place.”
Now years later after the iconic establishment closed its door’s Max’s Foundation headed by Yvonne Sewall (Ruskin), is constantly helping artists who have hit on hard times. Whether it’s Hurricane Sandy, medical emergencies or just economic difficulties, Yvonne and her foundation have become a life line for artists who have nowhere else to turn.&quot;</p>

            That list of celebrities is remarkably close to the list of "occult intelligence" assets I've been gathering since the beginning of all this. Wow.

             In 2003, the Oprah Winfrey Show featured Charles Best in a segment on Innovative Teachers, which aired on June 20.[10] Traffic generated from the show crashed the site, but viewers donated $250,000 to classroom projects. The sustained exposure from the Oprah Winfrey Show allowed DonorsChoose.org to expand from the New York City region to key metropolitan areas across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             DonorsChoose.org enables teachers to request materials and resources for their classrooms and makes these project requests available to individual donors through its website. Donors can give $1 or more to projects that interest them, which are searchable by school name, teacher name, location, school subject, material, and keywords. DonorsChoose.org then purchases necessary supplies and ships them directly to the schools. Every project contains a line-item budget and a description of the project. All donors receive photographs of the project taking place in the classroom and a letter from the teacher. Donors who contribute $50 or more to a project also receive hand-written thank-you notes from students.[15] Stephen Colbert has promoted DonorsChoose and has a position on the board.[16]

             Winfrey and Colbert?  This needs looking into.  He is on their board.
            </p>

             It was mentioned in an interview with Craig Newmark on the October 18, 2007, episode of the Colbert Report,[21] and again on March 19, 2008, September 27, 2011,[22] and December 13, 2012, as a recipient of host Stephen Colbert's Super PAC Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow.[23]

            <p>
             Google's partnership with the organization led to criticism from the UK tech publication The Register in 2016. According to the publication, the partnership created incentives in the DonorsChoose platform to favor expensive items over basic goods. It was claimed that this helped Google simultaneously have good publicity, sell their own product (Chromebook) and have tax benefits from charity activities.[28]
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortune magazine named Best to its "40 under 40 hottest rising stars in business" for three consecutive years. In November 2013, he received the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award, an honor for young Americans who are changing their communities and country through their commitment to public service. (Past recipients include Wendy Kopp and Cory Booker.)[4] In 2014, Best received the S. Roger Horchow for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen as part of the Jefferson Awards.
