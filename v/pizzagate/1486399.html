HE WAS APPARENTLY OBSESSED WITH &quot;FREEMASONRY AND ENOCHIAN&quot; topics and knew another island member who was involved in a murder previously. It sounds like he was paranoid about something on the island.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cramer always had a backpack with him which held his laptop. Cramer was fascinated with Freemasonry and Enochian (an esoteric 16th century language) and had written a book in Enochian which he hoped to have published someday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Schultes said he accepted the statement that Cramer did not take an unusually large dose of crystal meth on the day of the offence.
As such, Schultes said, the evidence was not there to prove it was the meth consumed that day which created the mental state that led to Cramer attacking the Schwartz family.
“On the evidence, the meth did not create the mental state [on the day of the offenses).”
The Justice said he also took note of Cramer’s comments to the psychiatrists, <em>describing years of physical abuse as a child</em>.
Schultes said at one point in the interviews, Cramer said that in committing the offenses he became, “that my life said I was to be.”
More info about debate over his psychiatric history, he appears to have had a life of problems with child abuse and was obsessed with saving his children

<p>Schwartz was the girlfriend of McCoy at the time he was murdered:

Outside court, Elaine Schwartz, McCoy’s girlfriend at the time of his death, was in disbelief. “The judge said it was a brutal attack,” she said. “[Corrigan] will be on our streets in 18 months.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spanning from Anon’s testimony and its ties to Harbin Hot Springs, we have uncovered a network of ritual abuse, child trafficking and evidence of Project MKULTRA taking place at institutions ranging from Harbin Hot Springs and Esalen Institute in CA through Ecstatic living, HAI Global and the Human Potential Movement through to The Haven in Canada, Findhorn in Scotland and more. These organizations are tied via the International Holistic Centers Gathering to the United Nations via the Findhorn Foundation, GEN, and Kitezh orphanage and Ecologia Youth Trust. They also share mutual ties and ancestry through the Psychosynthesis Institute, Teens &amp; Toddlers and ARK (a part of the Clinton Foundation) with Tavistock, the Huxleys and Military Intelligence in Britain and the US. Psychosynthesis’ founder then ties back through Alice Bailey to Lucis Trust and finally returns to the occult foundations of the UN.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t just stop at the clinic controversy – get your teeth into the new Madrona mall addition, the gun club, the water table, density, affordable housing. <em>Is the Gabriola Commons a cult? What really goes on at The Haven? Is the Roxy a front for something?</em> I can’t think a front for what off hand, but I’m guessing someone can!
Is it true that <em>all Gabriola children are drug addicts by the time they leave grade two? Is there a conspiracy between all the tradespeople to make sure that no one ever turns up when they’re supposed to?</em> Is there a danger that <em>ownership of the Fire Department will be handed over to some Foundation that will only put out your fire if you’re a member?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember me?  I first met my dear friend Greta when she was the invisible girlfriend of my son.
Well! … remember, I was going on those  car dates with my sleuth boyfriend, where <em>we waited for the people he was watching to come along on their way to or from their houses?</em>
Gabby, <em>he’s disappeared</em>! I’ve looked all over the island for him, but he’s just not here anymore. He isn’t even invisible – he’s just gone.
So Greta tells me he wasn’t any good from the beginning – that he was far too snoopy about people and she didn’t appreciate all those rude questions he used to ask about her.
He even doubted her existence, Gabby!
And anyway there’s been this retired fellah who has been hanging around and joins me on my walks around the neighbourhood, and he seems really nice and stuff.
He is polite and well-mannered and doesn’t think I’m strange because of Greta, and he also has a car and we have been on a couple of real dates, not just sitting in a car watching for drug dealers or whatever the other guy was into – he never told me, you know, in all this time, what he was watching for.
AND he thought he was better than me. I found out he was just tolerating me, not really respecting me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been here for a long time, Gabby. Since long before you came along. So I’ve seen a lot of changes around here. I’m an oldtimer now. I’ve had this little place back in the woods for a long time and I’m glad I bought the land when I did, when land was a lot cheaper than now.
Thing is, though, it’s the new neighbours.
See, they have this huge house they built and beside it they put up a big shack three stories tall where the guy built a boat.
I can’t believe it, Gabby! I went and looked things over one time last week when they were away, and I found out that the damned fool built the boat, cemented into the floor, inside the building!
What kind of an eejit does that, do you think? He’s going to have to chip out the hull and take out a whole wall to get his boat out, and he’s even insulated the place!
I tell you, they make one every day, don’t they?</p>

<p>Sounds like some kind of fucked up hidden chamber</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s quite a problem, I agree, on this isle of enclaves. If you have been used to pulling all the usual levers of power and influencing decisions by getting to know the right people, you’ll have a hard time finding them here. The right people are often not the influential people, and some of the influential people are just not – well – socially “right”, however you want to understand that word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like the local government is WEIRD</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s taking a real chance to write to you, Gabby, because I’m hiding out here and have been for several years now.
People think I’m dead. They think I died in a car crash.
Well I didn’t. Somebody else did. So now I’m FREE. Free to be my own unimportant, unfamous, unknown self. I had plastic surgery so I  look a little bit good looking, but undistinguished and undistinguisable, you know?

           Outside court, Elaine Schwartz, McCoy’s girlfriend at the time of his death, was in disbelief. “The judge said it was a brutal attack,” she said. “[Corrigan] will be on our streets in 18 months.”

           <p>
            Spanning from Anon’s testimony and its ties to Harbin Hot Springs, we have uncovered a network of ritual abuse, child trafficking and evidence of Project MKULTRA taking place at institutions ranging from Harbin Hot Springs and Esalen Institute in CA through Ecstatic living, HAI Global and the Human Potential Movement through to The Haven in Canada, Findhorn in Scotland and more. These organizations are tied via the International Holistic Centers Gathering to the United Nations via the Findhorn Foundation, GEN, and Kitezh orphanage and Ecologia Youth Trust. They also share mutual ties and ancestry through the Psychosynthesis Institute, Teens &amp; Toddlers and ARK (a part of the Clinton Foundation) with Tavistock, the Huxleys and Military Intelligence in Britain and the US. Psychosynthesis’ founder then ties back through Alice Bailey to Lucis Trust and finally returns to the occult foundations of the UN.

           <p>
            Remember me?  I first met my dear friend Greta when she was the invisible girlfriend of my son.
Well! … remember, I was going on those  car dates with my sleuth boyfriend, where
            <em>
             we waited for the people he was watching to come along on their way to or from their houses?
            </em>
            Gabby,
            <em>
             he’s disappeared
            </em>
            ! I’ve looked all over the island for him, but he’s just not here anymore. He isn’t even invisible – he’s just gone.
So Greta tells me he wasn’t any good from the beginning – that he was far too snoopy about people and she didn’t appreciate all those rude questions he used to ask about her.
He even doubted her existence, Gabby!
And anyway there’s been this retired fellah who has been hanging around and joins me on my walks around the neighbourhood, and he seems really nice and stuff.
He is polite and well-mannered and doesn’t think I’m strange because of Greta, and he also has a car and we have been on a couple of real dates, not just sitting in a car watching for drug dealers or whatever the other guy was into – he never told me, you know, in all this time, what he was watching for.
AND he thought he was better than me. I found out he was just tolerating me, not really respecting me.

            I’ve been here for a long time, Gabby. Since long before you came along. So I’ve seen a lot of changes around here. I’m an oldtimer now. I’ve had this little place back in the woods for a long time and I’m glad I bought the land when I did, when land was a lot cheaper than now.
Thing is, though, it’s the new neighbours.
See, they have this huge house they built and beside it they put up a big shack three stories tall where the guy built a boat.
I can’t believe it, Gabby! I went and looked things over one time last week when they were away, and I found out that the damned fool built the boat, cemented into the floor, inside the building!
What kind of an eejit does that, do you think? He’s going to have to chip out the hull and take out a whole wall to get his boat out, and he’s even insulated the place!
I tell you, they make one every day, don’t they?

Well I didn’t. Somebody else did. So now I’m FREE. Free to be my own unimportant, unfamous, unknown self. I had plastic surgery so I  look a little bit good looking, but undistinguished and undistinguisable, you know?

Mention of mass murder, cults
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A minor epiphany, arriving in Vancouver back in the late ‘70s, as the changes were starting to occur. Barely registering in the mainstream. A total contrast to what had gone before. The vacancy haze you tend to associate with the Woodstock era.
And the nasty side as well, the
             <em>
              bad craziness of cults and mass murder that I didn’t really get a sense of until near the end on Gabe
             </em>
             . An unfortunate trajectory. Staying at D’s place for what must have seemed like several lifetimes. Coping with the insanity. Distorted perspectives taking their toll.
The scotch broom pogrom was in full swing. Drove down to the ferry to drop somebody off and there was a hardy volunteer by the side of the road counting up the plants he’d managed to cull, like a bounty hunter. An instance of false memory syndrome, perhaps, which was enjoying a fashionable vogue earlier on.

            <p>
             As previously reported, a parent recently came forward, on condition of anonymity, to report that adults in the community are luring minors into using methamphetamine, aka “crystal meth”, or “meth”. The parent also said much of this is occurring at mixed-age parties in which adults are partying with teens.
In a follow-up Nov. 18 interview Caldwell said in order to act on any information about drugs in the community he would either need someone to bring the drugs to him and say where they came from, “or give specific details about the transactions going on, the amounts, the money changing hands, (and) the methods of how they do it”.

             BC Canada has been a hotbed of the pedophile racket for decades due to its vast uninhabited territories and many small and sometimes private islands. We are talking about a place where you could lose a 737 forever. 
I was there during the 90's investigating pedo rings. At some point, a Judge, a lawyer or 2 and a few cops were busted but never charged. Dozens of teachers have been charged but had just been transfered around. Female teachers often get charges dismissed. There was one if I recall had committed multiple sexual acts on a boy about 6 years old. Her charges were dismissed and she has no criminal record let alone being on a sex offender registry. They didn't even have a sex offender registry until after 2k and the one they have is a joke. You have to already know they are a convicted pedophile to gain access to the registry to find out if they are a sex offender. If that even helps to gain access or just enables you to go to the police and say hey, this molester is living at the school fence.. But when half the teachers and child services and protection is deeply involved, what can you do.
            </p>
            <p>
             BAN FEMINISM!! 99% of them are pedophiles and all in education and family services, they are there to destroy families to gain better access to children!
