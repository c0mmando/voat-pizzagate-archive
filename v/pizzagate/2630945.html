<h3>George Carey, the former archbishop of Canterbury who was heavily criticised in an independent report for his part in the cover-up of sexual abuse carried out by a bishop, has been allowed to resume an official role in the Church of England.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Carey stepped down last year as an honorary assistant bishop at the unprecedented request of Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, after a damning report which found the church had colluded over the abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>But it emerged this week that Carey has been granted “permission to officiate” (PTO) by Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, allowing him to preach and preside at churches in the diocese. Croft is reportedly under police investigation for allegedly failing to respond properly to a separate report of clerical sexual abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The decision to grant the PTO was made in February despite expectations of further revelations this month about Carey’s role in the case of Peter Ball, a former bishop of Gloucester, at the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA).</strong></p>
<p>The inquiry will spend a week scrutinising the C of E’s handling of the Ball case, starting on 23 July. Ball was jailed in 2015 for the grooming, sexual exploitation and abuse of 18 vulnerable young men between 1977 and 1992. Prince Charles has been asked to give a witness statement to the inquiry about his correspondence with Ball.</p>
<p><em>(LOL, does anyone expect that Prince Charles - buddy of notorious pedophile Jimmy Savile - will testify against Ball, possibly incriminating himself? Hardly so.)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carey, who was archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, resigned his honorary post after the publication of an independent report on the Ball case by Dame Moira Gibb.</p>
<p>She concluded that senior figures in the church had “colluded [with the abuser] rather than seeking to help those he had harmed”. She said: “The church appears to have been most interested in protecting itself.”</p>
<p><strong>Carey had “set the tone for the church’s response to Ball’s crimes, and gave the steer which allowed Ball’s assertions that he was innocent to gain credence”, said Gibb</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February this year, Carey contacted the diocese of Oxford to request a PTO, which was granted by Croft. </p>
<p>(Of course it was - <em>birds of a feather</em>...)</p>
<p>It is understood that Carey underwent fresh checks on his criminal record and C of E safeguarding training.</p>
<p>The church’s national safeguarding team was not consulted on whether the PTO should be granted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A survivor of abuse by Ball said he was extremely concerned to learn that Carey had been granted a PTO. “It’s a real stab in the back for Ball survivors,”</strong> he said, adding that it would have been prudent to wait until further evidence had been heard by IICSA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Croft is one of several senior church figures, including John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, who are reportedly being investigated by South Yorkshire police over alleged failures to act on disclosures of an alleged rape of a teenage boy by a clergyman in the 1980s.</strong> The force declined to confirm or deny an investigation was under way.</p>
<p>Matthew Ineson claims he was raped by the Rev Trevor Devamanikkam, and in 2012 and 2013 reported the crime to senior figures in the church, including Croft. He alleges they failed to follow proper procedures and did not advise him to tell police.</p>
<p>(Devamanikkam was later charged with indecent assault and buggery without consent, but killed himself in 2017 before coming to trial.)</p>
<p>“Given the circumstances it is incredible that Croft is still in a position to decide whether PTO should be given to George Carey or anybody else who has been so involved in the dreadful case of Peter Ball or any other safeguarding case.”</p>
<p>PTOs are mostly granted to retired priests who wish to continue their ministry by preaching, taking communion and providing holiday or sickness cover to serving clergy. PTOs are granted at the discretion of the local bishop.</p>',

             </strong>
             suggested that the Ripper murders were part of a conspiracy between Freemasons and the British Royal Family, a claim which is not accepted by historians.[4] Nevertheless, the book became a bestseller, and was the inspiration for several works of fiction, among them the film Murder by Decree (1978) by Bob Clark and the graphic novel From Hell by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Brotherhood (1984) was published at a time when Freemasonry was coming under increasing scrutiny in the United Kingdom. Knight's last book before his death was The Killing of Justice Godfrey, exploring the death of Edmund Berry Godfrey in 1678, which had caused widespread anti-Catholic sentiment in England.

              New Lead: Mountain of Evidence linking DC's Luzzatto family to secret Kabbalah cult and Venetian Black Nobility
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Connected to both James Alefantis and the Rockefellers, there's no question that the Luzzatto family represent a powerful element of the DC pedophile ring.
             </strong>
             I have recently uncovered evidence that the Luzzatto family are both linked to occult kabbalah worship and the Black Nobility, a globalist faction based in Northern Italy and Switzerland. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was a messianic cult leader accused of promoting black magic through a secret cult during the 18th century, and his descendants have included freemasons, Club of Rome members, zionist bankers, international art collectors and of course, Rockefeller foot soldiers like Tamera Luzzatto.
            </p>
            <p>
             This pattern is in line with Tony Podesta's ownership of the "art blu" restaurant in Venice and his mysterious residence in Lausanne, Switzerland, a location I have confirmed is directly tied to actual Illuminati members.

              <p>
               Pastor Rick Warren on Saturday will reveal what he calls "Saddleback's Christmas gift to Southern California." That gift, according to Warren, is called the PEACE Center, a building at the church's main Lake Forest campus that will be open to anyone in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               The focus of Rick Warren's ministry has shifted from from faith in God's Word to service to the world, and it is based in Christian Socialism.

               The letter "c" in the logo for the peace plan is 
similar to the rising of a new world order on the horizon.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The oak tree was regarded by Socrates as an oracle tree. An oracle is one involved in divination, or someone that uses witchcraft to predict the future. The Druids, likewise, ate acorns in preparation for prophesying. In addition, the Druids believed the leaves of the oak tree had the power to heal and renew strength.[1] Through the symbol of the oak, the Druids worshiped the Supreme Deity. According to The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly Hall, the secret teachings of the Druids are practically the same mysteries concealed under the allegories of Blue Lodge Masonry. [pg. 39]

                Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin holds the title of Grand Chancellor with the Vatican’s Jesuitical, “Knights of Malta.” This secret society openly displays the Vatican’s ecumenical intentions as part of the Jesuit's Counter Reformation.

               Boykin's website admits to being part of

                Billy Graham's Lausanne Movement.[3] This movement, whose goals are similar to that of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals [4], has expanded worldwide. Lausanne also has its hands on the National Day of Prayer.

               Ironically, Rick Warren also has connections to the Lausanne Movement and the United Nations Council on Foreign Relations. In June 2010, Saddleback Church hosted the Lausanne Global Conversation panel at their church [5]. Additionally, Warren was on the advisory board for the 2010 Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization to be held in October in South Africa

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Council on Foreign Relations member and mega-church pastor Rick Warren has a habit of compromising biblical truth to forge unholy alliances with sworn enemies of the Gospel. Warren has stepped onto the slippery slope and landed exactly in the "interfaith" camp, rather than being faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ and His inerrant Word. His endorsement of the former British Prime Minister's "Tony Blair Faith Foundation" is only part of his "interfaith" sell-out.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, when Rick Warren gave President Barack Obama's inaugural invocation in January 2009, his inclusive ecumenical idolatry was loud and clear.
