            So why would Richard Branson (NXIVM connection), BlackRock and William + Kate team up?
           </p>
           <p>
            We should look at the BlackRock shareholders. BlackRock has become more powerful than many banks, but somehow has been staying under our radar.

            IIRC, the Bronfmans have been holding shares in BlackRock.

             I just found that Blackstone backs GEMS Education and they are a SA Org.  They are teaching Multicultural Education.  We know that NXIVM was responsible for Rainbow Cultural Garden which also was all about Multicultural Teachings.  Idk, if that is the answer but we know they all seem to be one on this concept.

              In 1981, friends lamented that there were rare occasions to learn from their fascinating work and everyday-life acquaintances in a personal, substantive way. Consequently, 60 families shared Phil &amp; Linda Lader's four-day New Year's "house party" on Hilton Head Island.

                I can't believe all those people.......  Just shocking actually.  And there it is right on the internet.  I am thinking what else there is out there.  I am sure they did not gather together to improve Our Existence.

                     Years ago this author’s newsletters exposed Hilton Head Island, SC as a watering hole of the
powerful elite incl. retired generals and admirals, and the site for the elite’s Renaissance Weekend
"meat market"
                    </strong>
                    . Remember, that at one time Hilton Head Island was private, with imported alligators
in the water around it. A person was only allowed on the island by going through security gates with a
clearance. In a later newsletter, Disney’s Hilton Head Island Resort was mentioned. This resort, built
by Disney Vacation Development, Inc., is located on a 15-acre private island linked to Hilton Head
island by a narrow bridge. Members to the Disney Vacation Club can exchange time for vacations at
Disney and other resorts around the world. Memberships cost minimum $9,412.

                    Wow.  Is this like their own Epstein Island in SC?  This is amazing.  Meat Market.  Imported Alligators?  What?  This surely sounds like A Playground of the Rich Famous &amp; Evil.  If this involves  Disney, Ugh.

                      I can't believe people do not notice that during public appearances.  It surely is possible.  I wonder how evil that place is.  A den of iniquity.   If there is not evil there, these people would not be going.  Bill the Science Guy  George Takai     David Gergen (CNN)

                      Gergen joined the Nixon White House in 1971, as a staff assistant on the speech-writing team, becoming director of speechwriting two years later.[5] He served as director of communications for both Ford and Reagan, and as a senior adviser to Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.[6] He graduated with honors from Yale and Harvard Law School, and has been awarded 25 honorary degrees.    These people are all here for a reason.  They are connected to  Bill and Hillary Clinton in some way or their Foundations.

                        Of course, diminutive sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer was there to get her message out as well. She said her session on relationships – for 13- to 16-year-old set – was a big hit. "The kids know they can ask me about sex," she told the paper.

                        Well the people that are pictured, surely qualify as Satanists.  I think I have heard stories about Charleston/SC.  Always thought they where kind of ghosty, but now not so much.

               I just had a thought... about the contaminated water in Cape Fear we were posting about yesterday.  I believe that area is very close to Racine.  If this is deliberate maybe it has something to do with the Sustainability Agenda.  My brain is fried now. Time to take a break.

                Sustainability is the Key.  The hoarding of the water.  As we speak Bill Cinton is organizing Major Cos. to meet in Fla.  and head to Puerto Rico all in the name of setting up another Cc of  Haiti and in the name of Sustainability.

              Sir Martin Sorrell’s iron grip as chief executive of WPP is under threat after the advertising group hired a law firm to investigate an allegation of personal misconduct.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the last five years alone Sorrell has been paid well over £200m for running the world’s largest advertising group thanks to lucrative and highly controversial reward schemes. His £70m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history.
             </p>
             <p>
              The trouble at the top has once again put a spotlight on the issue of succession at WPP amid accusations of a “Sorrellcentricity” – the view that Sorrell runs the giant business autocratically as a personal fiefdom, dominating decision-making.

              MONEY BAGS Who is Martin Sorrell, what’s his net worth and why has he stepped down as WPP boss?
             </p>
             <p>
              He was educated at the prestigious Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and studied at Christ's College, Cambridge before completing an MBA at Harvard.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the 1970s he was appointed group finance director for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, where he was often referred to as "the third brother" for his indispensable role.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1985, he formed WPP after taking control of a shell company, Wire &amp; Plastic Products, and established it as a marketing services group in 1986.
             </p>
             <p>
              As CEO of the company for the past three decades he has built up an advertising empire with 3,000 offices in 112 countries.
             </p>
             <p>
              The razor sharp businessman was KNIGHTED  in the 2000 New Year Honours.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorrell is married to Cristiana Falcone, director of media and entertainment industries at the World Economic Forum.
             </p>
             <p>
              At 43, the impressive businesswoman is three decades his junior.
             </p>
             <p>
              She gave birth to their first child, Bianca Sorrell, in November 2016.
             </p>
             <p>
              Their marriage breakdown - reportedly due to Sorrell's obsession with work - resulted in the largest divorce settlement in British legal history.
             </p>
             <p>
              The three sons followed in their father's footsteps by going to Cambridge University.

            UpVoat!  Outstanding Post!  I chose headstogether to look into but julia hans rausing trust caught my eye.  Harry and William have so very much disappointed me, especially how their mother Diana tried so very hard to show them the right path.  That is why she is no longer here.  They did  something to those boys to turn them inside out.  Kate is more than happy to oblige.  The will pass this sick way of life on to their brood.  I hope Kate is done shooting them out.  Considering they are for Depopulation, they are not good roll models.

            Institute for Cancer Vaccines and Immunotherapy
           </p>
           <p>
            Founded in 2000, the Institute for Cancer Vaccines and Immunotherapy is the only national charity in the UK devoted exclusively to funding research into cancer immunotherapy and vaccines.  Both its research and other studies around the world have shown that this approach works and has enabled many patients to live longer and enjoy a better quality of life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recent funding from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust has allowed the Institute to employ a consultant investigator to co-ordinate a series of clinical trials for a variety of cancers.  The institute hopes that this important project will allow it to translate more of our findings into the clinic.
           </p>
           <p>

             There is so much more I want to say on what is going wrong in the States Chamber, but for me the only problem I see right not is the 29 members who consistently vote with Philip Ozouf.  We can bring questions.  We can bring propositions.  We can hold rallies.  We can drink Kir Royale at the Grand Hotel, but at the end of the day it's those same 29, who seem to lack any independence of thought, backed by a Council of Ministers telling a pack of lies.  Yet these 29 vote with them every time.  How is it that these 29 people voted for Chief Minister Le Sueur's Commissioner led review, over Deputy Hill's P9 and THEN when the Deputy of St Martin's asked the Chief Minister to bring a statement to the House regarding Napier's review, more or less the exact same 29 voted against it?  Make no mistake.
