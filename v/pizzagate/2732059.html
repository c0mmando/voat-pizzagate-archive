<p>There has been something oddly missing from recent news events concerning the dismissal of an employee of this international organization. Some of what the employee did has been documented and names of victims proffered by the organization for public consumption and interviews. What hasn\'t been offered to the public by the organization, even though it has been discovered via other means, is the dismissed employee\'s name. Seems kind of odd they protect the bad guy and put the victims front and center with names and make them available for interviews.</p>
<p>One other thing that is missing is why the dismissed employee\'s behavior is being referred to law enforcement for possible prosecution. For sexual harassment? It is disgusting, but rarely criminal. So, why all the hush hush and what happened criminally? Apparently this employee\'s job allowed him to traffic children. Well, not him directly, but he could make sure that certain organizations would not be reported for doing so. He could provide them cover. He could also arrange for documents for the children from his home country so the children could be trafficked. Still though, why all the secrecy? This seems to be something that could be turned into a positive. Taking down a child sex trafficking ring or two or however many were operating freely with the aid of this man. Nope, there is something more. You might think it was that low profile diplomatic expulsion of a senior official and his family. Apparently that senior official is already in jail in his home country for his part in this operation.</p>
<p>One of the faces of this organization is A+ list. If her name came out, it would be an explosion. It would bring so much attention to the organization that it would implode from the investigations. Behind the scenes, things are crazy. In addition to the A+ lister, there are two senior organization employees that the A+ lister has romantic relationships with and also assisted at her request. She would say she was trying to help kids go to better places minus all the paperwork. Umm, with no paper trail, these kids basically have no future at all. The amount of people involved is significant. If it all came out, it would topple the organization. Apparently a big part of all this came from the wife of one of the senior officials who was sleeping with the A+ lister. She did some digging on her own on why he was taking so many trips with her.</p>',

            Anne Hathaway is not A+. Angelina or Nicole (tho didn’t think Nicole ran in those circles so much). Seems obvious it’s Angelina.

             I see Ann Hathaway but Nicole would be more like it but I believe I have read she doesn't like men and I also agree it must be Angie.  She is really sick and demented.  What some of the stars are doing to their children is criminal.  He/She is that the new sex? Ugh.

             As part of UN Women’s efforts to engage men and boys in support of gender equality, the HeForShe IMPACT Summit is convening world leaders, global CEOs, activists and celebrities to introduce ground-breaking solutions to achieve gender equality around the world. Among several other speakers, award-winning Actress and UN Women’s Global Goodwill Ambassador, Anne Hathaway, is set to issue a global call to action for gender equality during the Summit.

            Definitely the UN.  Many are saying Angelina.  Can't be Hillary or Huma they have been reported as sleeping with women.  I think it would be much bigger explosion if it WAS Hillary, but Angelina would really be a shocker to the normies.

            I agree with someone else in the comments, time to Shut Down the UN.  Way overdue.  God I hope this Blows Up!.

             Hillary likely involved in much darker events -- peddling is just but one.  There was an interview that the Hostel movies were art imitating life (going looking for the interview on YT).  Given HRCs known anger issues, I don't doubt physical abuse is her thing.  I sat in on a predator profiling seminar (I have been in the sexual assault/child abuse field for a few years) and HRC's behaviors do match many of those characteristics and on par for the DSM-5 antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders.

              I can't argue with that.  God knows what has happened within that family.  Many say Chelsea is not Bill's daughter, and who knows why they wanted a baby.  To continue their evil ways not doubt.  I have just read something recently about Chelsea being gay.  They love to give beards to the stars and other elites.  Bill is a beard for Hillary, but he has his own problems.  We saw how she reacted with Matt Lauer when she thought she might lose. She threw a nasty hissy fit. "We will all hang."

                  Greed and taking over the world and power that's what they both wanted.  Sick is what they are.  What ever punishment from either side they get, they deserve.
