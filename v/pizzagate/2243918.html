             There may be another reason but I think this is a big part of it. Historically white populations have been incredibly successful, creative, and powerful. The parasites realize that the only segment of the population left with enough resources to give them a fight is the white middle class. Knocking out this threat is of paramount importance.
            </p>
            <p>
             White males are the warriors and white females are the mothers. The white males are the most dangerous because they can physically attack and fight and own the bulk of the successful businesses that are left.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my opinion raising the minimum wage was more about making it hard for medium and small businesses to survive than it was about feeding poor people because the NWO satanists don't care if people starve.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are also attacking our women but I think they consider the white males the biggest threat to their dominance which is one reason they spread homosexuality too.

               Of course. The last thing the NWO can tolerate is for blacks, whites, mexicans, men, women, gays, heterosexuals, et:al is to realize that we are better off banded together because our strife is the glue that holds their spells together. If we all unite its their death and its what they fear most. If there is one thing they understand its the power of unity because they operate like a hive and they understand that this is the reason they are on top

              <p>
               That is why I keep telling donkey that his race strategy is a losing battle. Normies will not fight "the jews" and it just pisses them off because they are brainwashed to believe the "jews" were kicked out of the holy land, etc....If anything point out that they are not even semites for god's sake. They are a criminal clique thriving on a criminal evolutionary strategy that are not oy veys kicked out of the holy land.

             Now -- that said, I believe 'Q' -- and whoever Q represents -- is unleashing something truly powerful IF THE PEOPLE RESPOND. The more people research, the more we find out for ourselves, the more we share what we learn with each other, and slowly, with friends and family (teeny tiny red pillets) -- the more everyone gets lifted into a new understanding. And knowledge truly is power.

           <p>
            I will admit that the Q phenomenon has caused the masses to do an immense amount of research and many people have learned much needed knowledge. For that alone I am grateful. Some redpill seeds have been hatched.

            I agree as long as it does not lead to confirmation bias which is the death of true knowledge. We have to be willing to hear what we do not like without throwing tantrums and calling each other shills. There is a lot of that going on too.

            Life is a process and not an event. Attempting to unwind this 6000 year old pedosatanic system will also be a process. Education is the key. Accuracy in information is crucial and confirmation bias kills accuracy.

            I use tenacity and perseverance instead of the Hopium I get from the satanic airwaves of communication.
           </p>
           <p>
            Organic Hopium is good hopium because it comes from the strength gained from good information and actions. A person has to be careful not to smoke the generic Hopium :)
           </p>
           <p>
            We can do this but it will take time and accuracy. The satanic system is very precise, and we have to strive to become equally as precise in our understanding of what is truly happening, instead of living in a bubble of the way we wish thing were.

            Q caused a lot of people to do a lot of learning. That is a good thing.

             Thanks for this! One thing that struck me as being odd when I read about the interview that "she" gave was that "she" claimed that only very few people in Saudi Arabia were allowed to have slaves.
            </p>
            <p>
             But many, many of the upper class families have housemaids and other personnel who live in slave like conditions, and also very often are sexually harassed. Not to speak of child slaves who get abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems that someone wants to push the narrative that something is being done about sexual slavery in Saudi Arabia when in fact it isn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             (No, I'm not saying that Q is a Russian... ;-) ).

            Does Washington DC not being in a State mean they have their own police force, judges, child protection officers? 🤔
Does this mean for the past 30 years kids have been openly sold, abused, raped, mutilated, tortured, in the capital of America? 🤔
The Golden Traingle is a Disney Land for pedophiles. Kids served up in Pizza Restaurants etc to these sick bastards and the police paid off. Never forget MOSSAD, CIA have facilitated this from the very beginning

             I have no doubt the Saudi may be one of the major players in some corrupt, exploitation, global pedophile scandal however it could easily be a hghly connected globalist network meaning there will be many other people, more elite, more important players...but it would not shock me to see Saudi Arabians there, maybe even a connection between Saudi, Paris, India, California, London and the political elite of Hollyweird. Remember as written in their book the Quran or Koran, the fundamentalist muslim, orthodox islamic, mohametan they follow the ways of their so called prophet muhammad, this muhammad was an extremist, warmonger and pedophile who married a 6 yr old girl, muslims consider the Quran or Koran to be the perfect book and their so called prophet muhammad to be the perfect man...

             DC is like the Vatican. Makes you think doesn't it? Did you know London has the same setup? There is a city of London inside the city of London Just like DC is not a state but is in America and the Vatican is in Rome but not part of the city of Rome. The Satanist use this setup in their top vassal states, England, USA, ROME.

              This is correct. It's called the Triangle of City States. Often represented by 3 crosses (X'es). The logo of the city of Amsterdam here in Holland is just that:
              <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/">
               https://www.amsterdam.nl/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Amsterdam historically has been the burrow of Zionist bankers and legislation. There is a reason why in WW II, Rotterdam has been bombed into oblivion, notably the civilan part of the city: To give the leg-up to Amsterdam (as competing city) and likely, to get rid of prominent citizens of Rotterdam. The rivalry between the two cities is notable through an annual occurrence: The soccer match between Feyenoord (Rotterdam) and Ajax (Amsterdam), every year highly laden.

             It is rumored that DC's Golden Triangle is controlled and financed by Saudi interests.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I keep seeing this "Saud is the real puppet master" and I don't believe it for a minute. Saud has been used as a patsy by western forces for decades. I don't doubt that Saud names, addresses, and bank accounts might be tied to it but they had to be allowed into D.C.'s tight inner circle by some D.C. locals. I see an attempt to blame the Saudis, leave them holding the bag all by themselves, and take the fall for the real puppet masters that have control over Saud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back when the infamous "missing 28 pages" of 911 information were released a couple of years ago I believe this was extortion and blackmail against the Saudis. I believe this was a "do as we say or else" move against Saud by western forces.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Q" is also pushing the line that the House Of Saud is the real puppet master and listed their net worth at 4 Trillion dollars. It might be true that Saud is worth 4 Trillion but they are deeply in debt to western banking oligarchs so all that "net worth" does not legally belong to Saud.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 1970's Nixon set up a deal with Saud to offer them protection from their neighbors if they would buy U.S. Treasuries with their surplus oil profits. Saud is heavily invested in U.S. securities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saud is at the mercy of western forces and is in no way the ultimate power broker in this situation. It won't surprise me if Saud gets the blame for things they ultimately did not mastermind.

              That is the hope, but...Trump just went to Saudia Arabia and so did Kushner, and the U.S. just did a massive arms deal with Saud. Saudia Arabia, on behalf of the NWO, has exposed millions in Yemen to cholera and millions are on the verge of starvation. Saudia Arabia is gearing up to make Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran if necessary, cooperate with the NWO or else.

             <p>
              This in not an anti NWO move. People are expecting one president, who has less power than most hope he has, to undo a 6000 year old global system of child pedophilia with some indictments while he fights a global banking system.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about that. And then observe what is really going on, that is visible in the middle east....

                There is nobody in our top level government that isn't NWO. The NWO made it. The Saudia Arabian "pedo bust" was not a pedo bust. They are taking seventy percent of their wealth and letting them go. Money cured their pedo problem? Maybe the Clinton's lose some shekels in the deal too. The point is that there is ample evidence of pedophilia and it can be easily exposed any minute if they really wanted to. Right now they are busy muddying the water with sexual harassment cases to divert public attention from pedophilia and Hollywood is doing the same. People in this forum are doing the same.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is a clear line between pedophilia and the conversation on pedophilia has almost left the building and gotten trapped in lurid details of infidelity among adults and very old cases of "ooohhh, he liked girls a little too young 15 years ago."

               I think S.A. is just a part of the big picture, I think they turn a blind eye to what is going on in other Countries because it works to their advantage also

               Excellent analysis -- that's what I'm seeing too. A certain level of corruption is perhaps getting cleared -- but not the root of the rot. It looks like NK might be being forced to toe the NWO line, too. Although there's lots of confusion and fog around that now.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now -- that said, I believe 'Q' -- and whoever Q represents -- is unleashing something truly powerful IF THE PEOPLE RESPOND. The more people research, the more we find out for ourselves, the more we share what we learn with each other, and slowly, with friends and family (teeny tiny red pillets) -- the more everyone gets lifted into a new understanding. And knowledge truly is power.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know if I'm saying any of this well -- but don't be afraid to smoke a bunch of hopium -- we just keep doing our research, gathering facts, making connections, getting better at answering questions calmly and knowledgeably, becoming better able to calm friends and family as they start to wake up -- let 'em know we can change the course of all of this by working together and waking together.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other side is weak and actually pretty stupid -- it's taken them thousands of years to get this far against a sleeping people. They have no chance against a woken people. And they know it. (Good Christ, look at Lynn dR yesterday -- that was hysterical -- literally :) We've got a window here. We just need to stay focused. Be patient. Be persistent. Keep calm -- it's a marathon, not a sprint. Breathe and take care of ourselves, because we're gonna need to be strong for quite a while as more and more folks wake up.
              </p>
              <p>
               And we can help one another relax into KNOWING that Truth Wins. LOVE Wins. Light Wins.  If God is with us, who could be against us?
              </p>
              <p>
               6000 years of horrors against children? 6000 years? That's the first I've seen that.
              </p>
              <p>
               No more on my watch. (I'm bawling right now) Let's keep going. Let's get this done.

It happened in WWII in Germany and its happening again here in America. After Wwii's goal of instituting Israel was complete the mercs the us and britain hired were moved to the us to complete the plan of transforming Hollywood, government and science into pure mind control tools, ALL OF US ARE A PRODUCT OF...

                 Roger Stone is a lackey in the system and has no real power. He has operated in political campaigns in the past as a fixit man and sometimes trickster. He is well known but I can assure you he does not have the power to allow the Saudis in or out of D.C.

                   I would also like to know from which bloodline he comes?
 Im interested in who this other faction is....we keep hearing about white hat patriots and military etc which sounds great but who is behind them? A competing bloodline sounds about right. My hope is that they are at least more humane than the current ruling bloodline.
