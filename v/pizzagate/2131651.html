<p>The ten year anniversary of his disappearance was yesterday. <em>Sept 14th</em>. Read about it here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden</a></p>
<p>There have been many theories and lines of investigation opened, over the years. The father was initially a suspect (and still is, in my book) but ruled out, and the main thinking is that he may have been groomed by pedophiles via his Sony PSP, which were just starting to get popular (online chats etc) around that 2007 period. His parents were quick to insist that he did not have a home computer or liked to spend time on one, which was incredibly strange, given that Andrew was a total Math geek and \'loner.\'</p>
<p><strong>IN COMMON WITH MADELINE McCANN</strong>: Andrew ALSO had a strange facial deformity, much like Madeline\'s eye colobuma. He had what is known as a very rare \'double ridge\' along his right ear: (see pic) <a href="http://www.411gina.org/cases/gosdenandrew.htm">http://www.411gina.org/cases/gosdenandrew.htm</a></p>
<p>Are there any medical experts here who have more info on what a \'double ridge\' is? Many believe that eye colobumas hold a special protein gene which promotes life expectancy. Does the same apply to ear \'double ridges\'? Or is a double ridge the mark of the devil (lol.)</p>
<p>Some other things of note: </p>
<ul>
<li>This case was investigated/bungled by South Yorkshire police: NOTORIOUS in their number of pedophile cover ups</li>
<li>SY Police did not think to look at the CCTV cameras in London\'s Kings Cross until <strong>28 days</strong> AFTER Andrew had been reported missing</li>
<li>The parents are ultra religious, dad a former minister, and, to be honest, an obvious closet case. Both parents have (to me) incredibly strange demeanors, not unlike the McCanns. Dad seems to love the limelight. Mom shrugs off the disappearance with a \'hope he\'s out there enjoying life\' blasé attitude. Cant put my finger on it but something is very \'off.\' As with a lot of these \'false flag\' parents, they just don\'t seem too upset. (From <strong>36:40</strong> onwards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPR6kB3vc0Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPR6kB3vc0Q)</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don\'t know how or why Andrew disappeared exactly, by MY THEORY is that Andrew was being abused by the dad, possibly condoned by the mom, and was \'taken care\' of in London, before he could start spilling secrets. Again, South Yorkshire police are KNOWN as the worst police force in the UK and for their cover ups, in particular of the North of England pedophile grooming gangs....</p>

            From the Wiki: On the morning of his disappearance, Gosden had difficulty waking up and was particularly grumpy. He had a 100% attendance record at The McAuley Catholic High School and left at the normal time to wait for his school bus.[4] He returned home to change out of his school uniform after the rest of the household had left for the day.[5] He withdrew £200 from his bank account,[6] went to Doncaster railway station and purchased a one-way ticket to London before boarding the 9:35 am train to King's Cross. Witnesses saw him getting on the train alone, and CCTV at King's Cross shows him leaving the main entrance on the same day.[7] That was the last time Andrew was seen. The ticket seller on Doncaster station remembered Gosden because he refused a return ticket, despite it only costing a small amount more than a single.[5] When he failed to attend lessons at his school, the teachers tried to contact his parents but a misdial on the phone meant they ended up with the wrong number and Gosden's disappearance was not logged until later that day.[4]  OK.  First off, why would he buy a one way ticket and not go to school?  Did someone tell him about a special event he was invited to and he would be picked up by car?  Also, is that not just too handy that the person dialing made a mistake when calling to report his not arriving at school that day.  There are too many possibilities here? Not in my book.  Dad?  Sold him off?  To the elites at the school?  Who knows who he went to, but it just seems too strange.  A child that was expected to get all As is very committed and would not take it upon himself to go on a lark with no ticket back.  Nope.

            Remember Etan Patz?  Same thing.  Disappeared on his first time getting to school alone.  Hmm.  Parents also seem "odd".  You may be right that he "has been taken care of".  But we have had articles on here saying that Etan is now still alive, having been used by a Pedophile Ring.  Possibly he was sold of like Etan.
