            I saw it on Random Rants of Ryan podcast. Remember, these notes were dated a month BEFORE Eric Prince's interview which corrobrates everything in the IG report. PG is real - official gov. Document !

            Stop with the Weiner laptop..really.....no more...ran it's course last year...enough. There is no suspense, no expectations that anything will come of any of this. Stop humiliating yourselves. Archaic angle that proved to be a delay game. Too much time has passed, doesn't work anymore. Nothing is about to break. Please quit.

            So emails under child / molestation / porn search parameters of the warrant for wieners laptop brought up 300k+ emails associated with Hillary. The New York state AG instructed not to view. Emails that got pulled up under this search parameter. Child porn &amp; HRC EMAILS.

             That’s not what your linked images describe. The guy went looking for things related to kiddie porn and began processing the laptop, and in doing so discovered the tremendous amount of emails.  It does not say that on searching 1 million emails he found 300k on child porn, just that in his investigation he discovered the emails. No doubt there are pizzagate emails in there, but it’s ridiculous to think that the 300k emails all referred to exploiting minors.  And it makes sense that he was instructed not to view as he is a federal employee without the proper clearances to access the classified data being leaked in the emails.

               He was simply using software to categorize and strip ALL files, and saw a giant cache of emails.

               If I turn over your hard drive looking for goat images using forensic software, and I find a huge volume of over 300k rare Pepe images, it would probably show up abnormally in the software. Imagine pie graphs and other advanced technology. Then I would  steal all the Pepes and goat images.

             NYPD, Prosecutors Probe Claim That Anthony Weiner Sent Explicit Messages To Girl, 15
"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — The NYPD and other authorities confirmed Thursday afternoon that they are investigating the latest claims against Anthony Weiner.
            </p>
            <p>
             A police source confirmed to CBS2 that the NYPD Special Victims Unit, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, and the U.S. Attorney’s office are investigating Weiner, CBS2’s Dana Tyler reported."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The report appeared in Britain’s Daily Mail and claimed that Weiner sent the girl shirtless photos of himself and more graphic 
messages."
            </p>
            <p>
             "As of late Thursday afternoon, police had not spoken to Weiner or the teen, sources said."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Police on Thursday were trying to contact the teenage girl, and the U.S. Attorney’s office is issuing subpoenas as part of its probe, sources said."
            </p>
            <p>
             "On Wednesday when the story surfaced, CBS2 reached out to Weiner.
            </p>
            <p>
             Weiner offered this response to the article: “I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,” he said. “I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I hurt. While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax,..."

               By the time Erik Prince gave that story, the fake NYPD story was being pushed for at least 5 days.   This post is the first mention on Facebook, goes back to late October.  The Woman's name is not real and the real woman behind the account is a 60 year old woman in Joplin, MO.  You know, exactly the type of person to have deep NYPD contacts.  When she was found out she refused to explain how she came across her allegations.

Post the Federal paper trail. Who initiated them going after Weiner and WHEN?
 Did the NYPD have any contact with Weiner and said laptop? CBS local news reported NYPD initial involvement. Show me the NYPD paper trail on this case.

                 CBS did not report involvement. CBS reported a local investigation was opened.   Same day a federal investigation was opened.  Same days the feds opened their investigation, they also filed a subpoena.  Google it. Who Initiated this?  The US Attorney of the Southern District of New York.  You want the federal paper trail.  Look up the unsealed Weiner laptop warrant.   It was discussed in tons of details on voat within the last two weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's the timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                 2016
Sept 21
UK press reports on Weiner.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sept 22
NYPD announces investigation
US attorney announces investigation.
US attorney also issues federal subpoena for Weiner's electronic devices.  This is the key.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sept 23 
Weiner turns his devices over to a security firm (probably on advice of his lawyer, to avoid a charge of tampering with evidence.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sept 26
Judge grants a federal search warrant.
FBI acts on search warrant and seizes with Ipad, his Iphone and a Dell laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sept 28 By this point, if not earlier, emails from domains clintonemail.com are known to be on Weiner's laptop.  FBI agents start discussing the fact they will need another warrant to examine them because they Weiner warrant does not allow them to read the Clinton emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sept 21 and 22 are from news report in 2016.  Sept 23-26 is from the unsealed warrant.  Sept 28th is from the IG report.
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                <p>
                 No.  NYPD never issued a search warrant.  The claim that the NYPD had the laptop first is false.  The claim that the FBI took the laptop away from the NYPD is false.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  CBS local news reported NYPD initial involvement. Show me the NYPD paper trail on this case.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 There is no NYPD paper trail.  The FBI got the laptop from Weiner and examined it and noticed almost immediately it contained Clinton emails and then kept close wraps on it.  The IG report mentions that one FBI agent was working on with an image copy of the Weiner laptop on his computer.  His computer had to be wiped because of the potential that classified material might be on computer and his computer was not secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's unclear if the NYPD got to look at Weiner's laptop at all. The NYPD has never said anything publicly about this case.  The IG report never mentions the NYPD at all.   The one piece of evidence that suggest they had something to do was the day that Weiner plead guilty, the US attorney thanked the Special Victims Division of the NYPD for their help.  But it didn't indicate what that help was.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All this is on voat with links, I remember the federal warrant for the weiner's laptop was published by the NY Post.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The True Pundit/Erik Prince story is destroyed.  Remember a key element of that was that if Comey didn't indict Clinton the NYPD was going to come forward.  She was not indicted and nothing happened?  Why?   The whole thing was a hoax.

                  ""A federal search warrant was obtained on September 26, 2016, for Weiner’s iPhone, iPad, and laptop computer. The FBI obtained these devices the same day.

                  According to the NY CBS article I linked above, the origin of the Weiner sexting story was the British Daily Mail, published on September 21, 2016. On September 22, 2016, CBS reported that "A police source confirmed to CBS2 that the NYPD Special Victims Unit, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, and the U.S. Attorney’s office are investigating Weiner, CBS2’s Dana Tyler reported."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Interestingly "As of late Thursday afternoon (September 22), police had not spoken to Weiner or the teen, sources said." "Police on Thursday were trying to contact the teenage girl, and the U.S. Attorney’s office is issuing subpoenas as part of its probe, sources said."

                    It's really not a complicated story.  The Feds got the laptop and held onto the laptop.  They found evidence of one criminal, Anthony Weiner.  He plead guilty to crimes related to a single victim.

                      "The warrant shows that the only “probably cause” the FBI found on the laptop that drove their request to go through emails on the laptop they believed were linked to Clinton was the email subject lines and the fact that Clinton’s top aide was Weiner’s estranged wife. Beyond that, there was little evidence to support their request for the warrant."  The alleged leak said there was a "Insurance" subject line. I suppose an investigator could click on it to find out proof of ownership.

WHO DID THE FBI GET THE LAPTOP FROM? THE NYPD?
WE DO NOT HAVE THE COMPLETE PAPER TRAIL OF THAT LAPTOP. 
The FBI got it LAST.

                      "Eleven days before the 2016 presidential election, Comey announced that the FBI had discovered emails possibly "pertinent" to the Clinton email server probe "in connection with an unrelated case." That unrelated case was New York prosecutors' separate investigation into allegations that Weiner -- a former New York congressman and the estranged husband of Abedin -- had sexted with an underage girl."

                      This was the probable cause used in the FBI LAPTOP search warrant:
18 U.S.C. § 793 - U.S. Code - Unannotated Title 18. Crimes and Criminal Procedure § 793. Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information
"(e)  Whoever having unauthorized possession of, access to, or control over any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, or note relating to the national defense, or information relating to the national defense which information the possessor has reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation, willfully communicates, delivers, transmits or causes to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted, or attempts to communicate, deliver, transmit or cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same to any person not entitled to receive it, or willfully retains the same and fails to deliver it to the officer or employee of the United States entitled to receive it;  or

Search warrant for Weiner’s electronic devices unsealed

                     </p>
                     <p>
                      THE FBI ALSO SEARCHED FOR:
"Evidence...including child pornography.."
"Evidence of who used,owned or controlled the Subject Devices..."
ONE COULD JUSTIFY LOOKING INTO A FILE MARKED "INSURANCE".
If it contained "p o r n", they could keep investigating it.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      "This warrant also authorizes the copying of electronically stored information for later review"
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This is what is alleged the NYPD did. Thus, the laptop would have still been in Weiner's possession to turn over to Granite and then the FBI.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM: According to the NY CBS affiliate, it was the DAILY MAIL story and CELL PHONE evidence that got the NYPD and Feds involved in the Weiner sexting case. THEY ONLY SHOWED CELL PHONE SCREEN SHOTS IN THE ARTICLE. How did the NYPD or the Feds know about the LAPTOP if they did not search the apartment? WAS ANY "sexting" evidence ever found on the laptop????????

                       That is false. The NYPD could have searched the Weiners' home on the on the 21 or the 22 of Sept. 2016. CBS claimed they reached out to Weiner on the 21st. They also claim that the NYPD was involved in the investigation. THEY NEVER SAY TO WHAT EXTENT. There has been no released FOIA request for any NYPD search warrant. If the leak is true, powerful people would not want that info outed. Remember Loretta Lynch's involvement, mentioned in the OIG report. "Leaks"
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       "Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Anthony Weiner's cell phone and other records, according to law enforcement officials. "
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       They specifically listed a DEVICE (cell phone) and "other RECORDS"
"Other records" does not mean LAPTOP. Also, the info comes from UNNAMED OFFICIALS.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       "The announcement by the FBI and New York Police Department that they are investigating close Clinton ally Anthony Weiner's inappropriate relationship with an underaged female is extremely disturbing," Jessica Ditto said. "The Clinton campaign should immediately return all campaign contributions from Weiner."
Again, THE NYPD IS INVOLVED. They are LOCAL government. They have THEIR OWN AUTHORITY to investigate this. They could have a search warrant that allows them to COPY everything on discovered devices, just like the FEDS did. This is consistent with the alleged leak. The NYPD would not have to confiscate the devices to have all the info.

                        They could not have searched Weiner's home on the 21st.  Given that the story broke on the 21st, there's no real world way this could happen.  Remember first word that an NYPD investigation happened was on Set 22nd. The 21st is out.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        How about the 22nd?  For your claim to work, the NYPD would have had to do all of the following on Sept 21- 22nd. Before the FBI starts writing up their warrant claim on the 23rd. 
* Learn about Weiner article
* Open investigation.
* Establish probable cause.
* Petition judge for search warrant.
* Get search warrant approved.
* Execute search warrant.
* Process Weiner's laptop enough to discover crimes involving other people.

                       <p>
                        So that's a lot of stuff to happen in the first, say 36 hours after learning about a potential crime.  And, remember, there is no documented evidence this happened.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And the timing isn't even the biggest problem with this scenario.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        What would the NYPD do with the laptop after they got a search and seizure warrant for it?

                       <h1>
                        The NYPD gives it back to Weiner?????!!!!!
                       </h1>
                       <p>
                        The federal warrant makes it clear that the laptop was in Weiner's possession before it was transferred to Granite Security.   The warrant says the laptop and other devices "were transferred by Target Subject to Granite Intelligence, LLC."
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Weiner's the Target Subject.  So for your scenario to work the NYPD gets a warrant for his laptop, executes the warrant and seizes the laptop and THEN GIVE IT BACK TO HIM THE NEXT DAY?

Also I think it's quite probable that they records refers to cell phone records, such as calls and texts, other internet communication records like skype calls, messenger apps, etc.  This point doesn't seem to advance your argument.

                        This makes no sense whatsoever.   How would they copy the info if they didn't have the device?  Are you saying they got a copy from the FBI, because that destroys the leak story as well.

                        How does this help your story at all?  The usual type of subpoena would be something like  "preserve all records, communications, internet history and let us know what devices you use."   The subpoena would have gone to Weiner's lawyer and they probably asked him what devices he used to connect to the internet or to text.   There's nothing about this that means the NYPD had the laptop.

                        Preet Bharara's office jumped into action and seized Weiner's laptop. If he wanted to protect Clinton, or Democrats in general, he could have slow walked this case. You're flying off the rails here into conspiracyland.  All of the actions you mentioned were after this case and after Donald Trump personally asked Bharara to stay on.

                       <p>
                        Also your point about Bharara is undercut, by the fact, it was assistant US attorneys who put this all together,....."Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara"....... that happens in most cases in US Attorney offices.  It's also undercut, by the fact, the conviction was secured under Bharara's replacement.

               True Pundit's claims of vindication are utter bullshit.   It absolutely does not confirm True Pundit's Hoax Story.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact in undermines it severely.  No mention of the other litany of crimes True Pundit made up.  Zero mentions of the NYPD.  The important article you mention is irrelevant.  NYPD opened an investigation on the same day the Feds did.  But the Feds also issued a warrant and the FBI seized the laptop.  We have now seen that federal warrant and we know how the FBI got the laptop.  We know the NYPD did not get the laptop first and the FBI did not get it from the NYPD.  That story is destroyed.   TruePundit stories from today are filled with lies.
              </p>
              <p>
               TruePundit is lying right here

               there are two separate items in a list.
Hillary Clinton &amp; Foundation
Crime Against Children:
              </p>
              <p>
               There are more like bullet points than headings, but it quite clear they are separate.
What this indicates is quite clear from all the context in the report.  There are separate investigations.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Crime against Children investigation is what the laptop was seized for.  This is the Weiner investigation.  This investigation closed with Weiner pleading guilty to Transferring Obscene Material To A Minor.
              </p>
              <p>
               This investigation never involved Clnton and nothing in the IG reports says otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other separate investigation involves Clinton's emails and could apply to her server and the Clinton Foundation.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, at the time these notes were written, the FBI did not know what were in these emails because they didn't look at them BECAUSE THEY WERE LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO.  They had to get a seperate warrant for to look at these.  All they knew was that they had emails from clintonemail.com and state.gov and other domains that were relevant to SEPARATE INVESTIGATIONS.

                Here's some evidence from the report that shows Coleman's notes DO NOT SHOW Hillary Clinton emails involving sex crimes.   The evidence begins in the executive summary.  It's not hard to find.
               </p>
               <h3>
                Page Vii  Here's your Crime against children.   Anthony Weiner's warrant.
               </h3>
               <p>
                A federal search warrant was obtained on
September 26, 2016, for Weiner’s iPhone, iPad, and
laptop computer. The FBI obtained these devices the
same day. The search warrant authorized the
government to search for evidence relating to the
following crimes:
                <strong>
                 transmitting obscene material to a
minor, sexual exploitation of children, and activities
related to child pornography.
                </strong>

               </h4>
               <p>
                The Weiner case agent told the OIG that he began
processing Weiner’s devices on September 26, and that
he noticed “within hours” that there were “over 300,000
emails on the laptop.” He said that either that evening
or the next morning, he saw at least one BlackBerry PIN
message between Clinton and Abedin, as well as emails
between them. He said that he recalled seeing emails
associated with “about seven domains,” such as
yahoo.com, state.gov, clintonfoundation.org,
clintonemail.com, and hillaryclinton.com.
               </p>

                • Sweeney said he also spoke to FBI Assistant
Director E.W. “Bill” Priestap on September 28
and 29, 2016. Emails indicate that during their
conversation on September 29, they discussed
                <em>
                 the limited scope of the Weiner search warrant
(i.e., the need to obtain additional legal process
to review any Midyear-related email on the
Weiner laptop)

               </h3>
               <p>
                The SSA told us that he specifically recalled the case agent mentioning
domain names associated with Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, and possibly
Clinton for President. The SSA also recalled the case agent telling him “early on”
that there were “hundreds of thousands” of emails.
                <em>
                 The case agent and SSA told
us that because the search warrant for the laptop was limited to child exploitation
offenses, they agreed during this meeting that the emails were not covered under
the search warrant and the case agent should not review those emails.
                </em>
                ....
                <em>
                 The ASAC told us that he immediately instructed the case agent and SSA to
stay focused on the Weiner investigation and to “stay completely out of” the Clinton
email case.
                </em>
                The SSA and case agent stated that the ASAC told them to stop
reviewing the emails pending further guidance from FBI Headquarters.
               </p>
               <h3>
                page 276              What emails to review for Crimes Against Children Case
               </h3>
               <p>
                The AUSAs provided written guidance to the case agent about how to handle
review of the laptop. In a September 28 email to the case agent and the SSA,
AUSA 1 advised that
                <em>
                 the case agent should review “only evidence of crimes related
to the sexual exploitation of children, enticement, and obscenity” and instructed the
case agent “that all emails and other communications between Anthony Weiner and
Huma Abedin (even if there are other parties to the communication) should be
sequestered and not reviewed at this time.”
                </em>
                The case agent agreed and responded
that the “[o]nly emails I will review are those to/from Weiner accounts to which
[Huma Abedin] is not party.”
               </p>
               <p>
                The IG report makes pretty clear that Athony Wiener didn't try to hide anything.  All through this section of the report, it's clear they have not seem criminal activity in the Clinton emails.  They call them "potentially relevant emails."

               <p>
                On 09/28/2016, EAD Randall Coleman received for [sic] call from AD
Bill Sweeney indicating team of Agents investigating Anthony Weiner
sexting case had discovered emails relevant to Clinton email
investigation. AD Sweeney advised team had halted further review
and would be requesting guidance from FBIHQ.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's nothing there about Clinton and sex crimes.  And it's apparent there are separate email reviews needed and only the Weiner review was going forward.

                “I’m sure I told him exactly what I’d been
representing to others, that, look, there are a lot of emails. You may want to get a
search warrant. We can’t, we’re not looking at anything. ....... “[W]e’ve got some
Clinton emails here, explained what it was. And they weren’t sure what to do with
it in that it was outside the scope of what they were working on.” .....The NYO participants told us that they provided the Midyear team with an
overview of what they had found on the Weiner laptop. This included the fact that
the laptop contained “hundreds of thousands” of emails potentially relevant to the
Midyear investigation......Each of the
NYO participants told us that the limited nature of Weiner search warrant was
discussed. The ASAC stated, “I know that we said to them that the warrant didn’t
authorize us to look at these particular emails.” He continued, “And [the Midyear
personnel] understood that. There was no pushback from them on that.” .....The Midyear SSA also told us that “content-wise” NYO “had only seen a couple” of emails because “they couldn’t review content.” ......The Midyear SSA stated that
Midyear personnel were informed that the Weiner search warrant had a very limited
scope. He stated that Midyear personnel knew that they “were going to need to get
a warrant to review this.”.....Well, from my standpoint, I said we were going to, we were going to address whether we had enough for a warrant. And that we would run
this up the chain on our side. And...they agreed especially that they 
would go back to SDNY and see what the exact parameters of what
they could and couldn’t do, because they were not going to cross a line
that would compromise their case......Analyst 1 stated that NYO reported that they had seen metadata showing “what they were characterizing as like [Hillary Clinton’s] email
addresses.” Analyst 1 stated that the Midyear team was trying to determine if
these were Clinton’s or were from the clintonemail.com domain.........Analyst 2’s notes
included a reference to “2007 dates on PC.” Each of the three also said that NYO
emphasized the limited nature of the Weiner search warrant and the fact that the
Midyear team was “going to need to get a warrant to review this.” Agent 2’s notes
included the following references: “SDNY advised to avoid emails” and “not looked
@ any content.” Analyst 2’s notes included the following references: “SDNY—said
put them aside” and “Huma has not waived marrital [sic] priv.” Analyst 2 described
the limited nature of the Weiner search warrant as an “overarching theme” of the
call.......We didn’t know if it was the right timeframe. So, you know, Huma we
knew, Huma had...worked for [Clinton] for a long time. So we weren’t
sure of exactly, one, what, how much of the information on this was
Huma’s versus Weiner’s. Because we thought it was his laptop. And
then, two, whether it would have been relevant to the right timeframe.
We were looking for Clinton’s emails, not Huma’s emails. We also
knew Huma had a clintonemail address, so she could have been using
that for her own personal activities, so we just didn’t know the full
extent of what was on there.......FBI Attorney 1 told us that NYO relayed that
“SDNY was very concerned about staying within the scope of their warrant.” FBI
Attorney 1 stated that the Midyear team told NYO, “well when you get further
clarity about what this laptop is, get back to us and let us know, and we’ll try to
figure out what to do from there.” ........When
asked whether NYO was supposed to create an inventory or list for Midyear, FBI
Attorney 1 stated that she “thought we talked about [the Weiner case agent] not
being able to do that. Because of the instructions. I mean, because of how the
warrant was drafted.” ......the September 28 email from AUSA 1 to the
Weiner case agent (detailed above) outlining the limited scope of the Weiner search
warrant and providing instructions for the case agent’s search of the laptop. The
ASAC told us that he forwarded this email to make sure “they understood the
directives that we had from [SDNY] in terms of limitations and really kind of under
what circumstances we would be able to look at anything that was attached to an
email.” Witnesses in NYO and SDNY told us that the case agent was told not to
affirmatively search the emails for information unrelated to the Weiner child
exploitation investigation. ....... It is something that we need to look into. There is work
they’ve got to do. We’re not there yet, but it isn’t something we can
just say, ah, let, there’s nothing relevant there.
..... the next step was for NYO to process the laptop and for NYO to look for
the type of data on the laptop that the Midyear team would need. ....
[A]nd...when you’re done with that, you know, call us back and let us
know. And again...there is no sense of this is going to be huge and horrible......Anderson said that she was informed that it was unclear what was on the laptop at this point and NYO was going “to try to figure out as much as they could” consistent with the terms of their search warrant.

                   Allegedly it is the "Rod Rosenstein version". Nothing was necessarily blacked out. THE TRUTH WILL OUT.

                   "A federal search warrant was obtained on September 26, 2016, for Weiner’s iPhone, iPad, and laptop computer. The FBI obtained these devices the same day. The search warrant authorized the government to search for evidence relating to the following crimes: transmitting obscene material to a minor, sexual exploitation of children, and activities related to child pornography."
HOW DID THE FEDS KNOW WHAT TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   According to the NY CBS article I linked above, the origin of the Weiner sexting story was the British Daily Mail, published on September 21, 2016. On September 22, 2016, CBS reported that "A police source confirmed to CBS2 that the NYPD Special Victims Unit, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, and the U.S. Attorney’s office are investigating Weiner, CBS2’s Dana Tyler reported."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Interestingly "As of late Thursday afternoon (September 22), police had not spoken to Weiner or the teen, sources said." "Police on Thursday were trying to contact the teenage girl, and the U.S. Attorney’s office is issuing subpoenas as part of its probe, sources said."

                   "A newly unsealed, search-and-seizure warrant obtained by the feds shows that the disgraced ex-pol (Weiner) handed over an iPhone, iPad and laptop computer to Granite Intelligence on Sept. 23, 2016."

                   According to "Attachment A, an "insurance file" could have been searched to determine ownership of laptop and if it contained child "porn" they also could have looked at it as per the conditions of the search warrant.
Scroll down to "Search and Seizure Document" and go to "Attachment A, #2 and #3.

                   WHAT WAS NYPD'S ROLL IN ALL OF THIS? By what legal authority did the U.S. Attorney, NY jump into this based on a news article in a foreign paper?  According to CBS, the Feds were "issuing subpoenas as part of its probe" on September 22, 2016. Did Weiner ever talk to the NYPD?

              The only thing I know about Q is that he’s irrelevant the majority of the time, and wrong for most of the rest. I just wish he wasn’t wrong on important points where he lulled people into complacency who could have actually done something.  Still waiting on Q to deliver on Roy Moore when he said it was rigged but he’d fix it.

              I see people who push Q really hard as the potential shills imo.

             No its not and it wasn't a hoax feeble minded liar AWS it happened 2 deaths resulted, you are scared you got owned on the NYPD angle, NYPD had clear access to their investigation, all kinds of openings through Granite and before, but hell lets assume FBI got it NYPD could have easily found the filed and cracked the steg or whatever be the case on it due to location and encryption methods AW would have tried to use for his precious insurance....too bad you are so low IQ and don't understand anything about code breaking.

             <p>
              Give them a front row seat and physically force them to watch the people they've been defending be executed in the most agonizing, horrible ways imaginable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then turn the shills in to the public and allow said public to handle them however they want. No law enforcement intervention in terms of decided fate.
