Did you know that Mila had to lie about her age to nab the role of Jackie Burkhart? The producers of That 70s Show were looking for an 18 year old actress, but Mila was only 14! Nevertheless, her charm and sneaky answer (Mila said she’d be 18 “on her birthday,” but she didn’t say which birthday!) had cemented her in the role of Jackie.)</p>
<p>Surely since they are only making a small decision like hiring a lead actress for their major network sitcom they would not have bothered to check her resume. Because had they done that they would have found out that she had just prior been playing a young teenager (obvious one at that) in the TV episodes<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115083/"> 7th heaven.</a></p>
<p>Clips from her on the show: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qsDv9HS5F4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qsDv9HS5F4</a></p>
<p>They began airing in 1996, That seventies show premiered in 1998. </p>
<p>In 1995 she looked this young in Baywatch: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0394233/mediaviewer/rm3810867456">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0394233/mediaviewer/rm3810867456</a></p>
<p>Still didn\'t stop the creators of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165598/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_37">That 70\'s show</a> from casting her as their main star and having her act out scenes like this, when Jackie is about to lose her virginity: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioWUuQyaatM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioWUuQyaatM</a></p>

<p>Watching the clips from 7th heaven gave me a weird vibe. Here they are seemingly taking a stand against this kind of thing so there is nothing really wrong about it that you can put your finger on... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoJaQ2ebBKo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoJaQ2ebBKo </a> but maybe it is this skeptical mindset after researching this topic, to be skeptical about a show revolving around so many teenagers coming from Hollywood. Maybe it is the fact that the name is in part a reference to &quot;7 minutes in heaven&quot; which we all know has some suggestions that imply that there might be some sexual themes in the show. Whatever the reason my hunch was proven to be on point pretty quickly since well... The main actor in the show has <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2783557/Actor-played-pastor-dad-7th-Heaven-admits-molesting-underage-girls-taped-therapy-session.html">admitted to molesting children</a> that were on the show:</p>
<p>In case you need further proof than the Daily Mail ... well, here is an audio recording of his confession:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1a7DM6GXs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1a7DM6GXs</a>
And his interview about it:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4g1dTDcOM0"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4g1dTDcOM0</a></p>
<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/09/267A2C8300000578-2986695-image-a-45_1425929954065.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/09/267A2C8300000578-2986695-image-a-45_1425929954065.jpg</a></p>
<p>This is a picture of his victim. Here she is talking about it recently: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MpVSpNwMWg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MpVSpNwMWg</a></p>
<p>It does not seem plausible that a guy who is an admitted pedophile that acted in 243 episodes over the span of 9 years with young teenage girls only had a few incidents of &quot;indecent exposure&quot;. This smells a lot more like a Savile situation. You would think that a pretty girl like Mila Kunis, also acting in the show would have been in immediate danger working this closely with a person who has a sexual attraction to kids and has admitted to acting upon those urges, keeping in mind that he only admitted to it after being accused and does so in a manner that is downplaying his crimes and did not mean to do so publicly. </p>
<p>Then of course there is her husband doing this: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJJh5bp7G7w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJJh5bp7G7w</a></p>
<p>And heads an <a href="https://www.wearethorn.org/about-our-fight-against-sexual-exploitation-of-children/">organization fighting human trafficking</a>.</p>
<p>This is speculation at this point but I feel like there is plenty of circumstantial evidence and I would be surprised if Mila was not harmed during this time by the many vicious pedophiles hovering around Hollywood. I hope she wasn\'t but at this point it seems like there is a lot of smoke.</p>',

            is a Scientologist. There might be some funkiness with the rest of the cast, I'm not sure but it's strange for one show to have all these assholes.

            OP sure put a lot of time into a highly speculative post about a well known celebrity, who would likely never admit to being abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            OP is brand new, too. I think you will see a lot of these posts as time goes by. They want to include celebrities with large fan bases who would defend them to the end. It's another attempt to control the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short.. I think this post sucks.

            I think that actors are all victims. I think they have to go through the casting couch process, and only get the job if they submit to being sexually exploited.

            Absolutely. I mean, did everyone get the part that this young actress that he exposed himself to was STAYING OVER HIS HOUSE?!!!! How often does a teenage girl have a sleepover at the home of a guy making inappropriate advances ... not only inappropriate ... ILLEGAL! WTH was she doing there? And they just happened to wind up watching TV ... ALONE!!! Yeah, just a situatioin a lot of husbands face ... nothing unusual there at all. And, of course, it didn't go past that even though it sure sounds like this girl was groomed.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, of course, the producers of THAT 70s SHOW had to know Mila Kunis' age. Shows have to arrange for on site tutoring for children of that age. It's not like someone of 30 lying about being 21. No high school to get in the way of the lie and of the actress getting the part. This is so ridiculous and so out there in plain sight that it's sickening. The lies ... the cover up ... the stupid, stupid, STUPID excuses! Then the dragging out of the media whores like Couric. That's how you really can tell this pedo monster is being protected. Yup, the media shielding one of their own.
           </p>

            Thanks for the post. It's no wonder these actors/actresses are so sick in the head.
