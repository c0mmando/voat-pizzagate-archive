            we need to get this voted up on the main page and a call for collaboration. I will see what I can do... first let me find a resource to upload a "living document" that people can enter into and you can clean up as needed. trying to figure that out first.

            I am not sure how to do that, but I will dig.  You have put so much into this... a searchable solution would be so great. Hopefully some really smart person will pass through and tell us how. For now we DIG. upvoating this one. Its good work and it requires more collaboration to make it happen.

            We need to sticky this list somehow, it's important.

            RE Paul Ingram, that is one strange case. Richard Ofshe, one of the professional gaslighters wrt RSA and founding member of the pedo infested False Memory Syndrome Foundation, inserted himself illegally into that case and subjected Ingram to a pseudoscientific experiment used to bolster their made up syndrome.

            His fake expertise - he's a sociologist not even a psychologist - was used to cover up and explain away RSA cases all the way to Europe.

           <p>
            Perhaps we should make a separate list of professional gaslighters/cover uppers. I bet with some research most of them will make the master list anyway. See also today's thread

              Woody Allen  was involved with an adult woman.  The other accusation was rejected in court  because the child's account was virtually implanted by her mother who created an atmosphere where Allen was the devil.

               Lots of apologists here, hmm. Perhaps some FMSF fans? But I want to repeat that the OP asked for anyone who has even been accused, so in am not implicating anyone, just referencing public information. In addition, Townshend was charged with using a credit card to purchase online CP (buying CP creates more victims,) and what you said about W. Allen is not true.

            A comprehensive list would be nearly endless.  Start near the top with Gen. Michael Aquino (ret).  He's been implicated in the Presidio Day Care child rape allegations, Franklin Credit Union scandal, satanic ritual abuse (SRA), Church of Satan,  psy-ops, mind control, and is a High Priest and chief executive officer of the Temple of Set, the nation's principal Satanic church.

             In the case of Dylan Farrow, the CT police found no evidence any molestation took place.  Her mother coached her through a video account where the video kept being turned off.  It was filmed over multiple days alleges one the nannies present.  When first asked when Allen touched her, Dylan Farrow indicated her shoulders

              Well well well I see you're slinging the usual bull shit AreWeSure. This time it's about a child that contends she was sexually assaulted by Woody Allen. And just like clockwork out come the tortured arguments that leave your opponent wincing in pain at seeing you twist and contort logic to arrive at an unnatural conclusion. You point to the fact Woody Allen was never convicted as proof he's innocent because after all people are innocent until proven guilty right?
             </p>
             <p>
              "After a custody hearing denied my father visitation rights, my mother declined to pursue criminal charges, despite findings of probable cause by the State of Connecticut – due to, in the words of the prosecutor, the fragility of the “child victim.”"
             </p>
             <p>
              It sounds to me like Woody is innocent of sticking his penis in Dylan's vagina or ass-hole. But he's guilty of lesser offensive like subtle and inappropriate touching. Did Woody commit sexual assault? You tell me how the law defines sexual assault of a child. Is the bar set at penis in a hole only? What does the law say AreWeSure?
             </p>
             <p>
              Looks like he had Dylan sleep next to him in bed sometimes. He would sleep so close she could feel his underwear. Then there's Dylan saying Woody would message her upper thigh as she sat in a chair naked. There are many creepy examples. It's a lot more sketchy than what Anthony Weiner did to get the NYPD on his ass. Whatever the case with Weiner in Dylan's case it sure seems like you're working the "Child just had an overactive imagination." defense. Way to keep it classy AreWeSure. Fuck a rape victims right to be believed. She had "Daddy Issues". Deep down "She wanted it.". Her vivid memories that haunt her to this day are false. Unless you have a handkerchief with the adults semen and the child's vagina blood and it looks "pizza related" then nothing doing. Besides Woody Allen is an older rich white person and as you've already proven with Mrs Sandler older rich white people are incapable of committing crimes.
             </p>
             <p>
              What a pathetic piece of shit you are AreWeSure. Never honest, never objective, always will run from a fight you are losing. What's this latest one you ignored, oh yeah, there aren't any "overt" references to Pedophilia at either of JA's restaurants. I point out that "Buck" is a Pedophile code word for child they want to fuck on a camping trip and you say nothing. I provide a documentary proving it, you won't watch it. I point out "Buck's Camping and Fishing" has the word "Buck" predominantly displayed and nothing doing. Cheese pizza is Pedo slang for child pornography and who knows. Panda bears have a special meaning to Pedophiles as does "ping pong", who cares. "SHUT UP AND FUCK" carved into the bathroom at CPP next to an alien ejaculating on a ping pong table and who cares. He's using the same table to play ping pong with a young boy....and on and on ad nauseum.
             </p>
             <p>
              You got something wrong with ya AreWeSure. What is it? Why are you so painfully and persistently irrationally obtuse about anything that would ever point to Pedophilia?

               You don't know what you are talking about when you say "from 7 years old."
              </p>
              <p>
               There was a single incident that supposedly occurred when the house was filled with people.    At the time Dylan made no accusation without her mother's prompting. In fact, her first answers indicated nothing happened.  The police found her story rehearsed and contradictory.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have no doubt she know believes something happened to her.  When your mother keeps telling your answers are wrong, you can implant a memory in a 7 year old.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyhow, the fact is the police investigated this at the time at they refused to bring charges.  The pyscholologists hired by the cops did a multi-month investigation and concluded no molestation occurred.

                Did you even bother to read her story? Nothing rehearsed or 'implanted' about it.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 He took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.

                <p>
                 For as long as I could remember, my father had been doing things to me that I didn’t like. I didn’t like how often he would take me away from my mom, siblings and friends to be alone with him. I didn’t like it when he would stick his thumb in my mouth. I didn’t like it when I had to get in bed with him under the sheets when he was in his underwear. I didn’t like it when he would place his head in my naked lap and breathe in and breathe out. I would hide under beds or lock myself in the bathroom to avoid these encounters, but he always found me. These things happened so often, so routinely, so skillfully hidden from a mother that would have protected me had she known, that I thought it was normal. I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different.

                Still even staunch pedo defenders like you, always ready to gaslight victims, ever prepared to manipulate facts and insinuate foul play on the victim's or her defenders' part - even sick fucks like you hardly any better than the pedos themselves (if not yourself one) can't deny FACTS, like that Allen went in therapy for his vile impulses wrt Dylan. Or that Allen refused a police polygraph. Or that Allen lost FOUR court battles, after which the judge concluded that Allen's behavior was 'grossly inappropriate, and that measures must be taken to protect [Dylan].'

                 Allen passed a polygraph.   Mia Farrow refused to take one.  Again the facts are after investigating both sides of this story, the police decided there was no molestation.  The investigation included a psychological team brought in by the State Police who concluded no molestation took place.  They interviewed Dylan extensively.  The investigation included medical tests.  This is not simply he-said/she-said, the authorities investigated this case right after the allegations were made.

                <p>
                 A nanny told police there was no time for Allen to do what was alleged in the attic. Dylan or Allen was not out of view that long.  This is one of the reasons that they concluded molestation did not occur.

                  You mostly don't know what the fuck you are talking about, you are lying where you do, and you refuse to read the facts I present you. Worst of all you're trying to gaslight me, with your 'projection'.

                 <p>
                  This shit don't fly asshole, not here, not with me. Here's the undeniable facts from the article you ignored:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <ol>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Mia never went to the police about the allegation of sexual abuse. Her lawyer told her on August 5, 1992, to take the seven-year-old Dylan to a pediatrician, who was bound by law to report Dylan’s story of sexual violation to law enforcement and did so on August 6.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Allen had been in therapy for alleged inappropriate behavior toward Dylan with a child psychologist before the abuse allegation was presented to the authorities or made public
                     <em>
                      .
                     </em>
                     Mia Farrow had instructed her babysitters that Allen was never to be left alone with Dylan.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Allen refused to take a polygraph administered by the Connecticut state police. Instead, he took one from someone hired by his legal team. The Connecticut state police refused to accept the test as evidence. The state attorney, Frank Maco, says that Mia was never asked to take a lie-detector test during the investigation.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Allen subsequently lost four exhaustive court battles—a lawsuit, a disciplinary charge against the prosecutor, and two appeals—and was made to pay more than $1 million in Mia’s legal fees. Judge Elliott Wilk, the presiding judge in Allen’s custody suit against Farrow, concluded that there is “no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen’s contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi.”
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     In his 33-page decision, Judge Wilk found that Mr. Allen’s behavior toward Dylan was “grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.” The judge also recounts Farrow’s misgivings regarding Allen’s behavior toward Dylan from the time she was between two and three years old. According to the judge’s decision, Farrow told Allen, “You look at her [Dylan] in a sexual way. You fondled her . . . You don’t give her any breathing room. You look at her when she’s naked.”
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Dylan’s claim of abuse was consistent with the testimony of three adults who were present that day. On the day of the alleged assault, a babysitter of a friend told police and gave sworn testimony that Allen and Dylan went missing for 15 or 20 minutes, while she was at the house. Another babysitter told police and also swore in court that on that same day, she saw Allen with his head on Dylan’s lap facing her body, while Dylan sat on a couch “staring vacantly in the direction of a television set.” A French tutor for the family told police and testified that that day she found Dylan was not wearing underpants under her sundress. The first babysitter also testified she did not tell Farrow that Allen and Dylan had gone missing until after Dylan made her statements. These sworn accounts contradict Moses Farrow’s recollection of that day in People magazine.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     The Yale-New Haven Hospital Child Sex Abuse Clinic’s finding that Dylan had not been sexually molested, cited repeatedly by Allen’s attorneys, was not accepted as reliable by Judge Wilk, or by the Connecticut state prosecutor who originally commissioned them. The state prosecutor, Frank Maco, engaged the Yale-New Haven team to determine whether Dylan would be able to perceive facts correctly and be able to repeat her story on the witness stand
                     <em>
                      .
                     </em>
                     The panel consisted of two social workers and a pediatrician, Dr. John Leventhal, who signed off on the report but who never saw Dylan or Mia Farrow. No psychologists or psychiatrists were on the panel. The social workers never testified; the hospital team only presented a sworn deposition by Dr. Leventhal, who did not examine Dylan.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                   All the notes from the report were destroyed. Her confidentiality was then violated, and Allen held a news conference on the steps of Yale University to announce the results of the case. The report concluded Dylan had trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality. (For example, she had told them there were “dead heads” in the attic and called sunset “the magic hour.” In fact, Mia kept wigs from her movies on styrofoam blocks in a trunk in the attic.) The doctor subsequently backed down from his contention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Connecticut state police, the state attorney, and Judge Wilk all had serious reservations about the report’s reliability.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     Allen changed his story about the attic where the abuse allegedly took place. First, Allen told investigators he had never been in the attic where the alleged abuse took place. After his hair was found on a painting in the attic, he admitted that he might have stuck his head in once or twice. A top investigator concluded that his account was not credible.
                    </p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <p>
                     The state attorney, Maco, said publicly he didhave probable cause to press charges against Allen but declined, due to the fragility of the “child victim.” Maco told me that he refused to put Dylan through an exhausting trial, and without her on the stand, he could not prosecute Allen.
                    </p>

              No, Mia Farrow found naked pictures of her in his drawer when she was very young. For starters. Not sure what your motive here is. And she was his daughter figure, so that is incest.
