<p>WAS JEFFREY EPSTEIN &quot;GOOGLED?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Google life sciences spinout Verily is partnering up with British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline for a spinout venture focused on bioelectronic devices. Bioelectronic medicine is a new scientific discipline that seeks to treat a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, asthma, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease by using miniature devices implanted in the body that are able to modify the electrical signals of nerves in the body. &quot;</p>

<p>WELLCOME TRUST</p>
<p>&quot;The Trust was established to administer the fortune of the American-born pharmaceutical magnate Sir Henry Wellcome.[7] Its income was derived from what was originally called Burroughs Wellcome, later renamed in the UK as the Wellcome Foundation Ltd.[8] In 1986, the trust sold 25% of Wellcome plc stock to the public. Overseen by incoming Director of Finance Ian Macgregor, this marked the beginning of a period of financial growth that saw the Trust\'s value increase by almost £14bn in 14 years, as their interests moved beyond the bounds of the pharmaceutical industry.[9]</p>
<p>In 1995, the trust divested itself of any interest in pharmaceuticals by selling all remaining stock to Glaxo plc, the company\'s historic British rival, creating GlaxoWellcome plc. In 2000, the Wellcome name disappeared from the drug business altogether when GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham, to form GlaxoSmithKline plc.&quot;</p>

<p>TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE</p>
<p>The archive of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was gifted to the Wellcome Trust in 2015. Characterised by a broad and complex psycho-socio-cultural and health coverage, the Tavistock Institute’s archive fits comfortably within the Wellcome Library’s collecting policy and there has already been significant researcher interest in the collection.  It is now one of the Wellcome Library’s 700-plus archive collections which also include the papers of Francis Crick, The Family Planning Association, Marie Stopes, Melanie Klein, National Childbirth Trust, Donald Winnicott and The Mental Aftercare Association, to name but a very few.&quot;</p>

             "Evidence that members of Comet Ping Pong's inner circle are working for organized crime ring located in the City of London, primarily consisting of a medical institution called the Wellcome Trust. Evidence suggests Wellcome is the primary engine of the elusive 'Tavistock' program that has been fodder for conspiracy theorists for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
             The connections also reveal that Comet Ping Pong's James Alefantis and company use contemporary art and occult rituals to further the goals of this ring, which is loosely supported by American, British intelligence, along with the oligarchic Rockefeller and Rothschild families."

             "Lady Diana's favorite London SERPENTINE GALLERY is a good one. Former NY City mayor Michael Bloomberg was on the board of directors along with a Rothschild. Features disgusting "modern" art. Also hosted a Marina Abramovic "performance art".

             "September 26, 2013, 11:57 AM EDT New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be the next chairman of the Serpentine Gallery, a London arts institution, taking the post after his mayoral term ends."
             <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-26/mayor-bloomberg-to-chair-london-s-serpentine-gallery">
              https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-26/mayor-bloomberg-to-chair-london-s-serpentine-gallery

             "Bloomberg reports that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will chair the Serpentine Gallery in London, the exhibition space run by Julia Peyton-Jones and Hans Ulrich Obstrist. The news, which was announced at a Serpentine dinner on Sept. 24, suggests, as has been rumored, that Mayor Bloomberg plans to spend a fairly significant amount of time in the U.K. after his mayoralty ends Dec. 31.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mayor Bloomberg had previously served on the board of the Serpentine, and it sounds like he was a pretty good board member, if this excerpt from a 2002 New York magazine article is to be believed (though note that the the Serpentine does not actually deal art, as it suggests):
            </p>
            <p>
             Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine Gallery, an avant-garde art dealer located in the glorious middle of Hyde Park, was intrigued to receive an invitation to a Bloomberg soirée at Sir Terence Conran’s Bluebird restaurant. Curiosity turned into delight when she found herself seated next to the host.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I found him absolutely hilarious and extremely endearing,” Peyton-Jones says. “He was completely irreverent and talked about the arts in a very straightforward way.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Flattered by his interest, Peyton-Jones did a most un-English thing: She screwed up her courage and asked him for money directly. The check Bloomberg wrote for £250,000 got him a seat on the Serpentine’s board alongside one of the city’s social lions, Lord Jacob Rothschild. “He missed very few meetings,” says Peyton-Jones. “His dedication was remarkable.”"
