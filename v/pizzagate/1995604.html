            I have not posted here before although the hashtag of #whitemorefarm hit my feed.
In there I found the above link, also here -

            What I learned through my years of studying people and the "bad" things they do - we live our lives intermixing the normal and our darkness.  Over time, those lines become blurred, and at times some go into the "full deep end" and that is when people are arrested, hit bottom, die, or get killed. Nobody says "I am going to cheat on my husband".  What they do say is "I am not happy" "That guy is sweet to me" which then descends into "I am grabbing a bite with 'friends' " and then "I have to work late" and you see the pattern - lies to cover selfish and knowingly destructive behavior.  Rarely does someone say, at least not prior to life-wrecking failure, "I am a slut looking to bang married guys".  People continue to lie to themselves yet at the same time they must hint, signal, and flag their speech, actions, activities, and clothing to remain part of their other world.  Sometimes their signaling is 5% if they can manage their demons.  If they cannot - signaling increases to 49%.  Think about the functional alcoholics.  They do not drink 100% of the time. Maybe once a week or maybe once a month.  In a safe place - where they cannot be discovered - they drink until they black out. Shame, guilt, misery overtake them and they are sober for another few weeks. I am like that and that is why I cannot drink more than one beer. If I were ever to lose that discipline - I could easily go full blackout for days a week. Lose the job? Downward spiral. I quit at one now. That demon will forever haunt me. Check my feed and you will see I like beer companies. Hang out at those places. This entire pizzagate thing has been about connecting the dots without "hard" evidence.  Most bad guys are part timers. The guys in jail went full downward spiral into criminals. Most will entertain a demon but not turn over their will and can deny to those unable to connect the dots.

            Look at the link's Dec 2015 and you'll see what appears to be babies for sale. Other hashtags which could be followed.

             Good post, but you're conflating average Joes with the "elites."
            </p>
            <p>
             The "elites" were raised to be this way by their "elite" families, attended "elite" schools that reinforced it, joined "elite" secret societies, etc. It is a way of life for them and is intergenerational.
