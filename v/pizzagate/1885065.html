            Here's a post I made yesterday looking at Joe Capone's fb posts surrounding the days of SR.  Includes some interesting connections of Joe's too -

            Dear ReddittRefugee and fellow Voaters: Can someone find a link on the bar owner and a pic of he or the bar in question? The pics and vids outing them seems to send them into a tizzy. They are fine until they no longer have the anonymity of the rock to hide under!

             I wouldn't say Capone has been hiding. He agreed to be interviewed on a local news station.

            Could be why he wasn't interviewed by the police. They just asked Obama what happened that night, and the ex-Prez told them what part Capone played that night. He could have even handed them the script everyone was working from in case they lost their own copy. Narrative, peoples ... stick to the narrative.

              Yeah, well, he's beyond that sort of thing ... King of the Cannibals and Cannibal Kings don't sweat shit. They just play ping pong and eat pizza for about an hour ... and sometimes share.

            George Webb met him and said he trusted him, but the stories do not match the police report, when George met the owner he said that he never put seth into a cab, in fact he was out of town the week of the murder.  So something is really wrong here.

             It was the bar manager, not the owner, that saw Seth on the night of his murder.
            </p>
            <p>
             It does seem extremely suspicious that the owner decided to be out of town that night though considering his meeting at the White House so soon before.

             I have been trying to find this out, but have not found it yet.  Hugh Rodham was rumored to have been involved with some mob characters .  I still have a suspicion that he may still be connected to the mob.  They are reported to have infiltrated DC.
