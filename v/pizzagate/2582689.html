The skull can be seen in the video further in. (at 23:40)</p>
<p>This has relevance to PizzaGate, due to the source of people trafficked by the elite and others. Where Cemex could be a big player due to the money the Elite has put in it. Cemex being a donor to HRC and a possible child sex camp was found on their property.
The body does not necessary tie to human traffickers as said in the video. But could &quot;just&quot; be a killer. But it\'s still a child skull composing non the less.</p>

            So many folks claiming this story is fake and a scam. WHY would Lewis implore for people to come down and search if it were? I mean wouldn't anyone coming down witness it being 'fake' if it were? Typically scammers don't share their profits with strangers and demand boots on the ground in a hot desert.

            I became left-ugee during election cycle...but these people. Wow! So it's easily debunked by looking only at local news sources that confirm your hypothesis and stating that migrant deaths in the desert are "sadly" (sad face emoji) common. Did the bleeding heart liberals just tell us to fuck off b/c nothing to see here? ...JUST another dead immigrant ; No need  to investigate further!!! Just a dead brown person, non-item. I was going independent - libertarian...might go full Republican just to spite you self-righteous, racist a-holes. At least the racists on Voat know they're racist! F'n hypocrites. Sorry so ranty. Don't know where else to deal with this.

             You're awake to it now. No going back. A brave step, freeing yourself from the thought control and brainwashing. My wife is still in her shell, doesn't know the significance of the Steele dossier. She's adamant she's right, my judgement is flawed looking at all this insane stuff on the web. It's not worth looking into. Trump's guilty and a horrid racist too. I've tried several times to help her...

            much). We found a child's skull yesterday and the media are calling it an adult. There was still soft, wet tissue inside the head where it was severed from the spine. Had to be recent for any moisture to be there in this desert dry heat.

            Oh, wow....This is getting serious. We are going to need more info on this about what is done with the skull, testing, some kind of official confirmation. Notice the authorities don't want to help. Anybody surprised? At what point do these individuals get push back?

            I decided to look up decomposistion rates to try to triangulate thr approximate time of death for the body.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the child's time of death was less than 3 months ago, for that is the time at which mummification occurs. In a hot environment, the smell of death can form in less than 24 hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can find the time at which the smell disappears, it's possible to establish an end point to the approximation.

             Best Thanksgiving was when I was going fishing and hit that turkey. Best gator was when I saw that van in front of me run a 4 footer's head in the middle of the road. I threw him in the trunk, and turned around before I ever wet my line. Roadkill is better than hunted as long as the intestinal tract is not ruptured. Reason it is better is that it is closer to the vehicle thus closer to the kitchen at home. Keep up the good work.

            I'm convinced the bastards are trafficking children around the border, we all know that is true. Some of the claims the guy from VOP made though just don't seem true. For example:
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            People have described the "restraints" as being child size and height from the ground. That just ain't true and this picture proves it. This is a grown man standing next to it and it is head level. Also they are different heights and turned different ways.

           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            If a person was going to make some restraints they would probably make both of them the same way. Turned the same way and at the same height. That looks awkward as hell to be restraints. If they were for children they would also probably be closer to the ground maybe.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Considering they are turned different ways and at different heights it looks like they were either put up at different times and or for different purposes and it looks like both sides are nailed to the tree which would leave no way to tighten them. These things are big enough to stick a whole leg through too. Too big for wrists.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            One is turned vertically. That could easily be for sticking a pole through to be attached to the main structure. A way to build an outcrop and extend the camp. If these are restraints its the worst attempt I can think of to make restraints.

              I know they hang kids up. I just think the meth head VOP guy is jumping to conclusions. Maybe its just me but I see those damn "wrist restraints" as a functional item for the camp. I think they are for sticking poles through to make a tent frame structure. Then you stretch a tarp over the frame. That is what my eye sees as most likely. Loops too big and can't be adjusted. Rope works wonders, those big ass loops? nahhhhhh Not functional as wrist restraints. A smart person would just use rope because those loops cannot be adjusted to fit a wrist.

             Kind of agree, but in their art the child is always hanging from straps, not standing. Don't know about your logic. They don't worry about the child's comfort, they hang them at their own level most likely, or do you think they like to bend down to the childs level? You are sloppy today, but I respect you...for now.

              i thought about the hanging aspect, but if a person wanted to make some restraints that was a really shitty way to do it. Good old fashioned rope would be a lot easier. Those huge loops would also require some rope to be functional and then the loops would be unnecessary because the rope would be doing all the work. I do not believe those are restraints. If I stick a person's wrist in there I still have to tie their wrist to the damn tree, then I can just cut the "restraints" because they ain't doing jack shit anyway.

               Hey, for all we know, we are being trolled. But you are dismissing this on reasoning that I cannot run with. I'm am not going to back and forth about the art of tying wrist and width of restraints. An odd amount of minutia you drag out for your reasoning. Carmenicita is also very bothered by this, which is curious to me. She commented about the horror of children possibly being molested on pictures that were as focuses as ink blots, now she is trying to halt the train? Im not liking either of you very much at the moment. A response from either of you that would be ok is, if it seems to good to be true, it probably is, need more updates. But no, you have come up with restraint width, height objections and somebody else about skull not being dirty, it was, and she has not been her agreeing as always no matter what self. I will be watching both of you closer then the known shills. They are harmless hacks. You two were about the only ones left. I worry not about allies. Don't screw up.

                I don't take people seriously that talk to GOD as much as this VOP guys does. If you want to see his "scientific" method for finding child traffickers go to 47 minutes. He finds a building that is probably a waypoint on the illegal immigrant highway and immediately brands it as a "place where children are being held." Later at 1:19 his secret method is revealed, GOD TOLD HIM.

                The desert is a tough place to survive. I would imagine that illegal immigrants, dope smugglers, and child traffickers are using a lot of the same trails and waypoints to rest, get out of the Sun, restock with water, get out of the rain, etc...There is an enormous amount of trash, clothes, kids stuff, etc....at a lot of these places.

                No doubt there is some terrible shit happening out in that desert, but, I have watched about 30 videos from this whackadoodle meth head VOP guy and I am not impressed with him. I think he is finally getting some recognition in his drug ridden life, his 15 minutes of fame, tons of donations, and he is milking it for all its worth.

                Sometimes he gets that "crazy eyes" wide eyed look like a meth head and rants about God on and on and on. He is a fucking nut case. That don't mean he is totally wrong about everything, but his ass ain't stable from one day to the next. Some days he seems normal, next day a fucking maniac. He has not "discovered" shit. Its been going on in the desert for two hundred years. He just found himself a way to garner attention.

            Craig Sawyer is a professional.  I've seen the bullshit out there about him.  Anything is possible, but I'd put it in the 3% chance this is anything remotely close to a LARP.  There would be outtakes, jokes, some levity, some lack of professionalism caught in the videos, in the writing, or the reporting.  Sawyer is a member of the Pipehitters Club (SOF).  He's fully vetted and not a fraud.

            I worked in the region from Tuscon, down to Bisbee and Sierra Vista.  All the way up to the border.  People die out there.  We had strict protocols on travel, contact and ROE, etc.  Not to mention food/water/med stocked.  This isn't Sahara desert.  This is high chaparral @ 3-5,000'.  Bodies dessicate very fast.  Carrion-feeders also make fast work of a body.

            Human traffickers get paid when they deliver the final product.  It's in their best interest to keep bodies alive.  Chances are the bodies, if of children (look at skull size versus boot) were from ones that died or were too sick to travel on.  The hair dye, airplane ticket, the comb and blonde hair, and American toy are very telling.  No one is dyeing a Salvadoran kid's hair.  They are snatching the highly prized white kids.  Or Euro descent.

            Could be a LARP. The people behind this can't be trusted. Why trust them? Why aren't some of them diverting resources to protesting outside of the WalMart in Texas where children are being held, and even a Senator can't get in to check on them? Why is no one even talking about that?

              I think we can trust Sawyer to go about knee deep into this, like Jones. They’ll talk about trafficking. They’ll crack pedo skulls and interview whistleblowers for ratings. They won’t mention tha cabal though.
             </p>
             <p>
              So far, I think we can trust Sawyer’s report here, but he’s got a leash that goes back to AJ.

              I don't agree here. Imo he's fishy. I don't trust him. That said, when the VOP are based in Tuscon, it would be natural to do their work there, wouldn't it?

              We just need many people vetting different sites/leads. And yes, we should continue to looking into the Walmart story.

               I'm starting to change my mind somewhat.  More is needed to be known here.  I'm suffering from some cognitive dissonance and information overload.  Too much information to process + work + life.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hate the fact that I am having to retract some things, but the psyops are getting very sophisticated.  I'm starting to think that one of the two narratives is false CEMEX/Sawyer or Wal-Mart.

                I haven't had time to really dig into either one of them to watch body language etc., but my current bet is WalMart is disinfo, Sawyer is legit.

                did some vetting of Sawyer when he first got involved in Pizzagate. He is genuinely trying to help the kids.

                Also, when he first got involved, there was a massive shill attack brigade that spammed every thread about him, produced multiple smear threads trying to discredit him, etc. The same shit they did to

                 Have you read the current thread about CS, Vin? It pretty much sums up what I've always thought about him. Plus my gut feeling / spider senses are always alerted when I watch him.

                <p>
                 When Honeybee_ has a different opinion - for reasons whatsoever - ok, but I'd rather trust my own vetting.

                <p>
                 TL;DR: Even when someone is smeared by the wrong people, he can still be fishy. That's not mutually exclusive I'm afraid.

                I admit that I haven't look into the WalMart story properly, only read the recent thread about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                What simply doesn't add up re the Cemex/Sawyer story is the still activity on the sub. LOL. But I'm not kidding.
               </p>
               <p>
                All resident shills that went
                <em>
                 totally mad
                </em>
                when we looked into Rachel Chandler and Maggie Nixon have not only been peaceful (one didn't even show up), they even
                <em>
                 contributed
                </em>
                to the Cemex research.
                <em>
                 All of them.
                </em>
                (Ok, maybe apart from AWS.)
               </p>
               <p>
                That's highly suspicious. Not saying that a company that donated to the CF, that is based in Mexico etc. isn't fishy.
               </p>
               <p>
                But something is not adding up here.

                 Yeah, something isn't adding up.  I detest the idea that a SEAL, especially a 6 guy, could be involved this deeply with a Deep State LARP.   Not like anyone I know.

                  There are more and more stories where I don't take sides. Trying to take be open to all possibilities. Like the story about the guy who shot six people.

                  Maybe he was 'just' a violent guy with a history of domestic violence.

                 <p>
                  Maybe it was a set-up.

                 <p>
                  Maybe both stories are true - he was violent,
                  <em>
                   and
                  </em>
                  his wife has been involved in something sinister.

             Any flesh on a human skull in the desert would mean fresh or mummified. That did not look mummified.This is not a wasteful environment, and most things look for food at night.

               Without proper forensics? Border towns are not known for that. I am an outdoorsman, and from what I saw from the extremely grainy video, that looked like flesh attached. It does not matter who is right in that argument inasmuch as the fact that something is not good here. By here, I mean out in the desert border, and possibly right here on our board. If anyone is disturbed by this, then they can comfort themselves by knowing, that is the way you are supposed to feel.

            Yeah, I just posted on VOP and the disinfo shills coming out of the woodwork. This has to be huge because these shills are doxxing themselves to control this narrative.

            I read a comment last night on a forum. It goes like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            If the entire population knew the truth, 99% would wind up in the hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought about this comment for quite some time in relation to just the USA and the after-effects if a massive and intense truth storm occurred.

POTUS is our savior."

            <p>
             "The complete picture would put 99% of Americans (the World) in a hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             The world, and our own elites, are far more evil and degenerate than we may imagine. Their corruption is overwhelming and they have worked against the interests of the USA including treason."

            . It's cartel territory, so its unfortunately probably expected to find human remains, but to me it doesn't necessarily lend credibility to the child trafficking camp stuff.

             Not trying to down the theory on the camp, just trying to make sure we cover all bases.

             There have been mass graves found and some say they may be killed by cartels.  So what I am saying is that we need to cover ourselves.  It does happen in the dessert.  BUT there is also a chance that this could be what we have been thinking, a trafficking camp.

              Clearly you have been trying to down this from your first response. Scroll up. EsotericShade just made a ridiculous post that the straps were too high for a child, when we know they have images  hanging children form up high, their feet not touching the ground. You two are having a really really bad day. You are both under heavy scrutiny from this point forward.

               I have said over and over that the camp could be a reality.  All I am saying is that things can be arranged and planted.  We need more evidence and research.  When this first broke I pointed out that it pointed to a trafficking site because the camp let to the back of the hotel.

                Sure, but I am noticing you have been quick to validate things that were sketchy, like ultra blurry photos where you said you saw abuse. I do not forget bullshit, and my objective is always to find the moles. This is the first time I EVER saw you aggressively downplaying something. I make note of these things. You also mentioned the Truth Project and used the word "We" when talking about it. I feel most these sites are gatekeeping, although I admit I have no specific amunition about that site.

               These points are being ignored..

              <p>
               VOP see homeless camps all day all year it's their job, they know homeless camps..
              </p>
              <p>
               Homeless people don't camp that far from services like WATER etc.

               The comment about the restraints isn't thought through, because you would not just use the restraints alone but would also use handcuffs, or zip ties etc, also the picture he is using doesn't show the ground. When he showed them on video it was much lower. And also if you were restraining someone to do horrible things their hands would be elevated not low to the ground.
              </p>
              <p>
               They also found lots of dark hair dyes, this leads to believe they were disguising people that are blonde as having brown hair.  Think about that, why would they do such a thing? Think hard because I came up with a very good reason if you're trafficking children or even women.

            A growing portion of the public are finding out the the government is lying and protecting child traffickers.

            The dollar is going to get fucked. Because it's being propped up anyway and once the American people turn on the ruling government The currency wars will begin! Currencies are falling apart already in Italy it's going to help bring down the euro cad and dollar. The fiat system of the west is doomed!

             Wrong, the dollar is manipulated and cannot get fucked. The worlds central banks are owned by different combinations of the same 40 or so elite families, the head of which are Rothschild. They can trade in the money they print for any currency. They aren't even spending money when they do it, just holding it in another currency. They all trade their local currencies for dollars simultaneously whenever needed, propping the dollar back up. You aren't aware that all markets are rigged? Watch the dollar vs all currencies simultaneously...they move in unison.

              The point is they will break the dollar to stop the people from rising against them. Much like the printing of continental dollars, destroying the economy is part of war.

             Are you talking about Clif High? I used to listen to him a lot, but somehow forgot about keeping up with him. If this is who you're talking about, send a link please to where he's talking about this. I'm very interested.

              Ughhh that would be tough to find. It's within the past 9 months, an interview on youtube, maybe with crypt0, I think he has more than 1 interview with him. it's not on his channel I do not think. however there is a plethora of fake copy cat channels that copy his stuff, so look for view count and channel subscribers and actual original content. probably mid dec to 1st q. 2018 I think it was before btc hit 20k.

               No worries, and thanks for letting me know it is Clif High and that it was a recent prediction. His work is so fascinating! I'll have to start following him again. Very smart guy.

            There are probably thousands of human skulls and some of them children (tears) out in the dessert.  Since this property belongs to Cemex and they have Cartel connections, a skull is expected evidence.  But where did it come from?  Did it belong to immigrants crossing the boarder?  Did some MS-13 members kill some more people? Yes, they kill children too, even though some of them are not far from that age.  Too many unanswered questions as usual.  Cemex and the Cabal are not to be trusted.

              No not downplaying just saying before we go whole hog on this we should look at all evidence.  Also that we are targets of the elite cabal.  Right now I am sitting on the fence.  Just waiting til all is looked at.  With items being found, yes they can certainly point to child trafficking, but again, they can also be placed there as fake evidence.  Not faulting VOP but possibly others.

             It could also have been planted by an over-enthusiastic VOP member to create news, or bad guys looking to discredit VOP with evidence that would backfire on them somehow, or a prankster from an anthropology lab who is trolling everyone.

             In the pics that I've seen the skull was clean and sitting out in the open, which is suspicious. That's what you get when you carry a skull into a site and set it down. I didn't see any signs of them having dug it up or brushed dirt off of it.

              It looked clean? I am not an expert on finding skulls as you seam to be, but it looked like it had sediment on it. Tell us, what the average found skull should look like in the dirt? Some odd expertise in this forum about this subject.

              It was kicked from out under a  bush to see what kind of bone it was if I understand correctly. Their theory is it was from a shallow grave and an animal dug it up, which is plausible.

              Oh you are so smart.  There are so many out there ready to discredit those that want to do good or especially our cause.  Cemex has many at their disposal that are connected to MS 13 and other goons. I was and am still hoping that this camp is the Real McCoy.  I have seen a lot though in the almost yr and a half on here, so need to be cautious.

               You are gung-ho, until possible credible evidence is presented, then you get semi aggressive. Keep talking, I want to hear more how much this bothers you.

              Yes, that is true.  But those things can all be planted.  I am just saying we need to be careful.  AND yes, I am also saying it could still be a  trafficking camp, just need to tread carefully.

                If this is fake and we take the reality trap, we will be stamped as disinfo.  Totally discrediting us and our cause.  We have made so much progress.  They would love to take us down like they did with the CPP shoot up.  Yes, horrid either way if true.

                 Last time I checked, we knew that they were trafficking a lot of the children from crossing the border, so how is this different then what we are following? The illegal immigrants are faceless, and not on record, so this makes total sense. You should know that, but you chose not to be logical, all of the sudden.

             Bodies of illegals are routinely found out in the desert.  For example:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3760805/Bodies-850-unidentified-people-died-crossing-border-Arizona-remain-one-morgue.html">
              http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3760805/Bodies-850-unidentified-people-died-crossing-border-Arizona-remain-one-morgue.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure the bodies found are only a fraction of those that are actually out there.  Even locals (legal citizens) who die on hikes or camping are sometimes never located.  My dad found a couple of bodies himself during javelina hunts back in the 70s.  I have friends who have encountered really weird camps out there.  The desert can kill you in under a day this time of year.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I've said before in regards to this Tucson issue, I am 100% sure that there is a certain amount of child trafficking for the purposes of sex slavery (as opposed to kids who are smuggled in with their families).  Hell, my mom used to scare us with those stories when I was a kid.  However, I'm not convinced that the one VOP discovery, or this child's body, is necessarily linked to child sex trafficking.  If it is, it's not necessarily connected to some kind of Rothschild cabal operating out of Tucson.  The stuff with incredibly common logos and the Gem and Mineral Show an intentional front for selling kids is a bit out there.  Tucson is a major corridor for human smuggling, so situating a child trafficking pipeline within that makes sense, but the coyotes do a fine job of all that on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             The most likely scenario is that this kid died during a desert crossing and the family was forced by the coyotes to leave the body behind.

              Hold on with your theories until you read the history of the Spanish in Mexico, and how they remained in control well after the so- called revolution. Endless wars is a great condensed book for those with little time. As for Cemex, In 1992, CEMEX began its push into the international landscape with the purchase of Spain's two largest cement companies, Valenciana de Cementos (Valcem, currently head of CEMEX Spain) and Cementos SANSON. Venezuela's largest cement company, VENCEMOS, was acquired by CEMEX in 1994, and plants were purchased the same year in the United States and in Panama. In 1995 CEMEX acquired a cement company in the Dominican Republic, and with the purchase of a majority stake in a Colombian cement company in 1996, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In 1997-1999, the company expanded its scope to include Asia and Africa, making major purchases in the Philippines, Indonesia and Egypt, as well as Costa Rica. The acquisition of U.S. based Southdown made CEMEX the largest cement company in North America, and further international purchases were made in the following two years—a Thai company in 2001, and in 2002, a Puerto Rican company. All the hot spots. Maybe communism actually still fails just like it always has in the end, and Venezuela was a really bad investment with quadruple negative return per quarter day. What makes immediate cash? Desperation of the extremely rich and ruthless is where my money trail is going.

              I so agree and it is all so very sad.  I am hoping that this story about the camp is true, for it would provide more evidence for our cause.  What I am trying to say though is that we have been stiffed before and we need to tread carefully.  I commend the guy that found the camp, whether he is a veteran or not.  He seems to have helped the homeless and that is honorable.

                <p>
                 No OUTRAGE in 2014-15.  NONE!  I was in AZ 2015. Obama referred to 48,ooo undocumented children along the border as "Congressional Gridlock" &amp; "an Immigration issue" 
Everyone stayed comfortably asleep. 
Don't worry not expecting much of any other suggestion from you. I've seen the depths of your "thinking"

              OH she is in a bubble for sure. She just tells me the usual crap “everything can’t be a conspiracy” or complains that it’s too heavy for her to think about. Sure as long as you are happy you can continue to safely virtue signal from the safety of your phone. The shit is infuriating

               Well this the thing about human smuggling; it doesn't have to be a conspiracy to be true.  Factually, it's a very real problem that goes on all over the world.  Human smuggling is modern-day slavery, and it's usually done for either labor purposes or the sex trade.
              </p>
              <p>
               A certain percentage of sick fucks out there want to fuck little kids and will pay money for it, which means there are children who are smuggled into this country in order to populate whorehouses.  People supply that demand.  Anybody who can find, sell, or exploit children for sex can do just about anything else to those kids; hit them, mutilate them, get them hooked on drugs in order to control them, or kill them and dump their bodies in the desert.  These are all things that happen, both to foreign children and US kids.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is all factual stuff you can find plenty of sources on to talk to your wife about.  You don't have to bring up the Pizzagate angle at all.  The scariest thing about it, IMO, is that you don't need some global conspiracy.  It's a market that demands supply, and there are people who are willing to provide that supply.  It's literally a trade, no different in basic economic principle from, IDK, soybeans or cars.

                 I'm just messing with you bro.  Been married 19 and while it ain't easy, I love my wife more than anything (well maybe I love my dog as much).  Looks fade, bodies change but hearts are what they are in my estimation.  She has a heart of gold and that means the world to me, miserable-fag that I am.

                   This 41 year old veteran was murdered by the criminals they then pushed Kagan, Meyer and the whole group out too much heat on the rampant street crime and homeless population. This group was not a militia and Meyer was a Volunteer. We played them they are sperging.
