            This is very important!! It goes back to fbianon first post from last year when he told us to "follow the cards" and it will lead to the downfall of the corruption in the DNC.  It looks to me like the most obvious possibilty of "cards", or at least it needs further research. Someone who can download and search this holiday card file written by Seth rich needs to get on this. We need to know when the file was born, was there other contributors to his work?  This is going to get buried and lost.
           </p>
           <p>
            Commoner can you retitle and repost to refer to fbianon ?? This needs more attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we do conclude this is the cards fbianon spoke of, how did he know Seth rich made a file titled holiday cards? Was FBI Anon Seth rich? Or were they working together?

            Cards are something used to recruit members - or unionize a workplace.  Unions hand them out to workers and they sign them in support of unionizing a workplace.  As I understand it.  I must confess, I don't see their relevance here, just throw it in.

             From my understanding, DC uses the 3 largest Unions as their muscle to get people to cooperate.  SEIU, AFSCME &amp; IBEW.  They will use any means necessary, including compromising pols with child porn to get them to fall in line &amp; follow the rules as they were written by the Clinton camp.  This election was rigged &amp; the card carriers were the muscle behind keeping everyone quiet.  Those who didn't comply were Arkancided. In return the pols make sure that the unions are kept happy with generous wages, benefits &amp; perks.

              The way I understand it is -- the leadership of the unions came out to support Hillary, but the working members themselves objected to this and came out in favor of Bernie. So, like we have seen -- people are put in power who will serve the needs of the power structures. Clinton/Bush/CIA/Mafia all connected and have been at it for decades.

            What actually happened was they just unregistered Bernie voters, after the breach of the voter roll firewall, by the millions. There was a documented number of 160,000 in Brooklyn alone. This other theory is way too complicated and has so many moving parts when we saw many many reports of Bernie voters having been taken off the rolls or reregistered as Republicans. 60 year old always-been-Dems to freakin Bernie Caucus Delegates were affected.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were then forced onto a provisional ballot that wasn't even counted or struck down after being challenged.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF YOU WANT TO TRIP HILLARY UP ON THIS, THIS IS THE REAL WAY IT WENT DOWN.

            Wow, that's crazy stuff!! Good find!

            "The directory Holiday cards contain key files you need to see. It is the Seth Rich directory where he gave that name to the directory to hide its importance. It is more important then the stuff for Mike folder, as it exposes the key files which expose the crimes of the DNC."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is from pg5 by a poster named globalintel.
My first thought, how did fbianon know - almost a year ago - to tell us "follow the cards". Was fbianon Seth rich? Or working with Seth rich? Of all the card references been considered, this one has the most potential.

            EVERY POTUS "election" -- since the 1789 "election" of George Washington -- has been "won" by the candidate who had more royal BLOODlines.  This is GENEALOGY-directed, GENEALOGY-based.  That is 100%, with ZERO deviation.  Documented by the unimpeachable genealogy house of England, Burke's Peerage, who does genealogy for Buckingham Palace.

            TPTB choose our presidents, not us.  Slaves have NEVER elected the President.

            Those of you who shoot the messenger because you don't like the message, go ahead and downvoat.  But Trump and Hillary are royal COUSINS.

            ALL POTUSes have been of three major royal bloodlines, two English and one French.
           </p>
           <p>
            This "election fraud":BS is just that -- BS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is a crypto Jew of royal BLOODlines and an Illuminatus -- like EVERY POTUS before him.  He has more royal BLOODlines than Hitlery, which is why he "won" the election.
           </p>
           <p>
            This Seth Rich story is bullshit for the sheeple's consumption.  It reinforces the MYTH that our elections are legit and "Your Vote Counts."

             Equineluvr I always like to read your comments. You do piss people off with your point of view, but obviously you're well read and researched on the subject of this corrupted world, so you're bigoted comments  may indeed be truth. But you're so far ahead of me in researching this stuff that I haven't learned yet the things you already know. But I always learn something from you.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this particular instance you say this Seth rich story is to reinforce the myth our elections are real.  That comment alone resonates with me and it is making all the other stuff fall into place. The coincidences with all the pandas, the fact that his GFS last name is Mulka (seriously?),  Fbianon saying watch for cards then Seth rich having the downfall data file called cards.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is starting to look like well thought out fiction for the exact reason you stated.

            Seth Rich was a DNC insider who saw Hillary steal the election from Burny Sanders and set-up alternative polling stations in all states, only for Hillary voters, while Republicans voted as separate locations. The DNC set up a program linked to distributed servers, via a proprietary voter system which allowed it to have access to all state voter data, market their campaigns, and use all the resources of the DNC to first elect Obama, and then next, to try to put Hillary into office!***There was a post about something someone named Claudia Kash (supposedly Seth's GF) said about the alternative polls. Quite a few people knocked it down and said it was fake or bogus. After being through what I did last year, being a Bernie Girl, let me tell you this is not beyond the power of the Clintons or the DNC.  This is highly doable.  There are people all over the country of all stripes, that were doing their bidding.  Including Republicans.  They pay well.

             This is what I love, rabid Bernie supporters. I loved you during the election process.  Y'all caused heartburn to the pathetic HRC voters. I prayed everyday Bernie would just suffocate her in votes. Too bad she stole Bern's well deserved primary win. Make her feel the Bern now. Never settle for less when your candidate was cheated out of victory.

              I have always been in favor of the voter's rights, no matter what party.  It is our inherited rights as Americans. We are not done.  She needs to pay for what she did. And the others must go with her.

              That's what I don't get. We all went to our regular polling stations here, but we do have early voting and ballots by mail. Most are now cast by mail. The facility has ballot printing machines inside that we're not allowed before early voting and they are there to print ballots by demand. We got a new windowless huge buildings to for this entire operation. Fraud is in the vote by mail  and ballots can be printed and marked to replace Hillary votes that came in the mail.

              Didn't they say that the second "Hillary only" poling stations' locations were only available from her website?   If you went to the DNC site you got the correct list, but if you went to HRC website to find your poling station you got sucked into her scam.

              How the heck do I know how she did that?  That is Election Fraud that she committed.  This is illegal stuff.  AFAIK it has never been done before.  We are just finding out about this.  Stop asking trick questions. Dufus.

                Amen.  To believe that people that are controlling rat lines, organ harvesting, human trafficking and drug running can't run an illegal election, that is beyond my understanding.  But then we know that they don't believe in those things either.  They will come back and fight tooth and nail against things we all are smart enough to figure out.  Because they are with them.

                But it sure sucks once those people who were outmaneuvered find out about the scam pulled over on them and they decide to stay home in the general election.  But, hey, she can blame the Russians after she loses, right?  And her team can take pride in their great plan to outmaneuver the dummies.

               It's not a trick question.  You claimed to understand how election are run in the United States.  You claimed the scheme was highly doable.

And the answer is she didn't do it.  It never happened.  It's another myth you bought into.

               Elections are not run by the parties.  They are not run by the candidates.  They are run by the State Board of election and at the local level they are run by Precinct Election Officers.   How you get the idea that this insanely complicated and risky scheme can be pulled off, I have no idea.   A small city like Alexandria, VA has about 500 Precinct Election Officers for a presidential election so that is 500 people, you need to worry about when you try to pull off your scheme, just in one tiny city.  If they are part of your scheme, you need to worry about them talking.  If they are not, that 500 people who are  going to be there all day on election day and you somehow need to get your scheme past them.  Multiply this across the whole state and then other states, it tens of thousands of people you need to pull this off.
              </p>
              <p>
               And Let's say you set up fake Hillary only voting places?    What do you do with your vote totals?   How do you turn in votes from phony voting places?   The State Board of Elections would know exactly how many precincts they have and who is responsible for tallying the votes up.   Do you think that anyone can just call in vote totals?

                Yes, they have the money and the power to buy people everywhere.  When Bill Clinton goes into a polling place (after yelling out in the parking lot with his Bull l Horn) and has his picture taken with the Mayor of Bedford Mass.  when it is against the law, tell me they can't get away with what ever they want.  When they were able to control the AP so that they announced the totals on the East Coast and that affected voting in Cal. then tell me they do not have the power to get whatever they want.  In Cal. Michael Vu did is dirty deeds just as he did in Ohio.  That is why he was sent there after committing Election Fraud in Ohio.  He did not go to jail but his people did. By the way none of this is MY Scheme.  How do I know how she did it?  Her plan surely looked like the map of her ratlines.   I am done with you, as usual you are a waste of time.

                 If they have that money and power, why bother to set up fake polling places at all? Why not just turn in the fake vote totals? And more to the point, why not turn in enough fake votes to, you know,

                totally agree!! this scam could ~maybe~ be pulled off in a couple larger cities or dnc heavy territories.... which if one recalls, the dnc apparatus funding had actually shrunk considerably during the Obama years... no way this could happen in enough places to effect the real vote...it's a primary scam if it's even possible, not one for the general election... most notably, requiring waaay too many insiders to be feasible, each 'fake' poll site would need someone to carry the hrc votes and to perform the switch... as noted this would require a great number of people to pull off in more than 1 or 2 cities.

            Folks.  Just Please stop calling it Voter Fraud when it is ELECTION FRAUD.   It is Voter Fraud when it is committed by the public.  ELECTION FRAUD  when it is committed by the Govt.  I am sorry, but I have been involved with voting and elections for years and it is one of my pet peeves. I have researched voting machines, exit polls, you name it. When we get it wrong, people tell others that there is rampant Voter Fraud, and there is not.  There is Rampant ELECTION FRAUD. Thanks Guys.

              Thanks for the Back Up.  RweSure has been after me.  I could have gone further but I will not dox myself at the expense of losing my right to help and defend our children.  Not at the expense of someone that is getting paid to strike us down. No.
