Scheve) lived at 7292 Finns Ln. He was the Business Manager of the New Hope Academy (7009 Varnum Street, Hiattsville, MD) which is associated with the Unification Church (AKA Moonies).</p>
<p>There is a theory that the children are being kept arround the areas of Finns Ln and Varum Street (near the New Hope Academy) from following post (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085)</a>)</p>
<p>An interesting post came up when another researcher was digging deeper into 7292 Finns Ln, Lanham, MD (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1573590">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1573590)</a>). This researcher had a bizarre search result come up when they searched that address. It was a Washington DC Craigslist post in the &quot;missed connections&quot; section (<a href="http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/mis/5958620886.html">http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/mis/5958620886.html)</a>)</p>
<p>A bizarre reference came up: REVENGE OF OSIRIS 7292 Finns Ln, Lanham - mm4m (Cairo 86637) </p>
<p>To me, it looks like a hidden notification/invitation for a party/ritual/game at 7292 Finns Ln. I\'ve heard in the past that Craigslist has a repution for facilitating people making weird, sometimes nefarious connections (just look through the &quot;missed connections&quot; section sometime). </p>
<p>What could this event involve? Is there children involved? Why is it posted (somewhat cryptically) in the &quot;missed connection&quot; section of Craigslist? From the context of Pizzagate, this event is very curious (IMO)</p>
<p>Because of my current research into the Pegasus/Alefantis/Scheve/7292 Finns Ln connection, I thought it was at least worth spending some time to do some further intel on this subject (from my research, I\'m not so sure it was a hoax. It seemed pretty elaborate and deliberate. Also knowing the resident of 7292 Finns Ln is a psychic (Jaycee\'s Palm Readings), the subject matter didn\'t seem totally out of the realm of possiblity). </p>
<p>HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF MY RESEARCH (in my opinion, some curious and intriguing stuff)</p>
<p>1) REVENGE OF OSIRIS 7292 Finns Ln, Lanham - mm4m (Cairo 86637)</p>
<p>I went to the Helsinki Finland link (from the Craigslist post): (<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">http://www.helsinki.fi/</a>~jetsu/papers/publicity.html) and I found the following in the references (the link discusses the &quot;Cairo Calendar&quot;):</p>
<p>The Number &quot;86637&quot; refers to the Cairo Calendar (see below)</p>
<p>Cairo Calendar (Nummer 86637) fanden sie tatsächlich eine Periode von 2,85 Tagen, die mit der Periode des Veränderlichen Algol ...&quot;</p>
<p>On the webpage it states:</p>
<p>&quot;An ancient Egyptian calendar of Lucky and Unlucky days, the &quot;Cairo Calendar&quot;, is the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star, Algol. Modern astronomers made the same discovery three thousand years later. The above figure shows one papyrus page of one such calendar (<a href="https://voat.co/user/Trustees">@Trustees</a> of the British Museum). The stars in the modern Perseus constellation have been superimposed on the papyrus and connected with straight lines. The eye denotes Algol.&quot;</p>
<p>2) the tilde (~)  (in the image on the Craigslist post) represents the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://chemtrailsaredemonic.org/demonicStargatePortals.php">http://chemtrailsaredemonic.org/demonicStargatePortals.php</a></p>
<p>&quot;The tilde key on the computer keyboard is a satanic symbol, or portal. The wavy line appears on many things, think of it as a demonic spirit or serpent. &quot;</p>
<p>2a) Link to a storyboard that explains the Osiris and Isis story: <a href="http://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboards/dyanjazzeliene/the-osiris-and-isis-story">http://www.storyboardthat.com/storyboards/dyanjazzeliene/the-osiris-and-isis-story</a></p>
<p>3) the &quot;mm4m&quot; on the post represents gender preference. (translation: &quot;multiple males&quot; looking for &quot;male&quot;</p>
<p>4) Found some interesting documentation on 7292 Finns Ln. It is currently owned by John Frank who bought it in a tax sale in 2015. He is the husband of Jaycee Frank (formerly Jaycee Mitchell--from Jaycee\'s Palm Reading&quot;).</p>
<p>5) Found an interesting document. Looks like they wanted to build a 6 foot high privacy fence around the property to shield it from the street.</p>
<p><a href="http://pgccouncil.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/588">http://pgccouncil.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/588</a></p>
<p>(see quote from document below)</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;The property is a corner lot with the house facing the legal front street at an angle. Exhs. 2 and 9(A) through (E). There is an existing asphalt driveway on the property that accesses the property from Riverdale Road and runs along the rear property line. Exhs. 2, 5(E) through (H), 9(A) through (E).</p>
<p>Petitioners would like to construct a 6-foot privacy fence around a portion of the rear and side street yards, but a variance is needed to obtain a building permit. Since the fence would be over 4 feet in height and located in the side yard abutting the street, waivers of the fence location and height requirements for a fence in the side yard on a corner lot were requested. Exh. 11.</p>
<p>Petitioner John Frank testified that they want the proposed fence for security and privacy reasons noting that drivers currently use the driveway in their rear yard to turn their vehicles. He testified that his dog was run over by a vehicle.</p>
<p>Jaycee Frank testified that they have five children and the youngest child is two years old. She stated that the fence is needed to protect the children from the (trespassing) vehicles and from the road. She stated that she is further alarmed because there is a bus stop near the driveway (Exhs. 5(C) and (D)) where people loiter. Appeal No. V-102-15 - 2 -</p>
<p>John Frank further testified that the driveway at the rear and a metal chain link fence existed when he purchased the property. He stated that the existing fence next to the driveway is broken (Exhs. 5(G) and (H)) and will be replaced with the new 6-foot privacy fence using the existing fence lines. He explained that there will be a gate blocking off the driveway from the yard to protect the children.</p>
<p>He explained that the property slopes upward from Riverdale Road and the proposed fence would be located at the top of the slope next to the driveway and Riverdale Road. See Exhs. 5(A) through (K). He stated that the new fence will not block the view for traffic because there will be sufficient clearance between the fence and Riverdale Road.&quot;</p>

            The story of Osiris is a key to this whole sick world. It is tincluded in the occultism religion of Thelmaic. Think John Podesta/HRC/Elites Emails. The cult of Thelma and Osiris are also tied together with Marina Abramovich and spirit cooking. Remember Podestas hands the palms of his hands that had the number 14 and the symbol 🐟, with the cut on the middle finger. 
Now think of the spirit cooking blood writing on the wall in Abramovich "art" which explains the ritual in graphic detail. Osiris involves sacrifice, cannabilism, and worse. Please research this it is all connected through ancient times  the occult, Aleister Crowley, Satanism it just gets more and more horrible.

            I'm not sure of the relevance. But the compass shown has a "C" and not a "G" as a masonic compass has. I even searched google images, I cannot locate one instance of a C being used in place of a G.
           </p>
           <p>
            That whole thing is like a mock up of real masonic shit, without legit masonic shit.

            It's interesting, but I actually think this was planted to throw us off. Timing is much too coincidental for this to be legit.

            I'm going to write a post about this but don't mind if someone beats me to it....I was reading about Osiris and Osiris WAS KILLED BY SETH. So the revenge of Osiris would be to kill Seth!

            Is Revenge of Osiris related to the symbols on Podesta's hands? I've seen research suggesting it's an allusion to the death of Osiris.
