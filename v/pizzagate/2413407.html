<p><strong>1-3 – Recap/Previous Posts</strong></p>
<p><strong>4-6 – This Post</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> This all started a few months ago with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1TAE_inW-0">a video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9SL3BtH21c8EGeZnw0WTXw">Jamie Dlux</a> in which he shares some research he had found on Dan Schneider and other Hollywood perverts.  Most of you probably already knew about Schneider\'s past and were shocked when you saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltbzdKB8jZE">@dillonthehacker clip</a> in which Schneider is said to have “cauterized a star of David onto the forhead of babies,” and “sold Miranda Cosgrove into slavery!”  If you found yourself watching all of the videos on Schneider\'s websites, you may have come across <a href="http://www.danschneider.com/videos/victorious/victorious-group-hug-collapse">this one</a> that not only contains, but draws focus to, a boy-love symbol.  (There\'s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suHwPZckZkQ">video</a> about this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfFC_f69BnlrFSmOxLEPEA">my YouTube channel</a> and previous <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2360675">post</a> on this.)</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> There\'s a <a href="https://archive.org/details/ViacomParamount">mind-map</a> connecting all the Hollywood abuse scandals to Viacom and Paramount.  In it, you will notice that Clinton Inc. is connected to several of them.  It is starting to seem like the Clinton\'s are actually more entrenched in this community than many have previously thought.  Here\'s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmGULvhP8do">video</a> (and previous <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2384507">post</a>) summarizing the links between the Clintons, Frank Giustra, 3 of the original investors in Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), Alphy Hoffman, and possibly Dan “Radcliffe” Schneider himself.  Giustra\'s Radcliffe Foundation is what led to the (re)discovery of the Elpida home.  
</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> You may have seen <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/Social_Tech/elpida-factory-logo-and-office.jpg">this picture</a> of Amed khan and Frank Giustra in front of a triangular boy-love symbol on a glass door.  That is one of the doors at the Elpida Home.  Here\'s a <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2386507">post</a> about Khan\'s background with links to lots of images and video showing the inside of the home.  The images don\'t contain any red flags per se, but some aspects of them are worth questioning given what is really being investigating here.  Here\'s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCh7fra26cA">video</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2389933">post</a> about that too.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> And finally, we come to the subject of this post and video.  Two people who worked on the ground at <strong>Elpida</strong> are <strong>co-founder Amed Khan and project manager Mike Zuckerman</strong>.  <strong>Khan is a former employee of the \'92 and \'96 Clinton/Gore campaigns</strong> before getting involved in the <strong>International Rescue Committee</strong>.  <strong>Zuckerman is a self-described cultural hacker</strong> that works to re-imagine urban spaces in order make them more organized and efficient.  He is a <strong>member of the Institute for the Future</strong>.  Both the International Rescue Committee and the Institute for the Future <strong>partner with the Rockefeller Foundation</strong> and have members (Katharine Farley and Berit Ashla, respectively) who are tied to other Rockefeller interests (Rockefeller University and Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisers, respectively).  I also linked Institute for the Future partner, Humana, to <strong>Doug Band</strong>, another one of Bill Clinton\'s close associates.  <strong>Band and Clinton used Band\'s company Teneo to help sell America\'s interests via Hillary\'s State Department</strong>.  When you consider Khan and Zuckerman\'s ties to Rockefeller interests, along with those concerning the Clinton/Giustra/Band alliance, you begin to realize something that is getting close to the truth: that <strong>wealthy families really are setting up foundations, charitable missions, and refugee camps around the very people that were displaced by the wars they had a hand in starting</strong>*. Not only that, they now expect that these charitable endeavors, aught to be profitable so they don\'t have to donate to them year after year!</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Why do the wealthiest and most prominent philanthropists need to turn a profit on their foundation or charity?  There are many different types of philanthropic work that needs to be done in the world.  Some people donate their money to research, or to saving wild, and in these cases, it would not be that unreasonable for a person to desire a profit from funds invested.  However, <strong>the fact that the Rockefeller\'s, the Clinton\'s, and the Giustra\'s of the world are looking to profit from helping the refuges of war that they helped cause seems downright evil.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Is this it?  <strong>Is this how elite pedophiles, who supposedly run the world, procure their victims?</strong>  Are these humanitarian organizations being used as front for something truly sinister, such as human trafficking?  <strong>Or is this exactly what it seems to be; honest philanthropy aimed at financial sustainability?</strong>  Am I looking too far into the people and the symbols and the coincidences?  I don\'t know how easy or hard it would be to find any reports of wrongdoing at Elpida, but at this point, I can\'t tell if I am more anxious that I\'ll find it or that I won\'t.  I think this means it\'s time to start fresh with a new topic altogether.</p>',

            You want to dig on Giustra dig on mister invisable John A Hardy, an ex lawyer in Vancouver who bragged his father ran Canada's spy agency CSIS ( although his name doesn't come up so it was maybe before when the RCMP ran the spy agency). He went on to be CEO of Versatile Systems( a RFID, tracking and shipping company) and now runs Equus Total Return. He is scum. Trying so hard to be invisible. Side note, funny how all these creeps are tied into shipping companies and technologies like tracking. Tracking what, children?? Please save this in the event something happens to me. Hardy did once threaten me. Told to keep my mouth shut about my kids   'or I was dead'. Little bread crumb but I was told he set up the deal for LionsGate. Hardy, back in 95-96, was a lawyer and dealt with insurance law surrounding mining companies and logging companies. Hope people other than just the bad guys see this

            The Q board found a major HRC connection. May be worth its own thread. The following is in need of digging.

            One thing that really upset me was the drawings of the Elpida children.
           </p>
           <p>
            The drawings. There are a few drawings with showers. This seems to mean something to the children. Somehow the drawings don't seem normal to me. I worked with all ages of children for 7 yrs in a school. Most of them are devoid of color. Somber. There does not seem to be happiness here, at least to me.  I really don't want to imagine what may going on there.  I am going to give a link I have been posting as much as possible.  Bill and Frank with a precious little girl

            Pretty heavy material. Pretty creepy feeling knowing that elements within our government work very hard at convincing us they are all about humanitarian efforts when history is showing us that those original foundations were created with the only huge sources of revenue and wealth at the time (Robber Barons), ill gotten in the first place, to GAIN A FOOTHOLD ON THE ROOT OF SOCIETY AND STEER IT, as in the Rockefeller/Carnegie Frankfurt model public school system which is the basis of societal mk-ultra conditioning in america.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a double edged sword that has shielded itself from criticism because those foundations have also done alot of 'good' in the world. meaning provide enough auxillary help to make it look like a benevolent organization to the bulk of blind society that any criticism has been shielded by the "Good Deeds", when in reality in the long run it has propped up a number of activities that when examined correctly foster a 'satanic' society. This is the same modicum shielding them with the jewish question, create enough good or bad sentiment around and object and it has value to the goy programmed by it in society. It is a tactic succinctly outlined in the Protocols of Zion.
           </p>

            I've always been amazed at the tenacity and resolve of the liars on tv like Bill Clinton, President for 8 fucking years and faciltated the sale of billions of dollars worth of cocaine that destroyed thousands and thousands of lives by suicide, robbery, murder, police, courts, just like his mentors and predecessors the Bush cartel and the nazis before him, can STAND ON LIVE TELEVISION AND LOOK STRAIGHT FACED WHILE OFF CAMERA ARE SCREWING HOOKERS AND SNORTING COCAINE, SHIPPING TONS OF THE STUFF TO LINE THEIR POCKETS AND COMMIT GENOCIDE ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY.

            "And advisor to the Carlos Slim foundation"
Slim has previously beat out Bill Gates on the most wealthy Forbes list. His parents were wealthy Lebanese immigrants to MEXICO. He supposedly made his fortune in a telecommunications monopoly in Mexico. He more recently bailed out the NEW YORK TIMES and used it as a platform to fight Trump and especially THE WALL. If you were a narco/human trafficker, you really wouldn't want one of those.

            DURING AND AFTER TRUMP ELECTION:
"Donald Trump on Friday accused Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, a part-owner of The New York Times and a six-figure donor to the Clinton Foundation, of being a meddling foreign bogeymen behind the troubling sexual harassment and assault accusations that have emerged this week.
During a mid-afternoon campaign rally in North Carolina, the Republican presidential nominee said the Times is out to get him, and cast Slim as the unseen hand pulling the strings of 'corporate lobbyists' masquerading as reporters.
'The largest shareholder in the Times is Carlos Slim. Now Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico,' Trump said. 'He's given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives.'"

            "6) Is this it? Is this how elite pedophiles, who supposedly run the world, procure their victims? Are these humanitarian organizations being used as front for something truly sinister, such as human trafficking? "
Yes and maybe even more sinister than that. You left out organ harvesting I think. Yes, hard to imagine this kind of evil
