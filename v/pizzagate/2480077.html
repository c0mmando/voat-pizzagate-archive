            post - Despite multiple apologies, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman was continuing to incur the wrath of the contributors to a popular Donald Trump subreddit after admitting to modifying a number of obscenity-laden posts directed at him, he also continues to censor and ban subs.
This  series of events that were kicked off by what the mainstream media calls a fake news story regarding a pizza place, known as Comet Ping Pong, in Washington, D.C. The articles — which later gained momentum on blogs and social media — essentially recycled a conspiracy theory started by 4Chan users that claimed the restaurant was the site of a child abuse ring led by Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager John D. Podesta. Soon, a subreddit entitled “r/Pizzagate” emerged. Its mission: to prove the theory correct.
           </p>
           <p>
            Taking notice of the conversations on the new forum, Reddit quickly shut it down. Users searching for the subreddit were confronted with a message stating: This community is banned.” Reddit added: We don’t want witch hunts on our site.” Huffman, who left Reddit to start travel site Hipmunk in 2010 before returning last year to replace Ellen Pao, said he made the changes to messages in response to critical and abusive comments that he received in the wake of closure.
Brett Ratner connects to the youonger steroid Willliams sister who is married to Alexis Ohanian...but no abuse happening in US sports??. Brett Ratner publicly dating stars such as Serena Williams hanging out with Charlie Sheen, Polanski and other Weinstein types a Redditor once exposed Kevin Spacey as pedophile years ago but reddit managed to bury it.

            just hired more moderators and the senior moderator u/tomatocake just posted about it the monthly modpost. u/PepeDidNothing posted the linked comment on that modpost after having found out they had hired the muslim moderator u/shotdownm.

            I have a big concern and the community deserves to form an opinion on the facts:
           </p>
           <p>
            What were your considerations when you hired a muslim moderator, who:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Openly posts on Reddit about his illegal drug use and is on drugs while modding?
            </li>
            <li>
             Goes against any sort of criticism of islamic oppression of women in here?
            </li>
            <li>
             Covers for muslim men who sexually harass women?
            </li>
            <li>
             Gives advice on how to cheat on welfare?
            </li>
            <li>
             Gets aggressive if people don't look at him the right way on the street?
            </li>
            <li>
             Defends adult males' molestation of children in a thread about a muslim 28 y/o male who raped an 11 y/o?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            He has already made several grave errors that he publicly had to reverse his actions on - e.g. here, here and here. How many comments did he delete that we don't know of?
           </p>
           <p>
            How did you come to the conclusion this was the kind of type suited for deciding who's allowed to comment in here?

            There are archive links to all the claims in the text, seems like pretty solid evidence. User was banned and muted for posting that comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mods hiring him and covering for him are u/tomatocake and possibly u/amalian .

             Thank you!  I don't know why people still are stuck on reddit.  I left when they banned us talking about pizzagate.  Are those people really not red pilled by now?  Boggles the mind.
