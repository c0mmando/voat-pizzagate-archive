            I heard rumors that some of the founding documents of the Illuminati were on display in a handful of museums within Europe. Any photos? I'd love to see some of the originals.

             When were they on display and where?  Are they still or have they been removed.  I just came back from there.  But saw nothing of the kind.  I wish I had known.

               Well I am sure I would not have seen it anyway.  We went with others and divided our time but that would have been hidden I would think.  Amazing it was even out there.  Especially in the Land of the Crown.

             My point wasn't to agree or disagree with every point listed on the timeline, but there is enough there to help make sense of current world events.  From what I've seen from just scratching the surface of NGOs, CSOs, Round Tables, Focus Groups, Foundations of every conceivable angle of generic goodwill, orphanages and Voluntourism, pedophile rights groups and related so called 'rights' groups that support them, pedo tourism, international schools, boarding schools, not to mention the UN agendas of mass migration that provides plenty of bodies for both sex and labor slavery...all these areas have something in common, and it's of a very perverse globalist nature.

            Relevant to PG because the elements of international child trafficking and the overreaching goals of "transforming the world" into a pedophile paradise are present.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jan. 22, 1870 – In a letter to Italian revolutionary leader Giuseppe Mazzini, Albert Pike – Sovereign Grand Commander of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry – announces the establishment of a secret society within a secret society: 
“We must create a super rite, which will remain unknown, to which we will call those Masons of high degree of whom we shall select. With regard to our brothers in Masonry, these men must be pledges to the strictest secrecy. Through this supreme rite, we will govern all Freemasonry which will become the one international center, the more powerful because its direction will be unknown.”
            </p>
            <p>
             This ultra-secret organization is called The New and Reformed Paladian Rite. (This is why about 95% of the men involved in Masonry don’t have a clue as to what the objectives of the organization actually are. They are under the delusion that it’s just a fine community organization doing good works.)
            </p>
            <p>
             1875 – Russian occultist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky founds the Theosophical Society. Madame Blavatsky claims that Tibetan holy men in the Himilayas, whom she refers to as the Masters of Wisdom, communicated with her in London by telepathy. She insists that the Christians have it all backwards – that Satan is good, and God is evil. She writes:
            </p>
            <p>
             “The Christians and scientists must be made to respect their Indian betters. The Wisdom of India, her philosophy and achievement, must be made known in Europe and America.”
            </p>
            <p>
             1884 – The Fabian Society is founded in Great Britain to promote Socialism. The Fabian Society takes its name from the Roman General Fabius Maximus, who fought Hannibal’s army in small debilitating skirmishes, rather than attempting one decisive battle.
            </p>
            <p>
             July 14, 1889 – Albert Pike issues instructions to the 23 Supreme Councils of the world. He reveals who is the true object of Masonic worship: 
“To you, Sovereign Grand Instructors General, we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st and 30th degrees: The Masonic religion should be, by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.”
            </p>
            <p>
             April 1972 – In his keynote address to the Association for Childhood Education International, Chester M. Pierce, Professor of Education and 
Psychiatry in the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University, proclaims:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Every child in America entering school at the age of five is insane because he comes to school with certain allegiances toward our founding fathers, toward his parents, toward a belief in a supernatural being. It’s up to you, teachers, to make all of these sick children well by creating the international child of the future.”
            </p>
            <p>
             1928 – “The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution” by H. G. Wells is published. A former Fabian socialist, Wells writes: 
“The political world of the Open Conspiracy must weaken, efface, incorporate, and supersede existing governments. The Open Conspiracy is the natural inheritor of socialist and communist enthusiasms; it may be in control of Moscow before it is in control of New York. The character of the Open Conspiracy will now be plainly displayed. It will be a world religion.”
