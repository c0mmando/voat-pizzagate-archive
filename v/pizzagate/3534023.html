<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to preserve the integrity of all U.S. elections, as ordered by the President of the United States, after an extensive investigation in select counties (the ‘sampling’), the DHS has concluded that while Russian entities (as outlined within SC Mueller’s investigation were complicit in attempting to undermine the presidential election of 2016) had no direct impact or bearing on the outcome of the presidential election, nor were any U.S. person(s) knowingly part of such an attempt to sabotage as it relates to the Russian investigation, U.S. and other foreign entities (as further described within DHS[XXXX]), acting outside of Russian agents, did attempt on numerous occasions, and were successful, in interfering w/ the presidential election of 2016, senate elections of [x, y, z], [x] elections, whereby several million of illegal, non-resident ballots (the “irregularities”) were counted, while legal ballots were improperly tabulated and/or intentionally mishandled. We believe these actions were a coordinated attack against the democracy of our country.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Fancy that, the guy bringing you news on PIZZAGATE arrests happens to use a standalone &quot;Y&quot; just like Q ANON does.  I bet that really burns the asses of some certain shills here.</p>
<h1 id="md-rules-checklist">Rules checklist:</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally.  Fucking.  Arrests.  Does anyone doubt arrests based on Anthony Weiner\'s case has nothing to do with PG?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Title\'s first factual claim has a link in the body of the submission to the tweet, verifying my claim that he tweeted it as factual.  Title\'s second factual claim of Q ANON using a standalone &quot;Y&quot; recently and many times was taken care of with every other link/quote/explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2: If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn\'t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2: If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No opinions or arguments.  Factual claims only.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2: Avoid baseless speculation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>None to be found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2: ALL posts must include at least one link. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multiple links.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot think of a more succinct explanation title, and Anthony Weiner should be a household name here by now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3: EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do believe no case could be made that this did not happen.</p>
<p>4, 5, and 6, are not applicable.  This is not Meta, it is not NSFW, and is not a link post.</p>

           Fancy that, the guy bringing you news on PIZZAGATE arrests happens to use a standalone "Y" just like Q ANON does.  I bet that really burns the asses of some certain shills here.

              I find it hilarious that you would respond in this way to such a deep nested comment that I might have previously thought had nothing at all to do with you, that 100% has to do with a pedophile and his supporters.

                Dude, I protected pizzagate from the Qanon psyop for a long time. I'm not gonna protect it from crensch. This next few months is gonna show us where your heart is. crensch is gonna destroy pizzagate if you don't step in and show some balls. Step in dude. Nuke this shit before it grows.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your love of Q, and disdain for Q, has nothing to do with this shit. Do not let crensch stomp on you like you are a bitch. Stand up. Crensch has NO power over you anymore.

                   As for Kev, I didn't "try to make him an enemy". Kev proved himself to be an enemy -- of this subverse and of Voat. All I did was document it over time and share my observations. Kev's a fraud.

            All I hear is that I hurt your feelings by bringing up the fact that you got banned for doxxing. And you still don't like the fact that I call zyklon a pedophile for talking about raping a child constantly for over a month.

              I think our boy messed up again. Aligning himself with the literal pedophile to attack me. Maybe he logged into the wrong account? I know he's done that before.

            I was going to post this yesterday but didn't. Q is too divisive here on /pizzagate. For what it's worth, I have some faith Q is legit and followed since day 1. Until there's high level arrests I'm still doubtful.

              @crensch
             </a>
             does not. It means more than one thing, as with everything in the occult, truth is layered and becomes a composite that is hard to explain. A person has to understand the occult world to understand "Y" because it is a multi layered concept. It is a reference to to the divine feminine and "the child." It is also a reference to the creative process of copulation that takes two opposites and creates a "new" thing. It is also a reference to "out of chaos comes order."
            </p>
            <p>
             When the Judeo Freemasonic cult creates chaos it destroys the standing order, and from that the "Phoenix Rises From The Ashes" or same thing "a child is born" to be molded and shaped into a "New World Order" by the usual suspects.

             It feels like she thinks I don't have the right to post something that ES will find objectionable.  Something he has fought others over constantly in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also think she needs to familiarize herself with the rules a bit more, since my post very clearly complies with every single rule, as illustrated painstakingly in my OP.

              It seems you don't understand just how disgusting I find ES to be. I like not seeing him, and his pompous bilge. I liked it better when he stayed away. He comes back all the time now, I keep watching to see if I see repeats of earlier behaviors. It's hard because he uses alts, as you know. But he never does quite cover his NPD. That part always shows first.

             <p>
              I just explained to vin, I meant that it appeared you made this post for the purpose of fighting with ES. I didn't say to delete. I was hoping for an honest dialog, I want someone smarter than the people I see submitting to qrv to explain it. If you don't care to, fine. But then I will ask others if they can help me.

                You've also been known to ping a user who got down on all fours, spread her ass cheeks wide open and BEGGED every troll on VOAT to  slam her good and hard, all while gobbling down as much Mod cock as she could possibly ever cram down her Jew throat. Suddenly

                     You just wrote out a sexual fantasy in response to me. I think you have issues dealing with your own emotions so you project them onto others. it's okay, women are over emotional, illogical, unreasonable, weak-willed beings, and they need their pussy pass to be able to compete with men.

                          You've also been known to ping a user who got down on all fours, spread her ass cheeks wide open and BEGGED every troll on VOAT to slam her good and hard, all while gobbling down as much Mod cock as she could possibly ever cram down her Jew throat. Suddenly someone slips a pinkie in her pussy, and WHAM, she starts screaming rape.

                Yes I can be specific. You used to be judicial, fair, and fairly well balanced. You still are for the most part. The Q thing jumped the shark long ago. Its a psyop. Us pizzagate readers don't want the Q psyop in our business. Thats really it.

                 So, because I allow discussion of a White House backchannel communication op urging citizens to dig into pizzagate on a free-speech, anti-censorship platform, I am no longer "judicial, fair and fairly well balanced". In order to be "well balanced", I'm supposed to censor discussion of this one major topic.

              I've had a hard time converting my head into words for a few days, my typing is becoming slower and harder to get right. It happens around holidays when no one speaks english to me for days at a time. I meant to say that it felt like the post was made specifically to fight and not to inform. I am not saying it should be deleted, I've been waiting for a long time for anyone to give me a logical explanation as to why I have to trust Q, I don't trust any politicians, why should i trust some anon who does.

              DJT comes from a family of scum, all his relatives are scum, PG has proven that ALL his cousins are SCUM, every fucking one of them. But somehow, magically, he's the savior of the people that his family prey upon. There is no proof.
             </p>
             <p>
              If he meant any of the things he said to get himself elected, he would have rounded up and executed his family, deported all the felonious foreigners, and would tell Israel to give us our fucking money back or face the wrath of a Xtian nation. This is not a good man.

              And he wouldn't give a fuck about reelection, if he did it right to begin with it would be a landslide, no one left to lead the left.

                 What I find peculiar regarding the other one, is that the entire thing could have been raised without even a mention of Q or Q sharing the document first. But none of your opposition raises that point.

                   Nothing negative about you if that's what you might have thought. I'll explain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In reference to "the other [submission]", this one:
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3535879/">
                    https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3535879/
                   </a>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                   <li>
                    Imagine Q
                    <em>
                     didn't
                    </em>
                    make the recent post with a snippet from that CIA doc.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Your post could have been raised on its same merits without any relation to Q being necessary.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Your
                    <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/3433526/21500677/">
                     opposition
                    </a>
                    hasn't raised this point, which is peculiar in my opinion – I figured it'd be an easy way to take a swipe at the Q element of your post.
                   </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                   I guess what I'm saying is that setting Q aside, your case still has the same basis and although it's not a smoking gun or even the most solid case, it's not totally without basis to point out indeed that "correct the record" has been a directive/phrase in use for a long time (CIA or otherwise) and that adds (however insignificantly) to suspicions that CTR the organization may be corrupt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Is there really any doubt that the CIA is likely involved, on some level, with organizations such as CTR and indeed CTR itself? I would hazard to say no.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What also, if someone else (not me, obviously) had posted the same theory (with or without the Q element)? Would we see the same reaction?

               It’s elsewhere, but the Qdom has been trying to parse the use of [Y] and the talk of Y heads mingled with the global elite. How this post is
               <strong>
                directly
               </strong>
               tied to elite global pedophilia I do not grasp.
              </p>
              <p>
               It seems little more than an advertisement for Q, who is clearly far more invested in the re-election campaign of POTUS than any other interest.
              </p>
              <p>
               I reckon this meandering post would have been flagged for deletion/resubmission if someone less notable had posted it. To someone without any prior knowledge of Q, it looks like the ramblings of a mentally unbalanced individual and lacking anything resembling coherence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, none of this is up to me, and never was. Being a usefully talented, humorous, and agreeable individual doesn’t hold nearly as much stock on Voat as it used to.

                It's directly tied to globalist pedo elite because Flynn, who tweeted the "Y" in association with a reference to the Weiner laptop contents, also was one of the few who tweeted about pizzagate. The Weiner laptop is also related to pizzagate, both because it allowed Weiner himself to be convicted as an elite pedo, and because the agent who investigated its contents noted "Clinton" and "Crime against children" in his notes. Then there is the fact that QAnon has associated the "Y" to the Rothschild masquerade ball, which was a real life Eyes Wide Shut type of shindig which had spirit cooking-type elements, including heads of babies in the centerpieces of the dining room tables.

                was posting about Flynn's tweet containing the Y, which we had never noticed until Q just re-posted it (even though pizzagaters posted his tweet multiple times at the time he made it, a year before QAnon was anything but a twinkle in Trump's eye). He went on to include all instances of the [Y], for the convenience of those who might want to investigate further, given the pizzagate connections. New pizzagate leads might well be uncovered, were folks on this board to look more into this aspect of the Q leaks.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's really no different than someone posting all the pics they could find of celebrities wearing red shoes, or making the owl eye gesture, both of which I would also leave up, as long as they were properly sourced and explained their pizzagate premise.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have over 33,000 posts examining the corruption of elite pedos. QAnon frequently says "You have more than you know". He used our research on the Biltmore Hotel pool's similarity to one depicted in Podesta's art collection to launch a whole series of leaks about the Vanderbilts and Anderson Cooper that introduced "pizzagate" to a whole new "normie" population. It's not a stretch to think if the researchers on this board dug through our trove and pushed some of the findings about Haiti, for example, out onto Twitter, he would use it the same way he did the Biltmore material.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q has stated repeatedly that the human trafficking stuff was the final phase of the public exposure, after FISA etc. Many folks on this board are irritated by that, because they've been manning their oars a very long time. It's a situation that has been taken advantage of repeatedly by those who wanted to sow discord here in
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                 v/pizzagate
                </a>
                . Probably BECAUSE Q is most powerful way to mainstream the mind boggling stuff we've found. It wasn't Q posts that Voat's last DDoS targeted; it was pizzagate. Those who want our pizzagate research buried have the most to gain from discouraging discussion of Q here.

                 I disagree with this assertion. I do not find it likely the Qniverse

                 </em>
                 go mainstream. Perhaps I’m wrong. I believe archived, well-sourced evidence and research unhindered by a modern day Nostradamus clone would stand the best chance. For example, and I will take something very basic and early:

                 A ‘properly sourced’ photo of celebrity P in red shoes at event X published in newspaper Z is a concrete
                 <em>

                  I disagree. How closely do you follow Q, Heygeorge? He has definitively established that his leaks are emanating directly from the Trump White House, and has asserted that posts must be cryptic in order not to violate laws about leaking classified information, or give too much away. He can only point to what's out there in hopes of people putting the pieces together themselves. Pieces like the excellent Besta logo example that you highlighted.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've been trying to disseminate stuff like the Besta logo for three years, now, and I can tell you that even at the most viral stage of pizzagate when people's jaws were dropping over Abramovic Spirit Cooking, it was hard to get even Trump-fan family members to take the existence of the pedo elite seriously.  But Q has changed all that. Now I have family members, corporate professionals and friends from church who are intrigued by Q and want to be part of the movement they see people sporting bumper stickers and t-shirts for
                  <em>
                   asking me
                  </em>
                  about pizzagate. All of the reliable Q researchers on Twitter and YouTube talk about pizzagate/elite pedophilia as a
                  <em>
                   given
                  </em>
                  rather than an embarrassing hoax.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Because Q established his White House bonafides, his numerous leaks about elite child abuse -- from Pedo Island, the Biltmore pool and Haiti to Hollywood and the S8n Twitter -- amount to backchannel White House confirmation of pizzagate.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Q has mainstreamed it among Trump voters. He did it by predicting future events, revealing inside information, and doing so as an artfully orchestrated game, a puzzle people are invited to engage in helping solve. And he regularly takes their contributions and amplifies them, so the game is interactive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you actually believe this "isn't a thing" you've got your head in the sand.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A better question is, what kind of Thing is it? Is it really a crowdsourced effort to Drain the Swamp and take the country back? Or is it just brilliantly weaponized grassroots social networking cloaked in patriotism and saving kids?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Even if you think it's the latter (which many people -- especially survivors -- here do), it's eminently relevant to the investigation of elite child abuse, because that would mean the Q team is exploiting child abuse to consolidate political power and those of us who want to stop it had better be wise to that.

                  If I had someone posting photoshopped images of celebrities in red shoes, and it were proven it WAS photoshopped, I would absolutely leave that post up and flair it DEBUNKED, just like I did with the stupid Frazzledrip crap, the Kevin Annett "tribunal", and the supposed pics showing DEWs igniting forest fires. We have many, many posts in our trove about what disinfo is being pushed to distract from pizzagate. The information warfare to discredit us is absolutely relevant, as Rule 1's definition of pizzagate points out.

                  A day does not go by on this board where someone doesn't mock those of us who dare to hope there's a real effort underway to stop globalist corruption as if we're idiots or brainwashed. As if hope somehow makes a person weak or helpless. It's kind of humorous, really, because it's exactly the opposite the truth. Hope is the most deadly weapon against evil. Hope leads to perseverence, perseverence builds character, character renews the drive to take the fight to the enemy, that drive makes us learn new skills and we are tempered and honed and become ever more deadly.

                     Lol my house has some undesirable wiring as well. I just haven’t gotten ‘round to fixing it yet. Yesterday I found a sewer riser with a massive crack over four feet long. So that’s a bit higher on the priority list. Meanwhile I bought interconnected smoke &amp; carbon monoxide alarms.

                      Is a sewer riser a hatch for septic? We bought a vac/home recently with septic and no hatch, lots of digging in the future.

                       A sewer riser is also called a stack. It’s just a pipe that goes up and down. Oh, and carries shit when it needs to.

                       you can see here that I found a split cast iron waste pipe in my home. Fun!

                       Main water breaks can be difficult to track down, but I’m glad you found it. I’m not sure which stupid sob you are referring to, aka plumber or your husband. But hey, at least it’s fixed! Out here, the water company determined a neighbor’s main was leaking, so they pretty much said fuck you, fix that part and until then fuck your water. Nice!

                        In the house I first lived in, here in Maine, there's cast waste pipes and stink pipes. They were pretty much the only pipes that didn't burst when I was figuring out that whole heat the house with wood and/or coal thing.

                        Did the water co. cut off everybody's water? Or did they try to get everybody else to pay for wasted water? Why do PUBLIC utility co. treat the PAYING public so poorly? Assholes.

                         Lol no they just cut off service to that person then made them pay extra to repair the line (out in the road) before they would restore service! Good times! It’s tough to tell the water co to go fuck themselves in this area.

Then all of Voat watched as they openly used ShareBlue/SRS/Soros/(((THEM))) tactics to silence ShareBlue/SRS/Soros/(((THEM))) and anyone else trying to destroy Voat. Everyone watched as they removed dozens of censorship rules against all users for failure to cause butthurt that they were largely perpetrating (jew tactic 101: cry to mom, get more jew gold, pay more shills, get into over again). Then Voat watched as they systematically used said tactic to remove dissenting users from mod positions, and as

                 , their total victory was assured! I could go on, but there's no point. Voat is now full of blonde and red haired honeys run by the defenders free speech and there's nothing SRS can do about it. That's why the vast majority of all real shills months ago. It was all laid bare.

                    I do remember reading that, I thought maybe more info had been provided.

                   <p>
                    So does this mean that flynn has been positively identified as being one of Q, or is it speculated?

                   <p>
                    This question isn't as inportant to me as my first one about all the random Y's and exactly what they're supposed to mean? I need more.

                   <p>
                    That's the part I'm not able to track through the qmaps. And why I asked you to write an explanation that was more of a summary. I think it might help others, too. Not just me. I've had so many  questions go unanswered, I kinda gave up.

               I don't know what Q subscribes to. But the Y head in the photos is a stag, not Minerva. I can't recall the gods name who it is supposed to represent, atm.

             Fancy that, the guy bringing you news on PIZZAGATE arrests happens to use a standalone "Y" just like Q ANON does.

           <p>
            Who is the 'guy bringing the news'? I can't find who you mean. Is it comey?
           </p>
           <p>
            Guessing about what some anon means when they won't clearly state it, is part of what makes Q so difficult for me to follow at times.

           <p>
            Then you add every TD&amp;H stating that his interpretation is the right one, and they all differ. At some point it has all just become distracting noise.

            I know you hate my guts, but would you please write a summary of what it is you are saying. I understand your words more clearly than I do the wording of the Qmap threads. And I think it would be helpful.

              Well, that would certainly hook up with the Pachamama bullshit the fake pope is so enamored with. But I haven't ever seen Q reference that particular demon.

             QAnon has mentioned it numerous times, as Crensch has shown above. At least some of them refer to the powerful old money families that control governments and may be involved in Satanic Ritual Abuse of children. The image above with the woman at the masquerade party wearing a golden stag's head was confirmed by Q as part of the meaning of "Y head families". I believe she was a Rothschild.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q has spoken at length over the past two years about Rothschild banks being used to enslave populations via currency devaluation/central banking, and claimed Trump will end fiat currency in his second term.

             You would crawl over a mile of broken glass on your hands and knees in an effort to seek the affirmation of a person you mistakenly think has some authority. When you openly admitted to being a blood drinker I thought &gt;&gt;&gt;

                      That's probably why they're not obese, mr. sock aka belly of a whale. Not in. Just that you have the belly of a whale.

                       You missed the point...running is for faggots...men aren't obese because you perform labour and aren't gluttons.  You are bragging about being asian, and jogging, that is hilarious.  It isn't because I CAN'T jog, it is because I have self respect so I DON'T jog...the only people who jog are those who have (being)rape fantasies, and the rapists

                        So you rape people too, faggot? Your obese ass sure loves to vote manipulate cuz you got no life. Also never said I jogged but I already knew you couldn't. That's why you don't. Beer swelling Hillary asslicker who still can't STAND that someone trumped her! But yes, we know, you're still "with her". Your ship is sinking.

                          Riiiiight, Suuuure. Hey retard, you got so many accounts here as you bragged about it for ages. The upvotes are from YOU, and your downvoting with multiple accounts that you already have while you build up yet another account ccp and shit! But YOU will end up in the hospital. Then everyone does a happy dance because your abuse will be gone once you end up where you truly belong! With Hillary and her upcoming fate.

                           No seriously man you need some fresh air or a fresh 'scrip for your Dr.  I was having fun running with it while you were going on about socks but it isn't healthy to be THIS deep into anything, let alone VOAT.  I did jump accounts but I left my old 1 (one) behind; I am not saying this because I am worried about getting into trouble, I am worried about you.  Why would you think I am going to end up in the hospital?  If you are truly wishing harm on people that is bad for YOU, not bad for them.  Get some help.

                            I'm going to create a board and call it something like the Disco Roller Rink, and I'm gonna have all the disco freaks and disco dancin' fools come there and dance and party. And I'm banning you and all your socks from it. I'm gonna play all th best from the 1970s. I'm going to host an event with guests like the Captain &amp; Tennille, David Cassidy, and Telly Savalas, and those two guys from Fantasy Island.

                                  Arrogant idiot. I literally handed you the names which you failed to connect to the punchline. If you think your stupidity is exciting, maybe you should learn English. Entertaining would be more like it. You're pathetic little 10 year old basement dweller. Yes please give up here.

             Given what you showed me (~)yesterday, well, Flynn tweet and a few other things make a bit too much sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not the best implications for some of pizzagate, but also a great opportunity to point out what is real and why Flynn may still be in danger and/or under duress. Will post about it down the line.

We still have laws against kikes and niggers here and we smell outsiders at the state line.  We'll put your lifeless fucking body in a mine shaft without a second thought.

                  I saw the video of Coleman Rogers (pamphletanon) using the Q trip code with my own eyes. Unless Isaac Green's Youtube channel got the shoah you can go watch it too. Thats called evidence and instead of hope. Isaac, Baruch The Scribe, and Tracy Beanz also confessed to having been part of the scam.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I still don't understand why the Qtards don't go with the evidence instead of smoking Hopium. I have said this a thousand times but I will say it again &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When it comes to political parties like Democrat or Republican the answer is NEITHER because they serve the same master.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If the Q tards would use their collective attention span hours to do something productive like focus on getting the Patriot Act repealed, get rid of the Federal Reserve, stop them from stealing our taxes and spending it on Israel's wars, etc....you would be of some value.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As it stands right now you are just suckers helping the Republicans feed us to Israel.

                 Also, other researchers you buddied up to somehow wound up disappearing and/or freaking out before disappearing.

                 It's ok.  Nobody has to believe that part if they don't want.  They can believe it's a lie, but I have absolute evidence that you manipulate votes and play both sides of attacking researchers with alts, and playing White Knight hero to them with this username.

                        Just tell Srayzie to comback, and stop bitching. Zyklon is gone. She put lots of time into Q ,she should be here when all unfolds. I will stay to myself. I am already blocked from her sub and never comment on this one.

                       It doesn't evade my notice that you tried to distract from the main point of the subject by bringing up things that are only 10 chinchilly relevant and really not all that interesting. You try to tell a story of your life in order to distract from the fact that there is absolutely no reason to believe that kat had any information, whereas Kev was part of the mod Circle and she had opened up to him. He was the only one that had some of the information that came out.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Best part is, there is no reason to believe you since you stuck with a pedophile that was threatening to rape and murder her child for over a month. Healthy, well-adjusted, honest people don't do that. Jews and mentally ill sick fucks do.

                          I defend Kevdude because you keep accusing him of giving "Me" information and it wasn't.  I really know nothing about him whatsoever. As a matter of fact I made memes poking fun of him for defending Srayzie. The only conversations I ever had with him was after all this went down, he sent me messages asking me to come clean about where the info came from.

                           They don't use the exact word. They don't want goyim knowing or having in their mind the idea that some things that walk on two legs around our downtown areas are not human.

                           If you don't know where the information ultimately came from, then you really have no right to say it didn't come from Kev. At the very most you could say that you specifically did not get it from him but you don't know where it came from. Instead historically you have told me specifically that it wasn't Kev.

                            Yes, you, Srayzie and Shizy were as thick as thieves, and zyklon knew that.  Plus you had made posts defending her, she was easiest to troll. You have a little more armour and toughness then her. He wasn't my wannabe husband, he made it very clear he was a parasite on my pocketbook, and that is all, and that's not love. But again he isn't a pedo, just a troll. He fooled you with fake shit about my family. Which started this while mess. Why don't you go and attack him on Poal? It's odd he gets such a free pass, and everyone else is chewed out over it, continuously..

                              No I didn't financially support anyone, that's what he claimed he was dating me for, when we broke up. In other words it was never real from the start.

                                No, that's when we broke up shortly after. He was stating things I could no longer defend and won't. In real life he isn't a Pedo but the comments he made, made me extremely uncomfortable.

                                   Nothing to do with that.  I could ask random passers-by if they would think zyklon and everyone helping him were probably pedophiles using generic terms - what do you think they'd all say?

                      Sure I do. He has been doing it for 55 years. Rothschild bailed him out of bankruptcy. Sheldon Adelson game him a 100 million dollars to run for President. He won the Tree Of LIfe Award all the way back in the 1980's. He boats that he could win President of Israel in a landslide. An Israeli group is minting a shekel with King Cyrus on one side and Trump on the other.

                              If you ever learn how this world is really run you're gonna feel pretty low I.Q. for having gone around and called your detractors "low I.Q."
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I bet you have not even taken the time to understand why the Jews in Israel call Trump "the new King Cyrus." Because if you did you would not feel nearly as smug as you do. I can assure you of that.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Cyrus gave the Jews their "second Temple." Its not about a stone building because "temple" means total Jew dominance and rule. They are crediting Trump with helping them build their "third Temple." Total boot stomping in the face dominance and control over every human being on earth.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              They had that sort of dominance 2 Times in the past, over their regions they controlled, and got their asses stomped out both times. Now with technology and banking it won't be their regions. It will be the entire the entire planet and that is why they call Trump "the new King Cyrus."
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Your problem is that you KNOW about an occult world, you know it exists, but you don't understand how it works. You also don't understand that it rules the world. THERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I understood the difference between Exoterics and Esoterics twenty years ago. You live in the EXoteric world but you cannot see the ESotseric world and its right under your nose.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              When I watch Cerealbrain2 butcher Gematria and make a mockery of it I just shake my head. He's not even taking out the Hebrew vowels or anything else you have to do. Then the Qtards crowd around in wonder and say "WOW how does he do that???"
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              He doesn't. He is a fukn clown. He is probably a Jew laughing at you all.

            Qtards are here to undermine Pizzagate. They're clowns that no one takes seriously, so it's no surprise that when more people began seeing the truth behind Pizzagate, you're starting to see more qtards.

And I hate everyone, I hate all parties and I hate all your damned religions! Including all your alternate accounts that you're using to abuse the system.

                      I don't like that satanic evil bitch. You operate exactly like the rest of your Zionist Cult. You ignore the facts and details that prove Trump is a devout Zionist and stick strictly with the insults. Thats because the facts are not on your side. Its also exactly the way cults operate. You are a brainwashed cult member, or more likely sitting in a cubicle in Israel.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The only good thing about Trump is that he does not spout SJW talking points. Other than that he is fucking traitor just like Hillary.

                       Oh and your ranting foaming attack is hilarous. You prove what a jew you are, projection and keeping at it like a banshee. If you want to believe I'm in some cult, so you have a reason to lick Janet Reno's dick (cause that was a man) then why don't you go ahead and put your money where your mouth is? Or is Reno's dick taking up all the room in there?

                          I'm just solidly kicking your ass with facts and proving that both Trump and Hillary are traitors to the U.S.

                          Rothschild bailed Trump out of bankruptcy. Trump won the high jew honor of getting the Tree Of Life award in the 1980's. Soros invested in Trump Towers. Zionist casino scumbag Sheldon Adelson bankrolled Trump's campaign. Trump desecrated the most holy city in Christianity when he obeyed his jew masters and moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Trump and his father both donate to Chabad Lubavitch. An Israeli group is minting a shekel with Trump on one side and King Cyrus on the other side.

                           You're not kicking anyone's ass, Hillary lover.

                           All you're doing is EXACTLY what Hillary and her followers do. You spew on and on about Trump when I never even fucking mentioned him and you're so seething on and on about him and showing your little libetal memes which are not facts. And the facts you think you have are twisted and delusional and you don't get the trolling Trump is doing on your ilk.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           And then you rush into all your alternate accounts and downvote everything I have said everywhere else, showing how completely unhinged you are and how you are the one getting your ass kicked without my even trying. I just have to live and you're wroth and dripping with rage. Also, stupid, I don't click on your links to whatever dumbshit you got there as your "evidence" because a wart like you who actually comes in with the insults and bullshit, isn't important to me.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In all your rage, you only called Hillary a satainist. That's not an insult to someone who worships satan. However, you keep her well guarded and protected without nary an angry word against her. Let alone any kind of meme. With your vile actions, your vote abuse, and continued abuse, while you sit there and claim how great of an abuser you are, which are ALL Hillary tactics, the only thing you've done here is drive me further into Trump's arms.

            The rumor is that Hillary is Crowleys sex magick daughter. Tom Horn and others have done the home work and most recently on SGT a two part. Its pretty mind blowing.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to remember grown men, hardened, were in tears regarding what the saw and discovered. You have to push this pretty far.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially the SGT report goes into the Portal that Jack Parsons opened and died in his lab from. The government is into somer really deep stuff, and they are not inclined to talk, at all.

            Look up Tom Horns Hilarion .  Its bad and its so out there it does not sound real. But the more I look into this stuff, its the same result. The level of evil proves itself.

            The election of Trump was either shifted by the military, knowing about the implications of Hillary or by GOD. I tend to believe the later, because the previous things I mentioned are true and virtually unbelievable.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Portal could very easily be construed as the 'looking glass' also. The military was highly involved once they started to dabble.

              , you've documented a lot of Moloch owls in various tv shows and movies...ever heard of this being part of the OTO? (see above)
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm curious how that

               Hillary email
              </a>
              where she talks about the "Owl/Minerva Rule" applying to the removal of Qaddafi might play in, here. We never got to the bottom of that, did we?
             </p>
             <p>
              I've wondered if it has to do with the
              <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm">
               famous quote
              </a>
              by Hegel:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought to be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late. Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known.
               <strong>
                The owl of Minerva, takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.
               </strong>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Is this the "Owl/Minerva Rule"? Are they using this quote by Hegel to justify Eugenics (if we build it, we’ll be able to justify it philosophicaly)? Wikipedia notes that
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegelianism">
               Hegelianism
              </a>
              motivated both Marx and the guy who described fascism.
             </p>
             <p>
              A connection to the OTO would certainly be an interesting lead in that context. Especially given the way Qaddafi died.
