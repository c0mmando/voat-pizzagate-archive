<p>I found this website while researching suckling pigs.
<a href="http://www.esotericonline.net/group/eleusinianmysteries/forum/topics/the-rites-and-festivals">http://www.esotericonline.net/group/eleusinianmysteries/forum/topics/the-rites-and-festivals</a></p>
<p>&quot;The festivals included the sacrifice of suckling pigs in a manner suggestive of not only of an human sacrifice but of a gruesome one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The seed-time festival of Thesmophoria lasted three days, the first day being named Kathodos (downgoing) and Anodos (upcoming), the second Nestia (fasting), and the last Kalligeneia (fair-born or fair-birth); and it was during the first that the suckling pigs were thrown, probably alive, into an underground chamber called a megara, and left there to rot for a year, the bones from the year before being carried up to the earth again and placed upon an altar. Figures of serpents and human beings made of flour and wheat were also thrown into the chasm, or &quot;chamber,&quot; at this time. And the author of this information wrote: &quot;They say that in or about the chasms are snakes which consume the most part of what is thrown in; hence a rattling din is made when the women draw up the remains and when they replace the remains by well-known images, in order that they snakes which they hold to be the guardians of the sanctuaries may go away.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is this pesky Saturnalia thing again. Although the 28th of December is a few days late to be Saturnalia...

<p>After the public rituals, observances continued at home.[14] On 18 and 19 December, which were also holidays from public business, families conducted domestic rituals. They bathed early, and those with means sacrificed a suckling pig, a traditional offering to an earth deity.[15]</p>
<p>It involves Ancient Greece. Wasn\'t Alefantis a pig farmer and is Greek?</p>

<p>&quot; Hundred dollar bills. Used in this sense because they easy to come by once you make it.
Johnny dropped a whole stack of tortillas on one hand of blackjack. Homeboy\'s got mad money. &quot;</p>

            I think the tortilla ref is of trafficked kids from mexico, tortillas are flat and round like pizza and the body of christ. Could be money or drugs  though. Suckling pig sounds about right.
