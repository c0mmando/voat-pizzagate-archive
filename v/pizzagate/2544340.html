Both were charged on April 20 with federal felony counts of sex trafficking, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, and conspiracy to commit forced labor.</p>
<p>In the same February 14th complaint against Raniere, in addition to naming CC-1 – who turned out to be Mack – there was another unnamed co-conspirator. She was identified only as Co-Conspirator #2 [CC-2}.</p>
<p>Who is she?</p>
<p>India Oxenberg </p>
<p>Everyone in NXIVM knows India ran The Delegates. The idea was first promulgated by cult member James Del Negro. Raniere took credit for devising it and ordered India to operate it</p>
<p>The “Delegates” were in fact gofers. The company was basically a gofer service where NXIVM slaves, illegal immigrants, and teen girls would run errands, clean homes, chauffeur, cook, and provide other services for NXIVM members who came to Albany to learn the secret teachings of Raniere, whose followers are instructed that they should call him Vanguard.</p>
<p>I don’t claim India was involved in sex trafficking through The Delegates, but, according to numerous sources, India worked for a time with a group of teen girls from Chihuahua Mexico, who were part of The Delegates.</p>
<p>Jens Gould – who is editor of Raniere’s Knife Media – should remember these Mexican teens for he took them out on an excursion to see various sights in Albany as part of their so-called “educational experience” here.</p>
<p>Maybe nothing illegal happened with the teens, but it was clear to me and others that Raniere intended to teach these girls the “secrets” of his sex practices, and it is known that they left amid rumors of them being unhappy and cruelly used, if not sexually abused.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to India. She ran The Delegates.</p>
<p>“Jane Doe 2 is an actress and model who began taking Nxivm classes in or about 2016, during which time she became friendly with CC-2 [India]. When Jane Doe 2 was in Clifton Park for a Nxivm class in or about November 2016, CC-2 invited Jane Doe 2 on a walk. As they walked, CC-2 told Jane Doe 2 that she was part of a secret society that had transformed CC-2 ‘s life and enabled CC-2 to uphold CC-2 ‘s commitments.</p>
<p>“CC-2 told Jane Doe 2 that in order to learn more, Jane Doe 2 had to provide collateral, which Jane Doe 2 did in the form of a video in which Jane Doe 2 divulged a damaging secret. After providing this video, CC-2 told Jane Doe 2 about DOS and Jane Doe 2 agreed to become CC-2’s slave.</p>
<p>CC-2 told Jane Doe 2 that in order to learn more, Jane Doe 2 had to provide collateral, which Jane Doe 2 did in the form of a video in which Jane Doe 2 divulged a damaging secret. After providing this video, CC-2 told Jane Doe 2 about DOS and Jane Doe 2 agreed to become CC-2’s slave.</p>
<p>“Eventually CC-2 told Jane Doe 2 that CC-1 [Allison Mack] was CC-2’s master and thus Jane Doe 2’s grandmaster. When Jane Doe 2 was introduced to DOS, she was living in Los Angeles, California. After Jane Doe 2 joined DOS, CC-1 suggested that Jane Doe 2 temporarily move to Clifton Park, New York and spend more time with CC-1 and CC-2. Jane Doe 2 began spending more time in Clifton Park, but regularly traveled back to Los Angeles for jobs. When Jane Doe 2 would travel between Los Angeles and Clifton Park, she would regularly fly into John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York before taking the train or bus to Albany.</p>
<p>Two of Jane Doe 2’s first acts of self-denial were to refrain from sex and masturbation. At one point when Jane Doe 2 was in Clifton Park, RANIERE sent Jane Doe 2 a message in the middle of the night asking her to go on a walk with him. During the walk, RANIERE told Jane Doe 2 sexual jokes. Over the course of several walks, Jane Doe 2 expressed to RANIERE that she wanted to open a T-shirt business. RANIERE expressed interest and told her he would partner with her.</p>
<p>“Jane Doe 2 left for Los Angeles for a job and while she was there RANIERE sent her a text message saying, “If you want to start this business with me then come back, the sooner the better.</p>
<p>“Jane Doe 2 returned to Clifton Park. She was soon given new assignments, including being kept on a regimented diet of 800-1000 calories per day. After several months, Jane Doe 2 received a text message from CC-1 stating that CC-1 wanted to speak to Jane Doe 2 about a “special assignment.”</p>
<p>“CC-1 and CC-2 then contacted Jane Doe 2 and told her the assignment was to “seduce Keith” and have him take a picture of Jane Doe 2 to prove she had done it. CC-1 told Jane Doe 2 that this assignment was a privilege that few women had the honor of experiencing, but that CC-1 and CC-2 both had.</p>
<p>“At the end of the call CC-1 told Jane Doe 2, “I give you permission to enjoy it,” which Jane Doe 2 interpreted to mean, “I give you permission to enjoy sex with RANIERE.”</p>
<p>“Not suspecting that RANIERE was involved with DOS until this call, Jane Doe 2 asked CC-1 on the call if RANIERE knew about DOS. CC-1 said that he did not.</p>
<p>“After the call, in an effort to avoid having sex with RANIERE, Jane Doe 2 made arrangements to leave DOS. Jane Doe 2 retrieved a car that she had loaned to CC-1 and her cat and possessions from Clifton Park. Before defecting, Jane Doe 2 also captured images of collateral belonging to other DOS members, including CC-2, from an online Drop box account, believing that she could protect the release of her own collateral by having other DOS members’ collateral as leverage. Jane Doe 2 officially left DOS in or about May 2016.”</p>
<p>( Jane Doe 2 is a smart cookie, also, it seems the compound was in Clifton Park, NY)</p>',

            N4N, does Frank Report mention in any of his other articles additional information regarding these Mexican girls? Could we maybe see if we can find any other sources about this?

                  To family friends, Seagram heiresses Sara and Clare Bronfman are victims of a frightening, secretive “cult” called nxivm, which has swallowed as much as $150 million of their fortune. But the organization’s leader, Keith Raniere, seems also to have tapped into a complex emotional rift between the sisters and their father, billionaire philanthropist Edgar Bronfman Sr. The author investigates the accusations that are now flying—blackmail, perjury, forgery—in a many-sided legal war.

                  ~~As Raniere’s losses soared, he would tell people that Sara and Clare’s father was responsible. According to Bouchey, he said that Edgar Bronfman “had figured out a plot with the commodities clearing firm” to steal Raniere’s money. From January 2005 to late 2007, according to court filings, Raniere, trading through First Principles, a company registered in Nancy Salzman’s name, would lose close to $70 million—and the Bronfmans would cover $65.6 million of it.

                   <em>
                    Between them, they would also spend close to $1 million to buy and refurbish Salzman’s house in Halfmoon;

                   Clare would pay $2.3 million for a 234-acre horse farm outside Albany that nxivm would use; and Sara would buy a $6.5 million apartment in the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower in Manhattan that Salzman would use. They would also “lend” about $1.7 million to buy nxivm’s headquarters.
