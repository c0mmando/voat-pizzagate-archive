<p>This relates to pizza gate bc it is about childhood pedophilia, and it teaches how we got where we are now. </p>
<p>We are releasing a new edition of our controversial film, &quot;The Kinsey Syndrome&quot; with a new cover design. We are very pleased to relate the this work continues to be used as a tool to warn of the damaging influence of Alfred C. Kinsey and his impact on the sexual revolution, pornography, abortion, and all the wicked fruit of the ungodly descent into immorality that our nation has suffered since the Kinsey Reports were first issued in 1948. </p>
<p>Our ministry has recently learned that copies of the film are being circulated in the Catholic Church to confront the immoral behavior of the pedophile priesthood of Rome. Please pray that God will use this work for His glory, and to lead souls out of darkness and into salvation.</p>
<p>Here are several important reviews of the film:</p>
<p>&quot;The Kinsey Syndrome is must-viewing for anyone who cares about our rapidly declining culture. The film is central to the curriculum for &quot;Sexual Behavior and the Law&quot; -- a class I teach at Liberty University School of Law. As the documentary so masterfully illustrates, there is a pre-Kinsey and a post-Kinsey America. Unfortunately, we live in the latter. All our major elitist institutions: the courts; the media; academia; the entertainment industry and others -- have relied upon Kinsey\'s wholly discredited research to move America away from adherence to the Judeo-Christian sexual ethic, and toward a secular-humanist, morally relative worldview. The Kinsey Syndrome has helped to expose Alfred Kinsey and his life\'s work as pure fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>Matt Barber, Associate Dean and Adjunct Law Professor, Liberty University School of Law
&quot;The Bible tells us to expose the fruitless works of darkness. The documentary, The Kinsey Syndrome does just that in painstaking detail. Each chapter of this video documentary addresses a different aspect of the work of the pseudo-scientist Alfred Kinsey whose fraudulent data laid the cancerous foundation for sex education, perversion, pedophilia, pornography, and the corruption of our culture.&quot;</p>

            I watched this the other day and it was very informative, yet disturbing the whole time. Every pizzagater needs to see it.

             I agree, I am victim of sex abuse myself and honestly its helping me alot! I am not a victim of pizzagate sex abuse but I am a sex abuse victim by my peers and boyfriend and I tramatized to the core. My boyfriend used a knife on me and my peers gang raped me and I haven't been able to figure out why until I found Dr Reisman

                 There was a comment there, that led me to think arrests may be coming soon, however it looks like that comment is gone now also.

                  PG-Iz is always saying that. It is the calling card. Any PG account claiming to be James is probably not the "real" PG and is a troll account. I think?

            So right you are. I was a hippie at university during the late 1960's and I fell for this revolution  hook, line and sinker. I feel stupid now and guilty for contributing to the moral decline of our nation. But the revolution and the anti-establishment movement was tied into the anti war student movement since we were facing a draft into an unjust in Vietnam. We also assisted the civil rights movement relative to minorities, the handicapped , the farm workers movement and gender inequality. So it wasn't all sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll. Just goes to show you how everything in life is a double edged sword.
