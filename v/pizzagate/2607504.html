            A bizarre additional chapter of the double murder played out when Valera's sister, Belinda Van Krevel, pleaded guilty in 2003 to soliciting her boyfriend Keith Schreiber to murder her father Jack Van Krevel while she was pretending to sleep in the adjoining bedroom.
           </p>
           <p>
            I got a really specific vibe from this report.  I had a feeling that Valera was possibly sexually abused by his father and the two men he murdered.  Also his friend that murdered the father, he was possibly abused as well.  There was a lot of it going on in that town.  The fact that the sister wanted her father killed, there had to be a reason, certainly to avenge what he did to her brother and his friend.  At least that is my opinion.  What a horrid turn of events.
