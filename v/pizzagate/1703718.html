            I am a Trump supporter and while I am open to the possibility that Trump does have dirt and they could be use it to control him some way, I don't think they will and it surely doesn't stand a chance against the dirt we have on all of them. Don't forget FBI anon told us not even Trump is clean, however, the dirt on him is connected to the Clintons so I can't picture them using it against him bc they would out their own queen in the process.

            Jet liner fuel dude. Planes were full of them. Tower built to withstand plane but not jet liner full of fuel. I worked as PM in Petro-Canada Centre for 10 years and design almost identical to WTC. In fact, during 93 bombing we traveled there to study damage and review Port Authority fire escape plans as we implemented similar drills due to building design. You have to remember the steel was coated in fire retardant but not made to withstand 2000 degree heat generated by the fuel and fire. Acted like a bomb. Once the girders started to warp due to heat it created the necessary metal fatigue and brought tower down upon itself. Our Engineers on staff concluded this to the main factor in tower collapses and they have no reason to lie.

             Even if what you say is true there is still the evidence that the administration knew about the attack and did nothing and that Cheney had the usual air defense stand down, so something is amiss.

            Dude, Trump was interviewed on 9/11 by a reporter who asked his opinion on what happened that day, especially in regards to the structure of the Twin Towers (apparently, having built his own Trump Tower, the Donald was considered an expert on the matter), and he very clearly states that he regards the Twin Towers to be one of the most solid structures ever built, that he doesn't believe the impact of a plane would cause a complete collapse of these buildings, and that it looked like a
            <em>
             controlled demolition

            So, if Trump is part of the 9/11 cover-up, he's not doing a very good job, wouldn't you say?

             He actually proved himself to be somewhat of an expert because 1) he went and saw the 1993 basement bombing damage and 2) he knew the structural engineer of WTC well, and also pointed out that the WTC unlike any skyscraper at the time had an external steel structure (designed specifically to withstand a jet impact)
            </p>
            <p>
             His conclusion is that the jets had bombs on board. Whatever you think of that assessment it was most certainly not part of the official story being rammed down the public's throats from about two hours after the attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did not hear him say anything about a controlled demolition though?

              He was giving  a limited Hangout and not the truth. So the fact that he does not go with the original story does not mean anything. The bombs were at the bottom. It was controlled demolition.

               Could be. In any case I'm sure the Deep State and its Zionist/judeo-satanic masters would never allow a 9/11 truther near any power positon, or major credit line for that matter.

              <p>
               I also know Trump's a freemason and at least fringe establishment. All I'm hoping for is them having an internal fight over child abuse, and the 'less bad' guys winning.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's all I'm hoping for.

            I'll have to look more at some of the videos you posted, but Trump may have made some of these connections for business, and others as part of a plan (keep your enemies closer).
           </p>
           <p>
            The proof will be in the pudding. I myself am skeptical about if Trump really does end this mess, but the deep state is after him for some reason (unless you think this is just part of the show, as well).
