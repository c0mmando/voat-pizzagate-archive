            Go do a search on Voat for the oldest post about it it was called "Fatherhood Web" and it may be linked in the PizzagateBot comment below. It was allegedly from WorldCorpPro or some random site that people have speculated might be some type of leak.

            I was trolled on twitter by a freemason and later his friend who had a Goat as his profile pic ( I kid you not ) He went to great lengths to tell me that Freemasonry was a harmless Christian brotherhood doing charty. When I mentioned Albert Pikes's teachings he said that Albert Pike was not an authority on Freemasonry - Again, I kid you not! Basically he was desperate in trying to convince me that pedo rings had no ties to high degrees of secret socities and that satanism among the elite was a hoax! And his buddy has a Goat for a profile pic! Tread carefully, they are onto us.

            As terrible as this trolling is, I'm not convinced it's Podesta. I will say, however, that professional LEOs will need to do a voice comparison for a more definite confirmation one way or the other. Plus, there's a kid clearly being abused in it in some capacity.
           </p>

            So while I remain skeptical on whether it's Podesta we hear in the video, I do agree we should keep reporting it to the FBI and Gowdy--at the very least, to investigate if this child is being abused, and to nab the person or persons responsible, if so. And if you've had the stomach to hear it, it's quite hard to buy that clip being some level 10 acting stunt.

              Children can act, but I don't get the sense this was acting. And it sounds similar to JP, but with a seemingly different accent. We need law enforcement to do their damn jobs and run a pro voice analysis to put this issue to bed, one way or the other.

              More importantly, they need to investigate and track down those responsible for abusing this child and producing this content.

            I think this is actually a pretty good point, despite what I said about how the accent in the video doesn't strike me as being from chicago. We know JP has an alter ego named Skippy which behaves entirely differently than JP normally does - I don't really think it's a stretch to question if that change includes an alteration in his voice.

           <p>
            In the video, the Finders were caught when the strange combination of homeless-looking, disheveled boys and well-groomed adults was noted. For what it's worth,
            <strong>
             this photo was taken in the alley behind Comet Pizza
            </strong>
            , about a week after the "shooting", on a school day, during school hours, when the restaurant was closed. The boys and man emerged from the back door of Comet, and when the man noticed the guy with the camera,  he shuffled the boys away quickly:

             *Note: this is a hoax video, the hoax is that they say the tunnel they explore is near Comet, but it wasn't as close as they say. The guys did inadvertently capture a strange scene that really happened. They said when asked on Twitter, that this was one thing that they couldn't quite explain, even though they believe pizzagate is a joke, and set out to make fun of us.

             here is a PDF file on the Florida arrest,  the children thought they were going to Mexico for a school for smart kids.  The van they were living in at the time had Virginia license plates. One of the adults handed a business card with a name on one side and a statement on the other, the statement being he knew he had a constitutional right to remain silent and he would do so. Washington DC police were already looking into the Finders. this arrest dates 2-12-87. talks of 2 warehouses in DC that housed children,   " blood rituals" sex orgies with children told by an informant.  warrant was had and the stuff they found unreal. This report hit so hard. Does Alefantis own either of these two?

              Holy shit. I don't know about these addresses, though i'm sure it's easy to move warehouses when needed. But it sounds like Alefantis and Comet is part of the modern day Finders.

               the kids mentioned a tent city in Washington dc, seems its a place for homeless people. A quick look-up and there are these places in a lot of states.... Will continue to look these places up. Hell of a place to snatch kids

             that video has stuck with me since i watched it just one or two guys exploring and a bunch of kids getting led away from them and then into a car. 2 other teenage males walked up and told them they were crazy and nothingl ike that was going on here and then a car pulled up and took them away as well

              Oh that's right!!! If that Navy SEAL who is being sponsored by Alex Jones is legit, and not taking Jones' advice to ignore Comet, he would be the perfect person to go out looking for these boys and this man. I worry about them every day. HOW MANY ARE SUFFERING AS WE SPEAK????

               Just so we're clear, according to you, Jones is now also directly responsible for there not being a party to go looking for some particular boys and a man. What feeds your insatiable appetite to hurl invective at Jones is your own shortcomings, as a man, and as an observer of the pizzagate phenomenon. You are using Jones as your personal outlet, and it's very ugly. Man up, and find some other outlet for your frustrations.

             I agree Von Zipper..   that capture was pure luck and reeks of nefarious activity.  I froze the frame and enhanced the still.  I thought the adult may have been #myfavoritepedo, but it's not.  He looks Saudi, but definitely Middle Eastern.

              When this first happened, I posted it here as a reply to the hoax video. I got slammed, harder than for anything else I've ever said here. So your comment brings such relief I can't even tell you....

              I've read all about the Boys Town case, and kept up with pizzagate, but nothing told me more about what exactly is going on, and why we are fighting to uncover the truth, like this one simple image. My red pill. These 5 boys are barely eating. Are they still alive? Why are they so listless? These are abused boys, everything about this picture says so. And since we don't see an adult walking along the streets with five boys, ever, we can be assured the underground tunnels are being utilized by these sickos. Realistically, this guy would have to have a van and some excuse as to why the kids are with him and not in school. They can't travel above ground. But in this case, they couldn't escape into Besta basement (they were initially feet form the door) because that would give it away, they had to run in the opposite direction.

            I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but do we have any actual proof that it IS John Podesta in that video? "It sounds like him" is not proof. There are billions of people in the world, and some are bound to sound like others. Maybe if someone did a legit voice analysis, then maybe. I'm not saying the video (or worldcorp) should be ignored, or that I wasn't sick to my stomach seeing that shit. But I'm so tired of seeing people pushing that video as being Podesta without any actual proof. We CANNOT get this investigation anywhere based on opinion, and pushing this without factual evidence just makes us look bad, not to mention it's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

           <p>
            Pizzagate is a very sensitive topic, and I know that I personally am guilty of letting my emotions get in the way of facts. We have to focus on establishing clear evidence if we want this to go anywhere.

              Hey, I never said I agreed with those things either. But we're not talking about that right now, we're talking about the Podesta video. This just all seems like a big case of confirmation bias to me.

               But regardless of if it is or is not Podesta, the video itself is still concerning and worthy of being investigated.  "It's not Podesta" or "it's a Boston accent" do not offer any detraction to the worthiness of looking at the video at face value.  Given the dilution of quality on the front page anyways, we might as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's just bizarre that we present what seems to be child abuse, regardless of it is or is not Podesta, and people immediately want to shut it down in favor of all the other bullshit that's discussed on here.  Nobody can definitively prove that it's not child abuse, so it should be fair game for PG.

                For the most part, I agree with that. I never meant the video shouldn't be looked into, or that it's NOT Podesta. I just mean I don't think we should be pushing it as being him without something more concrete to stand on.

             Proof is the FBIs responsibility, and we are trying to convince them that there is enough circumstantial evidence to conduct one. Proof is the result of a proper investigation; it doesn't often come prior. But there is a video floating around that compares Podestas voice to one of these videos, and it is a perfect match.

              I agree, but we are the ones bringing the accusations here. Again, "it sounds like him" is not proof, and it doesn't help our investigation. I don't even know that I would call this circumstantial evidence. We can't say that it's Podesta this video without factual evidence if we want to be taken seriously. We've got to focus on pushing things that can't be denied or explained away.

                Of course. So the question now is whether or not that is ACTUALLY Podesta in the video. Again, I'm not saying this isn't a completely horrifying video or that I wouldn't like to beat that guy's ass to a bloody pulp. Trust me, I would be happy to. I'm also not saying it's NOT Podesta; I'm saying we need actual evidence before we go around parading the video as him. Honestly, it just seems to me like a case of confirmation bias until we get something more concrete.

                 Your only complaint then is that the title of this submission would be better if posed as a question rather than fact. On second read though, it says "must be" not "is", and the OP totally claims responsibility, so we at Voat aren't making some huge claim, only one commenter is saying they believe it must be JP, and here's why. I don't think this puts us in a bad light. It's better than omg John Podesta is raping a kid at Comet!!!!!!!

                  Now you're getting into minor semantics. It's a sensationalist title AND post based on the OP's interpretation of shill activity, which could actually be because of a number of things, not just because it is, in fact, John Podesta in the video.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You and I have the same end game here, so I don't mean to put us at odds. I just think we need to stop focusing so much on the emotional aspect without having solid evidence to back it up.

                   It is a matter of semantics - if the title were less emotional, allowed for more doubt, you'd be fine with it. I'm not putting us at odds, just trying to see where we come together. But that video is very emotional, so I doubt there is any way to get people to stop being emotional about it, and it will end up expressing in the posts. Where can we go to talk about non-solid evidence? I thought Voat was a good place, and then it can be hammered out in the comments sections.

            What we are doing is pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Wordcorp is a click bait shock website and out of a billion people it could be we are pointing to Podesta because the community wants him to be guilty sooooo bad. I'm not even sure it is real child abuse. In my opininion its someone's little brother who was conned into doing it. You'd be surprised how well an 8 year old van act when a new Xbox game is on the line, Maybe it is real, but its not Podesta. This has already been debunked over and over. Please don't reply with nasty shit to me, I'm already regretting writing this. We need to take off our blinders everyone!

             problem is you can't say it's been debunked because the response will be "debunked by who?" and that is my question also.

            I've heard that accent "in the zone", out of the zone, drunk, sober, belligerent and high. It's a Boston accent. There's no question.

             Exactly...  This video needs to go worldwide in order to find out who the victim and the perpetrator are...  I don't think any moral person can view the video and not feel compelled to act.  Put experts on the video and audio.  We need as many eyes and ears on this case, as possible.

            I hope you don't think that was me. I've been skeptical of that video from the beginning. With all do respect to you and

            that's not John Podesta in the video. It's a guy with a Boston accent. I'm not saying the fatherhood video is real or fake. I'm just saying the father is from Boston and John Podesta's from Chicago. They can't be the same person.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since they're not the same person everything points to that video being a hoax. Sorry. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

                I'm just looking at hard evidence that can be used in a court of law. As far as a court of law is concerned CPP and JA are sterile ground.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now do I think something might be a little sketchy? Yes. Something ain't right. I think we can all agree on that. There's more to the story that's for sure. But the golden thread that unravels the mystery isn't anywhere near CPP or JA.

             "They can't be the same person."
Great job.
we all know it's physically impossible to mimic an accent.
No one in the history of humanity has imitated an english accent to jokingly sound "smart, and not one person has ever done an italian accent when they are jokingly sounding intimidating.

             I don't want to hear people dealing in absolutes in defense of JP unless they have really good evidence.
The burden of proof lies on the side trying to defend him, so you better back it up when saying there's no way its him, not just this  weak ass accent argument.

             I have to say the man (possibly Podesta) in the father vid is DEFINTELY a Chicago accent. Besides being in complete shock of the poor kid, that was the first thing I noticed. I grew up outside of Chicago. There are differences between Boston and Chicago accents. Chicago tends to not use TH sounds properly or N'T like Don't. Doncha instead of don't ya.

             Also the "o" in hot stuff line. The o sound is Chicago.

              where exactly did you grow up? I've lived on the south side of the city for the majority of my life, and I can tell you with confidence that did NOT sound like a chicago accent to me.

               That floors me. You can not hear a Chicago accent? He sounds like every guy in my family and most of the local people I waited on back in the days when I worked at Ditka's.

                I don't really want to listen to the video again at the moment, but if I'm not super depressed later on I'll give it another go and see if I can catch what you mean. I don't hear the chicago accent at all, but then again I grew up in Englewood, which is very different as a neighborhood than the areas you mention.

                 Ya, i get what ur saying about listening to it again. I was going to, I just can't. I cried off and on for three days the first time.  I guess there's another vid of it more clear (visual wise) and I just can't do it. Listen to his Os, As and the doncha part. Shit, it sounds like one of my uncles but a higher voice. Of course, I could be wrong and maybe it is NY or Boston, who the hell knows. No mistaking however,  the kid is being tortured and scared out of their mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think someone did computerized test on it, like a comparison to the voice and Podesta and it came out a match. It was on YT somewhere but probably scrapped by now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 ETA- maybe first listen to Podesta on some vids. He is from NW Chicago and def has the accent. Usually it comes out more, if people are excited or mad.

                  yeah, I lost it the first time I saw the video. it's infuriating that people refer to this video as a "hoax" since there's obviously a child being tortured, regardless of who the abuser is.

                 <p>
                  I actually saw one of those videos with an audio comparison that supposedly matched up to JP also (as I remember, they matched it to one of his speeches on the HRC campaign trail). I don't remember the specifics anymore, but I remember being doubtful because the audio software they were using was pretty much a joke (I did some audio/music engineering when I was a bit younger). I remember specifically thinking to myself that this audio comparison was a lot like the photo comparison from www.twinsornot.net early on in the investigation where someone put in Caris James and Madeline McCann's photos for comparison, and they came back a 100% match despite not really looking anything alike. I tried twinsornot.net myself because I was curious, and more often than not it would return a 100% match for photos of me compared to friends who look nothing at all like me (by which I mean, not even the same race). If you're feeling up to it later and want to try to find that audio comparison again, I might be up for looking further into it.

               is right about this. I was just mentioning in another thread earlier how I am from chicago. It's not a chicago accent. It sounds to me like it may be a new england accent, but tbh I haven't spent enough time in that part of the country to say. That said, I have heard someone do what I thought was a pretty decent imitation of a Boston accent, but that's pretty irrelevant ;)

               And unless you've lived in Chicago you wouldn't either. I always get mistaken for being from Boston, New York or Jersey.  I'm tellin you, it's Chicago.

                That accent is Chicago? I don't think anyone believes that. We all agree it's a Boston accent. The question is whether John Podesta can imitate a Boston accent or not. I've never heard a Boston accent imitated perfectly. It's almost impossible.

                 We all agree? You're misrepresenting the very comments in this thread, no one agrees with you. And asserting yourself as an authority whilst claiming Comet and the pizzagate evidence we have surrounding it are an expertly laid plan, and that we should just leave Alefantis alone, makes you appear to be a shill, my friend.

                 Well, I guess I'm not agreeing with "everyone". Search old post here when this first came out. I called it a Chicago accent w/out even knowing where Podesta was from. So I guess you need to find your Boston mystery man.

             Also as for a Boston Accent, I had a boyfriend with a Boston accent and I always thought Boston accents were pretty awesome, so I've listened to them for hours with intrigue. I don't really think you can seriously question the video based on your own perception of which accent it is unless perhaps you're some kind of CIA language expert. To me, it sounds like John Podesta, but I have a hard time listening to it for very long.

              I'm not a CIA language expert but I've heard that accent about 1,000,000 times. It's not even a question. Trust me. It's a Boston accent.

               I don't "trust you" but even if it is, it can still be Podesta. I can speak in other accents. Can't most people? Nobody who knows me can tell where I am from. I incorporated the accents of my friends growing up because I was embarrassed about where I grew up having a certain accent I did not want to copy.

                The Boston accent can't be faked. I've never heard it successfully faked yet. I can't even go to a movie where the actor is faking the accent because it's like finger nails on a chalk board.

                  The guys is doing more than dropping r's. You'd have to live in and around Boston to understand all the tiny little nuances. There's different way's to drop an R. A Maine accent drops the R as well but it's not a Boston accent. The guy in the video has a Boston accent. End of story.

                     You're absolutely right.  I couldn't.  Which is why I have not commented on this.  I don't know for certain that it's JP... but I don't know that it's not.  You however should not take a certain stance against your fellow teammates WHO ARE ON THE SAME SIDE BTW as fact... when it is simply opinion... and the fact that you dismissed them and tried to state this as fact in such a rude manner makes you a dick

                       I understand... when I hear the voice I instantly think mafia style movies... Robert deniro style... these people have studied voices ... it's there job.... I will never say it is for sure JP.... but it is really easy to take on a different accent... take military kid's for example... They pick up what they are around... Your argument is simply not plausible.  I'm sorry I called you a dick but you can't simply write this whole thing off either... it's 50/50 at this point...

               Late to the party but I agree with the MagaBoomer tag, he's been doing overtime for a week straight trying to distract from the video evidence saying oh it's faked the audio is fake the video is altered, some 4chan guy is laughing his ass off somewhere "do you even internetz?" and writing snarky comments saying it's been on the internet since forever, but doesn't provide any links as proof that the video came from another source and is in fact older.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even if it was older that doesn't mean it's not John Podesta. You know the voice is similar and I highly doubt that's some carefully crafted troll. They've been sowing seeds of doubt and disinformation and discrediting the

               forum as being a bunch of concerned parents and facebook moms, then when anyone argues with them they bring up safespaces and try to make them feel stupid. It's the best evidence we have had so far potentially tying John Podesta to child abuse. It could be hackers or law enforcement that leaked it to us using the worldcorp as cover, and shills like them are trying to say it's all one big distractiion.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the question is why do they care so much about this video specifically? People post stupid fucking bullshit all day long circle-jerking about David Seaman and other loose abstract things but somehow for a week straight all they've done is try to discredit the fatherhood video and discourage the discussion. Interesting they'd go through so much trouble fighting against something that's one of the best potential convincing leads we've had so far.
