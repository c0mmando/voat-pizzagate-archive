            COPY/PASTE from victurus libertas psted article link in /whatever to avoid the blowback from shilling Mcshillsters
           </p>
           <p>
            As promised by our DHS insider earlier this week, our FBI insider surfaces with information on #ObamaGate and a Spring Purge.  If you heard our interview with Robert David Steele, he also spoke of a Spring Purge.  This all falls together like pieces of a puzzle.  Below is the latest question and answer by FBI Anon:
 Q. Thank you for talking with us.  What do you think of Trump’s allegations against Obama?
A. In the worlds of the Carpenters, “its only just begun”
Q. So was Trump wiretapped as our DHS insider and Robert Steele suggest
A. Yes.
Q. Why?
A. Wrong question
Q. Ok, by whom?
A. Trump tower was bugged by more than just our IC.
Q. WHAT?????  Could you elaborate?
A. Brits, Israeli’s.  In the fullness of time, much will be revealed
Q. Why the Brits?
A. The same reason as the Israeli’s. Trump is a threat to the Deep State. The Deep State is a threat to Trump. Globalists are the populations bee keepers. They harness the energy, they harness the honey. Controlled oppression.
Q. So why do you and other insiders leak to us and others?
A. Because once in a while, a bat needs to be taken to the bee hive.
Q. So you want the bees swarming?
A. In a manner of speaking. We leak, so that the people may have a just outrage and demand a just result. The People outnumber the Government 300 to 1. It’s a numbers game.  We expected high level arrests to happen weeks ago, but discovered the bee keepers had interfered at the highest levels. There is an internal war within our Government, as many know. The Shadow State is like a vampire facing dawn. They do not go easily into sunlit areas.
Q. So why did the Israeli’s bug Trump
A The same reason they keep close tabs on Jared Kushner, who I fully expect will be let go by Trump soon. There is too much liability with Kushner. Kushner has pressure from the Israeli lobby and Trump knows he is a delivery boy for AIPAC. The Israeli’s bugged Trump because they were concerned about Bannon, America First, the possibility that with a Trump win, they would see their foreign aid cut, which by the way, is going to happen.
Q. What do you think of David Seaman? Is he a Mossad asset?
A. Never heard of him.
Q. How will this all play out?
A. We are entering a time of political purge – the likes of which has not been seen for decades, if not centuries. Trump has the evidence he needs to launch an investigation into a myriad of DC collusions. He must concentrate on the communications between Lynch, Bill Clinton, Obama, and Brennan. He needs to get serious with the pedophilia investigation because he can bring down his enemies in one fell swoop. McCain, Graham, Obama, Bill Clinton, and so on… His greatest tools include the Wiener file titled “Life Insurance“.  (Names, dates, photo’s, videos) and the Epstein videos captured by NSA when they were being delivered to Israeli intel, Wiener and Epstein. But, his greatest tool is the collective rage of the People. Trump must prosecute #PedoGate.  The relationship between Schumer and Wiener must be explored. It may lead to some stunning climaxes, if you can excuse the pun.
Q. This is huge!
A. As I said before, there is enough underbelly rot  to collapse not only our Government, but collapse the Likud part in Israel and expose a huge political pedophile ring that exists in the US, UK, Asia, etc.  All inter-connected. And that’s not even venturing into the extortion aspect.
Q. Will it get bloody?
A. Lets just say its flag weather.
Q. Any advice for Trump?
A He who hesitates is lost…..

            I don't know why folks are accusing OP as being a shill/CTR postmaker.  I watched the entire video from start to finish and it matches nearly lockstep with all conventional wisdom and open source intelligence we have absorbed thus far.  The video also backs up the earliest mentions, leaks, etc. from Flynn, Prince, NYPD, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been enough breadcrumbs along the way that anyone paying attention for the last 4.5 months would realize this "report" makes total sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Criminal investigations take a long time.  And as it is said in the video, the investigations are likely to go on for years.  Think about that.  We are probably talking about what? 20,000.  50,000?  100,000 people just in the US required to support this infrastructure?  Can you imagine the LEO nightmare of trying to skin and eat that elephant (as another poster pointed out today)?  And at the top of the empire are some of the most powerful people in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will get done, but it is going be messy.
           </p>
           <p>
            And for those screaming "we don't care, children's lives are at stake, release the videos now!"  Sorry, it isn't going to happen on your timeline.  Proper investigations don't adhere to any timeline.  And as much as "time is of the essence", my guess is if the investigative authorities found a "rendering plant" a la CPP/tunnels, I would pray that they would disrupt that operation immediately to save kids, and keep things very quiet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has there been any Alefantis sightings in a while?
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit 1:  I forgot to add that if Pizzagate is as big as we think, and 30% of government is implicated - which I think is a bad statement - to conduct mass arressts all at once would tank the stock market, cause riots and civil unrest as never seen before, and could bring America to its knees.  Regarding my "bad statement" comment: To imply "30% of government" implies that one out of three people working at the VA, Social Security office, or serving in the armed forces, is somehow implicated as a "pedo" or "pedo enabler".  My interpretation of the statement is "30% of Congress, its staff, and an certain elements of government (State, NCMEC, state and local CPS, etc.) are pedos".  Opinions may differ.

              I don't disagree.  Unfortunately, "leaks" and "CIs" need to be given some leeway when it comes to journalistic and investigative standards.

            why so many complaints about this post?  I've seen a LOT worse posts on here regularly with nary a whisper about it. Dark Math was apologizing yesterday about mildly criticizing a steaming pile of shitpost about salt and pepper shakers in a logo symbolizing racism.  That stayed up all day, But everyone is angry about this?

            I am so thrilled to have seen this video.  Where other's dislike "leaker" videos, I believe I am intelligent enough to judge them on the likely truth of the information.  It's been a long, long time since we heard about Anthony Weiner and I'm thrilled, just thrilled to get this "inside update".  It's much more interesting than other junk news like Miley Cyrus' twerks.  Thanks FAKENEWITARD2!

             Yes, you are SO much more intelligent than everyone else here. Even though you have NO insider info yourself to check the veracity of these claims against, you just "know" because you're so freaking smart.

             Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol.  It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone.  Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down and sometimes into oblivion, and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post on the face of it is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.

             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles.  I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030
            </a>
            .   If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code> - 1 Also reaching out to the mods 
 - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion 
 - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up.  At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all.  If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

             Take the post down then, my intent is to draw attention to what needs to come out to end all this; THE CONTENT ON WEINER"S LAPTOP. IF PEOPLE CANNOT STAND TO ADMIT THAT IT"S TOO FUCKING BAD. We have uncovered a mountain of circumstantial evidence and gone down more rabbit holes than there are rabbits FFS, but if citizens keep the pressure on to RELEASE THE CONTENT ON WEINER"S LAPTOP WE WIN. DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND THAT??

              I agree, at this point it's a race. Get that info out and let the chips fall. Wake people up, they need to care they need to know how evil the people are they are supporting.
Otherwise, they may support them into taking out trump and there won't be another chance.

            this isn't the contents of weiner's laptop so how is this useful? this does nothing but make the crowd-sourced pizzagate investigation look foolish. if you have nothing worthwhile to add don't add anything at all.

               yeah I was about to say, we need SOME info on this "source" alluded to in the video - there's unfortunately no establishment of credibility at all. not saying the MSM is to be trusted, but there are tons of "alternative" outlets that at least have a track record of credibility. none of us have ever even heard of this "Net4Truths" organization.

                 Because at this point we can see that Politicos in DC are terrified of this evidence and are clutching at straws to delay its release (Russian Hacking narrative), we can see that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has been running interference for Hellary for the last 20 years and George Webb is cornering him. Must I remind you that you are terrified of George Webb, and oppose and downvoat the links to his videos.Why is that? SHILL

                     YES! Weiner's laptop/hard drive has damning evidence that could put a lot of people away for a long time.

                     YES! I highly suspect there are pedo snuff films on that laptop/hard drive.

                    <p>
                     NO! I don't think we can start shouting that from the mountain tops just yet lest we lose credibility.

               i aint saying its not valid to link to that video. Its about the way you handle the evidence, you've seemingly declared an absolute certainty of snuff films, sensationalised it with apocalyptic overtones, when at the end of the day the video (whilst not being inconsistent with what we may well infer COULD be on weiners laptop) is not backing its claims with any source who cares to be named/identified.

               That being the case it remains in the sphere of conjecture and a more professional investigator would present it more neutrally

                 Slow it down. Take a breath. I'm sorry for your experience. And I'm not trying to tear you a new asshole, I'ts intended as gentle advice to raise your Standards of Evidence.

                 Did Poesta's wikileaks result in podesta's arrest? Not yet. Weiners emails will red-pill more people sure but it wont end the saga. The saga ends with arrests that have been planned CAREFULLY enough to result in convictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You release those emails before appropriate action can be taken on them, you get a bunch of demonic pedos flying out of America beyond the reach of justice

                 We have plenty of anecdotal evidence that Trump despises paedophiles - dont you think he would have already pulled the trigger if his ducks were in a row?
