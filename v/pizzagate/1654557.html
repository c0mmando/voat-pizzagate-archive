Here\'s their website <a href="http://www.meltedbodies.com/">http://www.meltedbodies.com/</a> Probably investigators can find a lot of stuff. For instance this; NEED CASH? UNHAPPY?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SCROLL DOWN NOW! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  at their website seems like a possible offer for who knows what?</p>
<p>Here\'s the music group this artist used to be in. Notice it\'s the same uniforms as used in the Alefantis\' Chapel Perilous video;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnTacC1qUmE There are a lot of innuendos in this.</p>
<p>Herer\'s another video by his former group; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_P9RBpiom8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_P9RBpiom8</a> The main (fake) storyline is the last dog on earth but the REAL MEANING is the story of the little girl in the video. Notice the lyrics sung when she is on video. Also notice her hands caught in the same thread they use to make pedo symbol on bunch of maps at the end of the video.</p>
<p>There\'s probably a lot of stuff that people can come up with. Mostly innuendos but maybe some sharp investigator will see something that will bring these guys down.</p>',
