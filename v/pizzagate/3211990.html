            CALIFORNIA SCREAMIN'
           </p>

            "'Too much, too soon'? California slammed for kindergarten gender identity talks in sex education"
           </p>
           <p>
            "A new California sex education guidance encourages teachers to talk to kindergartners about gender identity and middle-schoolers about masturbation, worrying some education leaders who say the nation’s largest school system is pulling them into conversations they don’t want to have with children in their classrooms.
After a contentious hearing Wednesday, the California State Board of Education approved the guidance. It endorses ideas of gender fluidity and sex positivity and posits what some see as alarming scenarios, such as a health teacher discussing nonmonogamous relationships.""
           </p>
           <p>
            "The guidance also provides dramatic instruction, with seventh- and eighth- graders asked to act out scenarios to teach appropriate behavior. The scenario descriptions include “Two students are at a party. One asks the other for oral sex,” and “Daughter asks mom if she will take her to get birth control. Mom replies, ‘Why do you want birth control? Are you having sex?’”"

            Parents have to get serious about protecting their kids. If it means pulling them out of school, get together and do just that to make schools listen. Suing is good too .. a class action suit even better. Keep the pressure on because once this gets going, it'll be even harder to stop.

             Home schooling is legal in all 50 states. If parents collectively decided to home school this fall, it would bring the public schools to their knees. Public school parents need to organize and STRIKE.

             <p>
              Absolutely. They should get together and do it.. Have a list of demands present them, and say that until these are met, we will keep our children home. Involve the press ... a lot of independent journalists.
             </p>
             <p>
              Brilliant idea.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe challenge each state to win an unofficial contest of who can keep the greatest number of kids home and safe from indoctrination.

               OPERATION SAFE AT HOME sounds good. There IS a war on for our minds.

               "Are home-schooled children smarter?"
YES! see 14:06 for test results for Canadian home schoolers vs public schoolers. Structured home schoolers significantly outperformed public schoolers sometimes as much as 5 grade levels higher in 5 out of 7 categories.

                Look,, the truth is that in any war, there's propaganda.
               </p>
               <p>
                The wrap-up smear job was on how home-schooled children are inferior in intelligence and social graces came from the same people pushing this agenda. Labeling home-schooled kids in this way created an unnatural fear of not sending your child to school. For if you didn't, you'd end up with this misanthrope who couldn't tie his own shoes and had no idea how to act in public. Nothing could be further from the truth.
               </p>
               <p>
                The wanted their hands on our children. They wanted to mold, indoctrinate, and create a generation of brainwashed cult members who couldn't think logically and could not handle even the most basic of conflict. By undermining the ability of children to be faced with, and effectively solve problems, they effectively skewered that skill set. An example would be the awarding of medals and prizes in competitions. In saying, "everyone's a winner," you undermine the basic principle of what a competition is like, and remove an underpinning of rationality and establish a credulity that accepts such a false notion. No, the person the person that crosses the finish line first is the winner. The person that crosses second comes in second place ... that is how it works ... and that is what was lost. The competitors became a gang ... a meaningless assortment of competitors whose identities were lost in lieu of a pseudo Lord of the Flies genderless personhood. One could see how once identity is lost and questioned, a biological male can rail and protest that he is actually a girl, and can then be approved access and invade the inner sacred and private sanctuary of biological females. For instead of the tradition of scientific analysis, i.e. underage girls should be protected and kept safe from being exposed to male genitalia in an intimate setting, we have this "conglomerate" group ... this herd accepting the premise that they "welcome" this assault on privacy. Further, these cult members now battle their parents, overriding their guardian's concerns in lieu of what their teachers preach and their classmates parrot. The socialist/globalist satanists supplant parents as role models and then can model these children in the way they see fit. And what they see fit is to have them be unable to form logical opinions and instead form all opinions based on emotion and this overriding, overarching nonsense of what a person fantasizes in his mind being a reality and not probing into whether the fantasy IS a reality. Further, is this fantasy or reality harmful to society or this group. The willing acceptance of the absurd is used as the benchmark for what is harmless when children have historically not been given province of deciding what is safe for them. That is a parent's role.
               </p>
               <p>
                And now we have non-biological females competing in sports and dominating. That, too, must be fought. Women's rights are being torn away under the guise of giving this "identity" nonsense free rein. No. Anyone in their right minds would know that biological males would dominate in such a setting due to superior strength, speed, and general abilities. This has long been established and why the sexes were separated to not compete against each other. Even in the Olympics, this was settled by the ban on the use of perfromance-enhancing drugs. Eastern European "women" were routinely tested and found to be "male" due to alterations of hormonal boosts.
               </p>
               <p>
                More proof of the absurdity of the product of this non-education is the rationales used. There was one that was priceless. When a woman was asked about whether a gun could be used to protect a family from an intruder, she said, "No." Why? "Because a home invader would not be given a death sentence in a courtroom."
               </p>
               <p>
                And that is what passes for logic and that is what we are up against.
               </p>
               <p>
                Parents, please. Pull your kids out of school.

                 Excellent summary. Perhaps you can make this a separate post since you have neatly tied home school "shaming" in with those who would pervert our children, including pedo-grooming them.

                  I guess I could do it, but right now I'm not allowed to post since I don't have 10 CCP points. I have a couple of submissions I planned on making, and I suppose I could make this a separate one.

            Satan runs California.  In little while God will violently wipe the sinners from California.  Genesis 19:23-25 "23 By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. 24 Then the Lord rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens. 25 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, destroying all those living in the cities".
