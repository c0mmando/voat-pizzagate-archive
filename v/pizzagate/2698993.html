Long before other Catholic mavens, she declared Pope Bergoglio to be an anti-pope and a homosexual, and she has consistently exposed the Lavender Mafia in the Church for years.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/08/31/is-antipope-bergoglio-a-sodomite-i-dunno-but-his-child-pimping-boyfriend-sure-as-hell-is/">she came out with a stunning report</a>,  entitled &quot;Is Antipope Bergoglio a Sodomite? I Dunno, But His Child-Pimping Boyfriend Sure As Hell Is&quot;, contending that Pope Bergoglio has a longtime gay lover, GUSTAVO VERA, from Buenos Aires, Argentina, whom her sources say is &quot;a child prostitute pimp&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My information is that Antipope Bergoglio’s sodomite boyfriend, GUSTAVO VERA, heads up an NGO in Argentina called “La Alameda”, which does some LGBT advocacy, militant feminist crap, but primarily focuses on child labor, specifically in the garment industry and in child sex trafficking.  GUSTAVO VERA also drifts in and out of official government positions, as so many people in NGOs do.Uh, yeah. </p>
<p>In order to suppress his competition.  Apparently GUSTAVO VERA is a rentboy PIMP that has a monopoly on BOY PROSTITUTES working inside the gay bars of Buenos Aires. So what GUSTAVO VERA does is use his power and influence to have the freelance boy prostitutes that are working on the streets outside the gay bars, and in gay bars which his pimping syndicate does not have a foothold, cleared out in police raids which he orchestrates, thus maintaining his monopoly.  He also executes vendettas against female prostitution rings and pimps.</p>
<p>FURTHERMORE, GUSTAVO VERA is said to use his “advocacy” for child sweatshop workers to enable him to procure child prostitutes, both already in Argentina, AND traveling to high Andean mountain villages in Bolivia to essentially buy children for his sex trade down in Buenos Aires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ann goes on to reveal that Pope Bergoglio brought Gustavo Vero and installed him in the Santa Marta Hotel which the pope spent $3 million to make over one floor as his residence, namely because the hotel atmosphere makes it difficult to track visitors, unlike the Apostolic Palace, the customary papal residence.</p>
<p>However, the pope and his boyfriend broke up last year: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up until last year when Antipope Bergoglio and Gustavo Vera had a fight and broke up, Gustavo Vera would travel from Buenos Aires to Rome MONTHLY. After the big fag fight, Antipope Bergoglio had the Swiss Guards go into Vera’s suite in the Casa Santa Marta, pack his bags for him, and then they met him as he was walking through the Vatican returning to the Casa Santa Marta, handed him his bags, and escorted him off the Vatican premises</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of photos of the pope with Gustavo on Ann\'s <a href="https://www.barnhardt.biz/2018/08/31/is-antipope-bergoglio-a-sodomite-i-dunno-but-his-child-pimping-boyfriend-sure-as-hell-is/">website</a> </p>

             Thanks so much for this!! Good to have a thumbnail sketch of this guy. Funny that the Argentine Homosexual Community denounced him. I wonder why? Here's an Aug 26, 2018 interview with him, but it's in Spanish. He doesn't look very Hispanic.

              The only thing I got from this is that the interviewer asks him a few times why he, as a legislator changed the codigo.  Codigo means Customer Account Code.  Also that he is doing thins without consulting the Community.  Sounds much like our lawmakers.  lol.  Other than that I don't get much more.

              There could be some German in him since a lot of Germans settled in Argentina after WWII.  I have met a few people from Argentina that are lighter like him.  I bet the Homosexuals found out some sketchy stuff he was up to.  Communities usually know all the gossip about their own.  I will look at the interview now.  Don't know much Spanish.

             Great work! Thanks for these articles. Very interesting that Pope Francis is apparently not well loved by the current Argentinian govt. Also, that Gustavo Vero conducted some shady business regarding sewing machines in textile shops and that he is an advocate against slave labor. Maybe that explains the shirts he's holding up in some of the pictures with Pope Francis: are those shirts being made in his shops, I wonder:

                It is interesting.  The

                 Asia Monitor Resource Center
                </strong>
                that brought them together probably should be on our radar.
