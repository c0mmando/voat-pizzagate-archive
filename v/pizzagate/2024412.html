            This may be out there, but is it a coincidence that both the names 'joseph' and 'frank' refer to food/drink items, as do pasta, cheese and watermelon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Franks are hot dogs and a cup of 'joe' is coffee.  Maybe we should start looking at coffee shops.

            "When checking addresses listed for the various locations, one can see trends appearing.
Locations seems to have some of these in common:
be near places kids congregate such as schools and parks;
associated with medical practitioners such as doctors and dentists;
be near churches/places of worship;
associated with lawyers;
Busy roads, waterways, train tracks;
Law enforcement or military"
           </p>
           <p>
            Would it not make sense that the major traffickers need a network of doctors and dentists across the country that will do work on the sly?
           </p>
           <p>
            They may not care about these kids, but they do want to keep them 'in operation' and 'disease free' and somewhat healthy, at least a good number of them.  Kids get sick and need medical attention and they would not be able to take these kids to regular places for fear of raising suspicions.  They may not need even an actual doctor.  They often times may need prescriptions or get the drugs they need to give these children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who knows, part of the programming, or training, may be to take these kids out in public places, like playgrounds, to test them.  It would makes sense that Pegasus museum was near a playground, and had its own watchtower.

             Surgeons are also handy for harvesting organs for the multi-billion dollar black market organ trade. Surgeons also include veterinarians, sad to say. Hunters who butcher their own wild game as well. To be clear, I believe the vast majority of doctors (including veterinarians) and hunters are not part of this horror show, but keeping in mind that people with the skills to harvest organs are needed in their world may help us to connect the dots. They're leaving blood trails and we have to find them.

              I also think the vast majority are not involved.  I imagine a lot of them are threatened, too.  When the life of a family is threatened, it's a whole different ballgame than if its your life that is threatened.  I mean, if you knew that they could easily kidnap one of your own kids, you might cooperate with them.  Of course, I am sure they have dirt on just about everybody, since we now know we have all been spied on.

               Absolutely. They could show the doctor a single photo of their kid asleep in their bedroom, showing they can access the kid at any time. And other similar threats would do the trick. And a fat wad of cash to seal the deal. It's an offer very difficult to refuse. But in their guilt, they might be leaving us clues to find.

             the lifespan of a trafficked kid is a couple years due to failure to thrive. Taking kids to the dr creates a paper trail they wouldn't want, besides, to them those kids are disposable. Well, most of them. The ones they keep around would need a sympathetic-to-the-cause doctor to help patch up/prescribe meds for controlling someone, esp if given a false identity (thinking Johnny Gosch)... Certain people-shaped assets need to be protected in a not-obvious way.

              I keep thinking that the Medicare/Drug fraud busts that Sessions Justice Dept conducted and announced last week may be part of the plan to bust these trafficking rings.  Maybe some of those that were busted can be linked to some of these frank and joseph addresses.

               I would have never guessed a year ago that so many people could be into this. Especially groups. A group of like minded people willing to do the things these people do is still so hard to grasp. I mean, how do they find each other without being obvious? I guess that's why they have their little pedo logo's right out in the open with pedo symbols on them.

                 That's what I was wondering. I watched a YouTube video the other day. They were saying that some people and businesses are made to do things by the CIA and and others by threats. So they don't even have the choice. Then they also offer to take care of them so they benefit too. I heard that like 2 days ago. That's really scary to think you are working and minding your business and then bam! You're all of a sudden under their control.

            YES!!!  I have said that a couple of times. Somehow they are connected.  Maybe they are places they use for CP or sex abuse.  They may be used in off hours, at night or be renting them out even, paying who owns these places.  Not sure, but they are very enterprising. They could be drug drop offs as well.  In one of the articles about the arrest of Imran it says he got a loan from the govt. saying he owned the apt. he was renting when he was not.  There are a lot of fishy things going on.  This is another hornet's nest.  Thank You Great Post.  Upvoat

             Yes! There are tons of these places. How can there be so many? They would be hugely popular. Also, it can't be a coincidence that so many of the locations lead to doctors offices and places like that.

              I on two posts right now.  I agree there is some kind of strange set up they have going.  The part about two of the places being near the Awan Car Dealership  CIA (what a joke) is a great find.  Some how connected.

               I know. Did you see if there is a Joseph's Bistro or Frank's Franks in your area? It shows up on hourscenter.com from the search engine. She even mentions that. It's so weird.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you have any where you live, you should try calling them. Put *67 before their number when you dial. That makes your number private so they won't see your number. Maybe just ask what their hours are or something,
