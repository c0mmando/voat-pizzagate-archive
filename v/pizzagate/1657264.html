            To red pill someone you need to first be willing to suspend their disbelief. Honestly, I find history the best example, since it is quite simply, what has happened. And before you hit into current, emotional events, it's best to dig deeper into the past, where events have ceased to tap into public, cultural consciousness.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I do believe in the majority of humanity, I think our detached, first world culture's have separated the human ---capacity--- to make inhumane actions (insert whatever word in place of inhumane: unethical, immoral, evil). The only way I can explain this is in simple competition versus cooperation argument. Both are a necessity to learning, but I believe competition in terms of "haggling", sports, games, teaching of debate, and fallacies, etcetera teaches people about fairness and ethics much more than cooperation; however, in our thrival, second level society, skirting the foundations of 'survival', that those principals taught from survival are largely neglected; henceforth, you have nauseous fairness police, dictating ridiculous terms onto free speech, people obsessed with control, but not realizing the capacity for their own self to bend the rules to achieve internal desires.
           </p>
           <p>
            People fail to rationalize, or even instinctively comprehend how, for example, both how ridiculous their own arguments/demands sound, as well as, how an individual, like Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians - on the level's of Boss Tweed. But it's just politics to her, what one of us may consider pure evil. It's a game, that she intends to win - at any cost. Many play cognitive dissonance about their US support for the War in Iraq over a decade ago; but I still reflect on how decades of piss poor presidents led to Bush bamboozling so many people.
           </p>
           <p>
            (I also think the US has a culture of being avoidant to vulnerabibility. Sorry, glass ceiling crybabies don't apply here.)
           </p>
           <p>
            With some explanation as to why, and how the teaching of the next generations needs to change to challenging them, because cooperation with your children as a friend, in Confucian terms, just makes them spoiled brats. I'll shortly go into how without embarrassing myself too much.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suspending the disbelief starts by filling the gap of cognitive dissonance. People generally know sugar is bad for them, and that fast food will make them fat, but I doubt many of them could explain how. Many know a majority politicians, especially career politicians, and a majority of big businessmen are corrupt, but the gap is empty to how they are. Because again, we need to show the 'capacity' for humans to completely bypass the human condition.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll just briefly mention a few examples (sometimes going back into Medieval/Roman times makes people just think we were cavemen a thousand years ago, so something like the bronze bull doesn't work so well): the Ford Foundation funding the Nazi Party, Stalin's Purge's, President Truman saber wielding the atomic bombs and completely destroying relations with the Soviet Union for the rest of the century. I believe the Kennedy Assassination is a good example, explaining why he was back-stabbed. Bill Clinton under investigation for bombing other countries with the cover up of the Monika Lewinsky trials. Obama bombing 7 other countries without a declaration of war. The CIA intervening in 100+ elections. The story of the media being silent on the Escobar son saying he dealt drugs with the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully some people can include some other example's from the past 100-200 years. Again, one needs to fill the gap of disassociation. How is sugar bad for you, how does fast food make one sick and unwell? The sugar industry has had some very dubious manipulation into public health in the past 60-70 years. How do swindlers and snake oil salesmen crawl into publicly held positions, and fool people that our government is eroded of so many checks and balances to allow them to, and that unchallenged, they are willing to perform the inhumane like a game.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even with Pizzagate, I disassociate Hillary Clinton with it while explaining it to others, because people tend to cognitively collapse when they think a parent, "victim of Monica Lewinsky", female politician could be capable of this. Like I have said before, Clinton could do just about anything, on video, and people would still think is a good individual. She could butt fuck Chelsea in front of the White House, and many would think it was an actor. I will later on mention Podesta, for example, and that he is close to the Clinton family. If I can red pill a person well enough, then I may use the audio clip of her saying to manipulate the Palestinian elections, and explain the Wiki Leaks key verifications they used before showing the Wiki Leaks e-mails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Oliver Stone's United States of Amnesia (Edit: whoops, that's Gore Vidal. I meant: Oliver Stone's History of the United States) is a decent enough documentary to illustrate how politic's is an old and dirty game, that is quite simply, never ending.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully this helps and makes sense.

            Just tell people that the leaders of every institution they hold dear are, and have been for generations, murderous, satanic, pedofile cannibals and that trump is a mere tool as part of a divinely-orchestrated counter coup led by a chaos-loving, ancient Egyptian frog-god (with mysterious motives) against the deep state and the mainstream media who respectively facilitate and cover up for the evil so that the public is none the wiser.   &lt;not necessarily sarcasm&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously though, while we as a community have been masterful at the research, I feel we haven't been able to to effectively reach the masses.  I would have hoped far more people would have been redpilled about PG by now.  I think we can all agree that SOMETHING is horribly wrong in our world and that it likely revolves around human trafficking, for whatever reason.  It is a statistical impossibility that all of these hundreds, if not thousands, of connections could be mere 'coincidences'...confirmation bias be damned.
So what can be done?  The comments above are certainly helpful.  More YouTube docs? Smarter #tags?
Maybe we need to up our meme game.  Perhaps the 'Great Meme War of 2016' was merely the first great battle in the new war that the forces of good are waging against evil.

            You need to invest at least 50 hours in going over the details.  That way you will KNOW how to answer that question.

            If they talk about comet pizza just dance around it by saying that you don't care about some stupid little pizza shop, the evidence is way bigger than that. I had a massive fbook argument with relatively normal liberal who cited snopes article as proof and argued that emails and Instagram pictures were normal. Oh and of course that it had already been investigated by dc police 🙄
           </p>
           <p>
            I would start with international scope of it. High level human trafficking and also how CP is a method of control. Makes more sense then a shit of people have predisposition to sexually abusing little kids. For quick evidence of that just used bushs and Bill Clinton skull and bones involvement, and how people with high levels of perversion are purposely selected, psychologically and sexually abused and then implicated for control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the podesta video is pretty damn convincing. That's a tough one because of how traumatizing it is... But a day or two of suffering on our end is worth saving a child from a lifetime of suffering or not even getting to realize their own futures.

            just start telling people, and they will tell you you're wrong- watch videos to come up with good counter arguments with sources- rinse and repeat. try and keep the information grounded and sourced. eventually they will hear you, however some people may never hear you. 
Start by saying that this is a movement against human trafficking. Have them watch the movie taken....this is not outside the scope of reality here.
