QAnon started <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/bmbond.png">dropping names tonight related to Rachel Chandler</a>, the Epstein sex slave-turned modeling photographer we exposed two years ago. He\'s urged anons to dig into before (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2490765">the last time, right before Voat went down for three days last April</a>).</p>
<p>He\'s made dozens of child trafficking related posts today. You can see them all, <a href="https://qanon.pub/">here</a>. A couple of notables:</p>
<p>&quot;Ray Chandler = Allison Mack x 100&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;THE STANDARD HOTEL.
RACHEL CHANDLER.&quot;</p>
<p>And he dropped a link to a new artist I hadn\'t heard of:</p>
<p>&quot; <a href="http://www.michalchelbin.com/portfolio_in.asp?id=1477&amp;type=100228&amp;sub_title=Strangely_Familiar&amp;langid=1">http://www.michalchelbin.com/portfolio_in.asp?id=1477&amp;type=100228&amp;sub_title=Strangely_Familiar&amp;langid=1</a> 
Connection to Ray Chandler? Are you awake?&quot;</p>
<p>So I did a little digging into Michal Chelbin. She\'s <a href="http://internationalphotomag.com/michal-chelbin-photo-biography/">an Israeli artist </a>who features &quot;art&quot; portrait photography of kids with dead eyes, topless preteens with their fathers in disturbing positions, <a href="http://losarciniegas.blogspot.com/2014/11/michal-chelbin-interview.html">naked underwater</a>, and groups of topless girls hugging. She <a href="https://archive.fo/dJqnD">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My images are vehicles to address universal themes: family issues, ideas of normality, puberty with its all incumbent pains and distractions, the desire for fame. An example of this is the adolescent girls I photograph, many of them are on the verge of sexual consciousness. They are in this difficult age, torn between innocence and experience. While their bodies might be still that of a child, their gaze sometimes imply differently. I try to create an informal scene, in which they directly confront the viewer. I feel they and their stories represent with most clarity the theme that interests me the most and which is the twilight zone between reality and fantasy. My aim is to record a scene where there is a mixture of direct information and enigmas and in which there are visual contrasts between young and old, large and small, normal and abnormal. My playground lies between the private and the public, between fiction and documentary. For me, the image is just the tip of the iceberg; it’s the gate to a story waiting to be told and which I try to depict in an appealing yet troubling way.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>QAnon then <a href="https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/5802771.html#5803571">dropped the link to the FBI tip line</a>, like he did last year.</p>
<p>I\'m not getting the connection between Chelbin and Rachel Chandler, though, other than they are both creepy female photographers with pedo-appeal photography.</p>
<p>While I was Google image searching Chelbin, Google offered up another &quot;art&quot; photographer doing &quot;similar&quot; work, Sally Mann. <a href="http://www.indemaudable.com/sally-mann-family-color-1991/">NSFW -- fully naked preteens</a>. The second photo in the &quot;Family Color&quot; series is a little girl on a couch, naked, with claw marks on her stomach, titled &quot;Dog Scratches.&quot; <a href="https://archive.fo/z2K05">https://archive.fo/z2K05</a></p>
<p>(NSFW) Mann is apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Mann">a famous America photographer</a> roundly criticized for her <a href="http://www.houkgallery.com/artists/sally-mann/featured-works?view=slider#3">naked kid</a> photography, including <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sally-mann-immediate-family-reissue-memoir-hold-still?verso=true">a kid in a ditch</a>, as well as her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Remains_(book)">book</a> of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sally+mann+what+remains&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqueOuJLhAhX7CTQIHd5pB4AQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1100&amp;bih=615">corpse photography</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exhibition was divided into five sections that &quot;visually depict[ed] the eternal cycle of life, death, and regeneration.&quot;[5]</p>
<p>Mann was inspired to produce the photographs in the book by her reactions to several different events. The first of these was the death of her father; later events that inspired her interest in death were the shooting of a prison escapee on the grounds of her Lexington, Virginia, farm and the death of her pet greyhound, Eva.[2] Mann arranged for Eva\'s skin to be preserved by tanning and buried her body in a cage in order to prevent the remains from being carried off by wild animals. She later dug up the cage and photographed the dog\'s skeletal remains.[2][6] A series of photos documenting Eva\'s decomposition is included in the book.[1][7]</p>
<p>Despite the fact that some critics found the images off-putting, Mann expressed surprise that the book did not garner the controversy of her previous books which featured nude photos of her young children. While giving the book a favourable review, Blake Morrison expressed his surprise that no one had questioned her right to publish photographs of the dead when there had been extensive protests over her images of her children.[2] </p>

<p>Nothing to see, there!?</p>
<p>Anyone care to dig more? I\'m short on time at the moment. Neither of these artists came up in a SearchVoat of our archives.</p>',

           And he dropped a link to a new artist I hadn't heard of:

           While I was Google image searching Chelbin, Google offered up another "art" photographer doing "similar" work, Sally Mann.

            Posting this here for better visibility, it's an interview with Swedish photographer Hanna Liden, who is connected to Rachel Chandler.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might want to watch this video about her work first:

           </p>
           <p>
            Her photos invoke scenarios of ritual abuse.
           </p>

           <p>
            'Thirty-four-year-old artist Hanna Liden first made her mark on the New York art scene in the mid-2000s with a series of bleak color landscape photographs populated by menacing masked youths.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a way, these works are nature studies—rugged quarries, placid lakes, overgrown fields, and leafless forests, which give a primal, prehistoric aura.
            <strong>
             But it was the rough, gangly figures
            </strong>
            looming under Liden’s overcast skies that made her work feel so urban, delinquent, and hostile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Liden’s photographs, many of which were shot in the countryside of her native Sweden, were in some ways just as indicative of the fast-paced downtown subculture as the more streetwise art productions of her friends Nate Lowman, Agathe Snow, and the late Dash Snow.
           </p>
           <p>
            But in the last two years, Liden has refined her vision,
            <strong>
             producing a new set of images that look simultaneously like pagan rituals and contemporary psychograms.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            She’s now taken her photography inside, making her studio the primary setting, and using elaborate or found props in her self-portraits and still lifes. Earlier this year, she presented a series of shots of blackened candles, their silhouettes taking the haunting form of a demolished city skyline.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Liden’s subject matter tends toward the dark side
            </strong>
            , but she has plenty of people in New York who love her.
           </p>
           <p>
            This month, she and Nate Lowman are collaborating on an exhibit together at Salon 94 gallery on the Upper East Side, which will not only showcase their varying histories of landscape photography and painting, but will also include more intimate notes, drawings, and paraphernalia of their long friendship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here, the two talk at Liden’s Chinatown studio about art, plaster masks, and living above meth labs.
           </p>
           <p>
            NATE LOWMAN: We both came to New York in the late 1990s. What was your life like before you moved here?
           </p>
           <p>
            HANNA LIDEN: I grew up in the suburbs in Sweden, and moved into my own apartment in Stockholm at 17. I worked as a photo assistant for a Swedish celebrity photographer, and I also worked in television. But I felt like Stockholm was too provincial, so I moved to London, where I was pretty much a slacker for a year.
           </p>
           <p>
            I felt paralyzed by the cynical London mentality. During the day, I just watched movies I rented from the video store on Camden High Street, and at night I went to clubs and did Ecstasy. No future in that. So I moved to New York in 1998. I remember being culturally shocked by American optimism. Now I don’t notice it anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: Can you list all of the neighborhoods you’ve lived in in New York?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: Lower East Side, Chelsea, Upper West Side, Harlem, Williamsburg, Bushwick, SoHo, Noho . . . Now I live in Chelsea again.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: What’s the craziest thing that’s happened to you in one of those places?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: The last time I lived in Chelsea, there was a meth lab in the apartment below mine. There were always fumes in the stairway. I got high from walking up the stairs. Once, the building caught fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was home sleeping and was woken up by the sirens of 10 fire trucks outside my window. My instinct—or mood—told me to pull the sheets over my head and just wait it out. I didn’t feel like getting out of bed at all, but I was forced to when a fireman started knocking really hard on the door of my tiny studio.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I opened the door, they were already getting ready to kick it down. Five firefighters dressed in smoke gear entered my apartment. They were using some electronic device to search for heat inside the walls. They looked like they were going to knock the walls out. I just left and went to have a drink in the bar downstairs. A week later the lab was back in business.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: What are you working on art-wise now?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: I’m working on the show that I’m doing with you in November. That’s mostly about landscapes.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: The show is a pairing of my landscape paintings, which are largely of tombstones, with landscape photographs that you’ve taken in different parts of the world. But you also have a solo show before that, in Zurich.
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: Yeah, that one is almost like a photo show about painting. I realized that today. I’m building all these sets in my studio—which are still lifes—and a lot of them reference different paintings. I really wasn’t even doing that consciously.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: I’ve visited your studio on and off for years. And even when you were shooting landscapes, you were building tons of elaborate props and masks—combining handmade items with things you’d just come across and bought. Is this studio still-life photography similar to the landscapes for you? Is it basically just bringing that practice indoors?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: The still-life series came about when I was working on my show at Rivington Arms in 2006. I decided to shoot some of the props that were intended to be incorporated in the narrative landscapes. That’s how it began. Recently I did a whole still-life series with black candles. To me, those candle photos are really cityscapes, so that is really moving away from nature and bringing the work into the city.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: Yeah, they have that feeling of a skyline to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: I’ve been feeling compelled to do all of my work from start to finish in the city. I don’t have the urge to leave here as much as I did before. So this is a change in my process. I used to make so many props in my studio and they’d travel back and forth to Europe in my suitcase for shoots. There were lots of masks made from molds of my own face, in plaster, resin, papier-mâché, etc . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: What I like about your sets is that you have intensively painted backdrops and candles that you’ve burned down for hours to the exact right length. But you also do things like you suddenly add a crumpled dollar bill shoved into the mouth of a taxidermied crow, or some weird rubber eyeball that came from a 99-cents store in Chinatown.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is something extremely sculptural about your photography. They never remain in the second dimension for me. They even seem more like portraits than still lifes. You often put yourself in your work, even if it’s just a hand holding a skull.
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: Yes, I do. Even when I was doing the landscapes, I inserted people who kind of worked as representatives of myself. But lately I’ve been doing self-portraits in my studio. And besides myself, I don’t really shoot people at the moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: There is also something quite cinematic about your still lifes. Did film influence you? What films and genres are you drawn to?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: When I was 20, I watched Aguirre: The Wrath of God [1972] for several months. And I watched every other [Werner] Herzog film that I could get a hold of. I think he’s been a big spiritual inspiration.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a teenager, I loved David Lynch. I watched Eraserhead [1976] and The Elephant Man [1980] a lot. Another film that is somehow always with me is Tetsuo: The Iron Man [1989]. It’s incredibly creepy. I liked to watch the same film lots of times for a long period. I remember being very taken by A Nightmare on Elm Street [1984] as a child. It terrified me.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other big piece of film was Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” [1983]. I loved the scary, campy stuff. I never liked films about dogs and girls and boys and little mermaids and things like that. And, of course, growing up in Sweden, [Ingmar] Bergman was always on the television. I remember Fanny and Alexander [1982] always being on at Christmastime.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: Herzog and MJ should have made a movie together! Do you think that your shift toward working in the studio and away from cinematic tendencies has to do with New York City?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: I don’t think I would have ever thought of making those cinematic landscapes in the first place unless I had been in New York City—or at least in America. They were really a crossover between Nordic landscapes, paganism, and American horror cinema. But I’m not really new to the city anymore. I’ve been here for 35 percent of my life.
           </p>
           <p>
            LOWMAN: Now that most of us have made it through our twenties, who inspires you in your early thirties?
           </p>
           <p>
            LIDEN: Mostly my close friends—you, Dan Colen, Adam McEwen, Agathe Snow, and my sister Klara Liden. You’re all inspiring in a day-to-day kind of way—how to make the work, how to live, how to make it work.

              10 Strange Stories About The Fascinating Guinness Family
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1929, socialite Diana Mitford married Arthur’s distant descendant, Bryan Guinness. They had two children, Desmond and Jonathan, who would go on to inherit the Guinness empire. Their mother’s story, however, is a pretty baffling one. In the early 1930s, she began an affair with the leader of the British Union of Fascists, Oswald Mosley. Mosley, who was also married, refused to divorce his wife for her but married Diana once she had died—after Diana left her husband.They were married in the drawing room of Joseph Goebbels, with Adolf Hitler himself in attendance. Diana and her sister Unity had a close friendship with Hitler, which Diana would defend until the day she died, once declaring: “The man I knew could not have done all that. Perhaps he went a little mad.” Along with her sons by Bryan Guinness, Diana lived in Germany throughout the 1930s, although they would eventually move back after the war broke out. Her children with Mosley were forced to rely on private tutors, since no British school would accept them as pupils.To make things even more complicated, Diana was also related to Winston Churchill—his wife was her father’s cousin. During the war, Diana and Oswald were briefly imprisoned under a law that allowed the wartime government to jail anyone that they deemed a threat to national security—they were accused of helping to establish pro-Nazi radio stations in Germany. Thanks to their ties with Churchill, the Mosleys didn’t suffer too much—they were allowed a small house, private gardens, and could even recruit other prisoners to be their personal servants.After the war, they lived mostly in France, near their good friends the Duke of Windsor and Wallace Simpson, although they frequently returned to England—especially to help the campaign to prevent non-white immigration into the country.

               Wait, you're saying that Rachel Chandler married the grandson of a woman who was close friends with Hitler and Goebbels? Did I get that right? You are fucking kidding me.

             And the same BS happened with the sadomasochist bisexual freak Alfred Kinsey's 'research' (more fascism and child abuse/rape/murder).   Recall the

              The Story of Moira Greyland (daughter of 'Mists of Avalon' author, Marion Zimmer Bradley) &amp; SciFi loving Pedo, Walter Breen
             </a>
             The mother hated her daughter but felt that she had to abuse her sexually 'for her own good'.  These sick people teach incest and child molestation and rape.  There's a sickness within parts of the letter community that believes it too, especially the gay pedos, and they believe not just that they're 'equal' but that they are superior to heterosexuals.  They believe that the world needs to free the children (those lucky enough not to butchered at birth)  from "hang ups" and from their parents not sexually fondling them.

              I had been claiming right along that there was an incon- trovertible link between the smut and pornography peddlers and the sex instruction promoters. This tie becomes clearer every day.
             </p>
             <p>
              For instance, I discovered that the very first nudity group in the nation was an outfit called Nature Friends. They es- tablished the first “skin camps” in America through the au- spices of the Communist Party in the early Thirties. The name of the camp was Midvale and it was located just off the Snake Dew Road, Wanaque, New Jersey.
             </p>
             <p>
              Midvale is still in existence, with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover announcing that the camp is a “Communist training area.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The club they referred to was the W.E.B. DuBois Club, a Communist youth group named after a Negro traitor who fled to Africa and died there some years ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              The camp was a permanent facility maintained by the Com- munist Party and top Party officials who acted as teachers for youth in attendance there.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1967 a group of campers was raided by South Carolina mountaineers who had heard all about their nudity, free love and integration in a summer camp in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
             </p>
             <p>
              A number of those campers fled north to Midvale, where they could be safer.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nature Friends was, and still is, an international arm of the Communist conspiracy, formed in most countries of the western world, with chapters and camps in scores of cities and states in America.
             </p>
             <p>
              The purpose of the camps was described in the hearing of the Special Committee on UnAmerican Activities, 75th Congress, Volume One, page 556.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Nature Friends seem to receive more attention than any other unit. This organization is widely organized throughout the country. It not only maintains outdoor activities, but it also operates an agit-prop (agitation and propaganda) section, music groups, film and photo sections (lewd, nudie films), chess groups, gymnastics, dance groups, scouts, lecture groups and summer camps.”
             </p>
             <p>
              In the Guide to Subversive Organizations of the United States Congress, “Nature Friends” is called “an international Communist affiliated movement which swept over our nation through its appeal to lovers of outdoors.”
             </p>
             <p>
              At one time the camps had 170,000 American members who took part in 400 physical activities.
             </p>
             <p>
              The UnAmerican Activities report ends with, “Whether or not Nature Friends are in any way connected with the nudist fashion is not yet known, but it is common knowledge that nude bathing among mixed sexes is practiced at Communist summer camps.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, skinny-dipping and what not, is de rigeur these days on college campuses, at hippie festivals and at Sensitivity Training sessions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the Congressional report was issued it has been proven that nudity did prevail at Midvale and the other related camps.
             </p>
             <p>
              Herman Thomas, an FBI undercover agent, reported to the 84th Congress, “I attended several closed meetings of the Communist Party with Frances (Grabow), but on one of the latest occasions, after the party went underground in 1950 (when Joe McCarthy was hot on their tails before the U.S. government shut him up permanently), I met her and another member friend of the Communist Party at an affair at the Nature Friends Camp near Valley, Pennsylvania. I made ar- rangements there with the other person to pick up Communist Party literature in Philadelphia, inasmuch as they weren’t using the mails ...”
             </p>
             <p>
              So, what does all this have to do with the public schools and sex instruction?
             </p>
             <p>
              Well, read on and you’ll find out.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Los Angeles based Elysium Institute exists for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is to promote free love and nudity.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ed Lange,* head of the group, publishes a number of maga- zines such as “Ankh,” “Nude Living,” “Sun Disc,” “Nude Lark” and “Nudist Idea.”
             </p>
             <p>
              He also publishes the official magazine of the American Sunbathing Association called Nudism Today.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lange is vociferously in favor of school sex instruction and in his magazine was listed a chart of affiliated organizations. Among that assorted group of not-so-odd outfits (if you really know what they are up to) is dear old SIECUS, along with assorted nudie and psycho-political organizations.
             </p>
             <p>
              For instance, Elysium describes itself as “a non-profit organization whose real purpose is research and dissemination of information in the behavioral sciences relating to nudity and the body taboo neuroses so prevalent in our nation. The Institute promotes self acceptance of others through a whole- some attitude toward the human body and its functions, both physical and emotional, including sexuality.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, if you substitute the word “sexuality” for the word “nudity” you have pretty well found the self description used by SIECUS.
             </p>
             <p>
              *Lange was arrested in July, 1970 on a variety of charges.

              When Dr. Mary Calderone spoke in Santa Monica in 1969, she was approached by Mrs. Lillian Drake, co-producer of an anti-sex instruction film called “Pavlov’s Children.” Mrs. Calderone first attempted to deny that her group’s name appeared in nudie magazines, according to Mrs. Drake, and then, when faced with the magazine as evidence, “flew into a huff and brushed me off.”

            I recall reading a while back that Michael Stipe of REM fame was an avid collector of Sally Mann's paedophilic "art" (Stipe was also named in a CDAN blind item as having raped a young Jonathan Rhys-Meyers during the filming of
            <em>
             Velvet Goldmine
            </em>
            , which Stipe co-produced with the Weinstein brothers, no less!)

             I heard a lot of rumors in the 90s that Stipe was a major "pizza" aficionado.

            Disturbing? Somewhat, some of it. Is some of this considered pornography though? I would disagree with that. Doesn't really show anything. Pretty strange though.

              I've thought about it. Now I think it's simply a liberal (weirdo loser) con artist (parasite) "alarm". The people that I've seen in all of these things are acting. EASY to look disturbed if you know how to exploit. These parasite losers think they can play us (taxdollars? donations?) like a fiddle.

               It's the same as Obama's Presidential portrait - Obama in the chair surrounded by flowers.  Obama had a relationship with "Wendy"... a child.  This child was photographed often by a pedophile photographer.  The photo I attached was taken by a notorious pedophile photographer.  Have you ever seen the meme "Where are the children?  Obama knows."  How odd that this pedophile portrait is so similar to Obama's portrait. Coincidenc?

             So, if Chandler and Chelbin are both handlers for children being trafficked to exclusive Caribbean island resorts frequented by the elite, the "art" photography could basically be a shopping catalog.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could the "nodes" embedded in the Chelbin site be to help shoppers find other handlers?

              Well, in the case of Chandler I'm sure it is. Dianne Chandler seems to have been a former Playboy model, possibly Rachel Chandler's mother (but that's not proven).

              SANDY HOOK SHOOTER’S PSYCHIATRIST ARRESTED
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On December 17, 2012 Connecticut police reached Dr. Fox to interview him about the Adam Lanza case. The psychiatrist had moved to New Zealand after things had gotten a bit hot for him in the Northeast.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just six months earlier, the 59 year old psychiatrist had been accused of sexual assault of a female patient while practicing as a psychiatrist in Brookfield, Connecticut. The patient in question was 19 years old, and state records show that Fox prescribed her “three to four” psychiatric drugs and also gave her free samples. The girl’s mother stated her daughter “was turning into a zombie.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Following this accusation, Dr. Fox voluntarily gave up his license to practice in New York and Connecticut and began working as a psychiatrist in New Zealand, almost 9,000 miles away from his former office.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..&gt;..During his time in New Zealand, he treated Nicky Stevens, the son of local politician Dave Macpherson. Nicky died while under psychiatric care.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dr. Fox was de-registered by the New Zealand Medical Council in February 2014. When Dr. Fox moved back to Maine he discovered his sexual abuse of patients in Connecticut had not been forgotten by the authorities. He was arrested at his home in Peaks Island, Maine on April 20th, 2016 by detectives and Homeland Security Agents and charged with three counts of second-degree sexual assault.

              Dr. Fox had prescribed the antidepressant Lexapro for Adam. Both Adam and his mother Nancy were reluctant to use the medication. Kathleen Koenig, a nurse specialist in psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center convinced them to try it.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Did Adam Lanza, while under the psychiatric care of Dr. Fox or while a patient at Yale Child Study Center, participate in a clinical trial? (In other words, was Lanza receiving experimental treatments?)

              As part of her ( Hillary's ) focus on children's welfare and the law, she expanded her studies to children's psychology and development at the Yale Child Study Center, where she helped research the book Beyond the Best Interest of the Child, by Anna Freud, Al Solnit, and Sally Provence.

            Fuckin' aye, you guys are already on it while I'm just reading up. Keep the effort going, before any other distractions throw us off the mark again. The more progress we make in this window, I suspect the more confirmation we get from Q. I'll try look into the Standard Hotel connection, using 7 different search engines if I need. Then I'll reverse-image search some photos, see what other websites or endorsements show up.

            finish this Ray Chandler connection, I felt, and evidently so did Q. Maybe one of the

             "You have more than you know"
            </em>
            references. This is amazing the see such coordinated response times and research. I'm humbled to ride with your waves, guys.

             Yes. Or "Haiti". It's very frustrating. Folks get burned out. We just have to keep coming back and taking a stab at it again. We are much, much stronger now than we were before. Just on Voat, we've got three times as many people tuned into this as we did a year ago (and that doesn't even count the number of folks who are now active across multiple platforms like 8chan and Twitter).

            Chelbin's photos seem to depict many Eastern European children / teenagers. A possibility would be that she takes pics, and someone in the US decides which of the children depicted will be trafficked.

            Chandler runs a modeling agency = many of her models look like trafficking victims. There are many established lines of trafficking from Eastern Europe to the US, partly via Mexico / South America (remember Epstein).

              It was not only obvious that he was into girls, 'many of them are on the younger side', it seems to have been obvious too that he got girls from
              <em>
               Eastern
              </em>
              countries, and kept them at his NY town house. I recall reading that someone thought it was totally weird that so many girls from Eastern Europe were at this parties (the kind of parties Prince Andrew attended).

                Err....@Vindicator? There are photos of Epstein with Trump and Melania. You have seen them. Melania's phone number is in his little black book (IIRC), together with lots of phone numbers of Trump and the Mar-a-Lago staff. Since he was a Mar-A-Lago member.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you want me to do a post with photos of the occasions when Trump and Melania were photographed with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell?

                    IIRC, Epstein's mansion is quite close to Mar-a-Lago. The mansion where he got massages from girls every day several times a day, and raped some of them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Epstein was a member of Mar-A-Lago.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    He and Ghislaine Maxwell felt so safe there, they even groomed one of Trump's towel girls.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump said many of Epstein's women were 'on the younger side'.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think he didn't mean Ghislaine Maxwell when he was saying that. /s
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Imo, Trump knew perfectly well what Epstein did.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump might not be sophisticated, but he isn't an idiot. He would have been a bad club owner and businessman, if he hadn't known about Epstein's activities.

                   <p>
                    Do you think he never heard about the 'Lolita Express'?

                      In Miami, the runaway became a captive of a 65-year-old sex trafficker, Ron Eppinger. For months, she says, she was sexually abused, kept in an apartment and pimped out to pedophiles. After his indictment in 2000 on trafficking charges, Roberts returned to West Palm Beach and tried to heal.
That summer, when Roberts was 16, she said her father helped her get a job as a locker room attendant at the spa at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, records show. Her father worked at the resort as a maintenance man.

                       Chelbin's photos seem to depict many Eastern European children / teenagers. A possibility would be that she takes pics, let's say in Russia, and someone in the US decides which of the children depicted will be trafficked.

                       Chandler runs a modeling agency = many of her models look like trafficking victims. There are many established lines of trafficking from Eastern Europe to the US, partly via Mexico / South America (remember Epstein).

                       Further speculation: Chandler might employ a bunch of scouts who take pics of Eastern European children and teenagers.

You think Trump is a complicit part of pedophile Epstein's grooming of young girls, you think Melania is implicit in it and you make snarky remarks about Ivanka having worked for Balazs (which btw, I did find the answer to your question, the truth is not so convicting and presumptive of some kind of guilt as your comment implied) and FWIW, Balazs said he didn't know Trump that well (2017 interview).

                       Thanks for linking that. I hadn't seen that before. That looks like a bunch of people standing around for a large event, not the Trumps "socializing" with Epstein and Maxwell, which implies a deliberate seeking out of each other's company. What event was this?

                       So Epstein was almost 50 years old at the time. Which means Trump (or any other normal person) could see him with a 22 year old and make that cradle robber jab. The article that quotes him that you linked refers twice to Epstein being a "ladies man", yet it never mentions involvement with young models, teens, or kids. I think it's a pretty big leap to claim Trump "obviously" knew about Epstein's "proclivities."

                        I disagree. Trump was 66/67 in 2002 when he made that comment. (Older than Epstein)
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Also Trump met Melania when he was 52 and she was 25/26. So by that same standard Trump is into "young women"
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        IMO that isn't what he's referring to. He's saying both are into women, but Jeffrey likes them "on the younger side."
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So either Trump knew, or he didn't and made a dig at Epstein for doing the same thing Trump is/was known for (dating young models)
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Now even if Trump knew, I don't necessarily think he was involved.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Considering the NY mag interview was in 2002 and Epstein was soliciting at mar a lago a few years later, I could see Epstein interpreting Trump's quote as tacit approval, and beginning to recruit from mar a lago.

                           Playing the victim, now, after you deliberately created drama twice in this submission, huh. Okay. Here is what you said:

                            . Makes me wonder how she felt when they socialized with Epstein.

                            It was not only obvious that he was into girls, 'many of them are on the younger side', it seems to have been obvious too that he got girls from Eastern countries, and kept them at his NY town house."
                           </p>
                          </blockquote>
                          <p>
                           That is a clear statement by you that the Trumps were socializing with Epstein with full knowledge he was raping underage girls.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           You then went on to implicate Trump because Epstein was a member of his club and Maxwell recruited one of the girls there. You claimed there were multiple photos of them socializing together with Epstein, and they were on such intimate terms that Melania's phone number was in his address book. Furthermore, when asked clarifying questions about when these things occurred in relation to the girl coming forward, you dismissed the idea the Trumps did not know he was trafficking kids when they attended gatherings he also attended.
                          </p>

                           You don't now get to play stupid and claim I am "making things up". You painted a picture of Melania, a model from Eastern Europe well acquainted with the pitfalls of her industry, as going along with child rape.

You have a photo in your OP that shows George Nader, it was posted by Q, then you should allow a discussion why a major GOP donor and Trump ally like Erik Prince employs him, and why Q doesn't call him out for that.

                               Also, this is more BS. You've spent the last several days painting me as a shill for Trump, claiming I "worship" him and "glorify him" and a bunch of other hogwash when you can't defend your position. You need to take a serious look in the mirror.

                                you both want the same thing. The liberation of the children who have been enslaved and used for both MKUltra and Sexual slavery for blackmail and elite depraved sick nutjobs. You both have fought off shill after shill attacks, have moderated the effort when Reddit destroyed the Pizzagate subverse, and both did so much for this community. This fight is so unnecessary, for both of you. Vindicator you are in the wrong to tell think- to fuck off, but think is in the wrong to imply you a satanist all over argociv and Aquino dispute. Sigh I wish you both would simply just actually talk this out instead of just attacking each other. Been through too much for that ya know?

                                  Ah sorry misread that then. I do mean it though, this fight is beneath you guys. I know what you mean about Trump and Vindicator I know think is not trying to disrespect FLOTUS, she is saying we should be weary of of Trump and both sides due to what we know about elites. Nothing is wrong with that. No problem think.

                            You can be sure that she (Melania) knows a couple of things. Makes me wonder how she felt when they socialized with Epstein.

                            IIRC, Epstein's mansion is quite close to Mar-a-Lago. The mansion where he got massages from girls every day several times a day, and raped some of them.
Epstein was a member of Mar-A-Lago.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            He and Ghislaine Maxwell felt so safe there, they even groomed one of Trump's towel girls.
Trump said many of Epstein's women were 'on the younger side'.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I think he didn't mean Ghislaine Maxwell when he was saying that. /s
Imo, Trump knew perfectly well what Epstein did.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Trump might not be sophisticated, but he isn't an idiot. He would have been a bad club owner and businessman, if he hadn't known about Epstein's activities.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Do you think he never heard about the 'Lolita Express'?

                           Wasn't your real concern in writing about this is that you believe Trump is doing nothing?  As in, "he knew then and did nothing, and he's not doing anything now" (In fact you seem to believe much worse than that)

                             two things regarding the 'much worse than this'.  It's one thing to say that he knew Epstein was attracted to women 'on the younger side' (legal age is 'on the younger side', early twenties 'is on the younger side'.  We don't know if Trump saw Epstein with underage girls at that time.  Epstein claimed to 'own the police department', is that something Trump was supposed to know too?

                            <p>
                             At any rate, It's something else to make a case that given the proximity of Epstein's estate, that Trump would know what was happening in the privacy of that estate.  Or that Trump was eyes on Epstein 24/7 because he was member at the club.  How often did he visit the club when he's so busy raping girls at the estate.  No rapes happened at Mar a Lago right?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Talking about 'how close it was, multiple rapes day in and day out' and then say they felt so comfortable as to groom a towel girl from the resort. (a victim of previous sex trafficking, likely very vulnerable to someone like Ghislaine approaching her.)  Is Trump hanging out in the locker room, watching what the members are doing?  Why wouldn't the girls father know about sex rings at the hotel, he was the maintenance man who got his daughter the job there.

                             All I'm saying is that's your animosity towards Trump and Melania are evident in how you phrase things. So saying you never meant to imply this or that, comes off sounding disingenuous.  Like high school level.  That's why I called it word games.

            as a consultant. = Still is employed as of today.

           <p>
            Yep. That's the same Eric Prince who has called out HRC, and is a Trump ally.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             George Nader
            </p>
            <p>
             George Nader (Arabic: جورج نادر‎, born 1959) is a Lebanese-American businessman, lobbyist, and convicted sex offender.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has acted as an unofficial liaison between Washington politicians and Middle Eastern officials.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader is an adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates and a consultant to Blackwater founder Erik Prince.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Nader was sentenced in the 1990s for transporting child pornography publications, and imprisoned in 2003 for sexually abusing 10 boys in the Czech Republic.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Erik Prince, founder of security firm Blackwater hired Nader to help with contracts with the Iraqi government; in a 2010 deposition Prince identified him as a "business development consultant".
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In August 2016, Nader met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower offering assistance to the his father's presidential campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader served as an envoy representing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammad bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The meeting included Blackwater founder Erik Prince again and Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) officials and president-elect Donald Trump's associates Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, and Steve Bannon.

              Please read my first line. Nader is on the photo Chelbin might have taken in the pool with Bill Clinton. You mentioned that in your OP.
             </p>
             <p>
              =&gt; Therefore I posted excerpts from Nader's bio on Wikipedia.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a pic provided by Q, right?
             </p>
             <p>
              =&gt; Therefore I asked why Q has never called out Erik Prince, who knows that Nader is a pedo, and employs him nevertheless.
             </p>
             <p>
              =&gt; Therefore I mentioned that Nader even had meetings with Kushner and Trump Jr. = was accepted by them although he is a pedo.
             </p>
             <p>
              =&gt; I recently said Republican pedos and pedos in the military were laughing their a**es off, since Q only targets Dem pedos.
             </p>
             <p>
              You didn't seem to understand what I meant. Therefore I delved into Erik Prince, a prime example for a military industrial complex guy whom Q leaves alone.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although Q now has called out Bill Clinton, shown in a pool with George Nader. The photo which led people here asking whether Chelbin might have been the photographer, and/or in other ways connected to the guys in the pool.

               The post was not about the picture Q posted. It was about why he posted it. I didn't even add that picture to the OP until a couple of hours ago, because I didn't realize it was related until really late last night after I'd already made the submission.

              <p>
               The MSNBC video you linked claiming Blackwater is doing these things is based completely on unnamed sources.

              <p>
               Are you claiming Prince is part of Dyncorp and therefore associated with their child trafficking? There's no support for that in what you linked. The link quotes an NYT article that says the two companies presented proposals to Mattis about the feasibility of using private contractors in Afghanistan, both of which he declined (and which Trump therefore never implemented). That site reeked of Snopes-tier fake news, though, so I dug in a bit further.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Task &amp; Purpose," a leftist blog targeting rank and file military families, is clearly very strongly biased against Prince,
               <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/erik-prince-blackwater-trump-russia">
                whom they ridicule
               </a>
               as a "Jack Ryan" LARPer and "Noted Asshole" with a "private trigger-pulling company" that did "cowboy shit" that "made everybody else's life harder in Iraq." Their About page is
               <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/st/about-us">
                conspicuously blank
               </a>
               . The writer and editor, Adam Weinstein (formerly of Village Voice, Gawker and Mother Jones), recently quit in a huff when the site's CEO asked him to take the spin out of a headline because readers were complaining about the biased writing. He also appears to have an uncommon level of butthurt about Prince's religion, calling him a "Christian Crusader".
              </p>
              <p>
               Their Prince reportage in
               <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/erik-prince-blackwater-trump-russia">
                this piece
               </a>
               linked in the one you cited as evidence they are part of Dyncorp child trafficking, is based on the Washington Compost, a CIA propaganda racket that also employs John Podesta, which probably explains why they are pushing the debunked Russian Collusion narrative claiming Manafort was working for Trump and Russia when we now know
               <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/435029-as-russia-collusion-fades-ukrainian-plot-to-help-clinton-emerges">
                he was really working for Tony Podesta and Hillary
               </a>
               to try to sting Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wouldn't call these trustworthy sources, by any stretch, and certainly insufficient to know with any confidence what exactly happened with Blackwater. They don't prove anything, other than that Cabal people hate Prince.
              </p>
              <p>
               All this is not to say that I think Prince is a good guy. He's one of the few people who has publicly confirmed pizzagate is real, and appears to be involved in some pretty heavy spy vs. spy machinations for at least the past decade. Reading his bio, it's safe to say he knows where a lot of bodies are buried. I can certainly see why he would be valuable to Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not like there is some spotless group of insiders who
               <em>
                have

               that kind of knowledge that Trump could recruit to help him drain the swamp.

               Stratfor is probably tied in there somewhere too. I never really did any deep digging on the defense contractor stuff aside from being familiar with the names/entities that were revealed via wikileaks.

                Well, here we have someone - Erik Prince - who knowingly employs pedos, at least one of them a convicted one, who has a company where men use underage prostitutes, and Prince doesn't give a shit; and on top of all this he teams up with DynCorp, who has a disturbing history of being involved in child trafficking and organ trafficking.
               </p>
               <p>
                (And I'm not even talking about money laundering etc. which he is obviously also being involved in, or his employees killing civilians in situations where it wasn't justified.)
               </p>
               <p>
                And, so we have someone who endorses pedophile behaviour, and exactly how many times has Q called him out?

                 I can't speak as to what Q did or did not do or why. As you know I don't follow that. I will say that the swamp is the swamp precisely because these people keep getting recycled across different administrations. When positions need filled at that level of government they get filled by the most 'qualified' people from a very small pool of those who have the specialized experience, skill set and connections. Which is why these same people keep popping up over and over again. The thing is that most of the qualified people are either mired in this stuff in some capacity or have connections to the ones who are. It's a small world and the players protect and promote one another regardless of which party is in charge. Prince is definitely slimy. Dunno about his sister.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will also say that I don't believe for one second that Trump is complicit in this if that is what you are implying. If there was real dirt on him they would have used it to take him out in the primaries and served us up the 'choice' of Clinton or Bush and nothing would have changed. I also don't think he understood exactly what he was getting into given the amount of turnover there has been in his administration since he got in.

                  Define 'complicit'. I define it as 'looking the other way', and 'cooperating with people and companies regardless of their shady and criminal activities'.

                  Sending Kushner and Roger Stone to meet with a convicted pedo as if this would be a normal thing to do is being 'complicit'.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Looking the other way when your buddy, mentor and attorney is (at best) friends with pedos, and is working for pedos, or maybe even running a child rape blackmail racket is being complicit.

                  Tolerating Epstein in his Mar-a-Lago club is being 'complicit'.

                  Giving money to dirty military industrial complex companies like DynCorp, who have been known for being involved in 
child trafficking and organ trafficking is being 'complicit'.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And if we allege Q = Trump's PR department, stating 'Trump is saviour, military is saviour' is frightening.

                 <p>
                  Last time I checked, Christ was saviour. Pushing the idea of military tribunals like Q does is the first step to facism.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Trump is endorsing, supporting and financing the dirty military industrial complex. Q obviously doesn't indend to call these people out for their pedo activities.

                  This is not the way it works. You have dirt on people, and you keep them in check with it. He would not have been able to become POTUS if they

                  He doesn't have the people skills he would need in this position. That's one reason for the turnover.

                    No. I think that the whole 'muh Russian collusion' story misses the point, and is a psy-op by the globalists.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I never could wrap my head around why Trump seemed to like Putin so much though when he first came into office.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Then I read about his Trump Tower-in-Moscow-plans, and I thought 'bingo'.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But that's about it. I think he had business interests in Russia, not that there was any big 'Russian collusion' regarding the elections.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The irony of the whole 'muh Russian collusion' story is that, of course, the Dems have always had ties to Russia, which they did not handle in a - ahem - very transparent way.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    According to the
                    <em>
                     Daily Mail
                    </em>
                    , Nader gave $ 2,000,000 to an Israeli company specialized in Social Media campaigns after the election. He, Prince and the Israeli company's Psy-Group's CEO allegedly met before the election to discuss a Social Media campaign in order to support Trump.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think this is likely true, since it is no surprise that the Saudis (&gt; Nader), the military industrial complex (&gt; Prince) and the Israelis (&gt; Social Media company 'Psy-Group') wanted Trump to become POTUS.

                   I think you are misreading the situation. That said I really don't want to get into it about Trump. I'm not here for that. Please don't take this personally because this isn't about you at all and I don't want you take it that way. I both like and respect you and I have no issue with your opinions on this topic even though we happen to disagree. This is simply my position and thoughts on the matter in general and they are not going to change barring a betrayal of epic proportion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Trump is not like them. There is no real evidence he is like them aside form the Epstein stuff but everyone who was anyone has ties to Epstein. That was the whole point. Seek out rich and powerful people and compromise them. I've looked through all of the shit they threw at him from the very beginning of his campaign. You have some idea of how autistically thorough I can be and I have seen nothing that would indicate he is part of 'the club'. Don't just take my word for it. By all means dig as much as you feel the need to. I'll not discourage you from that. I'm just not interested in participating because I came to my own conclusions a long time ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Conversely, I will not do the work of the deranged (((progressive))) pieces of shit that are in the process of gleefully destroying what is left of my country culturally, economically and demographically. These same people who are doing their damndest to convince a generation of children that it is perfectly normal for them to choose their own gender. These people who delight in the perversion of every tradition, moral standard and religious belief that was responsible for the very creation my country and the formation of my own values. I cannot adequately express the disdain and disgust I hold for these people. I will not hand them ammunition in the form of information that they will then warp and use as a weapon against me and everything I stand for. I will not do it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Trump has been attempting to do everything he said he would before he took office. The forces aligned against him are not doing so as part of some elaborate psyop. (((Hollywood))) (((MSM))) (((Social Media))) They absolutely fucking loathe him to the bottom of their black souls. There is a reason the voices of his supporters are silenced and censored across the breadth of the social media landscape. Hell, it's how a lot us found our way here. There is a reason the propaganda level has been cranked up to twelve over the last few years; they even ripped the damn knob off and threw it away. If he is taken down there will be blood in the streets. I'd like to avoid that if at all possible. I'm not entirely sure that it is over the long run to be quite honest. I don't know if one man is even capable of altering a system so vile, corrupt and entrenched. I hope so because the alternative is exceedingly violent and messy and the eventual outcome is far from clear. I remain optimistic because to choose otherwise leads to a descent into nihilism and self-hatred. If he is not the change perhaps he is the agent necessary for that change to occur. Only time will tell.

              I don't think so. Trump was connected to Cohn when he was younger, and Cohn was pedo and mob central in NYC, and even beyond. Cohn had good friends who were pedos, like former NY archbishop Spellman, and also Craig Spence, who was involved in blackmail operations. Former NYPD Jim Rothstein, former senator John DeCamp, and one of the ex-wives of L. Rosenstiel (buddy of Cohn, who was connected to Sam Bronfman) all say that Cohn ran child rape blackmail operations.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump gave more money than the Obama administration to defense contractors like Dyncorp. He obviously just doesn't give a shit how dodgy the characters are he is doing business with.
             </p>
             <p>
              He made John Bolton his NSA, who is as much swamp creature as it can get.

              You recently pointed out that Goldman Sachs held Backpage.com shares (for those who don't know, backpage.com got sued for allowing sex trafficking ads on its site).

              Yep. That's the same Goldman Sachs Steve Mnuchin and others Trump chose were working for.

            One of the guys pictured is George Nader. He is a convicted pedophile. He worked for Bill Clinton, but has been employed by Eric Braverman as a consultant. = Still is employed as of today.

            Yep. That's the same Eric Braverman

             George Nader
            </p>
            <p>
             George Nader (Arabic: جورج نادر‎, born 1959) is a Lebanese-American businessman, lobbyist, and convicted sex offender.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has acted as an unofficial liaison between Washington politicians and Middle Eastern officials.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader is an adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates and a consultant to Blackwater founder Erik Prince.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Nader was sentenced in the 1990s for transporting child pornography publications, and imprisoned in 2003 for sexually abusing 10 boys in the Czech Republic.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Erik Prince, founder of security firm Blackwater hired Nader to help with contracts with the Iraqi government; in a 2010 deposition Prince identified him as a "business development consultant".
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In August 2016, Nader met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower offering assistance to the his father's presidential campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader served as an envoy representing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammad bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The meeting included Blackwater founder Erik Prince again and Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nader attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) officials and president-elect Donald Trump's associates Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, and Steve Bannon.

                  Although not everyone embraced the idea of negative eugenics, “positive eugenics,” on the contrary, became part an important part of American popular culture throughout the twentieth century. Positive eugenics promoted the idea that we could improve the human stock by encouraging people with the best genetic material to breed. Many state and local governments, as well as private organizations, endorsed better breeding in a variety of interesting ways. For example, in the 1920s “Fitter Family” and “Better Baby” contests became quite a popular fad within American culture. These contests were often held at state fairs and participants were often judged alongside agricultural produce competitions. Contests sponsored by the American Eugenics Society often included signage like the one below, which mixed messages of positive and negative eugenic ideology.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  After the smoke cleared from World War II, and the atrocities of the Holocaust became evident to the world, eugenics, especially negative eugenics, began to fall out of favor. States slowly began to outlaw sterilization practices and many states repealed or weakened their eugenic marriage laws. Some states, like North Carolina, continued to quietly sterilize the “unfit” well into the latter-half of the twentieth century until activists called attention to the barbaric practice. We’ve never really rid ourselves of eugenics, however, as traces of it can still be found in popular culture. Every time I see a show like Toddlers and Tiaras, I can’t help think about how modern-day children’s beauty pageants have their roots in Better Baby Contests of the eugenic age. This thought adds a disturbing element to reality TV (As if it needed any more disturbing elements).

            This lady and family fetishises child abuse and poverty
           </p>
           <p>
            "The family portraits began in 1984, when Jessie came home from a neighbor’s, her face swollen with gnat bites. Mann put her against a wall, took a dead-on picture and called it “Damaged Child.” “That picture made me aware of the potential right under my nose,” she says. The next day, with Jessie’s face still lumpy, she arranged props around her and took more pictures. From its inception, the family series has played around with these two antagonistic elements: factual documentary and contrived fiction.
           </p>
           <p>
            For some time, Mann had been PHOTOGRAPHING YOUNG GIRLS in and around Lexington, several of whose parents had been delivered into the world by her father, for the book published in 1988 as “At Twelve.” She wanted to catch the tension in their bodies, eyes and gestures as they passed into the confused state when girls become women. The PICTURES DRAMATIZE BURGEONING SEXUALITY, while implying the more forbidden topics of INCEST and CHILD ABUSE. Mann’s laconic captions lend a parental concern, honed with a feminist edge. Some of the poses seem casual; others, carefully directed.
           </p>
           <p>
            In her pictures of her own family — like "DAMAGED CHILDREN,” with its IMPLICATION OF BATTERING, and “Flour Paste,” in which Jessie’s legs resemble a burn victim’s — Mann punches the buttons of her viewers. Upon discovering that she has stage-managed a scene, some people feel cheated, as if their emotions have been trifled with. “I hope you can get past that,” she argues. “You learn something about yourself and your own fears. Everyone surely has all those fears that I have for my children.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Mann has been criticized for treating violence with an esthete’s dispassion, for bringing out the subtle texture of blood and bruises without offering a clear political statement along the way. The IMAGERY OF DEATH fascinates her. A picture of Virginia with a BLACK EYE moved her for a long time because “you couldn’t tell if she was living or dead. It looked like one of those Victorian post-mortem photographs.” In 1987, Emmett was struck by a car and thrown 50 feet. Though he escaped critical injury, Mann saw the real thing as a warning not to pretend again. Still, “Immediate Family” includes a picture from 1989 that may be the most gruesome so far: a NUDE VIRGINIA seeming to havE HANGED HERSELF BY A ROPE from a tree."

             <p>
              As she writes in the introduction to “Immediate Family,” Sally Mann inherited the role of provocateur from her father, Robert Munger, a doctor who made house calls in an Aston Martin and delivered hundreds of babies in Lexington. A renowned gardener, with shrubs and trees from around the world, he was also an atheist and an amateur artist whose keen sense of the perverse delighted his two sons and daughter. For a long time he kept a white, snakelike figure on the dining-room table; only slowly did anyone realize it was petrified dog excrement."

              "It was he who instilled a shameless attitude toward the flesh in his daughter, photographing her nude as a girl — “terrible art pictures,” says Mann with a groan — and posing himself unclothed for a recumbent sculpture that now occupies a shelf in his wife’s den. Mann’s introduction expresses stronger memories for the black woman, Virginia Carter, who oversaw her upbringing than for her own mother. Elizabeth Munger, a dead ringer for her daughter, says, “Sally may look like me, but inside she’s her father’s child.”

              This is the same issue Berger writes about in Ways of Seeing. Art has historically objectified the subjects it depicts. Images of Children and women both are for the male viewing eye.

             <p>
              In one image from the book (shown to the right), Mann says that the young girl was extremely reluctant to stand closer to her mother's boyfriend. Mann said that she thought it was strange because “it was their peculiar familiarity that had provoked this photograph in the first place”.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mann didn't want to crop out the girl's elbow but the girl refused to move in closer. According to Mann, the girl's mother shot her boyfriend in the face with a .22 several months later. In court the mother “testified that while she worked nights at a local truck stop he was ‘at home partying and harassing my daughter.’” Mann said “the child put it to me somewhat more directly”. Mann says that she now looks at this photograph with “a jaggy chill of realization”.

            Also I recall reading Sally mann's dad was a perv and photographed her naked as a girl. I'm trying to find the article, but this says a bit about him (Robert Munger)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mann herself didn't develop modesty of any kind until she was 7. Before that she refused to put on clothes, and claims to have been raised mostly by a pack of family dogs. She showed a slide to prove that as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was introduced to photography by her father, Robert Munger, the Lexington town doctor, who had some interesting artistic ideas of his own. He liked to fashion phallic Christmas ornaments and adorned the dining room table with a sculpture that was later revealed to be petrified dog feces.
            </p>
            <p>
             "He was a bit of an iconoclast, but a very quiet one. He wasn't obnoxious at all," says Mann, who is proud of her artistic heritage. In addition to showing slides of the Christmas ornament and table centerpiece in question, she showed a portrait of her father just after he died of brain cancer.

              I don't think this is meant to "trigger" or insinuate a male/female divide in likelihood to get away with abuse or abuse children.
             </p>
             <p>
              But from a societal/cultural perspective, under our current/competing popular ideologies, female provacatuers get away with more than their male cultural counterparts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Female artists get away with depicting child abuse because of optics. If a Male does it, he can more easily be criticized for objectifying the person/woman/child in the image as subservient/sexual (Ala john Berger's ways of Seeing). But women can dodge these claims more easily as being either feminist,feminine, or motherly and thus use those lenses to justify the naked/abused kids they depict

               Well, I've been thinking of all the sick stuff male artists have been doing, and getting away with. Even today. I can see where you're coming from, but I don't necessarily agree.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some of the photos by Sally Mann look exactly like some Balthus did, both have been critized for them, and both get away with it more or less in the end. It's just that I don't see male artists or 'artists' like Jeff Koons get really called out for what they're doing.

                You know I'll amend my statement.
               </p>
               <p>
                Men and women "artists" both depict child abuse, but they must hide beneath a veneer of respectability.
               </p>
               <p>
                Depending on your gender, race, POV, you can use different guises.
               </p>
               <p>
                Balthus and other male photographers often use "art" or "fashion" (Terry richardson) as the "respectable" label for their "art"
               </p>
               <p>
                I guess I think for the particular instance of naked children. Women
                <em>
                 can
                </em>
                get away with it more easily, as nudity is a part of motherhood/raising children.

            I'm wondering if were all supposed to just report them to the fbi for producing child porn, which is visible on their websites. Enough calls warrants a visit by the fbi.

             That's what happened with Chandler last April. Not sure why we're doing a replay tonight. Possibly Q is playing chicken with the deep state shitheads again. He definitely has a pattern of stirring the anon hornets nest to provoke his enemies into rash behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you look at all his posts today, he posted the pic of Clinton and bros in the water somewhere tropical at a boat-in only resort and asked if there were kids waiting on the boat. He asked who took the picture. Then he started talking about Chandler, and linked the Chelbin page. I think maybe he is saying Chelbin is a handler like Chandler, and was the one who took the pic.

At this point, this witness will do or say anything to get out of the jam he is in. What kind of jam? How about the largest collection of child porn the world has ever seen. This foreign national is one of the richest members of the richest families of the world. For dozens of years he filmed boys as young as 3 having sex with grown men. There were thousands of these boys who worked as slaves during the day and then would be forced to have sex with grown men. All filmed. That slavery practice has ended, but the boys are still imported from other countries and still raped and it is all still filmed. The FBI found out about it and now are using its existence to get him to say whatever they want him to say. Apparently these people are so rich they have their own "cloud" which is highly encrypted where all these videos are stored.
