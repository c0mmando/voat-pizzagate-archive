            I am hoping for something like but I have been hearing a lot of stuff about Trump's resignation being discussed in WH.  I am close to this area/circles.  Either the greatest 2,000,000D chess move is about to be played or a massive disappointment that might incite violence and it was all a trap.  I really don't know how this is going to play out.

               That is exactly what I'm referring to... I speak to more anti-Trump'ers and pro-Hillary people than I do non-brainwashed folks. Anytime anything of negative value hits Trump, they are all over it. If you bring up the juxtaposition and remind them of how much worse Clinton/Podesta are/would've been - the response is nearly identical and they say "That's irrelevant! She's not the President, it doesn't matter what they did or what you think they'd do now! None of that matters!" and then they proceed to bash Trump as instructed by the MSM.

                I hear you, but the thing to remember is they're ignorant and deluded. They haven't even read the Wikieaks emails because they've read MSM's opinion of them. In other words: the narrative. So when things appear to be going into that loop, I say something like, "Well, for me it was globalization that was the deciding factor in this election. Clinton was going to combine Canada, the U.S.,, and Mexico into one big shopping mall. I want countries. I grew up in this country, and I want everyone to have the same opportunities I had. And it's not conjecture, she wrote the email and those were her words stating she wanted a one 'hemispheric government'." It usually stops them cold because: (1) they haven't read the emails so don't know whether what I'm saying is true; (2) had no idea The Cannibal Queen planned that because they're fucking idiots; and (3) at a loss for words because they don't want that either and are uncomfortable being on my side.

                 We're talking to very different people... haha, saying something of even the slightest complexity immediately triggers alarms and they explain it away, then instantly shift to how bad Trump is. It is scarily effective brainwashing tactics being applied to these lemmings. I wish I was around more liberals that could stand up to at least 5 seconds of meaningful conversation about real things.

                  Maybe you're sticking to the narrative too much. Plus I don't argue. I immediately switch to the "globalization" reason. If I went to protecting borders .... ding ding ding .... there's a narrative for that and I'm a racist, xenophobic, misogynist pig. But if I say "globalization", their eyes cloud over, their eyelids spring open, and they look like they've been spotted by border patrol. Try it ... or your version of it. I guarantee it works. It could work for me because I spent my formative years as an idiotic commie liberal so I know how I thought. I do have sympathy for the sad state of their flaccid, information-starved brains. I think the biggest and most effective strategy The Cannibal/Pedos have is somehow fostering the belief that liberals are intelligent. Now it doesn't matter if you're a mouth breather. If you aren't able to see that Michelle Obama has a dick and that Joe Biden feels up kids, you're instantly Einstein. It's a neat trick. Vote dem and add a zero to your IQ; vote repub and you reduce it to that of a shoe.

                   You are smart. I like the way you brain good. The final observation is especially true re: Dem vs. Rep and the impact it has on the "socially understood" IQ. Sadly, after processing that I have even less respect for the liberals that I engage with. But, looking at the bright side? At least I know that I should offer to cut their food and tie their shoes more often.

            I like the idea, but I am afraid there is no evidence this administration is trying to take down the elite pedo ring. The evidence suggest they are doing everything but that. The FBI is not investigating it, they are covering it up because they are involved. The DOJ and congress are also involved/corrupted. So what are you seeing? The only one we know who has a son that has directly spoke of PG, is Flynn, and he was canned. The rest is speculation/fantasy. Take your pick.

            The fact that people are specualting on "The Russians are coming!" is comical to me, since we know they are demonizing Russia because they are a power that the Cabal does not control, and a power that can protect the third world middle eastern countries we usually demolish with impunity. They already investigated it and the CIA was told to give over their evidence, and they refused. What they showed was of no value to proving the Russian did anything to our elections.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that being the case, what evidence is being cited for cointuing this charade? Why are they demanding investigations of what was already investigated? How is it that there are citizens left that respect the CIA and are unaware they don't work for America?
           </p>
           <p>
            The answer is most are still not awoke, and because of that, the propaganda press need only repeat lies daily for people to consider them the truth or possible. The CIA should be abolished, tried and executed to a man, not heeded. If the CIA is going after Trump and saying nothing to see here with Hillary, then you should already know what is going on.

            2018 is a big year, the year the republicans can get a congressional mandate if they win just one of the entrenched liberal states.

           <p>
            Their goal is to speed up the decline of the democrats, while restructuring themselves to be in power.

           <p>
            So at this stage, anything is possible.

            When I read today Flynn was asking for immunity to testify re Russia, I thought ahhh...when the camera is on him and no one can 'cut the feed/sentences etc' its all going to come out in the open.  Fantastic move, I think that the MSM are so entrenched in blaming Russia, they cannot see past it to see whats happening.  I thought they were all aware they were 'lying' about Russia, but I am now CONVINCED THEY 'BELIEVE' IT, There is a saying: 'Lie to yourself long enough and you will actually believe it!' --------------------------------  Just a few interesting ones for the records: 1)“A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.” ― Saul Bellow ------------------------- 2)“Reality denied comes back to haunt.” ― Philip K.

            ; can you please highlight those tweets, click the link button and paste in the hyperlink to the tweet urls? That way this post will qualify as a research post instead of an unsourced discussion post that has to be taken down for Rule 4. Thanks for your understanding and for setting a good example for the 3,000 new subscribers we've added in the last two weeks. :-)

              Excellent news. Something is definitely afoot. We've had a massive dropoff in shills, and folks on Twitter are saying they've seen the same thing there, on the Chans and elsewhere. Brock's heart attack may not be the only explanation.

               So... what do you think happened? I feel a strange "undercurrent" occurring... not sure if its a fluke or not, but, certain high profile individuals have been claiming to "pull back" while this surge is getting stronger.
              </p>
              <p>
               Specific to Flynn, this phrase won't stop repeating in my head "Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it"... this paired with Trump publicly supporting his push for immunity makes NO sense within the context of the current MSM narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, the media continues to undermine everything they can, no matter how pathetic or mundane. CNN is pushing a story right now with the link text reading "Does Michael Flynn deserve immunity?" - which pulls users to an opinion piece with the headline:
               <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/31/opinions/flynn-immunity-callan-opinion/index.html">
                Will immunity make Michael Flynn 'Queen for a Day'?
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               First off... for the media to determine his worthiness of immunity is pure speculation. They have nothing to go off. And as expected, this bullshit story is basically a waterfall of vague diarrhea spewing from Paul Callan's fingertips. It's pure assumption married with propaganda when there is just about zero information to go off of.
              </p>
              <p>
               Secondly, the repeated phrase "Queen for a Day" is referencing a legal term for a specific type of immunity that can be  granted. However, given that he is male, they could have used "King for a Day". Referenced from www.whitecollarcrimeresources.com:
              </p>
              <p>
               "First there is proffer letter immunity. Normally the government won't give you any more significant kind of immunity without knowing a lot about what you’re going to say. So what they do is they give you what’s called is a king for a day letter or a queen for a day letter. It’s the weakest kind of immunity. What it does, is it allows you to go in and you can talk to the government and what you say won't be used against you later in a criminal proceeding..."
              </p>
              <p>
               Another sad attempt at the MSM's 'veiled' undermining and hidden mudslinging.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's hope the swamp begins to drain ASAP.

                Well, there was
                <a href="https://twitter.com/DabneyPorte/status/847652092806176769">
                 this today on Twitter
                </a>
                . If you scroll down in the replies to her tweet, you'll see a 4chan thread that is interesting. Whether there is any link to the coke bust, I think it's very interesting Obama has left the country at this point in time.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, we have had a sudden drop in shill activity here in the last 24 hours, and I saw
                <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmVerySilky/status/847925027982979073">
                 others noticing it on Twitter
                </a>
                and the Chans as well. Could be because Brock's minions can't function independently and had a heart attack while yelling at one of them recently. Or, perhaps something is coming. There has definitely been a change of momentum.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think all of the Flynn stuff is disinfo. I think he is working with Trump and it's a set up to nail the people abusing power. I only think this because people don't just change their nature. Trump is gonna be Trump. Flynn is gonna be Flynn. I don't have any proof, just logic and common sense. :-)

            I think your scenario is far more likely than Flynn actually testifying against Trump in any way. In part based on his previous tweets. He is as woke as anybody.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Counsel to Lt. General Mike Flynn (Retired)
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Out of respect for the Committees, we will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for General Flynn and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place. But it is important to acknowledge the circumstances in which those discussions are occurring.
            </p>
            <p>
             General Flynn is a highly decorated 33-year veteran of the U.S. Army. He devoted most of his life to serving his country, spending many years away from his family fighting this nation's battles around the world. He was awarded four Bronze Stars for actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere in the war on terror. He received the Legion of Merit twice, and the Defense Superior Service Medal four times. He is a recipient of the Defense Department's Distinguished Service Award and the Intelligence Community Gold Seal Medallion for Distinguished Service, as well as numerous other decorations.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Notwithstanding his life of national service, the media are awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him. He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated. No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.
             </strong>

            It's looking like the Flynn immunity thing is a hoax.... Fake news that ALL the outlets fell for. It originated from a statement from his supposed attorney's twitter account. The account is not verified, and there has been no statement from his attorney confirming that the tweet was, in fact, genuine.

            I think your thought process on this is very realistic.  I was thinking along the lines he is going to come out with something explosive, but I was not even thinking Pedos!  How exciting this would be!

            Agreed. The theory completely spits in the face of logic and then farts on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But... I had an epiphany when trying to figure out how could this Russian narrative
            <strong>
             actually be true?
            </strong>
            It makes no sense. There's hardly motive behind it. The intel has already heard what they "needed to hear", and yet nothing damning has come to fruition against Trump and his cabinet, aside from the mere existence of conversations.

            If this is true. It would absolutely be a work of art. And how ironic... the one piece of art that the Podesta's can't display in their underground theater would ultimately land them in the hottest water imaginable.

             Appreciate your thinking, especially about the 'work of art'. We know the pedos operate on this twisted thinking - they can 'get away with these acts' yet keep them  hidden. Then they flaunt their beliefs through their art, instagram, videos, and cryptic emails.  I think I've heard a psychologist call this " leaking". They try to hide it, yet it spills out.  Same thing happening in the accusations of Flynn, Trump.  They've invented this Russian narrative because it's  how THEY think.  They're exposing their own corruption yet blaming others. 
Thanks for your post!  Hope it's true.

             And let's not forget revelations from Vault7. We know that Alphabet agencies have the capabilty to hack and leave fingerprints of a foreign entity. They could well have made it look as though Russia was meddling in US elections when in light of Vault7 disclosure the culprits were a little closer home!

              This has been swept under the rug. Needs to be reminded to people. The ability to fake fingerprints neutralizes any hacking claim. At all. Lol but they'll keep playing Goldeneye007 even though N64 is switched off

             That's a good point. However, "The approval of the Attorney General of the United States on certain orders to testify may be required, as outlined below." Source:

             It looks like a lot of cases of immunity "may" request AG approval. I'm sure some of them require it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps this meets that criteria?
            </p>
            <p>
             If so, and Sessions were to grant said immunity, that would strengthen this theory rather significantly.

            I like the way you think! I have been pondering similarly. I got a little suspicious when Trump "fired" General Flynn over not disclosing the full extent of his conversation with the Russians, to VP Pence. My first thought was that Gen. Flynn read the list with compromised politicians knowing he was being surveillanced. The leak outs him, and the mistake of excluding VP Pence close friend who is on the list, to VP Pence.
Gen. Flynn sacrificed himself to get a congressional hearing, where he can give full disclosure on the record.

           <p>
            Just a rant! But there is definitely more then Russian collusion.

             Yeah, the Pence loophole and his comrade... errr... friend, was another piece of the puzzle. Pence's reaction seemed over the top. Much more so than Trump's when reading between the lines.

            That's a good point. Trump and Bannon did a similar thing during the election when they had Melena give a speech very similar to Michelle Obama's. The press started attacking her and pretty soon we figured out it was planned all along and that Trump got a bunch of women voters who were pissed the press was attacking Melena.

            Excellent insight!  I  agree it's a very plausible scenario.  There is another post on here indicating that John Podesta is allegedly seeking an immunity deal, also.  If true, I pray Podesta is not granted immunity under any circumstances.   I trust that President Trump and his team will expose this scheme and I think your post is brilliant,

             I saw the Podesta post and I am really hoping it is fake. The FBI handed out immunity deals like candy on Halloween during HRC's email case. Rendering the ability to ever prosecute essentially impossible. Nearly everyone involved was granted immunity... and yet there was no evidence of crime?

              My name came from some post on here.   I forgot what it was originally, but somebody mangled what he was trying to say pretty badly.  So I used the name.
             </p>

              Trump is a clever schemer, but he's not a grand strategist.  This whole 3D, 4D, whateverD chess thing is giving him way to credit and trying to polish his blunders.  Remember this guy has had massive business failures often because he take giant risks and they blow up on him.  I'm from New York, I've seen this guy operate for years.  He bankrupted a football league, not just his team, the league.  The guy tried to run an airline at one point.   Remember that 900 million dollar loss on his tax return.  He took losses like that because in 1980s he was able to convince folks he was the man AND it was time of easy credit.   So he borrowed like a maniac and stepped outside the business of real estate where he knew what he was doing.  He went into the casino business and for some reason, kept building more casinos in the same small town.  So he newest casino was just stealing customers from his other casinos.  By the time he opened the Taj Mahal he borrowed so much, he needed a record profitable day, every day to pay off his loans.  But for a while the bank loans kept coming in.   He had real estate, casinos, a USFL football team, the Trump Shuttle airline (airlines are tough to run even for folks in that industry, a European style bike race in the US, The Tour de TRump.   It came crashing down on him quick.
             </p>
             <p>
              The business model for the USFL was they were going play in the spring and summer when the NFL was off.  They would get football junkies and then the hope was when the NFL wanted to expand again, they would come to these guys and boom, now you have an NFL team on the cheap.  Now Trump is an amazing salesman.....he convincned the other owners to move to the fall and compete vs the NFL.  It was a debacle.            Oh also when he was on his buying spree he bought a giant yacht.  He actually hates boats and it never left the pier, but he didn't want people saying he wasn't rich enough for a yacht.
             </p>
             <p>
              After the mid 90s he stopping buying and building.  He started branding.   Somebody else puts up the money, and actually builds the hotel or the condo tower and trump puts his name on it and charges them a fee.   One the reason he became an international businessman is New York banks wouldn't let to him any more.  But the Trump brand was still a thing and he could get your project publicity.  Prior to his own rebranding with the TV show, he was not in good shape.  His company in the 80's to 90's was private and it's private now.  But at one point, he had a public company.  You could buy stock in Donald Trump.   It was not a good idea though.  Initially the stock went way up, but if you stuck it out the whole way, you would have had a dime for every dollar you put in.  Company went bankrupt for the second time right before his TV show.
             </p>
             <p>
              The guy's a roller coaster.  He has massive highs and massive lows.   Right now he's heading low, his first pick for National Security Advisor has criminal lawyer now.   That's a massive reversal in a couple of months.

                Baffled, brooding Trump searches for new approach
               </p>
               <p>
                President Trump brought his chaos-and-loyalty theory of management into the  White House ........He now realizes this approach has flopped, and feels baffled and paralyzed by how to fix it, numerous friends and advisers tell us.
               </p>
               <p>
                This has created a toxic culture of intense suspicion and insecurity. The drama is worse than what you read.

               One of the advisors said if the White House was a piece of software, it would still be in Beta.

            Can't remember where I saw it, but shortly after Flynn was kicked out, somebody else suggested the same theory. At this point, anything is possible, anyone can turn in any direction, anybody can choose any side and then change sides again. And again. I'm more inclined to believe your theory than what the shills are saying (are we sure? yes we are!) but really, time will tell. If Flynn wants to be on the right side of history and justice, and I believe he does, we're laughing.

             That's some ridiculous foresight from whomever predicted this long-shot theory months ago. Are you saying that they are better than me?

              No, no. I'm sure it was some guy from the future coming back to give us some insight (he's probably Trump's golf buddy in the future) and in that way was cheating. You came by it honestly.
