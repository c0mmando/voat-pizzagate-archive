<p>Coming from a lawyer... I want to help focus this sub on building a case. If not interested, then i guess the post will just die out. I will ask questions and play devils advocate to help form a case (just like real prosecutors).</p>
<p>To make this on-topic, it seems as if the seth rich killing could blow pizzagate wide open, if proven true. That being said, here are my thoughts...
As of right now, everything is based in the court of public opinion. For that, the standard of proof (by how much someone would need to prove something ie beyond 50/50 vs beyond a shadow of a doubt) seems extremely high because at first glance, the DNC involvement in a murder seems unlikely and unreasonable to most people because they don\'t WANT to believe it.</p>
<p>Moving it over to the criminal prosecution world, the standard is much lower to begin. In order for police to obtain warrants and make arrests, you need to show Probable Cause. Probable cause is a &quot;fair probability.&quot; It doesn\'t even have to be better than 50/50. Probable Cause can be based on hearsay but must be reliable evidence. An anonymous source CAN be used, but only if reliable. For example, an anon source says Steve did it, with no other information, then that is not reliable. However if anon source says Steve did it and included facts that are verifiable and not of public knowledge yet, then that would be reliable.</p>
<p>so let\'s start...
Is it a fair probability that Podesta was involved?
If so, what makes it a fair probability?
Is it a fair probability that Dr. Sava was involved?
If so, what makes it a fair probability?</p>
<p>If you can establish probable cause and then show the DC police are not acting, that\'s a whole different potential crime and more evidence of the ultimate truth. If there is a cover up by DC police, you might want to find out if it was normal for each officer that reported to the scene to be there and if there are any complaints against any of them and if that was their beat. Also, what is their protocol (from their actual training, not what you suspect it to be) and did they follow it?</p>',

             Right now we have our US President being accused of collusion and everything else with Russia. Right now we have a DNC staffer who was murdered. Their names are Donald J Trump and Seth Rich. Right now we need to support our US President, Mr. Trump and also find the connection between him and Seth Rich. Wikileaks can not or will not publicly announce their source of information. And at the same time Seth Rich has been possibly unofficially named as the possible   source. Support your President and support your country. Also, find the truth for Seth Rich as he may have possibly found the truth for you. Seth Rich did not die in vain and we will find the truth one way or another. God Bless.

            This is a very interesting youtube video I watched this morning. H A Goodman is on Crosstalk: H A Goodman is keeping this going and puts up a good fight for Seth Rich and also discussion about Kim Dotcom.

            How about mathematics and probability?  According to statistician, Richard Charnin, "It’s not just about Seth Rich. Applied Mathematics indicates a virtual 100% probability of a coverup of the Seth Rich murder (and at least 6 others)."

            we need to know if Dr. Sava was on that night. If he was Seth's surgeon.  With what is at stake, records of attending surgeon could be changed.   Medics, hospital personnel, hospital records, records sent to insurance. People who went to emergency that night, we need help to confirm he was on and did the surgery

            Hey lads, I'm trying to build my own info-graphic, which will hopefully illustrate the senselessness of passing this off as tinfoil hat conspiracy. I'm using 'Keynote' on a Mac right now, but was wondering, the IG's I see in relation to Pizzagate, you can zoom into certain parts. As in, there is a Big picture of Seth Rich, with maybe a few small text bubbles, and then say, small links to Podesta, and then a big pic of Podesta, with his small links. I want to be able to zoom in on any part. This prolly hasn't explained it well, but if anyone knows what I mean, or can help advise on best programs to use, thanks. And good post btw OP

            even if you have a great case with solid evidence, you need a suspect to charge with murder. I guess it would be the doctor or someone in the hospital or ambulance who is responsible for "letting seth die" (there is no known cause of death to date). To find the shooter, we need the type of weapon and access to the street and body cams.

             Just like with criminal street gangs, once you figure out the clique responsible, you've narrowed it down. Everyone who helped in any form is guilty.

              Seems to me that the family is being intimidated. They could easily obtain the Death Certificate and file for wrongful death against the hospital and subpoena the DNC for Seth and his boss's emails to verify if he was the leaker, also respond to kim.com and ask for evidence. 
The family doesn't seem to want Seth's murder solved or they refuse to entertain the idea that he was a Bernie supporter/leaker, so its pretty clear that they have been intimidated. Bernie's own behavior and later endorsement of HRC follows that pattern. We are dealing with mass murderers who have enormous power and will stop at nothing.

                I don't know, I'm not a lawyer, but I understand that for RICO you need to assert financial damages, so maybe theft of election prevented Bernie from being elected and implementing financial policies, so a class action suit from defrauded Bernie supporters might have a claim on the basis that Seth was attempting to expose election theft? I think there is already a lawsuit against DNC but I don't know if it accuses them of murder.

           <p>
            Let me be more specific:
How would a metaphor used by writer in Vanity Fair IN JANUARY 2016 be relevant about the murder of a non high-profile person that occurred in JULY 2016?  When the person/ persons would not be familiar and when no keywords be known.  What about this caused your reasoning to fail?

            My take so far: It is fairly obvious that it is more reasonable that this was a targeted hit rather than botched robbery. Therefore, you look at who would want him dead.
            <em>
             IF
            </em>
            he is the leaker, that creates motive. You have an eyewitness saying Seth was leaker. As a detective, I would now be looking at the people who were affected most by the leak, because they would have the most motive. Do not need PC to start asking questions. However, if the subject of your investigation is intertwined with your department, you would need a neighboring agency or the FBI to take over so as there is no appearance of impropriety.

            I don't know... For me its about filling gaps. Like what hospital and who pronounced him dead.
Once we get the gap info, then we can narrow down.

            I would FOIA the hospital he was taken to (normally included in reports, but not weird if it isn't), and the physician that pronounced him dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would somehow attempt to get the names of the doctors working that night from the hospital.

            Hospitals can be weird because of HIPAA, but that information isn't subject to it.

            This is not the jurisdiction of the D.C. Police &amp; never was. First of all you need to be aware D.C. Is not like any other city in America. They are ultimately under control of the President of the United States.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though they handle local crime and have a Chief it is only a figurehead. Why do you think these horriffic crimes of child trafficking never get investigated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next when you have a shooting with the circumstances of Seth Rich it would automatically be FBI. He had access to internal DNC information regarding the potential next President of US. FBI would be called.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next as reported the hospital was swarmed with law enforcement and he was cordoned off as VIP...that is FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next there were FBI weapons stolen around the same time near where he was shot. FBI would be called in.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on but finally the FBI became aware of the "hack"   actually "leak" in December 2015 by monitoring trafficking going to Wikileaks. This means they knew it was internal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth was unmasked and killed. Probable cause is a joke at this point. The top of the FBI Comey &amp; McCabe violated their oaths long ago by taking money from HRC during investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama violated the constitution on millions of citizens by illegally searching and spying on them in violation of the FISA court. This was revealed yeasterday in a scathing report as the single greatest abuse of power by a President in history causing s constitutional crisis now.

             So, the reason why I say MPD has jurisdiction is because they are the ones who are supposed to have jurisdiction. If their narrative is to be believed, this was just a random robbery gone awry. Random robberies gone away are under the jurisdiction of MPD. If FBI is involved then someone has to admit some special circumstance that would bring them in... Deviate from the norm. And just being a dnc staffer doesnt rise to that level. Any deviations from the norm can be little red flags. You have to use their narrative against them. Assume everything they say is true and then point out the fallacies in their constructed "reality."

              Yes I agree. That is in some ways what I was trying to say. If they want to present as idiots and believed it was a botched robbery then hold it under your jurisdiction. The problem is that minimum standard is not even met.

              If this had been an obscure town in the mid-west this would not pass the smell test for a homocide investigation. It was not it was in the most protected City in the world with the highest number of law enforcement, agents, etc. per capita. It is wired with cameras everywhere. It is astounding how bad they are at committing crimes and covering them up actually.

            You're talking a lot about prosecution. I just want to see an investigation by legitimate inspectors. Trillions of dollars worth of law enforcement in that town and they let the local DC handle this case as an attempted robbery where nothing was taken?  It stinks and people can see that. We need to spend a lot more time hitting their robbery angle and force them to defend it. After the people admit that it wasn't a robbery, then we get on the right track and there aren't too many possible tracks. The sort of crackhead who they want to pin this on would be more interested in getting the valuables rather than staying a step ahead of the responding cops. It's easy to take his wallet after you put bullets in him.

            , will you kindly provide your recent Pizzagate submission to this submission?  It's definitely needed.  Thanks!

            idea regarding a wrongful death case.  Can't remember the relation, but there is a relative of Seth who wants answers.  It's in a prior submission, but I haven't looked for it.  This case screams medical negligence based on the information so many of us have provided thus far.  According to Washington DC law (and most states for that matter), it appears as though only a relative or beneficiary can bring forth a wrongful death claim.  Are there any exceptions to this?  If a wrongful death claim can be brought forward, everything would surely break open with pizzagate.
           </p>

            The 4th year surgical resident came forward once.  I believe he would do so again.  The info he shared is invaluable, and without a doubt, he would have a lot more to say.  We just need to find out who it is.  4chan may be able to provide us with info that was not submitted on their thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            One glaring thing that I noticed is no information about an autopsy, none, nada.  According to Washington DC law, based on specific criteria as to when one must notify the ME and perform an autopsy, Seth Rich, without a doubt, should have had an autopsy performed by the ME or a designated pathologist who works for the ME Office.  This, in itself, is medical negligence on the part of the hospital if the ME was not notified of Rich's death and on the part of the ME if he was notified and did not follow through.  Is it possible to go that route initially, based only on the autopsy?  The 4th year surgical resident could certainly obtain that info in a heartbeat.

               We'd need a huge pile of books revealing the evil side of freemasonry. It wouldn't be enough to say that the Church was against them (btw It isn't any more). Even the rare owl having similar gunshots with Mr. Rich wouldn't do without that. Like I said in the topic, it's a

            IMO first order of business is hire a licensed PI to ascertain with certainty that Seth Rich really lived and that he really died.

            This has all the hallmarks of the FAKERY we saw in countless FFs. Until you determine the above, everything you do is a potential waste of time.

            - this is fantastic... but, I'm curious. If we combine our collective and draft a formidable case that includes probable cause, you mention that this can unlock the ability to grant warrants. Clearly, this isn't happening. Beyond that, if the DC police aren't acting, it becomes a whole different crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, my questions are:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             What is this crime referred to as? Failure to... act? investigate? etc?
            </li>
            <li>
             Assuming we can get to this stage and show probable cause (should be easy) and then prove that the DC police never took actions/didn't comply with their protocol - who do we provide this to? Attorney General?
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Thanks again!

             Oh man, these are the $50 million questions...
So many routes...
Assuming (big assumption) that probable cause is there and that they didn't act, that could be some proof of a cover up and ultimately something like accessory after the fact or obstruction of justice.
Usually for this, you have to show some action (not inaction).

              So, some sort of communication trail to implicate a higher-up in obstruction? Hmmm... yeah, I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that following the wave of leaks, the powers that be have returned to the "old school" methods of communication.

              If only we could leverage Vault7 against them... using every eligible electronic device in the vicinity of persons of interest would be quite a powerful dragnet. Illegal? Yes... but, they built the systems that violate our Constitutional rights on our tax dollars, we should be able to use these very same tools to stop them from MURDER.

             <p>
              Would sworn testimony count? Without a breadcrumb trail it becomes a situation purely based on trust. The surrounding circumstantial evidence is powerful, particularly if it is proven that SR leaked the docs. My only other concern would be how high is the percentage of individuals hearing this case in terms of their rate of corruption/blackmail leverage?

            Don't necessarily need to read from right to left. You can also read left to right in this case. What about the other end? How do we know that he died? where he died? Who oversaw him? Who had access to him? The "how do we know" is equally crucial. It's called laying a foundation.

             As to where he may have died, do we know if anyone has feet/eyes on the ground of that abandoned hospital? Seems like a very good place for covert ops for backdoor medical care. Maybe they needed to keep him alive long enough to find out exactly what he knew and who he told what to. And maybe there's a slug in a wall somewhere in there if he was running away when they were shooting at him.

            Direct vs circumstantial evidence: 
Direct - I saw it rain.
Circumstantial - i dont see it rain, however, i can infer that it rained from the facts. guy walks in with wet umbrella, forecast calls for rain, no other water sources near by.
Legally, both are weighted equally.

             Direct evidence is unequivocal, circumstantial evidence is open to interpretation, and interpretations vary. Re your example, weather forecasts are not 100% accurate and  the wet umbrella could be due to the guy getting splashed by a car driving through a puddle. At common law inferences must be consistent with reason, but civil law suffers from political reasoning, i.e. picking the argument which bests supports the desired conclusion.

              Direct evidence has its pitfalls, too. With direct it is all based on whether you believe the speaker. Circumstantial is what it is, your interpretation can be different , though. Just remember,  DNA is merely.circumstantial.

            <strong>
             Point 1:
            </strong>
            I agree with another poster - this should be MPD jurisdiction.  There was no crime on any Federal property.  Hell, they have 300 of those per year on the other side of the river.  Unless the Federal government could present reason to take over a "botched robbery", this is all MPD.  I've confirmed this with contacts in MPD.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Point 2:
            </strong>
            Everyone keeps chanting this mantra of "Seth Rich" being the string to unravel the sweater - whatever it is now pizza, pedo, NWOgate...
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is, this really is the Achilles (pun intended) heel of the case.  We need another map showing the relations between Rich, his family, Bauman, Brock, Alefantis, and by default Podesta.  Hell Podesta is tied in through the hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is another fresh opportunity to capitalize on.  And this one is much harder to refute -
            <strong>
             "Young Midwestern DNC Staffer Seth Rich Killed by Family Connections".
            </strong>
            - There is enough evidence, in the form of named sources and printed sources to close the loop now with a little more digging.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, I do not have the resources.  If someone can put together a "meme", I prefer infographic, that may make the connection for a lot of people.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Point 3:
            </strong>
            The mock/moot court exercise is very important.  If people stay on topic and use the basics of Roberts Rules of Order, this "exercise" can serve as the basis of opening up a real case.  Just as finding evidence of a crime on Facebook or any other social media, if we are able to prove by "legal" and solid evidence (-iary?) practices, what gets laid out here can be used as the basis to open an inquiry, grand jury, etc.  [I may bot be spot on in my legal terminology but I hope everyone gets the concept]
**
If done right, what we do in this moot court can serve as evidence to be used in the opening of an official investigation. ** [If I am wrong, please correct me and tell me why]
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Point 4:
            </strong>
            There may be some merit in figuring out how to loop all of this shit and land it back in JA's lap.  He's so fucking happy to be out of the news these days he had the balls to write the POS op-ed a couple weeks back.  Let's figure out a way to leverage this so the light shines back on his reptile ass again.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Point 5:
            </strong>
            Want a force multiplier?  Take 10-20 dedicated people in the DMV willing to distribute a WHO KILLED SETH RICH (w/ the map on the back) 4"x6" card all over the area.  Locals know where they need to be dropped.  Put out 10,000 cards over the next month around Capitol Hill, K St, Kalorama, JA's hood....someone will crack.  Guarantee in this environment, it will make someone kirk out and do something that helps break the case open further.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Point 6:
            </strong>
            They killed Roger Ailes, spooked Hannity, and countless others.  They are pulling out all the stops on this one.  They need to be fought with what they can't defend against - guerilla marketing/PR warfare.  This cannot all be done online.  They will beat us at every turn.  Get those flyers, cards, postcards, handbills, whatever....raise awareness.  People will believe something in print more than online more anyhow these days...

             This is important because if someone can put together a document that creates probable cause, then MPD will have to respond (not legally, but in the court of public opinion). If they don't respond, or they respond but find no probable cause, then you keep piling on evidence or gathering legal scholars who agree that it is PC to show that MPD have an ulterior motive. then you go up the chain of oversight. Doing this also brings attention to the ultimate issue.

              Think about having the equivalent of a deposition/indictment with complete facts and citations.  Maybe 20 pages, in a legal format.  Printing is cheap.

              If someone is seriously thinking about doing this, contact me via PM.  I have some ideas, but they are worthless in a public forum.  Things can be done.

              If you feel there is enough 'probable cause' information from the posts here (and hopefully more will arrive), if you were to advise us on what you think best points to include, and the format etc, I'm sure some of us would manage to put the filing document together.  ie whatever help you need we could provide it.

                , and thank you for volunteering your time and expertise to the cause, it's very much appreciated.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, you're suggesting that a trial brief (a trial brief document citing points of probable cause), and an outcry is what we require in order to request an investigation?
               </p>
               <p>
                Did you watch the OANN special report on Seth Rich, released yesterday? It's very, very good. Here's the link to parts 2 and 3 if you haven't -

               </p>
               <p>
                The points covered were extensive and comprehensive, and are those which we have, and could use as probable cause.  I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Moving on, would there be any way you would be able to lay out a step-by-step plan of -

                <li>
                 <p>
                  The resources required

                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                Maybe I'm missing something up there in that list... you're the expert so please do say, and also if I'm being ignorant and the plan is obvious ; )
Hope you don't mind me asking.

                 Here's the thing, we as citizens cannot per se bring charges against anyone. That right lies solely with prosecuting agencies. So any statements of probable cause in order to effectuate a warrant or arrest are going to come from a policing/prosecuting agency. This exercise is to get you thinking like the police so that you can see where the weaknesses are in effectuating arrests (assuming the policing agencies are doing their job). Right now, it is finding something more than motive. But I think the SEIU track is a good one to go down.

               There is no filing document per se on our part. However, if we put something together that cannot be ignored, then they will.either react to it, or ignore it which would look suspicious and possibly create criminal or civil liability in their part.
Remember, the russian "special counsel" only got appointed because of the (fake) uproar from the left.

             From the beginning, all evidence pointed to Seth Rich as a leaker, yet the story immediately was shifted to a "hack" by Russia. The intelligence agencies eventually latched onto this claim...but the FBI was NEVER even allowed to look at the DNC server. The DNC server was looked at by Crowdstrike, paid for by the DNC and with heavy connections to Hillary. They had strong motives to cover for the leak by Rich (motive for murder) and to point to Russia (a meme to attack Trump). All circumstantial behavior around this is very suspect.
            </li>

             No one has pursued what Podesta meant when he wrote
             <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36082:">
              https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36082:
             </a>
             "I'm definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker." No one has ever asked what he meant by this...but Seth Rich was murdered after this. The leaks spanned from January 2015 through late May 2016, so the timing of the leaks is in synch with Podesta's email threat (
             <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/05/seth-rich-evidence-wikileaks-police-report-document-dnc-staffer-homicide-conspiracy-theory/">

             </a>
             )))). It reminds me of what happened to Breitbart after his famous tweet about Podesta):
             <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/28/andrew-breitbart-tweet-before-death-adds-fuel-to-o/">
              http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/28/andrew-breitbart-tweet-before-death-adds-fuel-to-o/
             </a>
            </li>
            <li>
             The behavior of the parents is not consistent with what anyone would expect...fighting ANY leads that would point to his murder for leaking the DNC emails. We receive this indirectly from a PR guy who was hired/paid for by the DNC, so it is not clear if the Rich family believes in this lie that all such leads are politically-motivated.
            </li>
            <li>
             Why would the FBI NOT have insisted to see the server and analyze it directly? The claim, which has been inflated to the highest levels, that the Russians "hacked" the servers to rig our election are so serious, they would have needed to investigate the server for national security reasons but chose to let a firm with strong political ties to the DNC/Hillary do this work. The work itself has been found to be shoddy...and most recently, exposed for potential fraud:
             <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6d9xcm/breaking_ive_found_evidence_that_the_dnc/">
              https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6d9xcm/breaking_ive_found_evidence_that_the_dnc/
             </a>
            </li>
            <li>
             The DC police claimed it was a botched robbery, yet nothing was stolen (wallet, expensive watch/jewely, smartphone, keys). There is no support for this theory. There is huge circumstantial evidence that Rich was the DNC leaker, which provides motive. There are many inconsistencies in the stories that emerged from the shooting...that ShotSpotter was used to detect it initially...then this was denied...and more recently, the idea that a silencer was used (which would make the ShotSpotter source not possible since it relies on the sound of the gunshots). All three bodycams lost/did not have footage, which is a statistical impossibility given normal failure rates of these devices. The police also seem to have lost his laptop.
            </li>
            <li>
             The reports from doctors/medical staff who worked on Seth Rich are not consistent with him dying that morning. This has been documented in several posts on Voat, in which medical personnel who personally worked on Seth indicated that he was in stable condition.
            </li>
            <li>
             The DC Police have hidden virtually any findings/evidence of the crime and are treating it like it is under a gag order, but no one has been arrested or even identified as a suspect. You would expect them to welcome help from the public in finding the murderers.
            </li>
            <li>
             The media, as well as the DNC, have gone apoplectic oveer the idea that his murder was tied to the DNC leaks. They claim that this has been debunked, but there has been zero evidence debunking this. Why such a fight against this theory and line of inquiry? They even came out today with a theory that KimDotCom, who is a very credible go-between in leaking to Wikileaks, may have PLANTED fake evidence that Seth Rich was the leaker. They are making this claim before he even reveals the evidence that he has. I have never seen such behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
             What about the suspicious death of Shawn Lucas, investigating DNC voter fraud, soon after he served the DNC with papers about a lawsuit (
             <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/05/seth-rich-evidence-wikileaks-police-report-document-dnc-staffer-homicide-conspiracy-theory/">
              http://heavy.com/news/2017/05/seth-rich-evidence-wikileaks-police-report-document-dnc-staffer-homicide-conspiracy-theory/))))
             </a>
             ))))? The LSM just ignores all of these connections.

             We should do a FOIA request on all evidence/reports related to the crime (from the police, hospital, laptop evidence, gunshot evidence, the bruising on the hands - there should be DNA evidence from this if he punched the murderers, how it is known that there were two assailants, footage from other cameras in the area,...can the guns be traced, etc.).

            The Seth Rich murder could expose so much, especially since it ties to the massive Russia hacking lie and would expose this and related lies/collusion involving the Dems and LSM. Thanks for the work on this!

             Unfortunately, any info that came from an anonymous 4chan poster is unusable until there is evidence to prove their claims. That means at least two of the points you listed are out (for now, at least):
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               The silencer being used in the shooting.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The reports from the medical staff.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Also, Kim Dotcom's claims are still unproven, but since his identity is actually attached to the them, the claims have the potential to be validated if/when he provides evidence to back them.

            Dark Math, why are you talking about the FBI?  For the time being this case is a plain vanilla homicide from a jurisdictional point of view. The Metro police are to handle the investigation and make arrests, not the FBI.  That said, I agree with everything the OP has  discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            More importantly there are some big wigs   taking an interest in this case. It is vitally important that if we want to help out, we need to present our findings in an organized fashion wherein the evidence has merit as evidence and not speculation.  AnonOpenPress is probably the best Pizzagater up to the task.  Perhaps a new post can be created styled  Summary of  Seth Rich Murder Evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:  The FBI would have jurisdiction over the  possible hacking of the emails by the Russians. Proof that Seth was the leaker would  pretty much take care of that problem. On the other hand if there was analysis of the Committees computers by the FBI  as part of the Russian probe, then Seth's involvement may be uncovered. So there is dual jurisdiction depending on the crime being investigated, a cyber crime versus homicide.

             The FBI has never actually looked at the DNC servers. They were denied access to them by the DNC. That fact alone speaks volumes about the nature of the leak to WikiLeaks and the claim by our Intel agencies about the Russians hacked The servers. Our intelligence these are basically operating off of hearsay, with the source being Crowdstrike, the firm paid for by the DNC with political motives.

             This isn't a plain vanilla homicide case. The Seth Rich murder case is the Golden Thread that will unravel the entire monolithic clown fraud. Think of one of those

              you didn't read my post thoroughly, it remains a plain vanilla homicide from a jurisdictional point of view, from a political point of view a whole different animal I agree but for now only the MPD has jurisdiction.  Neither your rants nor witticisms will  change that.

               Didn't the FBI go to Seth Rich's apartment without a warrant to take his laptop?

               There's also a suggestion that Seth Rich had a special kind of watch which the robbers
might have been interested in -- evidently a watch which might have held information.
Would be nice to know who has that.

              <p>
               Right now it seems that the closest guy so far is Dr. Sava, but don't know what's been
proven there of his presence at hospital or contact with Rich.

              <p>
               It is political and hard to prove cause the guys who do the dirty work aren't the people 
with the motives.

             VERY important to remember who has jurisdiction right now. If it really is just a random attempt robbery/murder then the FBI shouldn't be touching it. If FBI is getting involved, that is telling of something going on outside the MPD jurisdiction.

            the real way to blow things open, legally, is a civil wrongful death case - but you need a familial relation for standing.  all you need is an attorney who's brave enough to file, then you have some legal tools (like discovery) at your disposal, and also three's a lawsuit of public record that cannot be (totally) killed by the MSM (until a judge blows it out on motion -- but then you can appeal).  besides, wrongful death, perhaps there's some other creative civil remedy to invoke on behalf of citizenry generally (or at least a non family member)?  OP, if you are barred in D.C. maybe you could be that guy

            That's true but as long as Andrew SlowWalker is running the FBI it doesn't matter how much evidence is found nothing will happen. This is the whole reason he and James Comey were put there. They were put there for this very issue we're seeing where people got the goods on the Deep State but it has to get past the FBI first before a case is made.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the question isn't evidence at this point. The evidence is overwhelming already and that's with Andrew SlowWalker trying not to find any. Everything hinges on a new FBI director which I have a sneaky suspicion will be entering stage right directly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now if there's no new FBI director then who knows........start praying.

This happened in DC which is under "protection" of Metropolitan Police. MPD detectives will review evidence and decide whether to file a case with the US Attorney General Office (the prosecuting agency for felonies in DC). 
This is not an FBI case. This is an MPD case.

              below, has laid out what we know so far, very well, however this shit has been sat on for almost 11 months by TPTB. I believe they are getting nervous knowing that the silent majority has their #  (us) and we are at tipping pt. So, if pressure is applied they will want it off their back on to another agency.  I know personally that involving INTERNAL AFFAIRS can have amazing effects on getting a case on the right track.  You just have to find pts. valid to tip the scales! Then HAMMER IT HOME

             Let's assume Seth is the leaker (there's enough for PC). This only provides motive. What is an articulable fact that places Podesta/DNC ordering a hit? Multiple people probably had motive to hate Seth. What is specific to JP or Dr.?

              I think you're way, way off in your legal analysis.  Are you a criminal lawyer?  What relevant experience do you have?   You do not have probable cause if you assume Seth is the leaker.  You barely have motive.
             </p>
             <p>
              Probable cause is enough evidence of a specific crime to justify an arrest, or a search warrant.  Search warrants need to be specific as to what you are looking for.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's say that Seth being the leaker fully establishes motive (which it doesn't), how.does.that get you probable cause?
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's say I have motive to kill my wife because I'll inherit her money.    She's stabbed to death on the street while I'm out of town on business.   You can't get get a warrant to arrest me or search my house just based on that.  You haven't even begun to show I'm involved with her death.

               Wow, thank you for proving my point! Motive alone is not enough!
Must be something more!
However, what is important to realize is that we are only talking about PC which relates to (as you astutely copied and pasted from Wikipedia) only arrests and searches.
Probable cause is SO much more than what officers have before they start investigating. Officers investigate in order to GET probable cause. 
It's a little interesting IF they don't even have persons of interest that they are talking to.

                  However, now I must take exception to your claim.  You are saying there is probable cause that Seth Rich leaked?   Because there is no where near probable cause.

              Articulable fact... I'm on it, but not quite there. At the moment, for JP, I'd say the fact is his fear of his own death, articulating that with his current position being optimal for being a responsible person to order such a hit, and that people in similar position have faces questionable "suicides" before. TBD: To find those suicides, and to make it probable that there is a ring to cover up, motivating such an order.

               Yes! That is an articulable fact that relate directly to this time frame and set of facts. When you look at the TOTALITY of the circumstances, that email is very telling. It can be character evidence of the author, modus operandi, evidence of planning, a partial admission, etc. Probably need more, though if we can find it.
