<p>Annotation:	The term child sex ring is defined as one or more offenders simultaneously involved sexually with several child victims. Child sex rings have many dynamics different from &quot;typical&quot; intrafamilial abuse cases: multiple victims, multiple offenders, the victim\'s parents, and the gender of the victim.</p>
<p>Abstract:	Two thirds of all victims molested outside the home are boys. The two major patterns or types of child sex ring cases are historical child sex rings and multidimensional child sex rings. Historical child sex rings involve male offenders and male victims, preferential molesters, sexual motivation, child pornography and child erotica, and control through seduction. Multidimensional child sex rings seem to have the following four dynamics in common: (1) multiple young victims, (2) multiple offenders, (3) fear as the controlling tactic, and (4) bizarre and/or ritualistic activity. One advantage to the investigation of child sex rings is that the possibility of developing significant corroborative evidence is far greater than in one-on-one sexual abuse cases. The best and easiest way to avoid child victim testimony in court is to build a case that is so strong that the offender pleads guilty. </p>

            Out of those four dynamics, only #4 has ever arguably been demonstrated by

             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            , if I grant that artsy stuff seems "bizarre" to the uptight squares who seem to make up most of this subverse. As for the other three,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            has founnd zero victims, zero offenders, and zero fear unless you count voat posters' frothing-at-the-mouth fear of gay people and Jews.
