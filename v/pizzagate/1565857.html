Read what the Anon says; &quot;I want to reiterate that there is a top secret bunker about 500m 
from Comet Ping Pong.&quot; and &quot;it\'s worth considering that Fort Reno contains a reservoir that 
could \'possibly\' connect to the Broad Branch, which is the small creek running underneath

<p>A Presidential Emergency Facility (PEF), also called Presidential Emergency Relocation Centers

by the President of the United States should normal presidential residences, such as the White 
House or Camp David, be destroyed or overrun during war or other types of national emergencies.</p>
<p>Purpose-built Presidential Emergency Facilities are silo-like structures constructed from reinforced 
concrete that sit atop an underground warren of bunkers and chambers designed to withstand a nuclear 
explosion.</p>
<p>There are 9 PEF\'s in Washington DC each named with the letter &quot;C&quot;, Reno Park\'s is 
called &quot;Cartwheel&quot;, the White House is &quot;Crown&quot;. </p>
<p>Could these PEF\'s be connected by tunnels?
Are the PEF\'s still used? 
and if so, is Comet Ping Pong / Pizzagate connected in some way?</p>',

           A Presidential Emergency Facility (PEF), also called Presidential Emergency Relocation Centers 
and VIP Evacuation and Support Facilities, is a fortified, working residence intended for use 
by the President of the United States should normal presidential residences, such as the White 
House or Camp David, be destroyed or overrun during war or other types of national emergencies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Purpose-built Presidential Emergency Facilities are silo-like structures constructed from reinforced 
concrete that sit atop an underground warren of bunkers and chambers designed to withstand a nuclear 
explosion.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are 9 PEF's in Washington DC each named with the letter "C", Reno Park's is 
called "Cartwheel", the White House is "Crown".
          </p>
          <p>
           Could these PEF's be connected by tunnels?
Are the PEF's still used? 
and if so, is Comet Ping Pong / Pizzagate connected in some way?

            That doesn't seem related to this.  He was talking about grants from the Department of Justice.  The money spent on pizza was spent by the Hartford police department.

            I just noticed that the thread talking about about the Australian / Kidman occult thing just got wiped from Voat.
I can't remember the posters user name. But I replied saying I'd "look into it" that it's "not just in America".
It's disappeared. Or maybe I'm imagining things? Strange.

             Yep. Australia too. One victim Fiona Barnett depicts underground tunnels and train tracks in some of her abuse drawings here:

             There's also a documentary video about her in which she recounts her gruesome ordeal in detail here:

            Interesting find, I wouldn't be surprised if the PEF bases were interconnected by tunnels, that would be a convenient way to get "pizza deliveries".

            There is also a river running under this area.  The hole in the picture with two guys looking down could be to that as well.  I'm so glad someone is looking into this.  This old fort and it's coordinates were leaked on 8Ch.net a couple months ago.  Also I think the bathroom enclosure at CPPP is larger than it should be.  I speculated the second br by the woodpilehad a secret hallway that went in between the walls between CPPP and the Hen place next door, or else down or up.  Glad people are still doing research.  Cheers me up for one. I've got a lot of pics of the bathroom enclosure at CPP but can't travel there to measure.

            Also check out Denver International Airport. They intentionally fucked up the construction so instead of knocking it down and fixing it, they covered it up and built on top of it, leaving a lot of buildings underneath which is also used for presidential emergencies and no doubt, other things. Has all the freemason artwork too.

            Obama did have $65k worth of pizza and hot dogs flown in, did he not? HRC had a keen interest in Laura Silsby, possibly even helped her out, and, her husband was once the POTUS. Why is it inconceivable that intelligence agencies could use this facility with the full knowledge of the executive branch?
           </p>
           <p>
            The "kid" being written outside by the same hand of both locations seems highly suspect; it reminds me of the vampire graffitti in the blade movies secretly signifying establishments that catered to parasites.

             Why do we assume it's the same hand? The way is see it is one says kid and one says kids, but the new one the K was written differently, where the guy instead of making the straight line first then The angled line, he made a small v for the top and then made the bottom. I find that weird does anybody write k that way?thats why the line in the k seems broken or angled not straight, because it was done in two motions not one like most people would. That leads me to believe they are possibly written by different people, since they write k differently..

              yea for me its not the same hand written, or if it is it have been made years later maybe, i did graffiti for ~10yrs...
and yea looking in/contacting the graffiti community of the aera could be a good idea to know more about 1) this graffiti 2) possible tunnels, since graffiti wirters like usually to explore every abandonned places and tunnels..

              That "guy" was with Stratfor, which is closely linked with the WH. The two employees were discussing the method by which "pizza and hot dogs" were transported by Obama to the WH and discussing whether they should use the same channels. I'd say that's pretty damned legit.

               Yeah, I know the email.  There is nothing in the email to indicate first hand knowledge on the guy's part and Stratfor is not closed linked with the White House.  If want to say the larger intelligence community you'd probably be closer to the point.
              </p>
              <p>
               Stratfor would be closer to the military.  The guy who made that comment worked for the State Department's Diplomatic Sercurity Service.    If you want to call it high-level gossip, go ahead, but there's nothing to indicate this guy would know this and there is no other evidence pointing to a party like this.

             In the second one it's weird because I would swear they wrote the top of k then the bottom, which I don't think anyone writes a k that way, don't most do the line then the angled line? This dude wrote a v basically then made the bottom upside down v. Also there appear to be dots under the word and in the first one dots on the ground. Just bizarre. I could understand I suppose if it were a graffiti artists tag  or something, maybe a gang tag, but it doesn't seem to be that especially since one is plural and one singular. What a mystery.

              for me its not the same person who written the 2 graffiti ,or if it is, it's at different period , like his handwriting evolued..(i did graffiti for quite long time)..and maybe an idea is to try to contact graffiti peeps of the aera, since they maybe know about this graffiti and also about possibles tunnels or bunkers etc..since they usually like explore abandonned aera and underground tunnels etc...

              Can't really see the one on the black door --
but the first one in red ... notice that the dots move to the left and then if you follow them across, you find more of what looks like the same red paint at the very bottom, just before the handrail starts.  Breadcrumbs.  We should more often be looking for them in these pics.

            Wouldn't it make sense to have had tunnels connect with a wide area around DC for just this occasion? Beyond the silo structures, if I were to plan for the escape of elected officials in the event of a nuclear attack, I'd have areas throughout the city that they could enter and get underground. After underground I'd want them to be able to connect back to the silos or other people who survived. Thinking out loud really,  but it would make sense and not surprise me if the tunnels in DC are much more expansive than we know.
