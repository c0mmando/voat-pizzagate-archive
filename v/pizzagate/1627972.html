<p>Trump never went as far in his campaign as saying our government were &quot;killers&quot;, but just 2 weeks after he gets in, it seems he\'s finding out an awful lot he didn\'t know for sure before hand. He sure looks confident he knows scalia did not die of &quot;natural causes&quot;, and he looks disgusted at the same time because he highly respected Scalia. Keep in mind, Scalia was likely killed because he knew the ends and outs with Hillary, and would\'ve prosecuted her for benghazi, without having to mention he\'d do the same if he knew she was in a satanic child trafficking pedophilia ring.</p>',

            Keep in mind, Scalia was likely killed because he knew the ends and outs with Hillary, and would've prosecuted her for benghazi,

           <p>
            How could Scalia have prosecuted her for Benghazi?  This is only possible if you have no idea how our government works.

            Putin has killed journalists and opposition members as well.  In fact another opposition leader has been poisoned google Kara-Murza and you'll see headlines
Putin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza in coma after 'second poisoning'
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy recently was travelling through Moscow showing a documentary about the murder of another opposition leader.

           <p>
            I see this as Trump adopting Russian talking points.
