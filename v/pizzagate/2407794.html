Even after Michael Jackson\'s death Attorney Fields was given the responsibility to manage the estate. In 1993 Bert Fields played a major role in the Chandler allegations and subsequent settlement. For years Bert Fields has aggressively defended Michael Jackson against claims of child rape and exploitation. One of the other main players in the 1993 Chandler allegations was a private investigator named Anthony Pelicano. Pelicano was known at the time to be the PI to the stars and would do whatever it took to defend his clients and go after their detractors. However years later Anthony Pelicano was arrested and jailed for his over zealous methods and has been in prison for many years. However several years back Anthony Pelicano gave a jail house interview in which he stated Michael Jackson did far worse things than just molest children. At the time that was seen as quite a bold statement and one would assume that statement would of incensed the likes of Bert Fields. 
 So now it is 2018 and Anthony Pelicano will be released next year. Pelicano decided to give another interview and here is what he said..............He often refers to the &quot;omerta,&quot; the vow of loyalty he took to clients, the same vow that cost him his freedom. Yet talk to him about most of the A-list that once employed him, and his distaste is clear. For example, Michael Jackson, who reportedly engaged his services around 1993 (via attorney Fields) — and whom Pellicano claims he &quot;fired&quot; because he was disgusted by truths even darker than those alleged in Jackson\'s molestation scandal. &quot;I was offered $500,000 to tell the whole story by a tabloid, and I declined, even though, while incarcerated, I needed the money.&quot; Other questions regarding the Jackson saga are met with what may be the definitive Pellicano irony: &quot;All of that would get too close to the truth, so, regretfully, I have to decline.&quot;.     
</p>
<p>Now that is quite a statement. This statement is even worse than what the victims of Michael Jackson have claimed. Bert Fields was also interviewed for this article for the Hollywood Reporter and one would think Attorney Fields would aggressively go after Pelicano for these vicious statements. Bert Fields has never been shy to attack the accusers of Michael Jackson so this will probably not bode well for Pelicano but wait???? </p>
<p>Here is Bert Field\'s statement......
 This is not to imply that Pellicano is without allies on the outside, those who feel he\'s done his penance and then some, and has earned the right to live out his remaining days in peace. &quot;He\'s paid his dues,&quot; says Bert Fields, for whom Pellicano worked extensively doing what the renowned lawyer calls &quot;hard-core detective&quot; services. &quot;I\'m sorry to see him in this plight,&quot; says Fields. &quot;The guy has been in there for years, his life to a great extent has been ruined. I don\'t have a lot of sympathy for people who say he shouldn\'t come out. He didn\'t kill anyone, that I know about.&quot;
 Huh? This makes no sense why would Bert Fields want to support a man who has claimed Michael Jackson did far darker things than just molest children. Why would he not want to go after Anthony Pelicano like he so aggressively did with the victims of Michael Jackson. My theory is a simple one, power. Knowledge is power and because he worked with Bert Fields on the 1993 case the attorney may realize he can back up his claims.What Attorney Fields may also realize is that this information may also show the attorney as a willing participant in a cover up that involved both child rape and worse. Anthony Pelicano made it clear that he was offered a half a million to tell his story on Jackson but declined. So now with a little over a year to go is Bert Fields giving the indication that negotiations may be on the table. I don\'t know for sure but......</p>

            Michael Jackson was a pedophile, period. He got away with it because he was a great singer, but had he been a regular guy named "Mike Jackson" and lived down the street from you in your neighborhood, he would have been arrested and jailed.

            Macaulay Culkin talks about his relationship with Michael in an interview in 2004 (before the trial) on Larry King Live.

            Right off the bat Macaulay gave a tone that he was against MJ, but fought himself and made it that had a perfect life.

            I wonder what dirt Pellicano has on B Fields! Obviously he has a shit ton!
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember reading only last week a blind (I can no longer find it) about how someone like Pellicano is trying to sell a video of MJ naked, molesting a kid, with other kids in the video watching. Starting price is $1million. Does anyone else remember this blind?

            Something REALLY strange I found out about MJ about 8 years ago that still to this day I can not figure out why.
           </p>
           <p>
            When on holiday in Egypt I got talking to a local who worked at the hotel restaurant. He told me that for quite some time leading up to his death he would appear on Egyptian TV everyday telling them to stay true to being Muslims and prey etc etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not pizzagate related I don’t think .. but still very strange all the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dread to think what it is he is claiming MJ had done. I can’t think of anything more depraved than abusing innocent helpless children 😢

              I wish I could .. I’ve smoked a lot of pot since then 😂 I don’t remember much of what was said other than what I have shared. It was more shock and confusion over anything else to ask what I should have I guessed.

            Michael was a victim himself. Probably put under MK Ultra. No sane humam acts or talks like that. He was used as a front by the real perpetrators.

             I have thought the same thing too. I remember the interview where MJ talks about his love of children and sharing a bed with them. He seemed so innocent and child like, it made me think that one of his alters was a child

              Absolutely true. Great observation. I believe they did some Mk Ultra programming. He had multiples of which one was a child.

            I don't know guys from what I've seen, I kind of think that MJ was abused, and actually attempted to look out for other abused children like Corey Feldman and Macauly Culkin (sic).

             Agree with you 100%. He was not himself. In the end I believe he broke the programming and was about blow the lid (like princess Diana) and he had to be eliminated.

                Unless perhaps he himself was abused by Lord Janner. The scummiest ones like to flaunt it after all. I looked it up and in the photos I saw MJ doesn't appear to be pleased to be receiving a birthday cake from the guy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look I used to believe MJ was a pedo, but over the years I have begun to question the fact, that's all. I'm certainly not a fan by any means.

                 I always come back to the fact that he admitted he liked to sleep with little boys in his bed. Even if he didn't rape them, that's not appropriate. I sure as hell don't want any children in my bed. And I don't want them thinking it's safe to be in a bed with an adult because the next adult might rape them. So at the very least, Jackson was sending them unsafe messages. At worst, well...
