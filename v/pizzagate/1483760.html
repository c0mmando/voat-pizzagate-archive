            The prohibition against bearing false (from the ten commandments) witness was part of the common law from the time of King Alfred the Great, but the lawyers lied and said that the common law was made entirely my men. The US Constitution declares itself to be the law of the land, which would supplant the pre-existent law of the land aka common law in which it was unlawful to bear false witness.

            The first ammendment prohibits Congress from making certain laws. One of the problems with this is that this can be interpreted to mean that some acts (especially those relating to religion)  are always lawful.

            Strawman. The fact that truth is a defence to libel isn't derived from the first ammendment.
You're a fool for implying that I was parroting off communist ideas.
You don't have truth as a defence for that.

            Anarchist centrist libertarian society is what the constitution stands for, it was never the job of government to control the nation but rather to serve the constitution and the people whom it protects.

            Solution is as the founding fathers intended, assemble the troops and swarm DC and take over. Seal off the water ways as they have escape routes, locate all tunnels and seal them off, and make air travel impossible so they can not escape justice.

             Look folks lets ask ourselves what has happened during the Obama/Hillary administration.
I'll get biblical just for fun....Sodomites have been elevated to the highest ranks of the armed forces...Their has been a non stop gaying agenda from showbiz and the media. Its suspected with good reason that the president is a Gay man, and his wife, to put it mildly has hormone issues. Gay marriage has been pushed. It just ain't natural folks, not on this scale. I mean Joan Rivers said they were thus and got dispatched a couple of weeks later. So are we reading from the same book?

             Yep. 1984's main message is that ultimately the only crime is thoughtcrime because all other crimes are the direct consequence of thinking for yourself.

                Once you get over 100 contribution points you can voat away so just put some posts up or get in on new conversations early won't take long but does prevent a lot of bot spam which is nice

                 mentions gaining 100ccp. Does that only include karma from comments, or does it also include karma from my submissions? I'm asking because earlier today, I got blocked from posting more comments, so I'm not sure whether there's a built-in governor to keep people from accruing karma quickly. Thanks.

            Lying to promote war. Free speech is a form of anarchy, liberty is not the same as absolute freedom.

              Still too many cards to play before a hot war, the electoral college has to investigate Russia's alleged role in influencing the election, then there's the question of how Trump will play his hand.

               Their will be no hot war, Putin will get his sanctions lifted and we will do good business. China will wonder what happened. Hillary might find it hot in the Gulf but who will give a fuck.
