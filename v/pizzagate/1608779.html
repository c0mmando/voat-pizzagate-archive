I am seriously strapped on time due to a move so I only got through chapter 2 and skipped to chapter 7. He goes into detail on how the case was investigated and mentions the names of many of Kate and Gerald\'s associates plus what they do for a living. In chapter 7 he mentions a highly suspicions individual named Robert Murat who arrived before the abduction. He is also fluent in both Portugese and English, and offered his services as a full time interpreter for the police, then is later interrogated as a suspect because he raised suspicions by showing way to much interest in case leads and allegedly attempting to access the police files. My opinion this guy stinks like an intelligence agent. Like I said, I don\'t have the time right now to blow through this book in a day, but I am sure there is plenty of info in this book that will provide a much better picture of the how the Podesta\'s play into Maddie\'s murder. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The McCann case was the most televised abduction case in Euro/UK history. In my opinion, this lead is the key to blowing this whole thing open. Think about it, the identikits of the Podestas is the ultimate redpill. What are the chances that the two images uncannily resembling not only one PG suspect but 2,and they happen to be brothers. Imagine the mass public outrage we could generate by blowing the lid on this thing.</p>',

            I am not aware of any credible source of that. The is a verified connection between known deceased pedophile Sir Clement Freud, whom's vacation house was lent to "friends". His vacation house is 1/3 mile away from where Maddie was kidnapped.
