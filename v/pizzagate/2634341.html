            You should add the Tory names too so it isn't one sided. To an outsider looks like only Labour have the pedo problem.

            Pete Townshend applied to the police to access child porn and his request was granted by Scotland Yard. He did this as he was and probably still is researching child porn. But then the police got it into their silly heads to arrest him for something they gave him permission to do. And it was in all the papers that he was a nonce.... just because the police are effing stupid.

             I'm not aware of that . Here's his story according to the Telegraph:

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Townshend claimed he intended to show that child abuse has a financial chain that runs from Russian orphanages to British banks by paying a £7 charge for a child pornography site, which he cancelled immediately.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Many people believe him but for some reason I don't.

              Eel Pie Island and historical connections to PIE, the rock and roll UK music industry and the occult...

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Eel Pie Studios or Oceanic Studios at The Boathouse on the mainland nearby, formerly owned by Pete Townshend, were the location of several significant pop and rock recordings. Townshend's publishing company, Eel Pie Publishing, is also named after the ait.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             He said he was abused himself as a child so who knows what the truth is.  I would think that he has quite some knowledge of current British paedophiles given his proximity to the music biz and Eel Pie Island.

              Still on the fence with that one. I had to look at questionable things to believe they existed, but if he knew full well that it was going on, then why would he do something that stupid? Then again, I am a musician myself, and they are the best at what they do, but not the brightest at a lot of other things people might take for granted. He would be in the right time, at the right place to see some strange stuff.

            BOMBSHELL!  When does it land?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where does it land?!   I have no doubt that most British papers will fear libel suits without iron clad evidence to back this up.  But I am equally certain that child rape facilitated by Muslims (who then use this for blackmailing the Government) is WIDESPREAD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such collusion between Muslims and politicians/appointed civil servants for the purpose of maintaining child sex rings is very likely the central explanation for why British migration policy has failed to block migration based on Islam over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it is why Tommy Robinson is rotting in jail right now. The vast numbers of political actors involved and ensnared in Muslim-procured child rape is going to blow our minds.

             Pakistan is an mi6 intelligence creation ...an mi6 satrllite state with.pakistan was controlled by mountbatten who had his agent sidney cotton(james bond a composite character was based on sidney cotton amongst others)  run arms into kashmir and created the kashmir.problem.. brit pakistanis holding dual citizenships..i can point u to a few lawyer firms and estate agents probably running money laundering activities..They have connections to Wrstern Union..running cricket leagues ..most probably as a cover for cricket betting ..
Because the police ..and law society are corrupt i havent reported them...
But an advantage of dual citizenships is they can slip in and out of the country..if the law is after them.
Pakistan is a major.tool.in the deep state activities..they act as the gophers of all.criminal.activity required..Aga khan seems to be the middleman

             To be more specific ..i believe it is Aga Khan who is behind these networks..
Aga Khan has been a british intelligence agent ...there is an armenian suren pahlav clan connection to both Aga Khan and the core of london money powers...
Suren pahlav descendents are pallavicinis...the double headed eagle...
They r prime human cattle.herders ...and know how to manipulate the crowd...through fear..
The double headed eagle.represents the biology of fear and confusion..it looks like one of the glands in the human system..

              No they're people who have already been convicted mostly low level politics such as local councillors etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's all publicly available knowledge yet its being spun as exclusive leaks  -  it isn't.
             </p>
             <p>
              British Fight are a right wing aspiring political party but seem to consist of two people so far. They're asking for donations towards their party which has gained them some criticism as they are also luring people in with the promise of more exclusive drops.
             </p>
             <p>
              They started highlighting Labours misdemeanours first who are the left wing opposition party - some say this is politically motivated. They tend to insult people on twitter who question them so a bit unprofessional and immature as a serious political party.
             </p>
             <p>
              They have now posted some tweets regarding Tory (conservative government) misdemeanours but again all publicly available information being touted as exclusive.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe these lists are still shocking to some but I'm well aware of the scale of paedophilia in uk institutions. I don't like the way this twitter group are touting these as 'exclusive drops' just be upfront and call it what it is - info anyone can Google albiet in a collated form. Personally I think they could have taken more time to add links to these tweets as I've done in one of my other replies here. It would add validity but wouldn't fit with their 'exclusive' narrative.
             </p>
             <p>
              I encourage any one or any group to highlight these sort of past crimes in politics. It strengthens the argument for the naysayers of pizzagate in a sense that pedophiles are everywhere even in politics. However I'm betting most of these are not involved in ELITE networking paedophilia the real pizzagate stuff. Thats higher level and is what the failed Westminster investigations have covered up.
             </p>
             <p>
              British Fight claim.to be dropping these soon. Big claim. Will see if it comes true.

            . If this is all true, and that account doesn't get nuked by Twitter, this is going to be a great set of leaks! I'm giving this the "Potential Lead" flair and stickying it, in hopes of getting Voaters to add links to the source material that supports the claims of this Twitter.

             So far I'm almost certain all of the above names are of Labour politicians/councillors/activists that have already been convicted of these crimes over past 20/30 years. For example-
