            The whole Ted Gunderson story is a big one... I wouldnt draw conclusions based on this new info.
Here is a very detailed report on the whole gunderson story..
           </p>

            <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/tg/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course Ken from educate-yourself was always very pro Gunderson.. 
I honestly cant say if he was a double agent or not. It seems quite possible considering recent outs of various agents like AJ and others.

             I  looked  at  Ken's section  on  CIA and  my  impression  is  that it  is  the typical warmed  over explanation, avoiding the really gruesome  details  of  CIA; Ken  has a lot to  say about well  known investigative  reporters- jury  still  out  on  this site

            <strong>
             Kissinger/William Colby subordinate
            </strong>
            , and a retired Nebraska Senator. Like Aquino and Gunderson,
            <strong>
             DeCamp worked for the CIA
            </strong>
            . The U.S. Army assigned DeCamp to serve Colby, the Director of Central Intelligence, during the
            <strong>
             Nixon era
            </strong>
            . Colby, with** DeCamp, ran the Phoenix Program** that involved assassinations and torture.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the Vietnam War was winding down, with dissidents on the rise, and the media devastating public confidence in government and the military, Aquino and Colby, assisted by DeCamp, refined psychological warfare black ops for “The Company,” especially leveraging the media for controlling opposition."

              I  sure as  hell do-"BY THEIR  FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW  THEM"   I'm not  Christian but this statement is  certainly the truth of The  Creator -you can't do  business with the  Devil(s) and be  clean-some shit  just  doesn't  wash  off-the  association and murderous  work  of  each  of these  officials make  their character  and deeds very visible-what does  it take  to  open  your  eyes???

            I don't necessarily agree that Gunderson is controlled opposition. The evidence he is controlled opposition seems to be that he married Diana Rively. Poster doesn't mention that the same sources claiming the marriage also claim he divorced her in less than a year.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sources claim to have spoken to Ted Gunderson by phone and not in-person. They spoke mostly to Diana Rively. Isn't it just possible they found someone who can manage to sound a bit like Ted Gunderson to call the sources and introduce them to Diana by exclaiming "I got married!". Apparently, there is a note or something both sources claim to have received from Ted. If they can fake a President's birth certificate (however badly), they can certainly fake a note.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps he DID get married, realized he was being duped by a Satanist succubus and had been married by a "priest" from the Church of Satan.  He probably figured it doesn't count since there are no court records, he doesn't believe in Satanism and the priest probably wasn't vested by the state with the power to marry anybody.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would a Satanist marry anyway? Seems unlikely that the "heiress to the Church of Satan" would want to enter into the sanctity of marriage with anybody. Unless she was just trying to be a Satanic succubus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides, People from the Church of Satan lie. That's what they do. That's why they are IN the church of Satan. When the devil lies, he is speaking his native language.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the account says Diana Rively spoke for some time with the sources by phone about her work at the CIA. Really? What in the world did they have to talk about that wasn't confidential, secret or top secret?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was it even Diana Rively they spoke to on the phone? How would they know if it wasn't even her? Are they personal acquaintances of hers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems likely to me that some folks are just lying about stuff. They knew they couldn't keep up the charade that Ted Gunderson was married for very long. So they claimed they received a note from Ted indicating the reason for the divorce was that Diana was keeping from his work. Clearly, they couldn't say Ted's note indicated he found out she was a Satanist and divorced her for that reason. That would restore too much of Ted's credibility. So they made his motive for divorce selfish.

             Come the  fuck on-Gunderson, the  expert on Satanism is  duped  by Rively? The  bitch must really have a pussy that counts, eh?
   And this is  not the only reason why  people  have qualms about  Gunderson, the episode with Art Bell and Gunderson accusing Bell of raping  his  own  kid (for which  he was successfully  sued) among other things-not LEAST was  the  fact that NO ONE was  prosecuted for any sexual crimes in Franklin debacle-that *&amp;%$ Larry Kind did part of a sentence for money laundering (and apparently is free and  alive-untouched)

             For those who read Horrowitz entire expose they would see how he mentioned they were trying to discredit him by saying he was one of them. How hard would it be to simply say he was part of their societies? Bottom line is, his claim is that the satanic  child abduction torture murder ring is real and Gunderson was to be the investigation so they could make sure they can continue with impunity. And they have. So what use does he have to discredit Gunderson? The investigation were already a failure so sabotaging them is not the goal. Gunderson did nothing but talk and allow it to continue with impunity. The infor was already coming out, he just made sure nothing could come of it by being in charge of the investigation. The article points it out clearly.

Gunderson had other legit white-hat sources and collaborators too who vouch for him.  So the point is he HAS contributed HUGLEY to formation of a grassroots movement

             Playing Devils advocate, this still doesn't legitimise him or absolve him as a potential limited hangout.  Grassroots are still fertilised like any other idea/movement and the CIA has an incredible track record for astroturfing.

              Gunderson prosecutes nobody in the FBI or CIA despite a wealth of material. Bottom line is the FBI is part of the cabal so expecting the FBI to arrest itself and it's partners in crime is a fatal mistake.

             You need better discernment. Doesn't make sense for him to be a night of malta and try to tell us that not only is the child abduction ring real, but the authorities in charge of prosecuting are actually controlling the investigations so the ring can continue unimpeeded. Horrowitz already made clear they were trying to discredit him by saying he was one of them. If he was, why would  he be doing what he is doing? Again, he says the ring is real but the invvestiigations are actually damage control. That's what I got. So when does the FBI led PG investigations get kicked off?

"Our objectives are:
            </p>
            <pre><code>To reveal the Darkside's secret Plan 2000 for total world control by our present evil world leaders.
To reveal to the world's people that Creator God Aton of Light also has a Plan 2000. God Aton and His Forces of Light will not do it for us but will work with us, as we responsibly confront evil in our day and change the "ending of the play."
To reveal the evil world leaders' cover-up of off-world humans (our ancestors), who are here in starships in Earth's atmosphere at this time, and who have come with good intent to help us prevent the evil Plan 2000 from being accomplished, and to help us establish the New Age of Enlightenment.
To reveal the Truth presently being given to our civilization by the Realms of Light"

            Some good stuff.... Actors Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher started their own organization, called the Demi &amp; Ashton Foundation (DNA.) Their international campaign message was, “Take A Stand Against Child Sex Slavery.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of addressing the widespread problem–the international satanic network and its officials pulling the strings–the celebrities lamely address local pedophiles. DNA is asking, “Are You A Real Man?” “Do You Prefer A Real Man?”
           </p>
           <p>
            The psychology and target of this message is idiotic, albeit resulted in the apparent targeting  of these celebrities by the oligarchy. This controlled opposition they also controlled. Someone should have informed Moore and Kutcher that satanists don’t give a damn about “real manhood.” The Illuminati, superficially depicted in Eyes Wide Shut, relish their Bohemian Grove diet of human sacrifices, served on plates of Royal Copenhagen porcelain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moore and Kutcher’s United Nation’s sponsor, David Rockefeller and company, means they are part of the problem of controlled opposition, needed by the CIA and Aquino to control opposition.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Rockefeller is shown here with Benjamin Fulford who altered the last report of assassinated journalist Edward Harle (a.k.a., Christopher Story), attaching Szymanski’s Knights of Malta forgery to extend the COINTELPRO assault on Horowitz, and implicate the doctor in Harle’s murder.

             Barbara Hartwell-Interesting person and  her  website-my  question is   can ANY  CIA who  lists  their accomplishments as  part  of  CIA psychological  warfare  be  trusted? The fact that  she  is a  minister  means  NOTHING-this is a  topic  that  needs  to  be  visited  by the  whole  community-does  the  CIA  really  allow  insiders  to put this  kind  of information  out? I agree the  info  looks  good-but this is a  nagging  question I  have  yet  to settle

            Rudolp Giuliani would was also in on it. He made sure no charges were levied. From the passage below...
           </p>
           <p>
            “Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite ‘950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation,’ the investigation, ‘led by former U.S. Attorney [and future mayor] Rudolph Giuliani’ (of 9/11 infamy) produced ‘no federal grand jury indictments,’ according to the Herald Record…” (See Steinberg’s full report HERE.)
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder he was selected as Mayor of NYC during 9/11. He was part of that cover up too. Made sure all the forensic evidence was shipped out of the country to China and other places at light speed.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you guys still think the FBI is about to spring charges on their own opperations?

              I believe quite a few have tried but TPTB have anticipated this for as long as they've been dominating and thus have the measures in place to thwart any significant threat.  Also if we consider that the only way to get word out to the world is via their channels i.e the internet, print media, tv/radio then the odds are even more greatly stacked against them.  It's plausible that stuff has got out and may even be in circulation today but anyone who comes into contact with or attempts to further disseminate winds up dead or missing.  Lastly if you did have the opportunity to leak paradigm altering info but had a family you cared about, this would make you think twice as you would be acutely aware that they would kill every person you have ever loved if needs be to maintain anonymity and preserve their supremacy.

               Contemplate how one must expose the "bad element" without detection. Then, when it's your turn for God's sake, do your part as you will see the signs. Despite the illusion of their total awareness, we remain as unpredictable as a coin toss. One tip though, avoid psychiatrists, the military and spooky people.

            Gunderson was most certainly a limited hangout, and the CIA is definitely still running psyops against us.

              Anyone in a position of power who claims to be dedicated to fighting elite child trafficking/pedophilia needs to be examined. Webb, Seaman, Frost, Jones, Cernovich, even Gowdy and Trump. Not everyone is involved, sure, but we can't just accept people's word at face value anymore. The ones running psyops know what we want to hear/see and know that many of us are placated by pretty words and powerful speeches. The difference is in what actions they take.

               This^^ It's a litmus test for me when trying to discern the authenticity of a new 'paragon'.  Now I'm not trying to teach anyone to suck eggs as I appreciate how switched on many of my fellow voat'ers are but for anyone who is new to this game of sniffing out the shysters, this is my approach.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the individual in question was once connected to the establishment in any meaningful way and are then free to run their mouth in a critical manner about said powers, it's a big red flag for a limited hangout imo.  If they suddenly go dark or wind up dead then they generally get my support but unfortunately this is a pyrrhic victory and always demoralising.  The level of media attention one garners is such a reliable method to measure the veracity of someone.  If this attention and promotion comes from the MSM, it's a trap! and the same goes for much of the indi/alt media network as this is ostensibly owned and run by the MSM moguls.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't just look for criticism against those who appear legit as this can often be contrived subterfuge.  Instead concentrate on how little exposure one receives for their actions and promulgations.  If they're barely on the radar but resonate and concur with other legit truthers/researchers, this can be a good indicator of their authenticity and trustworthyness.  TPTB understand that the best way to make a problem go away (apart from snuffing out life) is to ignore it or sabotage it's ability to become apparent (messing with search results, doxxing, hack attacks, blocking etc).  That's why I hold a candle to no one in particular and wrote off Assange, Snowden, Jones et al a long time ago.  Unfortunately this also brings into question the veracity of Pizzagate itself, which I do believe is a psy-op but relates to very real crimes committed at the top of world power.  It's yet again another limited hangout.

                You hit the nail on the head with everything you just said. These people have turned limited hangouts into a fine art. Psyops on top of psyops. Pizzagate itself is a limited hangout, like you said. People get so up in arms when I say that, but it's true. It doesn't make Pizzagate any less real, it just makes it a less-serious crime that distracts us while they go do something worse somewhere else. It was too perfectly laid out. Then the false flags, like the Comet Ping Pong shooting. We were set up to look like fools from the beginning. Pizzagate was handed to us as a pedophile/trafficking ring operating out of businesses on Connecticut Avenue and involving Hillary Clinton. We managed to find the truth of the matter and take it further. I'm glad to see that there are other Voaters that realize this as well!

                 Thank you and it's reassuring to hear others espouse the now unfortunate but very real position we find ourselves in.  There are quite a few Pizzagate naysayers in this community now and as demoralising and incensing as it may be, we cannot pretend and obviate certain facts just to appease our original suspicions and mistakes.  We have been played from the very beginning but personally I only realised this concretely a couple of months ago.  I have been suspicious of WikiLeaks and Assange for a couple of years now but it was Pizzagate that confirmed their duplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We are up against such an incredibly adroit and unwavering enemy, one that has centuries of experience and nous in beguiling and herding the masses that it's hard not to be impressed...sometimes!  As you say it's multi-layered psy-ops on top of psy-ops so making sense of it all is both arduous and perplexing and few stick with it long enough to see the patterns and understand even the basic methodology.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One thing I forgot to mention and I'm forced to contradict myself somewhat reg the judgement of potential legit whistle-blowers is that sometimes it may be deemed beneficial by TPTB to allow these (legit) individuals to castigate them, even concerning sensitive info.  This can be regarded as another psy-op but by proxy as it serves to compartmentalise the interests of fellow dissenters thus making it easier for TPTB to monitor a given group and incrementally seed with dis-info agents etc.  Also the revelation of truths of this nature (child trafficking, SRA, TBMC) serves as a psychological weapon to demoralise, desensitise and charge emotionally those who engage with it.  When one becomes emotionally connected to a subject, objectivity can be impaired and the individual far more susceptible to manipulation.  We must observe, learn, remain emotionally disconnected and utilise our greater number to counter their strategies.  And just to reiterate, I'm utterly convinced of the type of crimes that Pizzagate pertains to.

               Agree.  I've been saying that looking at data is important rather than solely relying on words or 'opinions'.

                Neil Wolfe, was around for the pizzagate protests. Probably legit but you never know. Craig Sawyer most very likely is not legit and RDS most likely definitely is not.

            Fiona's mates are pushing gunderson I came across his video before but didn't find him too convincing as well pushing David Icke the reptilian shill to undermine pizzagate. Truth News Radio Australia failed to cut him down to size as he promised to in the lead up to their interview. Shills are everywhere: (

            Mike Holt redacted my interviews from his channel after Garry Burns the great boylover 666 threatened to sue them. I put them up on talkshoe after the censorship.  Garry Burns forwarded me his emails of him kissing court confirmed faggot pedo arse.

            - that's the first interview he censored. The second unaired one I played live but it didn't upload to talkshoe. i'll have to dig for it somewhere.

            Garry, I have reviewed much of the 'evidence' Luke has sent me....and believe me he has swamped me with links to dozens of articles and interviews. I have just told him that he has not provided definitive evidence that you are a paedophile and therefore I am not going to air the interview with him today.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no need for you to keep sending me your defence. Please leave me alone....and I am asking Luke to do the same. This is not my fight.

            Meanwhile the same evidence comes out in court - and Garry Burns admits he was a member of a pedophile group on Facebook as exposed here. FAIL!
