            I remember a woman that had a video from the Bellagio showing people sitting all along the hallways throughout the casino that night.

            She mentions there was a shooting in the lobby of the hotel.  Also, remember Trump said there could have been thousands killed, but thankful there wasn't. This must of been the real intel he received. Upvoat

            The connections are there, but one problem I see with your theory is that I think he was flying smaller Cessna's....I don't think they would have the legs to get to the US from the PI or vice/versa.  You should next research the type of planes he flew and the maximum range.  Commercial flights to the PI from the US generally go West Coast, and then either the Southern route of Hawaii/Guam or Northern route skirting Alaska to Japan/Taiwan and then the PI...either way that is a lot of open ocean.  Granted, you can modify the small planes to carry more fuel, but it comes at the expense of payload carrying capacity.  IIRC, the payload capacity of a Cessna 210 is only about 1300 pounds.

            FBI set this guy up completely... truthers and conspiracy theorists are following the breadcrumbs that have been laid out about Stephen Paddock. He was a patsy, and all of this information is just red meat for the wolves. None of it is true.

            Was looking at map, Luxor across the street.  Wondered if any satanic holidays.
           </p>
           <p>
            Didnt find anything for 1st, but did find .. A members birthday is the highest ritual
           </p>
           <p>
            It usually involves the member or a victim of members choice.

           <p>
            A quick look has Theresa May, Jimmy Carter and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a thought
           </p>

             It was THREE days before the full moon on the 5th October..the HARVEST Moon.  Highly significant and meaningful in occult terms.  In witchcraft the 3 days prior to and after a full moon is considered a very powerful time..

            The thing that puzzles the hell out of me is why they would use a guy like Paddock for a job like this? If Paddock is connected to all the dirty deals that he appears to be connected to they shouldn't want to take a chance of compromising him because he is a money maker for the cult.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            There was no way to hide this guys past from prying eyes. They used him anyway. I'm wondering why they didn't use some throwaway person with a fake name and untraceable background?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I wonder if Paddock has any alias names?

            What pisses me off is the fact that no matter how much solid information you guys dig up, no matter how professionally and eloquently the information is presented, the normie masses will just never believe it unless its said on CNN or some other major "news" network. I actually had a very dear friend get very pissed at me over this Vegas thing and say, with tears in his eyes, "I can't believe that you would use the deaths of all these people to try and fit your insane Pizzagate ideas." The (((elite))) love to use people's emotions against them and they know that they will be so clouded by negative emotions that they won't even be mentally capable of listening to any opinion that's not from an "official source." That's their game right now, trying to get everyone to believe ANYTHING that they put on the news, and to disbelieve anyone who says anything that is different than what was on the all-knowing, all-seeing TV.

             That is why I am rooting for the elite to wipe the normies out. I think I finaly understand the elite. My taste and ethics are different, but the normies contribute nothing. I invite them to all get on the next FEMA barge when offered and leave their valubales behind. I have no time or tears for sheeple. 16 years since 9/11 and they haven't a clue about anything.

             That's Not fucking true. Stop saying that. I didn't read the rest of your comment- forgive me if it completely changes the context of message... But this is all extremelly new.  Pizzagate Is Fucking New. Like I get it- It's been on going for millennia but The mass awakening and acceptance of this shit being true- Is unprecedented... And continues to Spread exponentially. And It only started to spread like this recently.
            </p>
            <p>
             To say this shit is never going to be accepted... Is just being lazy and or retarded.

             People are saying Left and right.. almost as if they are being directed to... I'm not saying they are- I understand the pessimism is real and obviously fucking justified. There's been a lot of people screaming this shit at the top of their lungs for a long time- But no one payed attention... One could argue it's because Those people shouting That- are also shouting that our Leaders are lizards- In between their shouts Of human trafficking.
             <sub>
              And listen- Based on everything I learned over the last year- I'm not even convinced their not lizards- I'm just saying thats not how you get people to take you seriously... Regardless if is true.(I don't think it is)

             I was saying you can't say "Nothings gonna change" because there's Nothing Unfolding today that can be compared to the past.

            <p>
             It simply can't.  They are truly different worlds. And shit hasn't been this crazy over the last decade... Like the True Shit storm/ mass awakening hasn't even made its first trip around the sun.
             <sub>
              Or how ever that shit works
             </sub>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Events that unfolded over the last year are fucking unprecedented pretty much on every level. Try to present ANYTHING  IN our existence as Human beings as being comparable to the shit show that has unfolded over the last year- and continues to unfold on an unpredictable basis.

            <p>
             Saying "The normies masses will just never believe it unless its on CNN.. Just isn't true. Cnn Is worse by the day. They will be over eventually. Someone will take their place- but the Name CNN will be gone in the foreseeable future.

             The Jew/Masons have been controlling media and our whole thought processes for generation after generation.  Dont despair.  There are three types of people.  One will see the truth with evidence....one who will see the truth with massive amounts of work and evidence and persuasion....and one that wont ever see the truth.

            That would make sense to me because something that seems fishy to me...
           </p>
           <p>
            Stephen Paddocks father was a bank robber and on the FBI’s 10 most wanted list until 1978 or 1979. He also tried to run over an FBI agent with his car.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It has now emerged that his father, Patrick Benjamin Paddock, was known as a violent bank robber during the 1960s and 1970s. His crimes made him one of the most notorious criminals in the US during his heyday.
            </p>
            <p>
             The older Paddock was also involved in a violent attack in Las Vegas, according to a contemporaneous report in Tucson's Daily Citizen. When he was apprehended by the FBI, he attempted to run down an agent using his car, the report said.
            </p>

            Here are some newspaper clippings...

           </p>
           <p>
            What is strange to me, is that Steven Paddock worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin starting in 1985.. Lockheed Martin is THE Worlds Largest Defense Contractor in the World!
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Lockheed Martin released a statement saying Paddock worked for the defense contractor in the 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Stephen Paddock worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin from 1985 until 1988," the company said in its statement. "We're cooperating with authorities to answer questions they may have about Mr. Paddock and his time with the company."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They would have some major background checks and be VERY strict. To me, it’s pretty strange that someone would pass a background check to work there only 6 or 7 years after his father was captured.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some podcast the other day said Steven had something like an accountant position. Also, a lot of things are coming out saying he worked for the CIA. The fact that they would hire a notorious criminals son not long after the capture, makes me think they used Steven Paddock for much more than an innocent accountant. Especially when you add everything together.

             Just looking over some old posts and read yours about Paddock working at Lockheed.  Comey was the head of Lockheed from 2005 thru 2010.  He must have had some ties or known about what Paddock was doing.  Maybe Paddock was already running drugs and children.

            You know whats also called Paradise Ranch?
           </p>
           <p>
            "To encourage workers to move out into the area, Johnson named the facility “Paradise Ranch”, a designation which the base is sometimes called even to this day.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name “Area 51” actually came from where the base was located, Groom Lake was located in a grid marked as “Area 51” on the map."

             Woah! The JANET terminal rumored to be now Area 51 employees is just southeast of the concert venue.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second window broken gives a lousy view of the concert but a great view of JANET
            </p>
            <p>
             Media has also reported he targeted two white fuel tanks beside JANET.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could his have been some hit on Area 51 people?

              This involves the drug running in Mena Arkans, Iran Contra and Nicaragua.  Holy Cow.  Was Paddock the Barry Seal of Today?  Were all those guns found in his room part of an Arms Deal gone wrong?  I don't know what to think anymore, we are in the midst of  Ironing this all out.  But this is a Holy Mess.  I think this Barry Seal Op possibly involved BC and GHWB.  I have read articles before about BC being involved in this stuff way before being Gov. of Ar.   Barry Seal was the one that would drop all those drugs in the fields of Mena, remember those two boys that were found on the RR tracks and a judge found their deaths an accident  that they were run over by a train.  I don't know but this sounds very similar to what Paddock might have been doing.

             I'm sure it's related. These psychopathic freaks love to troll the masses with their films. Like I always say, you won't find any truth in mainstream fake news, but they will often slip the truth in films, music and tv shows that are presented as mere "creative fiction" and "harmless entertainment" - in other words, places where you would least expect to find the truth. For example, take the new disaster film "Geostorm", which is about evil entities using weaponized weather control to wreak havoc on the world. A coincidence that this film is released right on the heels of the hurricanes in North America? Of course not. Those hurricanes were artificially provoked. We know that the US has been weaponizing weather since at least the 60s, during the Vietnam war, for example. We have Kennedy openly speaking about weather control in 1961. Then there is HAARP and other projects created solely for the purpose of controlling weather.

              Also not a coincidence that the storms just happened to pass over countries that were high in child trafficking. The storm just happened to destroy all the physical evidence in the area. No more island, no more physical proof. Not much left to investigate after a storm. Same as that earthquake in Haiti after they kicked out the Clintons. Cute.

              They aren't Psychopaths though, they are far worse they are Malignant Narcissists, every action they take relates back to Narcissism.

               The people at the top of the power structure are psychopaths, sociopaths, Satanists, and pedophiles, all wrapped up into one horrible package. These are people who literally murder and eat human children on a regular basis, and believe that they get "magick powers" by doing so. We are not dealing with people who are even remotely close to being on the same page as we are; these are people who may as well be living on a completely different planet, with different physics and different rules.

              Its a good scam they have going. Put nothing but falsehoods on the "news," which is supposed to be truth, and slip the actual truth into pieces of media that are called "fiction," so if you try to talk about secret societies or anything like that, the masses can make jokes like "Oh I think you've seen "Eyes Wide Shut" too many times, anon! You're crazy!"

              I've been looking at some Youtube videos about this situation today. I saw one, where ETNR on Youtube went out to check on Paddock's plane etc. - It was gone. -

              </a>
              - I don't know much about this YouTube channel, but there is all this information coming up about this guy and his connections etc. The story the MSM is releasing is out of control and changing everyday. They can't seem to come to a consensus about it.  Then I saw this in a sidebar, after I read some information her on this board. -

              - Sane Progressive  on YouTube pointed this out the other day. - She was watching this video.

              - at 00:27 you can see him in an exit room with a ton of police and people that appear to be FBI agents, etc. The supposed narrative is that he slipped and fell a year ago in the hotel, and this footage is from then, and that this was the response after he fell and hurt himself. - Debbie pointed out several logical reasons why this narrative is crazy suspicious. Then just yesterday Trump mentions the "calm before the storm." - I hope to god this thing is finally reaching the boiling point. -

                This literally looks like the guy was intentionally blinding people with some kind of light, - I kept wondering, - where was that spotlight coming from? - The he's seen exiting the scene. Very ominous. All of this footage that the MSM networks are showing about the victims and the carnage, and there was even this one on vimeo that ... there was this guy running around filming supposedly seeing who he could help? (former military?) - Anyway it looked totally bogus. I don't know, but I just ...there wasn't ...it wasn't visceral. It just screamed FAKE. -

            I found a magazine put out  by the Paragon Foundation in the summer of 2010 with an article on the Paradise Ranch in Wyoming

             The PARAGON Foundation provides for education, research and the exchange of ideas

private property rights and the continuation of rural customs and culture – all with the
intent of celebrating and continuing our Founding Fathers vision for America.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 2008, PArAGoN Foundation filed an amicus brief
in the landmark case Heller v. DC saying that the Federal
Government had no right to deny an individual’s right to
keep and bear arms under the 2ND Amendment of the
Constitution. Although Otis McDonald v. Chicago might
look similar in nature, it addresses the 14TH Amendment
rather than the Second. The City of Chicago’s claim was,
that even if the Federal Government could not deny
mcDonald’s right to keep and bear arms, they had the right
to do so. In conflict with Chicago’s claim stands the 14TH
Amendment, which proclaims that the States may not
“abridge the privileges or immunities” protected by the
Constitution. PArAGoN Foundation believed those
issues raised by otis mcDonald were of equal importance to
those raised in the Heller v. DC case, so, we again filed an
amicus brief into the united States Supreme Court.

              My comment is NOT an analysis.  Do you know what that is?  I'm asking for direct links to any associations to places named Paradise Ranch as the only documented link we have is the one I provided i.e. the Paradise Ranch 21 LLC.

              Think you need to re-read the thread.

               My system shows In Corp Services as a registering agent to Paradise Ranch.  Perhaps this is their website?
