<p>Special counsel Robert Mueller is getting the cooperation of a Lebanese-American businessman with ties to Arab royalty in his probe of foreign influence on the Trump presidential campaign, including the possibility of a back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team.</p>
<p>George Nader testified earlier this month to the Mueller grand jury. Nader is an advisor to Crown Prince Mohamnad bin Zayal Al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the UAE. According to the Times, Mueller is investigating whether Emirati money found its way into the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mueller should ask his new star witness what he was doing partying on an exclusive island resort with Bill Clinton, especially when the Clinton\'s have been caught helping fund the bogus Trump dossier which helped launch Mueller\'s probe. During Trump\'s transition to the White House, Bill Clinton was at a lavish resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic with Nader. That was BEFORE the Mueller investigation. <a href="https://truepundit.com/busted-muellers-new-star-witness-trump-caught-partying-exclusive-island-resort-bill-clinton/">https://truepundit.com/busted-muellers-new-star-witness-trump-caught-partying-exclusive-island-resort-bill-clinton/</a></p>
<p>Before Nader became the latest subject of intrigue with Mueller, he ran a magazine on Middle East policy and positioned himself as a go-between in Middle East peace negotiations. Interviews with more than 2 dozen friends and associates of Nader illustrate a mysterious man, who by some accounts has for decades quietly aided people in power.</p>
<p>Nader was born and raised in Lebanon before moving to the US as a teen. He went to Cleveland State University but dropped out to start &quot;International Insight, Inc.&quot; and a magazine of the same name. The name was soon renamed &quot;Middle East Insight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Middle East&quot; became well known in policy circles. At its height, it featured interviews with Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Diane Feinstein, and then Senatoir Joe Biden. Nader\'s writers also interviewed world leaders, such as Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and the who\'s who of Middle Eastern leaders including Arafat, Rabin, Gaddafi, Mubarak, and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.</p>
<p>Nader seemed to have a knack for connections. In 1987 he found himself amid Afghan mujahideen, Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, and Hezbollah leaders in the home of Ayatollah Khomeini, then the supreme leader of Iran.</p>
<p>Nader developed a reputation as a &quot;shadoiwy&quot; figure. &quot;It was hard to know if he had a political agenda, whether this was a political opportunist, or whether he was trying to make money,&quot; said a spokesperson. &quot;He wanted to connect with power and clearly reach out to people he thought were power players.&quot;</p>
<p>During the Clinton administration, Nader had connections to people at high levels of both Israeli and Arab governments which was unusual at the time because of tensions between Israel and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Then, in the early 2000\'s, poof, he was gone and escaped the public eye unttil the news outlet, Axios, first reported about the White House visits in January.

<p>Nader was arrested in 1985 on child pornography charges which was eventually dismissed according to court documents. &quot;The Court found that Mr. Nader\'s rights had been flagrantly violated, and the case was thrown out in its entirety before trial,&quot; a representative fir Nader told &quot;The Intercept.&quot;</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, as relayed in the US District Court judge\'s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence innthe case, Nader received a package that included both a film of young boys engaged in sexual acts and pictures depicting nude boys. Authorities conducted a search based on a warrant, and similar material was found in a room that Nader rented in a Washington home. The evidence discovered in the home was ruled inadmissable when the warrant was challenged, but the material delivered in the original packjage was not ruled inadmissable. In July 1986, just ahead if a jury trial, the charges were dismissed. Not all the court filings are available online, and the reasons for the dismissal were not clear.</p>
<p>Just weeks after the charges were dismissed, Nader was at the home of the leader of Iran\'s Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini. <a href="https://yournews.com/2018/03/12/356294/george-nader-cooperating-witness-in-mueller-probe-was-arrested-for/">https://yournews.com/2018/03/12/356294/george-nader-cooperating-witness-in-mueller-probe-was-arrested-for/</a></p>
<p>Nader then had pedophile convictions in Prague on 10 cases of sexually abusing minors and was sentenced to a 1 year prison term in May 2003. A court spokesperson said tge crimes occurred between 1999 and 2002. The spokesperson also said that Nader was convicted of &quot;moral corruption of minors, sexual abuse, and impairing morals&quot; after abusing teenage boys.</p>
<p>In 1 case he requested oral sex from a 14-year old in a room at the Hilton Hotel in Prague. After the boy refused, Nader masturbated in front of the boy and paid him 2,000 koruna - worth about $100 today. The verdict cites other examples of Nader providing money, jewelry, cellphones, clothing, and accomodation for sexual services. It was unclear how much oif the 1 year sentence he served in the Czech Republic. He was ordered expelled following his time served. <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/mueller-witness-is-convicted-pedophile-with-shadowy-past-as-a-mideast-negotiator/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/mueller-witness-is-convicted-pedophile-with-shadowy-past-as-a-mideast-negotiator/</a></p>',

            Blind Item #7
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point, this witness will do or say anything to get out of the jam he is in. What kind of jam? How about the largest collection of child porn the world has ever seen. This foreign national is one of the richest members of the richest families of the world. For dozens of years he filmed boys as young as 3 having sex with grown men. There were thousands of these boys who worked as slaves during the day and then would be forced to have sex with grown men. All filmed. That slavery practice has ended, but the boys are still imported from other countries and still raped and it is all still filmed. The FBI found out about it and now are using its existence to get him to say whatever they want him to say. Apparently these people are so rich they have their own "cloud" which is highly encrypted where all these videos are stored.

             , just an fyi - my submission did not get posted.  I submitted it x2.  #1 submission appeared, but I immediately saw there was a glaring spelling error in the title.  I quickly copy and pasted the script,  entered a corrected title and submitted #2 and deleted #1.  So, #2, the corrected submission is not showing up on the subverse.  Can you fix that?
            </p>

             Thanks, derram!
