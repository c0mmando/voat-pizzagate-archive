<p>Hey, all! This is a repost. I deleted this thread because I didn\'t get disinfo, but do now. There may be leads in here so I feel to make of thngs what you will, but it\'s important to have info up and available. Threads have given me many clues. So in honor of FUCK YOU, JAMES ALEFANTIS MONTH (yes, the month has been extended through the whole of July -- had to get in the summer solstice), I thought I’d kick it off by following through on a theory as to how Madeleine McCann could have been sold and how the police could find her or other children by using art auctions. </p>
<p>For me, there is no doubt that a pedophile ring was involved. Because of multiple sickos being complicit, the notion that the art world could be used for money laundering and other transactions such as these is viable. It’s such a perfect way to move large sums around without attracting too much of the wrong kind of attention. Since James Alefantis and the Pedostas are involved in both selling and buying art, the coincidence of them doing so sort of lends credence to this theory. Without a filthy underbelly, I can’t imagine why scum like this would even involve themselves in aesthetics. There’d almost have to be a crass motivation that would materially benefit them for them to take notice, but, hey, that’s me! Of course, in the pizzagate world, there are no answers, only greater mysteries. So I’m posting what I found, hoping it triggers one of you geniuses out there to ascend Mount Olympus and snag an actual truth. Anyway, here’s how the story goes … </p>
<p>A couple of months ago, a member of the forum posted about FBI anon … I don’t follow FBI anon so I’m not familiar with what s/he says, but the latest clue (at that time) was about following the cards? One of the suggestions was that the hint was directed at the Sotheby International Preferred Access cards. It stuck in my head because it tied in with this money laundering. For me, it also tied in with the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann. Why? Because: (1) that child was a prize that someone wanted to collect; (2) if a pedophile ring was involved (and it was), a child this beautiful is shared with others of the same ilk and not just killed; and (3) the masterminds behind the crime would need to be paid for the privilege of partaking. </p>
<p>Madeleine was born on May 12, 2003. She was abducted on May 3, 2007, just shy of her fourth birthday. Now in order for her to be passed around, she first needed to be abducted with the help of what I feel was an insider close to the McCann’s. After that was accomplished, it was then imperative to get the word out. It’s only logical. So first, the child is abducted. Then the invitations go out and time is given to letting the word spread that she is up for grabs. The word gets around, pedos get excited, and everybody wants to get in on having at this poor child. In other words, a bidding war is triggered. </p>
<p>I believe all this could have been executed through an art sale. To see if it were possible, I performed a search for May 2007 and found that not one, but TWO record art sales were conducted on two consecutive nights—May 15th and 16th. One auction was at Christie’s and the other at Sotheby’s. $384.6 million and $254.8 million were collected. Here’s the NYT article denoting both: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/XtIzv">http://archive.is/XtIzv</a></p>
<p>Since the dates of May 15th and 16th were right in that pocket, I became VERY curious as to what produced such outrageous bidding. I saw that the big ticket item for Christie’s was Andy Warhol’s Green Car Crash. It was and I quote 
“a rare image of a photo from a 1963 issue of Newsweek showing a car that had crashed and its driver impaled on a telephone pole”</p>
<p>REALLY?!!!! What a LOVELY keepsake to display in your home. Here’s the link (and I’d take a pic if I were you): </p>
<p><a href="http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-green-car-crash-4913707-details.aspx">http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-green-car-crash-4913707-details.aspx</a> </p>
<p>Note “the price realized” was USD 71,720,000. SEVENTY-ONE MILLION DOLLARS? For that piece of crap showing an impaled man?  
</p>
<p>Okay, I was hooked so I tracked down the Sotheby page for May 15th and found the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/w4GKI">http://archive.is/w4GKI</a> </p>
<p>There were no pics shown due to copyright violations, so I went in search of the “artwork” (and I use the term VERY loosely—so loosely that it belies the definition). I first found Jim Hodges NO ONE EVER LEAVES. It basically amounts to a black leather jacket and a spider web? Note that it keeps with this VICTIM theme:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/uGDEY">http://archive.is/uGDEY</a></p>
<p>Seriously, WTH? Is a jacket thrown on the ground with a stupid spider web worth millions? NO! So I went in search of another of the artwork that fetched such an astronomical amount. This time I went with Elizabeth Peyton’s CRAIG. It turned out to be a photo, but it didn’t stop there. The photograph turned up on Amazon under BOOKS?!!!!! </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/WxLTl">http://archive.is/WxLTl</a></p>
<p>What the hell is it doing under books? Well, it seems Ms. Peyton interwove pics of her friend Craig with the pics of the British royal family during the time of Princess Diana’s death.</p>

<p>What a CHARMING idea? Is she going to follow up by doing one of the McCann family? But I wanted to know more so I did a search using the info given which was Walther Konig and Dashwood Books and came up with this: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/mU2e2">http://archive.is/mU2e2</a> </p>
<p>There’s this guy Craig juxtapositioned in an identical pose with Princess Diana? The year Diana was murdered was 2007. The photo? Dated 2008 so this was done purposely, but again, why? I looked over what Dashwood BOOKS has to offer and found lots of spurious woman as objects and other smarmy titles. They have a whole collection devoted to smut. On their website, they give their hours. Now remember this is a “BOOK STORE” and yet it says: “ON MONDAYS BY APPOINTMENT ONLY”?!!!! What happens on Monday that you have to make an appointment? Maybe something that requires them doing a background check on you to make sure you’re not a fed or with Interpol. </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/m3v2F">http://archive.is/m3v2F</a></p>
<p>It’s just so curious that this piece of “art” was in this batch that fetched 254,874,000USD. It’s yet another victim-themed work with ties to the UK and a car crash now that I’m thinking about it … hmmmm … </p>
<p>The timing for these two events is just so damned curious. I’m not saying that either of these auctions is connected, but this is a way of doing it. And think about it, the actual owners of these places may not even be aware of something going on—if something is going on. After all, someone may group the invitees by predilection. Most are probably art collectors, but there might be a group with a taste for other things. </p>
<p>Anyway, if I were a cop, this is what I’d be looking for. Something like this where anonymous bidders spent millions on crap. They didn’t get this rich by doing that.</p>',

            At that same Auction a piece called "Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder" by Damian Hirst and a piece by Jeff Koons both went for about a million dollars as well. The Hirst piece is all Butterflies in an "iris of the eye"

            looking circle. Because of the coloboma issue this freaks me out, not to mention the MK Ultra Butterfly connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeff Koons piece is about a shampooer.  I truly wonder if the larger Warhol piece was used to launder the money of the many who would "partake" physically, hence the multiple physical impalements. I also wonder if the leather jacket/silver chain web piece was the collective purchase of those who want online/video access. Hmm...
           </p>
           <p>
            This is good work Quantokitty, good digging. Somehow the art is involved in a huge way. Plus the Pedo's are dealing in real cash going from bank account to bank account instead of an online currency like bitcoin.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the lesser artwork could be the purchase of the child herself. I believe that multiple art pieces would be involved to better hide the illicit cash being traced backed to one piece.

             I totally agree with your assessment. How much money paid signifies different things to different buyers. Could even be who could do what to the real commodity being sold.

             Thanks especially for that Hirst piece photo. Man, is that creepy! Yeah, something was going on there. I think there are some solid leads here for people to dig.

            But she could have thought she knew. She was delusional. All a person knowing this had to do is feed the paranoia. Tell her that her kids were in danger from the father and that she had to get them away from him. It would set up the scenario of her turning over her kids to keep them "safe" when they were anything but.

            "Safe" to someone delusional is not a good indicator of what's going on.

            The point is that the courts did everything to shut her up and not let her husband or the police talk to her. The whole thing is ridiculous.

            You know what? Ten years ago I would have said you were crazy, but now? Now I don't rule anything out. There was also the mention of the mother leaving the children with Erin. Eryn? The same name of the person that used to rent vans and arrange for transportation in the Pedosota memos. So there you go. And I don't know what the police did or didn't do except enable that child pedo ring to steal that child.

            It has to be. Think about James Bond thrillers. Fleming was in with the spooks mining intel and putting it into his novels.

            Maybe the entwining with human trafficking is a new -- very ugly -- twist.

             Well, there has to be a reason people are throwing millions and ending up with a leather jacket underneath a spider web. I mean, really? There's got to be more of a reason than buying crap you'd find on a trash heap.

            Didnt i tell you the first time Diana died in 1997 jfc not that 2007 would be any more significant to this nonstarter of a theory: the mccanns were already elite , so this was obviously not a targeted kidnapping.
