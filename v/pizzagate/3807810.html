<p>I believe the company that Hao Gu worked for, Eaton, did sponsor/support that school.  That would not be surprising as Eaton, though an Irish based company is international and does business in China <a href="https://www.eaton.com/Eaton/OurCompany/NewsEvents/NewsReleases/98066025">https://www.eaton.com/Eaton/OurCompany/NewsEvents/NewsReleases/98066025</a></p>

             Welcome to Voat, Edgewla. Reddit is pretty hated around these parts, and Redditish activities like asking for upvotes are likely to get you the opposition reaction. Just engage normally in discussions and you'll get your CCP rapidly. I see that OTI made a submission for you to discuss the LA research and that seems to be going well.
            </p>

             In the meantime, you may want to try some key word searches to see what else we've turned up about locales in the same vicinity over the past three years. You can do that by going to

             It's well known (among honest health professionals) that death with covid19 is not necessisarly the same as death by covid19 yet here we are counting everything as a Covid19 fatality.

             I think his models need to parse the hot spots from the lesser affected States and counties.  I'd bet that 90% of the predicted deaths in the next can be accounted for within a handful of places.  Not all opening strategies or closing strategies are equal.  New York screwed themselves during the Chinses new year celebrations imho.

             Power management vendor Eaton Tuesday said it has postponed its upcoming Eaton Partner Summit in the face of growing concerns about coronavirus. The Eaton Partner Summit, originally scheduled to be held March 16 to 18 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has been postponed until November, the company told its solution provider partners.

             Dublin, Ireland-based Eaton told partners via email and via the home page for its Eaton Partner Summit that it had anticipated about 250 attendees from eight countries to attend

            <p>
             Gangi said Eaton worked closely with the event venue, the Marriott Resort Fort Lauderdale Harbor Beach, to postpone the Partner Summit until November.

            2 seconds is what it took me to find that Gu is 88th most common name among the 1.4bn Chinks and Cao (tsao) is the 30th.  But then in China the family name comes first, so without the context of a "Mr.", Hao can be the 82nd.

              Former Clinton Foundation Executive Tied to Chinese Kindergartens Investigated for Child Abuse

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              For the second time, a Chinese kindergarten run by the RYB Education New World company is being investigated for abusing children, this time with allegations that staff injected children with unknown substances, fed them white pills, and forced them to strip naked for “health checks” by nude men.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Beijing-based, New York-listed RYB Education company has Joel Getz as an independent director. Getz was president of the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City and is the former director of development for the Clinton Foundation.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the Clinton Foundation, Getz directed its “worldwide charitable, educational, and economic development initiatives,” according to his Yale profile, and “was instrumental in creating a formal development operation for the Clinton Foundation, which raised in excess of $135 million annually.”

               You forgot to source your stats /s. If you are so ostensibly fact oriented (major kek) why not give the more relevant stats regarding common names by comparing the representative population percentage of the top 100 names in China vs the top 100 in the US?  You fussed over the Chinses education comment yet completely ignored the point, which is the communist propaganda being spread by Chinese schools in the US.  Instead you characterized it as though it's merely about "disciplined rote memorization, extra night classes, and competitive exams."  (As if the Chinese invented those). All the studying in the world hasn't fixed China's dismal record of coverup and sloppyness and substandard practices

               (examples are almost too numerous to list just in relation to COVID19 outbreak).  You completely ignored the topic of the RYB Education scandal and didn't add anything to discuss where else the ties could lead.  All in all you are a worthless contributor in this thread.
