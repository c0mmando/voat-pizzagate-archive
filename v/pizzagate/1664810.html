            Appreciate the comments! There's still a lot of good in this world, people can always blame "false memory syndrome" on children and get away with anything, hopefully all of the Ritual Abuse cases get reexamined eventually. I think we're heading in the right direction at least, best of luck with everything!

            Actress Selma Blair went through this MK Ultra process and last summer she had a mental breakdown on an airplane coming back from vacation in Mexico with her husband and young son she started screaming "He hurts me! he burns my private parts!" this was her having a flashback to when she was tortured as a young girl. She was drinking on the plane and taking painkillers and it triggered repressed memories. TMZ.com was all over this story so were the tabloids but they never explained what caused her flashbacks. I hope she got to a psychiatrist who analyzed her and explained it to her.

            I'm sorry that happened to you.  I think that's one of the problems that victims have-reconciling  the good parent as being the same parent who abused them.  In ritual abuse I imagine it's much worse, because the abuse is intended and thought out.

            I've been trying to explain to people the dubstep movement and the lightshows are part of their programming culture(No coincidence it absolutely exploded in popularity even though most listeners were like????) there a reasons those raves are absolutely havens for underage sex, and drugs and many children who are dissociated with their families already from the culture. People who get deep into that rave scene and get out always have tons of mental problems later in life for multitude of reasons, most of them say they are never really happy again and have trouble enjoying anything.

             Yeah I love to experiment but a lot of people I know have absolutely fried themselves over the last few years at these festivals. What's weird is a few people I know on facebook started posting all this pizza stuff after they attended burning man last year. I always wondered why this new music was so repetitive and shitty, it really is to program us into a trance, all about keeping our brainwaves within a certain frequency spectrum so we're "complacent and unaware".

             Interesting username, I wonder if the people who REALLY run the world are doing a lot of dmt, probably hooked up to IV's of that and baby blood to keep them barely alive enough to keep warping our space and time, I bet Alex Jones is gonna end up being right about the psychic vampires. I realized a while ago that linear time is just a trick of the devil, truth and our creative powers are kept well hidden from us.

              My theory is that's one of the reasons they do all the fucked up shit to the kid, to get Adrenochrome the drug that Johnny Depp takes in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, there is a slight mention to the people he gets it from can't remember off the top of my head. Knowing what we know though that the pineal gland releases all remaining DMT upon death, and scaring someone really bad will release PCP, then an infants blood is absolutely filled with stem cells so drinking that probably really is like the holy grail and a hell of a high I would imagine.

            Exactly, only I don't know if I believe that they're doing these things as an appeasement of the flesh. The ritualistic nature of their crimes leads me to believe this goes beyond simple carnality. This is an enormous assumption based on very little, if any, empirical evidence, but I'm starting to think that people like John Podesta and James Alefantis aren't totally human. That they're of a demonic spirit or something similar and not simple possession. They are deliberately mocking God by abusing the free will He gave us to commit the most unspeakable of sins knowing that, for the time being, they will suffer no consequences. Their modus operandi here on earth is to facilitate as much evil as they possibly can; to permeate the earth and it's inhabitants with ungodly amounts of sin and dysfunction. Read the 28th chapter of the Book of Ezekiel. It addresses the king of Tyre but you read on and find that what's being said couldn't possibly apply to a mere human king but to Lucifer/Satan. That seems to suggest, at least to me, that demons can inhabit the bodies of human beings and go about their business without suspicion. That Satan would inhabit a king should tell us that his preference is anyone with power over others. The AntiChrist himself is a good example of this. Obviously I can't say these things with any degree of certainty but it makes sense. I think they do understand the evil they're involved in but as completely evil beings themselves, they don't care. They feel love but it's for nothing but evil and the spread of it.

            Wow just read one of your posts that's horrifying. I've read about this stuff and it's hard to comprehend the horror from the text, society neuters people like me so our brains can't comprehend the things that go on in the shadows. People hear "human trafficking" or "satanic ritual abuse" and immediately dismiss it. I lost it that at the first sentence where you had to kill your cat, I love my cat more than anything, can't comprehend that at all. And the rest of it holy shit that is sick, horrible you or anyone else would ever have to endure that. You mentioned the Lord's Prayer replaced with Satan's name, I'm wondering if Melania reciting that the other day was to send them a message, sure hope so. Praying this evil gets exposed soon, the world needs a lot of healing.

            careful clicking these links people... remember.. an amazing way to take out researchers is to distribute something vulgar and CP with enough details to generate interest, make it go viral, log everyone who visits and looks a this stuff and then go arrest them on CP charges. Its not impossible. Be aware. Be secure.

            It's always been odd to me that people investigating this mostly disregard the satanic element and it's implications. These people have resigned themselves to their infernal king to carry out his bidding against a holy, righteous and loving God. They mock God by committing the most foul and deprived sins imaginable. But what I find so odd is that people mostly overlook just how dedicated they are to Satan and don't ever consider that if Satan could be real to these people enough that they'd carry out these crimes, couldn't that mean God is real? I wish more people would come to this realization. We need God.

               He is. There's an entire spiritual plane that exists around us only we're unable to perceive it. We shouldn't think that because it's invisible it poses any less of a threat. If demonic, supernatural forces weren't a threat, why in Ephesians does Paul remind us to wear our spiritual armor? Or why would he tell us this...

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               We're very likely dealing with something far more evil than what most people here think. Satan and his gang are not ignorant to their end. They know they're going to spend an eternity in Hell and so for the time being they are going to cause as much destruction to God's creation as they are able. They hate God and they hate man for being created in God's image. What's worse than sexually assaulting children and murdering them ritualistically? Literally nothing. It's rather unsettling when you put it all together.

              And it's true. Satan himself is a conspirator. He operates clandestinely, behind the scenes, perpetrating lies and fictions to hide the truth that he's the enemy. If everyone knew Satan was behind everything wrong in the world, they'd (hopefully) run to God. It's safe to assume Satan knows exactly what he's doing. He's watched the history of humanity unfold in real time.

            The guy who runs the story collection site is "Rey del Sexo" and he has connections to VA. He was asking for money to be sent to a PO box there (
            <a href="https://archive.is/FHzGG">
             link
            </a>
            ) When I looked up "alexandria va 22313-0583" which is where the PO box is, the name Ivan Keith came up. Donno if he has anything to do with Pizzagate at all, but it might be something to look into further.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something really weird though is the board connected to the sex story collection, the Kristen Archives (
            <a href="http://www.asstr.org/">
             http://www.asstr.org/
            </a>
            ~Kristen/) There's nothing CP related there, at least none that I saw, but I found Kristens Board at the bottom via a
            <a href="https://archive.is/7aGrp">
             link
            </a>
            titled Ask the Archivist. The phrase "child board" is used twice, and when I went to the Sex Stories By Members section, it was full of stuff about 'teens' and 'camp' and 'young girl'. In case you may be wondering how young this girl is, the word 'pedo' was used as a tag... In another forum section titled Room 1408 there is a warning "Beware of Fake News"

              That area is a hole. In recent years they have tried to gentrify it by turning the buildings into condos.

             <p>
              Looked up the phone number and it's a landline. Like who the fuck has a landline, except some workplaces?
              <s>
               It appears to be located a block west of Jane subway station, which isn't too far from the address you provided above. It's common for people in Toronto to not work close to their home... so I think we know where this person lives and works.
              </s>
              Shit. Nevermind. Just tried another phone number and it appears that is the default location. Weird, because usually websites pick City Hall for that.

            The real reason is the pursuit of immortality, a grotesque parody of the Christian concept of eternal life. As well as the enormous global racket of organ harvesting to supply fresh organs for the elites, there's the occult beliefs of energy robbing your murder victims.

            I think it's very important that threads like these are created to show the public how these pedophile rings have been able to survive for so long going undetected and uninvestigated for so long.

            Not only has the cult infiltrated every aspect of law and order through it's secret societies it uses the SPECTOR of SATANISM as a tool to keep people SILENT. Not only are adult and child inductees meant to perform a sacrifice among other members as a fear tactic it is also to have some 'dirt' on the fellow inductee, thus this tactic proves the transparency of Satanism, it is merely a ghost used to frighten children and adults into complicity and silence. The act of course brings up connotations of the absolute most evil, but in the capacity that most 'believers' of christianity create this imaginary land of red chested demons with pitchforks and spectral emanations, IS ALL STAGE FOR A DESIRED EFFECT.

            These psychological issues must be examined carefully and in depth to shatter the illusions these 'controllers' have attempted to place in front of our eyes.

             Apparently James Alefantis bought the Comet sign from Comet Liquors nearby in DC. I would be willing to bet he added those four corner satan symbols.
edit- I read it in an interview with Alefantis I believe, I don't recall off-hand but it stood out to me at the time.

              Because of this I actually suspected the liquor shop owner.  I went back and looked at what I could.  Family belonged to an importtant local jewish temple.   There had been some nefarious activities within a "temple network" elsewhere, but I didn't see any scandals directly related to their temple.  I decided to let it go.  The liquor store was from another period.  Apparently another "beloved neighborhood institution".  It gave locals a place to casually hang out, after they added food service and some tables.

              I still feel the name is too coincidental to just be a lucky accident then fit into all these perversions.  Ping pong balls cut in half and covering the eyes, with strobe like lights hitting them were used in early MK Ultra experiments.  There is the sexual ping pong, and "comet" has a meaning for swingers.  IDK.

              Agreed.  That's the worst part of it.  Like every time a spouse is murdered they look at the other spouse, every time a child is murdered or missing the parent's involvement must be a main focus even though that has backfired in the past.

                I'm remembering fairy tales like Rumplestilskin and legends of the devil granting your request always requiring your first born child and I'm starting to wonder if that still goes on.   Only the government can give someone the power, money and prestige for which someone may be willing to sell their first born child, thus explaining PizzaGate and the movement to discredit it.  Spooky, isn't it.

             I did a thread last week that talked about people who adopt overseas and then give away their adopted kid to virtual strangers when they realize it's too much. It's a huge market online with little attention given it by law enforcement.

              Thanks for the information.  I was initially going to cry out "why don't the adoption agencies or child protection services follow up!" but then I realized that CPS has problems and an adoption agency in Cleveland was just shut down with records confiscated by the FBI, so I answered my own questions.  Turns out our government has been very complicit in this and the whole "government knows best and will take care of everything" attitude shared by most Americans is a façade.  I think we all have to rethink things because we have a lot to learn.

            Painful but necessary to read as this helps people to get their heads around ritual abuse and programming very young children. Wish it wasn't so but if researchers avoid looking into this they miss a huge part of the equation. Not always but often the abusing of small children is the systematic torture programming that is involved. Granted hard to read, very upsetting for those unaware

            Oprah Winfrey in 1989 had a woman on her show who was a survivor of a childhood abuse. She told the story how she was abused at age 5 Too graphic! It was then I realized that the world we lived in was rotten.

              Not sure about that. Perhaps down the line.
 Sexual gratification. I can only pray she has not yet reached ' the age of attraction' (pedos sometimes have different attraction ages) and he will relinquish her before this. But I doubt it.

              fyi: your theory would make sense if he is involved in Satanic Ritual Abuse. Children are often used as energy vortexes to derive immense power for a true occultist via sexual abuse and other methods. (Sex Magick). Also as conduits for invocations of demonic entities.

                I am well aware of these. And of course anything is possible, esp when it comes to elites. I just think this particular case is run of the mill pedophilia. I just don't think he would take a 'beloved' child from birth and use her for these reasons such as organ harvesting or vampiric youth promoting . Would more likely be a complete stranger child that he has zero emotional investment in. But for grooming purposes such emotional investment is highly beneficial.

                 I have other theories on it - he thinks of her as someone whose tissues will ultimately provide him with life and become a part of him.  She is valuable because she is under his control, healthy, and purposely engineered to work with his blood type and genetics - he may have even been the sperm donar.  I think he's a top homo who likes ephebes but ultimately like to dominate men, a la I know luv video where Majestic Ape trolls for pedos, then rapes one with a vacuum after partying.  That doesn't mean he wouldn't play ping pong ugh can't believe I had to write that.   But she is being kept in good shape or his other purposes - narcissist NEEDS to stay young looking, feeling and acting.

                 But ultimately, we are like people blindfolded trying to make our way through dark woods - we are never going to think like these people!   it could be either of our theories or both.  I wonder if we'll ever really know.

                  Perhaps you base that assumption on thinking he could not fancy females sexually. I think that assumption is wrong. I've discussed this here before and don't feel like going through it again in detail.

                   You seem really committed to your point of view.  I feel like it is fruitless ultimately for any of us to think we "know" exactly what or how JA actually thinks.  He could be a puppet himself, split and handled at least to some degree.

                    Not committed. Anything is possible but I base much of what I say on my own personal life's experience; experience around LBGT. BDSM, Occult and other underground communities. You get a unique perspective to how many people think and operate. But I may also be projecting. As I personally knew someone very much like him. And I was only 16 and learned a lot about life the hard way. This BF (not really , more like lover/abuser, i was a sex toy) was an outwardly 'gay' man that was actually a pan sexual, bisexual narcissist that corrupted every soul in his path. He ended up a Mambla member and now dating those much younger than I was at the time. He was sadistic and cruel but very charming and magnetic. He also loved to rub every awful thing he did in peoples faces with teasers and sexual innuendos. He was also a member of a Secret Society.

                   <p>
                    You and I are on the same page that regardless of what he is using Caris for, we seem to agree he does in fact have her. To me this is almost blatantly obvious.

                    Do not think JA is small fish or puppet at all. I believe in fact he could very well be a CIA operative or other alphabet agency person. This is why he acts so cocky and smug.

                     great discussion.  I have had some exposure to Cherokee nightspots and the like.

                     When I say he may be a puppet I don't mean he isn't high up.  I have said long ago he is CIA asset if not operative.  Doesn't mean he can't be controlled, abused himself since boyhood, maybe like Anderson Cooper.  He  seems to handle Amanda Kleinman in my opinion.  I'm just saying I guess that I wouldn't be surprised with his grandparents background in that Greek Freemasonry society that he may not have been programmed in certain ways to be placed in higher positions.  I think he is the "artist" producer behind all the Heavy Breathing stuff, the pizza joint was just a headquarters although I'm sure pizza parties have taken place there, and that computer hard drive at CPP has a lot of ghosts and strange occurances.  He's definitely one of the highest PUBLIC fish, and scrambled a bit in the brain, narcissistic and sloppy about his "culture".

                      Ya, I see your point about his parents etc. His father is said to be involved with CIA was he not?. Could never get that story straight. Yes. Perhaps he is also being protected by Secret Societies. The Greek Freemasonry link is very interesting but is there actually proof he was also initiated and not just his mother? Also his donating to that Waldorf Theological school is a bit bizarre. Is Amanda Kleinman the woman behind Heavy Breathing&gt; What the fuck do you think is up with that? Someone wrote me here that that was a CIA pet. Whatever that means. What do you mean he is the producer behind Heavy breathing, I mean  for what purpose?

                        Your discussions and theories on Majestic Ape is fascinating. I cannot however bring myself to watch any other their videos/.Something very repugnant about them and not in the obvious way always stops me from doing so. I have only watched them partially.
                        <br/>
                        So yes, your theory of MK Ultra is very reasonable. As for JA playing the Majestic Ape part part time. I can see this too.   In fact, it is very likely. You know he has also taken to producing a couple of short films that are occultic as well. And a full length one coming up soon that is also seems very MK Ultra related.

            There's some pretty weird stuff if you put "loli" or "loli hentai" into these porn search engines, way too much internet for me today. Yesterday I read about deep web "red rooms" which is basically real life Saw and Hostel posted on the deep web, paying users can even interact with choosing how to torture and kill the victims. Anyways appreciate it, this stuff's so sick, been following pizzagate since it broke and it feels like it's closer than ever to getting the lid blown off, I sure hope so at least, the world's got a lot of healing to do.

            Sickening details, yet useful to know - they do use CONTRASTS to reinforce their programming. They use subtle NLP in their everyday language to practice their hand at manipulating ordinary people then switch to using extreme contrasts when they are dealing with children to more easily shatter their psych - creating compartments they can hook and program because they think they will get away with it.

            I'll give an up vote, but I cannot even contemplate reading or watching any of this. The video of the child screaming in the 'shower' on worldcorp was too much for me. I reported it to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children here in UK.  The police replied to my email so I hope they are following through and can get this sicko and his 'feinds'.

             that is great so glad you reported it in the UK.  I also can't read it.  I have seen enough sickness at this point and I rely on the reports of others.  I appreciate that others can go there, because it is important to get a total understanding of the demented pervs.

            This is what the ones who can only fantasize (maybe) write about.  Imagine what those with money can do.  It isn't writing filth like the one "story" I read.  I'm very far from being a prude, but that is some horrifying stuff.  Unfortunately, that type of trailer park activity (incest) is probably pretty common.
           </p>

            Edit 1: I read the story "Boys and Girls" I think about a young man, raping his 18 year old sister from the time she was 6 and then the 3 yo daughter of his sister, whom he fathered, when she was 3.  And more or less tact approval and even encouragement from the parents.

             How can you sit here and say that we should torture them? Thats called being a hypocrite and its not going to solve anything. I think capital punishment is hypocrisy as well, but if there is video evidence of these people partaking in these acts, I won't stop them from being publicly hanged.

             There is not just an after life. There is something called purgatory and limbo .Applies whether you're Western religion or Eastern. No matter, you will reap what you sow. Often in the form of getting to hear and feel pain you've inflicted in what will seem like infinity.

              There is no limbo. There is no purgatory. These are lies. We live in a world where the wicked prosper and the righteous are downtrodden; a world that is not fair. There is no adequate punishment of an earthly nature fit for the people guilty of abusing children. Life itself is our purgatory, if you will. It is in this realm that we our responsible for our actions and thoughts. We were allocated plenty of time here to figure things out. To find the truth. We are not provided a second chance. There is a location in the afterlife designated for those who rejected truth, virtue, righteousness and decency just as there is a destination for those who embraced them. A perfect God cannot allow evil to go unpunished. He will deal with these satanic pedophiles accordingly for He is perfect and only a perfect being can serve the perfect sentence.

                  God will deal with them accordingly. Whether we expose them or not,
                  <em>
                   nothing
                  </em>
                  can hide from God. Ultimately they will receive a just sentence for their crimes. These people have committed a sin that renders them unsavable. They have blasphemed the Holy Spirit.

             No way...  no way anyone should be forced to do that to another human being and the people who could do it, are fellow sadists and should not be in society.  This is evil and I refuse to become one of them regardless of my basic instinct to chop their fucking heads off.

              There are drugs that cause hallucinations that would be worth administrating with some visuals that come from their own rituals to cause a bad trip. No one but those injected suffer. I also do not trust or buy into the Justice served after life crap. Sounds like something the rich feed to the poor to allow them to remain immobile in the face of evil doing.

              And that is precisely why this shit will keep happening. If the only thing these pedofucks have to fear is a life of paid shelter, and food, and a painless lethal injection, it will keep happening.

             I've only read 2 or 3 of those nepi stories over the last few months and they're tough to get through, this story isn't nearly as bad as the ones in that section unfortunately. I was about to vomit the night of the election when Podesta was out there talking on the podium, that was a big red pill, couldn't believe that this WAS reality, everything started to make sense. Kid fuckers are everywhere.

            Strict  heterosexual here. A young man fell in love with me.  Never a mesh of the flesh, but, an  intimacy developed between us. He told me of things that happened to him when he was 12 to 13 years old.   His mother rented  a room to an older man. He stated that he enjoyed it and felt the man was an excellent role model for his absent father.   I told him he had been raped and probably  had his psyche damaged.  He only smiled.I've seen that same same sick smile on Milos face.

             You don't have to be raped to be gay, nor do you have to be a pedophile. That being said, the rapists and pedophiles in this country need to be purged, and we should hang as many of them as we can before their friends at the DOJ give them penthouse treatment in the prison system.

             Yeah. This whole Milo shit is so aggravating. Milo was a twink. Used sexually before he was able to consent. I have known so many gay men with the same history and the same attitude. Because they enjoyed a part of the abuse they often go on to perpetuate or (at least) accept it as normal. I know that he's a victim, and I think it's ironic that he's been chosen as some sort of spokesperson for the "conservatives"; when they are actually as rife with this sickness as the "liberals".

             Yeah it's a crazy scenario we're dealing with, generations and generations of pedophilia. I can't relate since I've had a fairly normal life, never knew this subculture was everywhere. Actually realized a few of my facebook friends who are most likely pedophiles after this stuff all coming to light. Maybe their brain tells them they liked it because it's a way to psychologically deal with being molested. Seems like everyday we get closer and closer to all the beans being spilled, heard human trafficking mentioned on the local news yesterday for the first time ever. The thought of a 13 year old or younger and an adult is just so sick to me I have a hard time thinking about it.

            I couldn't read this. But I will tell you what I came across before that was posted on voat or reddit at some point. The ping pong reference is when the child is leaned over getting it in the butt and mouth at the same time. Back and forth like ping pong. 🙁

            For those of you who think these stories are exaggerated, trust me when I tell you they're not as bad as the real thing. From The Illuminati Formula To Create a Mind Slave:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The fourth stage is built upon the foundation of dissociation created in the first &amp; second stages, and the love created in the third stage. (The demonology of the first step also helps pull in demons associated with programming, tunneling in the mind, and multiplicity, which are used in the fourth foundational step.) Often in the fourth step, the child’s mind will fracture along the same dissociation fracture lines that the trauma of the premature birth created. If the child is not a premature baby, it will need some additional help to want to dissociate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The child can have its senses overwhelmed repeatedly to the point that it learns to react to its surroundings by what appears on the outside as a numbness, and mentally is simply dissociation.  Everything imaginable can be used to overwhelm the caged little child’s senses and create dissociation. Rotten faul odors of the child’s excrement, of amnonia, and rotten food while it huddles in its cage will overwhelm the child’s sense of smell. Being fed blood overwhelms the sense of taste. The chanting of the Programmers dressed in Satanic garb, banging noises, rock music and the electric hum, and ultrasonic stimulation overwhelms the child’s sense of hearing. The child’s natural developing sense of shapes is taken advantage of by spinning the child and making it feel like it is going to fall. The child will also be deprived of sleep and drugged. Together all this will provide the dissociative base for splitting the core.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fourth stage is to strip the child of everything nice and lovely in the world. The child is caged and tormented by electric shock. The child’s senses will be overloaded and they will become numb. Eyewitnesses have described these hundreds of numbed children as "zombies". This stage and the programming put in after the foundational dissociation is created will form the next chapter. In the fourth step, the child is starved, cold and naked. When they finally see their beloved master or beloved adult caretaker appear after suffering from 42 to 72 hours, they are excited and they dissociate the pain of the previous hours of deprivation. Help appears to be on the scene. At that point the programmer/beloved adult shows his/her most vicious side, and the child in order to deal with how this loving caretaker has not only rejected them but is now hurting them dissociates along the same fractures of dissociation created by the trauma of the premature birth. The details of how the mind is split will be dealt with further in the next chapter.
           </p>
           <p>
            In review of steps 3 and 4, part of the programming is to have the primary initial abuser bond with the child. A close loving bond is needed between a child and the initial abuser so that a clean split is created when the initial mind-splitting trauma is carried out. The clean split occurs when the child is confronted with two irreconcilable opposing viewpoints of someone who is important to them. The child can’t reconcile the two extremely opposite views of the same person, one being a loving caretaker, and the other being the worst kind of abuser. The person the child trusted the most is the person the child fears the most.  Some professional therapists have come to realize that this is how the core is split. Jody Lienhart, a multiple herself, in her Ph.d dissertation correctly identifies the double bind of having two extremely opposite views of the most important person in the child’s life as the fundamental splitting mechanism."

             I think the worldcorpo videos are showing the tamest parts of this mind control in progress. A glimpse into someones real ritual mind control abuse.

             We can see a child being confined to a closed space, which can facilitate hot/cold shock with water from the shower, they are in the dark with flashing lights to disorient. We also see another child covered in what looks like blood and feces.
            </p>
            <p>
             They also say that these intense programming sessions (ie where a child is murdered in front of the main victim) take place at medical facilities and then the child goes home to continue a "lesser" regiment of abuse in order to keep them in disassociative states and I think thats what you are seeing in fatherhood.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing that randomly popped up in my head was Britney Spears weird live freak out and they say that when an alter is being pushed too far in therapy that other alters can be triggered to take over and I think that's what you are seeing here -

              I have absolutely no doubt that it was part of a ritual. I've seen that Britney video and a number of other ones where celebs either talk about their alters or switch alters.

             Can someone explain the logic behind this from the sick fuck's point of view?
            </p>
            <p>
             What does a split personality do that is advantageous to the sick fuck? Do the kid's lose memory? Do the kids do things on command and not remember they did them? What is the split? You are two totally different people in the same brain? It's all too sick for me to contemplate and there's no way I'm reading that sick shit.

             Speaking of mind control.  MK-ULTRA Delta programming allegedly creates soldiers or sleepers.  I'm open to this being a coincidence - Delta is the symbol of change for example - but why is the highest level commando team in the US always referred to as "Delta Force"?

             While I was kidnapped, many of the things mentioned in here were going to happen to me. I was told many of these things by my abductor, and I have a strong feeling he was also a victim of Satanic Ritualist Abuse.

             This is the kind of info I have been looking for.

               Thank you so much for providing me with this. I was able to read and learn more about the specific markings placed on mind-controlled slaves and peice together some interesting correlations regarding the man I was drugged and given to who I was forced to travel with during my transport.

               ) (from the book you provided me with) that they are given blue tattoos. The one that caught my attention was the bluebird tattoo that this man has on his right temple. He was deliberately hiding it behind his hair in the mug shot, but he emphasized the importance of blue tattoos and that those were the only colored tattoos he would get.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
               I dug a little bit into Project Bluebird and discovered it was some kind of personality splitting disorder (Disassociate Identity Disorder) that was deliberately executed on test subjects to use as their mind controlled slaves.
              </p>
              <p>
               The man I was forced to travel with (Adam Brett Hancock) had this disorder and would constantly switch between very bizarre personas.
              </p>
              <p>
               This helped me out significantly in connecting these dots that I had a hunch about. I can't thank you enough as I proceed to dive deeper into this research.

             Reminds me of the Judge Rotenberg Center, a "special needs school" for some of the most mentally and physically handicapped people. They actually use everything you described to "rehabilitate" the students, ammonia, rotten food, long-term restraint, and even electric shock. Some of the students are literally forced to wear a backpack 24/7 containing a battery where instructors can issue a painful electric shock whenever a "rule" is broken. The rules can be anything from muttering to raising your hand, sometimes these students are shocked dozens of times a day. If they're bad enough they're strapped spread eagle to a board like in this video
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAj9W0ntUMI">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAj9W0ntUMI
             </a>
             and shocked repeatedly over the course of hours.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now these are autistic people being tortured costing taxpayers $220,000 a year per student. There's basically one judge who sends the children to this school and the school run by Matthew Israel gives him money in return. This continues to go on today right in Massachusetts. I think they're not allowed to put any new students on the GED devices but there are still people who have been attached to this electrocution backpack for decades at that school. I guess this kind of stuff happens everywhere at these kinds of disability schools and "boot camps" unfortunately. No idea how we got to this point as a society, hope it turns around soon.

             Its almost impossible to trust a ritual abuse survivor after they go through that since you dont know if they really want to help other survivors or are just programmed to carry on doing what they have been doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is this survivor really cured?...

               If they have multiple personality disorders how do you know that they wont "relapse" and these other personalities come back or how do you know you are talking to the genuine person?  And she found help in religion...same with Becky Percy.  Religion is just another mind trap.

                Nothing is certain in life. But to confess about it at all means they have overcome a core personality that has kept them from snitching in the first place. Herculean task, I know from experience.

                Don't understand personally how anyone can be religious after experiencing the Devil. God has forsaken thee.

                 How did you do it and did a another survivor help you?  Is there really any treatments for this sort of thing?  Because this is something these people would not want out in the open that its happening and would rather give the label that they made it all up and pump them full of drugs.

                  Still have not actually done it. I am outing this person this week with the help of a well known youtuber and something may happen that i my change my mind. A severe panic attack, another hostile facet threatening me into not telling, etc. Does not help that society labels those that reveal truths as liars in many cases. There is an excellent thread here about False Memory people being pedos themselves, this is true. (in 80's-90's.) They do much to protect themselves. Sometimes assassinating the person in question but that is rarely necessary.  They are highly adept at MK Ultra or similar.  It takes a very strong personality to overcome conditioning.  In my case it was brutal threats that have lasted a life time because they were coupled with horrific acts of animal abuse. So that that fear comes back every time I attempt to break free. Shrinks are useless for the most part as they are rarely trained in this area/ Most victims end up in mental institutions  (pumped up with drugs), or commit suicide or are homeless or prostitutes. This is why you don't hear much from them. Also their are some programming that creates self harm. Self mutilation and even suicide.

                   Personally I think you should out everyone that did this to you and name names and locations and spread it as far and wide as possible complete with links to thier pictures and facebook accounts if they got them.  And by naming names give specific names and addresses.  These people fear the light and shining a light on them exposes them and that should at least stop them in their tracks from what they are doing.

              Splitting someones personality. A few of my guesses would be as such.. Control: the primary one gets out of hand, you "trigger" the other, which is less aware of the issues being had and is submissive (or whatever the setup is), then do maintenance. Power: John Podesta and Skippy, cool-headed, organized and friendly person, trained to self-trigger a cold awful satanic one.

            I remember when I was 13 In my room assembling a warship when I overheard a conversation between my Grandmother and her best friend. It was a heated, frantic exchange. It was about a neighbour of my grandma's friend, who was caught by his wife giving a 5 month toddler a pacifier - of the other kind! I still remember the bewilderment I felt - it was so far removed from my reality of my secret stash of Playboy mags and playmates of the month that I dismissed it as someone being stark mad and in my mind that sicko was placed in a padded room - my narrative was a defensive mechanism. I am 43 now, and after delving into pizzagate I realized that these sickos come by the dozens and they are not locked up in padded rooms, they are RUNNING OUR COUNTRY!

            How the hell can someone do this? My stomach turns when I see animal cruelty videos. And I have a very dark/twisted sense of humor... how is this kind of behavior even possible? Especially considering how many people are involved??? WTAF.

            Can we employ some Anons/Autists on hacking these sick fucks? Get their account credentials and start linking names with PG persons of interest? This is not okay.

            The way they sexualize a child's actions as if the child is thinking erotic thoughts. I couldn't go past it. The idea that a kid is acting in a sexual manner at that age is so repulsive I can't even get to the rest of it.

            I found from one of the perverts talking about it from a tribes post found on here a few weeks ago, said they love the nepi fiction stories on there and its what gets them off. The same person was talking about dedicating their life to making "ping pong" possible which is basically rape from both ends while the rapists make out. Ill see if i can dig up that thread if you really want. They talk about kidnapping women, raping them to get pregnant, then raping and killing the baby when its born before stuffing it back inside the woman. Im just the messenger letting you all know how these "pizza enthusiast" sadists really think. I can dig up the tribes thread posted here when i get home if youd like.

             That makes a lot of sense about "ping pong", actually.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, that whole exchange in the beginning of the story is worth a read to any investigator. Just imagine this conversation with a few code words stuck in:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              About a year after our encounter with Alex I gave Ryan a call.
"Say I've just got a new kid to break in. Do you want to give me
a hand?"
             </p>
             <p>
              "Does it rain in County Kerry, " he replied with his lovely
brogue. "Who's the lucky lad?"
             </p>
             <p>
              "His name is Kyle. He's six and three quarters. And, " I paused
for dramatic effect. "He's a total virgin."
             </p>
             <p>
              Ryan muttered something Gaelic. "You mean–"
             </p>
             <p>
              "That's right. No one has ever touched him. So I think we'll need
to start him out a bit differently. . ."

            I tried to read that but couldn't. Clearly it's a mix of sick fantasies and probably real events. Can someone explain what was the ping pong part in that story?

             Ping pong is on urban dictionary. It means a gay threesome.  Anal and oral on one person in the middle at the same time.

             I refuse to read it. It is preposterously bad. Not even well-written, even for fantasy.
Got five minutes into this, with the crucifix BS and the huge 6 yr. old lying on it,
and that was it. Ridiculous.

              Bad but 100% true. ... and worse if you can even imagine it.   We may say,  "That can't be true.  I'd never in a billion years do anything like that." Yes,  but they aren't us.

            Some very important points here. And that makes sense that torture would be used so that abused children would learn to tolerate sexual abuse, even though it also seems like many if not most child abusers also just enjoy inflicting pain on children.

             It's pretty different from Kutcher's description of the sexualized three year old, guess he fails to explain just how a three year old gets sexualized, probably something like this.
