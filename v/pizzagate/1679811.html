<p>Max Spiers was a well known &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; who died this past summer, mere weeks before Pizzagate broke. According to his girlfriend, he had been investigating- and getting very deep into- a &quot;secret satanic elite pedo ring&quot; that involved Michael Aquino, Presidio, the US army, etc. </p>
<p>Pretty much everything we have/had been researching on reddit, voat, the chans, and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Anyways, long story short (I could write pages on this, but it\'s late, ugh) sources say that prior to his death he began vomiting a massive amount of &quot;thick, black substance&quot; - it was ruled that he died by &quot;natural causes&quot;, even though he was 39 and in great health, no autopsy was performed. </p>
<p>IMO it sounds like what happens when one has a stomach perforation (bleeding ulcer) - the black vomit is due to a large amount of blood in the stomach contents. Alcohol can cause this, NSAIDS can cause this, and I am sure a multitude of other toxic chemicals can cause this as well. </p>
<p>But why no autopsy, especially given his age, good health, and the foreboding text he sent his mom only days prior?  Allegedly, death threats toward Spiers and his girlfriend were commonplace. Does this not warrant an autopsy/investigation?</p>
<p>No autopsy was performed. </p>
<h2>Days before his death, he texted his mom saying, &quot;Your boy\'s in trouble. If anything happens to me, investigate.&quot;</h2>
<p>More than a half a year later, his case is being reopened. Authorities now suspect that he was murdered. </p>
<p>I will be looking into this, but if anyone has any other info/links that are relevant to this, please share them here and I will update/edit this post to include them.</p>
<p>If you notice, pretty much every news source includes the words &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, &quot;ufologist&quot;, &quot;aliens&quot;, etc in the title or articles. I personally feel that this is just an attempt to discredit him.  We know how every news site that covered PG reported it inaccurately, skewed facts, twisted info, etc. I am 99.9% sure that everything that he was looking into before his death is very directly related to what we have been looking into since PG broke. </p>
<p>He was also scheduled to give a talk for Project Camelot on elitist pedo rings right before he died. </p>
<p>Imagine that.</p>

            Wow! So it seems the woman who was supposed to be the"secret lover" according to other mainstream media articles, was actually part of a Satanic group that was holding Max Spiers and not letting him go! This story is getting more and more crazy and obvious that there is Satanism involved. An ulcer does not cause someone to vomit liters of black fluid! His poor mother...

             Yes, that is how this seems, but this is such a complicated...incident though. Remember, much of what you read/hear in the news is twisted to fit a certain narrative. I think there is a lot more to this story than meets the eye. I'm not for certain at all, but I feel like there is something going on with his ex/gf/whatever title it is that she has- Sarah Adams. I dk why, and I could be COMPLETELY wrong. Something is off about this story though for sure, just can't figure out what.
