<p>&quot;Aside from what I could refer to as “normal” sexual acts, between two consenting adults, CK had myself and other children preform strange and unusual acts. Whether it was “stretching exercises” in where he would take turns pulling out our genitals as far as they could reach, standing in line swinging our genitals as he masturbated, increasing our tolerance for testicular torture, playing video games as I performed oral sex on this man, and forcing me to preform cunnalingus on a young girl as she attempted to scream for help. Her screams were met by CKs hands, dragging her by her hair and down an entire flight of steps, as she attempted to escape. He was clearly dangerous and capable of severe physical harm. CK would always tell us if we told an adult, he would kill us. I believed him.&quot;</p>
<p>​&quot;I specifically remember one-time CK sat us down in front of a drawing he sketched of a underground dungeon, with many different rooms and compartments all designed for his sexual fantasies. We were told we\'d start construction in the following days; forced labor. Alike slaves, we were forced to dig at his parents’ property in Mt. Kisco, which was a conservation sanctuary, called Marsh Sanctuary (the family has since left this property).  Needless to say, a small group of children with shovels were not able to complete his sexual dungeon and we were sexually assaulted again for our poor efforts.&quot;</p>
<p>I contacted CK’s father, also on a recorded line.  He admitted to knowing about what CK had done to me ,“…you are not telling me anything I didn’t already know about,” said his father.</p>
<p>The victim said groups of children were tortured and raped by a high profile Hollywood composer named Christian Kriegeskotte. This is the guy </p>

<p>He had plans to make a torture dungeon, and for years would rape and torture the kids. One of the victims got a hold of the pedophiles father, who said &quot;&quot;tell me something I didn\'t already know about&quot; The parents ran a conservation sanctuary called Marsh Sanctuary, where he said is a location where often many children would be raped and filmed at. That place is still open in Mount Kisco, New York. There\'s 188 likes on it\'s Facebook page </p>

<p>&quot;The Marsh Sanctuary is a 156-acre nature preserve, open to the public daily from dawn to dusk. Several hiking trails are maintained on the property and connect to trails in Leonard Park and other local preserves.&quot;</p>
<p>If what the victim is telling us is true, Marsh Sanctuary was run by the pedophiles parents and used as a location to rape many children. I think this &quot;Conservation Sanctuary&quot; is a child porn production center.</p>',
