<p>An Indonesian woman claims that she had her kidney “stolen” while working as maid in Qatar.
Sri Rabitah, who travelled to the country for as a guest worker in 2014, says that she was operated on at what was supposed to be a routine medical check-up in a hospital.
Sri says she was placed under anaesthetic without explanation, and discovered stitches on her stomach after she woke up.
Sri also alleges that she was abused by her employer during her time working in the country.
She is now calling on the Indonesian government to take legal action against the alleged organ traffickers. “I want the government to sue the perpetrator. My kidney was stolen”.
This incident comes in the wake of the arrest of two Saudi men in Egypt in late last year, after authorities allegedly discovered that they had solicited organs from organ traffickers.</p>

According to Irwan, Polda NTB will request the Criminal Investigation and Interpol help to find the last time the hospital treated Rabitah time to become migrant workers in Qatar.
&quot;Suppose if the right kidney is lost, we will coordinate to the Criminal Investigation and Interpol, to seek a hospital last Rabitah treated in Qatar. So it can be transferred to the kidneys where, &quot;he said.
Until now, the case is still a mystery. Re-examination would be an appropriate solution related to the kidney that existed at the Rabita body. This case has also become the talk of many people, in cases of abuse of migrant workers abroad. (Zr)</p>

            Here are links to an interview of Dr. Paul Byrne and his website where he states that a person must be alive when organs are harvested in order for them to be viable and that definitions of brain dead were manipulated in order to facilitate harvesting. If this is true and protocols as described by him aren't followed in harvesting, the only thing that makes sense to me is that those organs are eaten.

           </p>

            Just another examples of breaking the law. Also remember from earlier: Hillary KNEW that Qatar funds ISIS.  Why is the country funding ISIS giving money to Bill and paying for Hillary’s campaign. What are they getting in return?

            In accordance with the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, you may not accept anything of value from a foreign government, unless specifically authorized by Congress. This rule applies whether you are on or off duty. Any unit of a foreign government, whether it is national, state, local, or municipal level, is covered. It also applies to gifts from international or multinational organizations comprised of government representatives. It also may apply to gifts of honoraria, travel, or per diem from foreign universities, which are often considered as part of the foreign government. Spouses and dependent children of Federal employees are also banned from accepting gifts from foreign governments.

            It seems to be standard practice for countries receiving USAID to give "donations" to Clinton Foundation, (such as Morocco) so I guess it could be for any number of things, kickbacks or shakedowns, payments for other services or arms (weapons),  organs, children, spirit cooking, the possibilities are numerous. (But I think it is unlikely that Bill Clinton got that woman's kidney for his birthday, as he still looks sickly)
