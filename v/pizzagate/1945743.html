<p>Here is a video I came across a while back: www.zapiks.fr/bkn-is-back-.html</p>
<p>If you watch the first scene there is a little boy to the left. The snowboarder acts all weird jerking around. This video has really bothered me for some time now. I noticed some of the writing on it such as.....walking, months, run stairs, speech etc </p>
<p>Also noticed the end of a web address (the first part is cut off)  ojectmd.com 
When I searched this I found <a href="http://www.parentprojectmd.org/">http://www.parentprojectmd.org/</a>
I could then make out the dystrophy in the video. </p>
<p>So that brings us back to the snowboarder and his actions. What exactly is he conveying with his jerking movements?  More importantly, why exactly is that a part of a snowboarding video.</p>
<p>I found this site by following a lead from the farm that Podesta worked at. The guy is possibly a Rothschild and worked for the world bank, was then developing an app for restaurants in the DC area. He had mentioned a video found on this site I mentioned above.</p>',
