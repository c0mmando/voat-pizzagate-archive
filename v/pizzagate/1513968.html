<p>I should perhaps start by saying I\'m a longtime fan of Andrew Vachss, and have read all the Burke series, and highly recommended his novels to anyone who is putting time in to investigating the pedocracy. </p>
<p>It seems to me that many of the people who have commented about this clip are making flawed assumptions:
1. That the kid\'s voice heard in the clip is coming from inside CPP. 
2. That the two adults seen with the kid in the dress just happened to be passing by.
3. That the kid in the dress was a girl, and the adults were her parents. I recall my annoyance at occasionally being asked if I was a boy or a girl at that age. Sticking a dress on a little boy would work for a temporary disguise if he was being actively searched for.</p>
<p>Frank Winstead presumably was on stakeout for a good deal longer than two minutes, yet the only footage he uploads to YouTube is less than two minutes long, why? If one assumes that the kid\'s voice heard is coming from inside the place, it seems an unlikely coincidence that the shouting would coincide with the \'family\' walking in front.</p>
<p>How does this scenario sound:</p>
<p>A couple kidnapped a young boy named Ian. They don\'t have him long, and need to turn him over to higher ups in the cabal for conditioning or whatever else, so they take him down to CPP. On the way there there they make Ian put on a little girl\'s dress, and warn him to act accordingly. Perhaps they scared him with details of what will be done to him once they hand him over to where they are going, and as they approach, Ian begins to yell from being terrified. When they do arrive, however, a man playing ping pong with another man outside turns to them and says not to go in, because there is someone in a car across the street filming, trying to gather evidence of illegal activity. Ian hears this and sees a chance of being rescued. As the couple continue on past the door Ian tries to turn and wave to the person doing the surveillance, but only has a moment and is unable to spot the camera. Still he yells out &quot;Hey!&quot; (Which, being turned towards the camera and microphone, gets picked up very clearly on the audio track, proving that the voice does not come from inside CPP) and a moment later &quot;I\'m Ian!&quot;. But the other adult has a firm grip on his wrist, and he is dragged away, unable to offer any kind of a struggle.</p>
<p>This is what I hear, from the point where the kid tried to stop and wave to attract attention:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey&quot;
&quot;Wait&quot;
&quot;Hey&quot;
&quot;Save Me&quot;
&quot;I\'m Ian&quot;
&quot;Help Me&quot;</p>
<p>I\'m not sure why I always hear &quot;I\'m Ian&quot; when no one else has said they heard the same thing- maybe because the first listen was with $300 Sennheiser headphones. I have posted what I heard on YouTube comments as well as on Reddit, and of course other commentators say they hear all kinds of things. Pointless to argue about it, but for the purposes of this investigation I would ask that you assume the kid\'s name is Ian for the moment. </p>
<p>Here\'s what I want: can one of you with the appropriate online researching skills check to see if a small boy named Ian went missing from near Washington, D.C. in the weeks or months prior to May 26, 2007, when the original video was uploaded? It may just be possible that the smoking gun needed to provoke an official investigation has been online for almost a decade, but at the very least this scenario should be considered and checked against missing children records.
Thanks in advance.</p>',

            somebodies mis-directing about alleged "train noises" and vents? It sounds like a scream even to me, and my hearing is poor. -  - a list of the strategies / training points, of ringers. -

            interesting theory, except we cant hear the sound of the ping pong ball from across the street... meaning, we can't hear THAT child, either. So no, I don't believe we're hearing that child's voice at all... but it is an interesting theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, i doubt one could hear that kids' voice without using a boom microphone and a sound crew, but hey - what do I know, 20+ years experience placing boom mics for film and television.
           </p>
           <p>
            NOW: Give me a WIRELESS mic setup, let me BURY that mic in a potted plant or something RIGHT IN FRONT OF COMET? Okay, then you'd hear not only the ping pong game happening in real time, you'd begin to hear any conversations of the players and passersby. Guaranteed, though the quality would be pretty crappy due to traffic noise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Give me a parabolic mic and a skilled operator, like the kind they use at football games? I can begin isolate independent conversations, with minimal background noise. However, it would be fairly conspicuous to operate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Audio is no joke, and it's MUCH more difficult to acquire than video... by perhaps an order of magnitude. It's a VERY steep curve, with increasing cost, manpower and sophistication required at each step of the way. And for that reason, I have previously said that we are NOT hearing the child on camera - in fact, if you listen to the original video carefully, with your eyes closed, you can make out 2 DISTINCT CHILDREN - one a female, one a male.
           </p>
           <p>
            Try that on for size, and then try to guess where their voices are coming from. I can't, but I'm also hearing something disguised in the "traffic noise" - so you try listening to the original video with your eyes closed, just listening, and then tell us what you hear... then I'll tell you what I hear in it, because I don't want to prejudice your impressions any more than the clues I've already given.

             What about the ping pong player going "Heyoooo!" Right after the kid was dragged away? Seemed to pick up just fine on whatever equipment Frank Winstead was using.

             this said, i am NOT a skeptic of the video, since it is a "time capsule" of sorts, and would require an almost criminal genius to plant EIGHT YEARS ahead of any public investigation, as some have suggested.
            </p>
            <p>
             SO - because nobody has taken me up on the "listening" challenge, I shall divulge what I heard, listening, eyes closed, on multiple rounds of the above video:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              FIRST a girl screams.
             </li>
             <li>
              Then, "traffic" (which, oddly, does NOT sync up with the traffic shown on the street, indicating that this sound may not be traffic).
             </li>
             <li>
              A short while later, a BOY yells. Different tone, different energy to the voice, more force.
             </li>
             <li>
              The "traffic" noise at this point, when it re-emerges, very much resembles the kind of noise underground trains make as heard through the vents/grates in the street above. Clackity clack and all that, not mere "engine" noises as one gets from above-ground street traffic.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             And then the video ends. Now THAT is truly weird, and if we're HEARING trains, or residual train noise from EXISTING lines, that suggests that there are old vents/lines not accessible to the public, ON THAT STREET, which connect to existing functioning underground lines.
            </p>
            <p>
             That much seems to have been already established, which the actual POSITIONING of these has yet to be determined, last I remember on that topic.
