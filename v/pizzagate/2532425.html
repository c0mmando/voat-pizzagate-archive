<p>Just catching up on this story, but why would <a href="https://voat.co/user/RepCardenas">@RepCardenas</a> be the one to take the girl to the hospital instead of the parents? Odd that he would do that alone with a child that was not his own or related to him...</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, well, sure! You know how it goes. You\'re fifty-years-old and don\'t have anyone to play golf with so you invite a 16-year-old along and then she gets sick but you don\'t call her parents because you decide to take her to the hospital yourself and hope <s>to hell no one saw you with her</s> that it\'s nothing serious.</p>

            He is a sicko freak and also a thug.  Here's an excerpt from an April 27 LA Times article, before he outed himself:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The suit also recounted an alleged incident where Jane Doe said she found herself alone with the man [Cardenas/Mr. Doe] at her father's workplace.
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <strong>
             Mr. Doe told a joke, but she failed to laugh at it. In response, Mr. Doe told her, 'Remember where your dad works.' She perceived that as a threat against her family's security
            </strong>
            ," the lawsuit states.

            The court filing, which was first reported by the Los Angeles Times, alleges that “John Doe” first met the plaintiff in 2005 at a golf tournament when she was 14 and subsequently became a close friend of her family’s. Two years later, the document claims, he fondled her breasts and genitals while driving her to the emergency room after the two played golf at Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles.
           </p>
           <p>
            The girl had “suddenly collapsed to the ground” during the golf game after John Doe gave her a cup of ice water that “tasted distinctly different from both tap and filtered water,” the lawsuit states.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shades of Bill Cosby?  Drugging her?  He met her at 14.  A tender age.  He became close to the family.  Really.  Grooming begins.

             Ha! UpVoat for this alone! Thanks for making me laugh because Lord knows I need to at this point.

             Absolutely. Following in the well-worn path of being a perv. This just smells to high heaven. I guess the only question for me is how many times he did this before? Pervs that do this use don't usually stop at one victim.

              Nancy can't lose one of their Blackmailable Candidates!.  What a travesty.  He was surely picked for his perverted past.  She is probably hoping to make a deal with the parents and quietly settle it out of court.  Let's hope they stand up for that girl. Yes, the family feels victimized as well.

                Yes this is how they find their Brownstoning Victims.  Just think, this is pretty tame stuff (as sick as we all think it is) compared to what we know others have done.  This guy is only at the beginning of his evil doing.  It would certainly escalate knowing they will back him up.  A sweetheart deal.  He gets to do what he wants and they get what they want.  A Win Win.  Perverted and Sick is what they all are.

                   Things didn't happen by accident. Everything was measured and premeditated. And credit to The Devils who wove this web, when Killary was pushed out of the way for The Kenyan's candidacy, the cabal knew what it was doing. Killary would not have been given the pass that The Kenyan had. He decimated Our Constitution and country -- and nobody even blinked.
