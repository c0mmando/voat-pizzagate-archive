            Whoever new decides to step up and be a mod, I beg of you to look into these ridiculous "submission" rules. If a post is CLEARLY tying into PG and posted pics/videos are within the submission, for the love of GOD, why do we need to give a description of every damn pic?
           </p>
           <p>
            The dictatorship/importance of a post versus trying to bust this open and help 100's of thousands of kids is very disturbing. This forum wouldn't even need so many mods if we were treated like adults. I'm not saying I don't appreciate mods' time and doin this for free, but it does not need to be so complicated. Curious, who created the "submission rules" and are they even a mod anymore?

             So that people know what they are clicking on before they expose themselves to it. We have a lot of abuse victims here and many with limited time to invest, as well as active disinfo agents who constantly attempt to lead people down rabbit-holes. Describing linked material often forces those who post here for non-helpful reasons to reveal their intentions. It also makes vetting posts much, much easier. And it improves searchability via key words.

             The rules were created as a group effort involving mods, O's, members of ProtectVoat attempting to insure freedom of speech, and the user community. They were instituted shortly before I was asked to be a mod, so while I voted for them, I was not as involved in the planning then.

              Thank you for your response. I guess the entire subject of PG is exposing unpleasantries so I'd feel anyone looking is at their own risk. If something had very disturbing images, I could see maybe a quick warning-"disturbing".  I'd also think those of us truly trying to expose this stuff would be a little more obvious than trolls. Or at least give us a DM, explain the rule broken and allow maybe 5 hrs (due to time diffferences) to correct versus an auto delete. Seems harsh and exaggerated.

              I had posted a vid link and specifically said the pictures I posted were SS of the video. To label all groups of the pics is motonous and time consuming. But I reposted with the rules we have to follow.

               This would be great, except for the fact that it is exceedingly onerous for mods to keep track of, especially when we are undergoing one of our shill barrages. Under Voat's anti-censorship policies, if we did it for one user, we would have to do it for all, as in:

               "PGisStupidasFuck, please edit your post in accord with Rule 2. I'll come back in five hours to make sure you added supporting links to your dry erase drawing jpg of Podesta urinating on Pizzagate investigators."

               Ah. You are confusing the rules that govern submissions with the rules that limit moderator power (Moderator Rules). Here they are:

                (1) Submissions removed by a moderator will specify the following in the
                <em>
                 Reason
                </em>

              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                one or more rule numbers referencing the Submission Requirements that have been violated;
               </li>
               <li>
                the username of the submitter (for later inspections).
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               <strong>
                (2) Submissions removed by a moderator on their probation period will, additionally, get a comment that will:

              <ul>

                 </em>
                </strong>
                suggest an alternate subverse in the network to post it to;
               </li>
               <li>
                provide a hotlink to the suggested subverse;

              <p>
               <strong>
                (3) Comments are to be off-limits to moderation, with the following exceptions:

              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>

               </li>
               <li>
                copypasta (the moderator will leave the first instance and remove the rest);
               </li>
               <li>
                NSFW content (images, etc.) that has not been appropriately labeled as such;

                (4) Moderators will not delete posts based on source "quality".
               </strong>
               If a submission meets the Submission Requirements then the determination of quality will be left to the users and their votes. Moderators may use flairs to draw attention to submission quality.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                (5) Flairs will always be provided a reason for in a comment by the moderator.
               </strong>
               The comment will state which flair has been applied, and why.

                Users can request a detailed explanation for the removal of any submission. In order to do so, the explanation request needs to:

              <ul>
               <li>
                be posted as a top-level comment on the deleted submission (for transparency);

               <li>
                ping at least one moderator (using the @ sign);
               </li>
               <li>
                be specific and demonstrate a prior understanding of the rules cited as the reason of removal, requesting information

                 beyond

              <ul>
               <li>
                "Why has this been removed?" ✘

                "This is related to Pizzagate, why has this been removed?" ✘
               </li>
               <li>
                "@wecanhelp, I think my post complies with rule 1 as it is about the Clinton family, and I'm clearly stating that. What am I missing?" ✔
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Moderators, regardless of these rules, are still encouraged to be supportive, and make helpful comments on removals where it makes sense and there is a realistic chance of improving a submission that is otherwise investigative in its nature.

                Lol. Any rule that give any moderator any power at all is inherently a rule for censorship. And given how much stuff you guys delete around here, don't even pretend like you are about limiting the power of moderators. Half the reason I stopped posting was because you guys constantly deleted my hard work because you'd find one little imperfection about how it was posted that didn't matter anyways.

                This is pointing out who the global elite really are, you could claim this bullshit with any post. The ones controlling the money are the ones controlling the trafficking and blackmail of politicians in all countries. You just don't like the content. It is directly related and you know it.

                 Really? You didn't name a single name among the global elite. Just vague generalities, innuendos about secretive Medieval societies about which almost no claims can be proven. Please explain how "Knights Templar" is going to help put Alefantis in prison for raping his dishwasher, threatening pizzagate investigators and making death threats to mods here? Speculative. Interesting but useless. Certainly not directly connected.

                  Are you for real? The Rothschilds family, The Morgan family, the Rockefeller family. Any of the 13 bloodlines. They own all the worlds central banks and control the money supply to virtually every country, including Russia. How can you have been here so long and not understand anything.  And as usual, your stance is one of 'nothing to see here".

                   Guys, seriously, the BBC warrior monk story is like trying to cram a fat foot into a tiny shoe - the article does not even head into to general direction of pedophilia, it's just backfill story on world elites, albeit informative. But to shoehorn this story (BBC even!) into our forum distracts from investigave work and litters the page. Besides, many of us Voaters understand the KT/Black Pope/Vatican angle, anyway - we are, in many ways, hardcore. It's why we left Reddit.

                  Revealing who is controlling the money supply is going to lead to the big fish and that makes tracing the supply back to its root essential. We have multiple shills running around here daily blaming the Jews and spreading disinformation, this is to put a end to that and to shine a light on the real money changers. Ultimately, James Alefantis is a peon. Putting him in prison would be great, but it certainly wont end this. You know that. If any of us could name the people at the top of this bullshit and provide the evidence you're asking me to, we wouldn't need this sub.

             </a>
             NEW or HOT, click the TOP button. Then click ALL TIME. It will show you the highest upvoated posts, in descending order.

             Search has been removed as part of Voat's austerity measures. But the Alternative Search link in the sidebar gives multiple other options that work better than it ever did anyway.

                That sucks for me hahaha although I do have proof through disqus that I've used this name for years. I guess that doesn't really clear me of being a shill here, but you can certainly see my posting habits which is fighting shills.

            Darkmath is a good choice if he is willing. I have broken rules before inadvertently,  so I don't think I would be a good candidate.

             we all need to break the rules a time or two.  I voat YOU, and Carmencita (if not already a mod-just came back from a much needed break), and UnicornsandSparkles, that is if you have the time. I know you are a mum and that is super important to our collective future.  Best to all-keep up the great work.

            As much as I hate liberals and crooked politicians... Banning opposing opinions is a violation of the first amendment. Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.

            I want to thank the MODS one and all, past and present, for making this discussion possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            The abused have learned to hide everywhere in plain sight.  It's difficult  to speak even anonymously. It's something you never get over, self doubt and depression are the natural reactions unfortunately.  Abusers on the other hand, certainly verbal abusers here on pizzagate, post constantly like machine guns.     We need you MODS.  Your the Lions at the Gate making this a safer space, keeping it as civil as possible, where everyone yells at once.
           </p>
           <p>
            Platoons in hostile territory, always have a point man.  It's the most dangerous position, it rotates among the most able bodied and mentally capable within the group.  We need you, you with your thick skin and fortitude.    Mods are necessary.  If you don't have a thick skin, please fake it til you make it.  Do it for the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we are correct, that organized sexual abuse of infants and children is a world wide reality, then your time spent doing dangerous duty without any reward or acclaim, will not go unnoticed. It will be noted, your fearlessness and sense of duty, on a plane that matters more than this one.  We older people can feel that.  You don't need youth, beauty, or a strong back for this, just a strong mind.  Again Thank You in advance for stepping up, taking a turn. You can do it!

             The mods are compromised completely. They decided to go against Voat's well thought out voting system (for which moderation is not really needed unless the content-to-be-removed is illegal). From the beginning, I think that this forum was a "catch all" for the new  people coming from reddit. They've controlled the flow of information very effectively, mitigating any real increase in publicity and membership, or expansion from the main findings of
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">

              I don't see compromised mods, just folk doing important, thankless, work with harsh criticism par for the course.

              Not even saying "The sun always rises in the east." is accurate most days.  It varies from NE to SE daily, more towards the poles and less at the equator.  It rises in the E about twice a year.  Reality has shades of grey.  We all want it to be simple, but it isn't.   Grabbing at absolutes is a waste of your minds valuable attention. Attention to reality is powerful.  Use it carefully, hone your skill.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look, wake up to the new day and notice, you will never know it all.
And that is a beautiful thing.

                Wrong on the first one.  9/11 was definitely an inside job.  I called bullshit/disinfo on the "no planes" nonsense.  I haven't personally researched Sandy Hook, but I haven't seen any evidence of it being a hoax, let alone it being connected to pizzagate.

                LOL.  Shills are constantly flaming me.  I rarely respond.  Interesting tactic.  Make personal attacks against me and then if I respond, criticize me for responding.
