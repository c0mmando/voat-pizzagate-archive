<p>And in the light of that puke making Tech Crunch article about Kutcher\'s supposed enlightened stance on gender equality I\'d like to repost a comment on one of my own posts about the man himself:</p>

<p>IMO, you\'re right on w/ Ashton Kutcher\'s seedy connection to PedoGate &amp; Human Trafficking. A couple of things already known about Kutcher:</p>
<p>His ex girlfriend was stabbed to death (by a serial killer) in 2001. Ashton testified that he called her, then went over to her apartment after no response. Her car was in driveway &amp; lights on at her place. Kutcher knocked on door &amp; called out w/ no answer, then he said he looked through window &amp; saw what he thought was red wine pooled on the floor. He dated Brittany Murphy from 2001-2002. She got into drugs (w/ Kutcher), eating disorder &amp; now looking back, she was MK Ultra (Mind Controlled), IMHO. She died in 2009 under bizarre circumstances. I lived in LA &amp; went to house parties &amp; clubs w/ friends of mine (a model &amp; actress - both semi-successful). We would often see Kutcher at functions. What I remember most about him, in particular, was his insistence that he was going to be an A Lister. I mean he was into drugs &amp; would sex-up many men/women, but on 4 different occasions he would tell us how famous he would be &amp; willing to do anything to become an A Lister. He began dating Demi Moore in 2005. Kutcher became a devout Kabbalist after Demi introduced him to Kabbalah (definitely worth digging into further). Madonna, as well as MANY other celebs are Kabbalists.</p>
<p>Once Kutcher &amp; Demi got together, we would still see him out A LOT! I\'m guessing that we\'d see him out without Demi about 1/3 of the time &amp; the other 2/3\'s w/ Demi &amp; oftentimes her daughters would be out with them.</p>
<p>This is what myself &amp; my 3 girlfriends thought/think was the most bizarre was when Kutcher, Demi, &amp; sometimes her girls would go to Lucky Strike bowling alley (all ages hot spot in LA). Ashton would obviously &amp; aggressively hit on MUCH, MUCH younger girls blatantly in front of Moore. It was awkward &amp; pathetic to watch...he would actually leave Lucky Strike w/ YOUNG girls &amp; come back int the bowling alley 30 minutes later. It seemed like Demi only cared if somebody noticed it &amp; pointed it out, which embarrassed her. 1 time in particular, he was really putting the moves on a 15-17 yr old girl (underage to say the least) &amp; Demi looked away for most of it. Then some couple came in &amp; said, hey, it\'s Demi &amp; Ashton. To which Demi cheekily scolded Kutcher (not in normal, pissed way)...then they gathered up their stuff &amp; changed shoes. Demi went to the counter &amp; Kutcher darted over to this young girl &amp; got her phone # &amp; he scurried out to catch up with Moore.</p>
<p>He cheated on Demi w/ string of younger girls, many at same time.</p>
<p>Kutcher &amp; Demi Moore started DNA Foundation in 2009. Once they divorced in 2012, they changed the name to THORN. Both remain w/ THORN, as co-founders, as well as Board of Directors, along w/ Ray Chambers UN Secretary-General\'s Special Envoy for Malaria &amp; Jim Pitkow, co-founder of Attributor.</p>

            who has submitted a whole series of Submissions on Racine.  Kutcher is involved with McCain who is also connected to Racine.  Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore are pedophiles and all they want to do is protect their filthy habits.

             Notice how Chris (Ashton) Kutcher has been laying low after initially being paraded out as the front man to investigate Pizzagate?
            </p>
            <p>
             He was scheduled to attend a big event for The Fight to End Exploitation and backed out of it to avoid the scrutiny.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is because they know we have the truth about him, the Emanuels and Podestas, Clintons, Weiner, Schumer, Byrd, McCain, Graham, Bushes, Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Scott Walker, and how they are all connected to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption through Racine, Wisconsin, Knights of Pythias, the Pilgrims Society, Kabbalah, the Boy Scouts, Art in Embassies, Agenda 2030, and their other groups that overlap.

             Yes, thank you for the reminders.  I have also written about Kutcher's connection with McCain.  It just boggles my mind that with all the accumulated evidence we have on these pricks they are still rolled out as 'role models' and special human beings so concerned for all of us.  It's absolutely revolting. And the kool-aid snaffling masses continue to lap it up.

              I can't wait til this all comes out and IT WILL COME OUT.  It is slowly happening and they are feverishly trying to head it off at the pass.  But this is way to big to control.  There are way too many now catching on, but slowly.  They think it is just Katy Perry, but soon they will catch one about Jay Z and some others.  The Hip Hoppers are on to it but they are being suicided one after another, and I wonder how long that will continue before it catches the attention that it should, I am shocked the fans are not out in the streets over this.

            Should have dropped a hard J at SOME point, cowardly woman.  Kind of the elephant in the room.  Dont forget the vile Jewess Madonnas Haitian-American modern artist boyfriend who ODed at the usual age of 27, thus raising the future values of his atrocious spray painted crap, along with a biopic in which his friend (molestor) David Bowie portrayed his other friend (molestor) Andy Warhol.

            taking another look at your comment and searching for Jim Pitkow, co-founder of Attributor, I came across across
            <a href="http://memoryholeblog.com/2014/06/23/an-open-letter-to-anderson-cooper/comment-page-2/">
             this article
            </a>
            with an interesting comment:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Also, watch the short video at PredPol.com. PredPol is directly linked to Sandy Hook via ‘Sandy Hook Promise’ and
             <strong>
              Jim Pitkow and the Sandy Hook Innovation Initiative
             </strong>
             , which was already up and running by March 2013. Pitkow fronts “The Smart Tech Foundation”. This Pitkow fellow is a real whiz: he has founded, co-founded, served as ‘research scientist’, ‘advisor’ or ‘consultant’ to 15 different groups – among them Xerox-PARC and NASA, as well as oddly named organizations such as GroupFire, Pioneers of the Inevitable, and WellnessFX. He started out as a psych major at U. of Colorado and bought his Ph.D. sheepskin in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology.

             Interestingly, in the CBS video at PredPol.com, as the L.A. Chief of Police, Charlie Beck is interviewed, you’ll see Laurel Canyon Blvd. on the map. Laurel Canyon was the focal point for the ‘revolutionary’, some might say, ‘madcap’ 1960s and 70s, which included the murders associated with the ‘Manson Family’. The title of the CBS video is “Predictive Policing: Making L.A. Safer.” The fact that the editors at CBS ensured that Laurel Canyon Blvd. is visible for a few seconds in the video is the insiders’ way of laughing at the profane. Also, at the beginning of the ‘report’ we’re told that PredPol is being used in “the Foothill Missions section, North of downtown Los Angeles,” which is a “largely working-class neighborhood”. We are to draw the conclusion that this is the type of place where ‘real’ or ‘true’ crime occurs. It does NOT occur in an upscale/tony place such as Newtown/Sandy Hook or Columbine. Newtown crime isn’t real. This is part of the processing of the mind. In response to those who are skeptical of such predpol computer programs telling cops how to conduct their jobs, Beck states; (to paraphrase) if this old [street] cop can change the way he thinks, then I know my sons can change the way they think. Beck’s 2 sons are also cops.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what it’s really all about is changing the way you think. The program has already moved ahead – you need to “catch up” or you’ll be ‘left behind’. And no one wants to be left behind.

             Additionally, Laurel Canyon immediately brings to mind the name, Dave McGowan, who is another good researcher and who should be of interest. He’s written extensively on Laurel Canyon, the ‘hippies’, the ‘music’ groups [CSNY, etc.] and tie-in to military intelligence. Dave McGown’s site:

             With his 'open dialogue on gender equality' can you imagine how the freemasons in the background must be killing themselves laughing?
