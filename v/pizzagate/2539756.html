<p>1.The branding was performed by Dr. Danielle Roberts at the Albany home of Allison Mack. Branded slaves were all members of NXIVM before they were branded. Stormy was not a NXIVM member.</p>
<p>2.If Stormy had been a member of NXIVM, someone would have spoken of it.  As a porn star, she would have attracted attention</p>
<p>.
3.Members of NXIVM know other members. The names of NXIVM members are not secret. None of the branded slaves were kept hidden.  What was hidden was their sex slave status and their being branded.</p>
<p>4.All of the branded women participated in regular activities of NXIVM; they attended NXIVM courses. Stormy did not join NXIVM. She did not take any NXIVM courses [called ‘intensives”] And if she did NOT join, she did NOT get branded.
5.If she had been branded, she would have been required to follow the 500-800 calorie diet. And allowed only three-4 hours of sleep per night. Stormy looks well rested and not skinny enough to be a branded slave.</p>
<p>6.NXIVM slaves were required to provide graphic nude photos for leader Raniere, Allison Mack and Seagram’s heiress, Clare Bronfman to use for blackmail. If a branded slave did not obey, Raniere, Mack or Bronfman, would threaten to publish the nude photos to embarrass the woman.  This would not have worked with Stormy. She has 100s of nude pics already published. She could not be embarrassed by Raniere-Bronfman releasing nudes of her.</p>
<p>7.Stormy was not Raniere’s type. He prefers waif thin, flat chested or nearly flat chested, boyish type women. He has an aversion to voluptuous or large-breasted women.
8.Then there’s Stormy’s scar. If the pics are not photoshopped – which I suspect they are – the location where Stormy has her so-called brand is wrong. It is near her right hip. The women of NXIVM were branded on their pubic region, nearer their vaginas where it would cause the most pain. Pain was an important part of Raniere’s teachings.</p>

            Look I will spell it out for the ones that are still confused, they need slaves, some go willingly thinking they are cool, some are blackmailed, NXIVM was one, but there are hundreds of others, which also brand and blackmail, stormy was on one of the others, all the branches have different gimmicks, but at the top is always connected to the usual suspects, pizzagate 10000% real, more than 100% cause you ignore the scale.

             theres a certain mindset these cult leaders look for
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             now that I have been looking into things, I'm realizing what is all involved
            </p>
            <p>
             take Charles Mason, thought it was the drugs because I didnt see him as his followers did
            </p>
            <p>
             its the same spiel used everywhere, different extent

            Everyone should read this article.

            Lots of stuff going on.
           </p>
           <h2>
            Parlato dates the branding to beginning in 2015.
           </h2>
           <p>
            He has mentioned this elsewhere.  He himself didn't publish anything about this until June 2017, but he did tell law enforcement about it, the FBI I believe.  I know local law enforcement looked into this but they women said it was consensual which means it's not against the law.  There are fraternities that do this too.
           </p>
           <h2>
            Politics and NXVIM
           </h2>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I do appreciate the conspiracy theory. It’s lovely: Stormy is a NXIVM sex slave. Raniere and NXIVM are connected to Hillary and Bill, hence Stormy, as a sex slave, was ordered to ruin Donald Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a matter of fact, Raniere – who led NXIVM with an iron fist – hated Hillary Clinton. He called her “a cunt” many times. He gave her money, true, but that was only to get her to help him get enemies indicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Raniere preferred Trump for president. I know of no instance where Trump ever met Raniere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Overall, Raniere preferred Republicans, but Democrats were willing to help him. Raniere hired Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand’s father [her stepmother was a member of the cult.] He ordered Clare Bronfman to support Gillibrand financially.  Clare and Sara Bronfman and Nancy Salzman attended the Clinton Global Initiative.  NXIVM supported Albany County DA David Soares, now disgraced AG Eric Schneiderman and Lt Gov. Kathy Hochul.
            </p>
            <p>
             Democrats were willing to take Bronfman money. Raniere was willing to use them to protect his cult and go after enemies.

             Couple of other points to add.

             Not only is the branding in the wrong side in the photoshopped pic.  If it was a legitimate brand, it would even be visible in that picture.  Her panties would cover it.   They would have to be pulled down much more.

             We know exactly what was going on in Stormy Daniel's career in February 2010 when she tweeted she feels like she is joining a gang or maybe a cult.   This was very public and mainstream/non-porn related.  We know exactly what she was talking about joining.  It was well known at the time.  Y'all should look this up, because it explains exactly what she meant.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know when her surgery was.  She tweeted about needing surgery starting in 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
             We now see her tattoo artist posted in Jan 2014 that she was working on multi-part tattoo to cover that scar.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are tweets from Stormy Daniels in 2014 to her fans explaining why she got the tattoo.  A fan complained she ruined herself with that tattoo and she asks if he would prefer to see her scars.
            </p>
            <p>
             2014 is BEFORE NXVIM started branding slaves.  Which started in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             Debunked.
Here's an even better photo from the tattoo artist's website.

               No one is saying she was branded before they started that in 2015
              </li>
              <li>
               If they were going to brand she had to have it done on top of the tattoo....which is very feasible

              Had to give you a point there. She does have a scar and if you look closely, you can see what looks like the K at the beginning of it.  Could be two truths here however.  As for the timeline before the branding, can you verify it wasn't before 2015?

            I suspect she is an asset for honeypot/brownstone operations. The mark doesn't match NXIVM, but it is similar.

             I can see her as a honeypot, one that's been working it for a long time
            </p>
            <p>
             other cults that brand, now theres something I didn't think of, and I imagine it quite true
            </p>
            <p>
             tats are another type of branding, a lot of the gangs do that
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been relying on Franks articles as factual, I don't know who he is, or she for that matter, but he does seem to know the gang very well, he/she was a member .
            </p>
            <p>
             as I have said, I think Keith would be too intimated to take a porn star to bed , how would he manage to get the "Wow he's God" vibe going with someone who  has been there done that
            </p>
            <p>
             wonder how many times she was by Heff's mansion
            </p>
            <p>
             maybe she caught Trump in honeypot and they hung on to it for timing. or she could be working with him

             Guest View: You May be Wrong; Stormy Daniels MAY BE BRANDED NXIVM SLAVE out to get Donald Trump!
            </p>

             I watched the video where these photos were taken in the highest resolution available on a 55 inch screen.  The markings, whatever they are, certainly are there in the spot identified in the photos on your website.  In the real video, they’re much more obvious, as the movement of her body reflected against lighting shows clearly that it is raised skin. ...
            </p>
            <p>
             I just wanted to write you and tell you that quite a few people have seen the video in question, and I assure you, it’s not photoshopped images being circulated.  I can provide a link to it if you want to see for yourself.
Lastly, there are pre and post tattoo images being circulated now, the ‘tummy’ tuck is nowhere close to the markings in question.  There is room for the possibility she has some other surgery, obviously.
In general, as weird as all of this stuff is getting around this President, I would encourage you to leave the door a little more open to who she may be, and what she was into.

            My opinion? The timing is right for this. Remember this cult was first reported on in 2007. All the major outlets were aware of the bizarre goings on, so 2010 is soundly in the sweet spot for something to have happened. I think about NXIVM the way II do any major secret society ... Like the Freemasons. Do the lower degrees actually know there's a 33rd degree? Do they know of all the shenanigans and crimes taking place? Doubtful.
           </p>
           <p>
            So nobody's saying that she was a member of DOS, but NXIVM? Oh, yeah ... I just have my own thoughts on her working with Trump. When I had my ''revelation'' about Q being real, Stormy was tied into my thoughts that day and I clearly saw her as in an alliance with our POTUS. Call me crazy, call me wrong, but I'm not backing off that original feeling even though every time I read about another twist or turn, I think she can't be in an alliance with him. I was going to get a post from Q and submit my speculation, but haven't gotten around to it yet.

             Stormy doesn't have a brand, I looked close at pics last night and figured cover for plastic surgery, she did have a kid, and for some women it really causes damaged to belly skin
            </p>
            <p>
             a lot of people saying she was branded, which would put her in the inner circle, Just posting that isn't true
            </p>
            <p>
             some of the points Frank Parlato made, I figured out last night, not all of them though
            </p>
            <p>
             when it comes to NXIVM, Frank is one of the go to people who have inside knowledge

               its gut, but timing is weird, she usually has good things to say about him, been reading a lot of her interviews
              </p>
              <p>
               I think the thing that really kinda went with gut was when she said  "Sex with Trump was “textbook generic” but “wasn’t bad” either"
              </p>
              <p>
               “The sex was nothing crazy. He wasn’t like, chain me to the bed or anything. It was one position. I can definitely describe his junk perfectly, if I ever have to. He definitely seemed smitten after that,” Daniels said of her rendezvous with Trump
              </p>
              <p>
               I realize he was in much better shape back then, but it so sounds like he paid her for that one and she threw in a dib, he seemed smitten
              </p>
              <p>
               why didn't she hop the bandwagon when everyone else did?
              </p>
              <p>
               Why isn't her lawyer Allred or Bloom?
              </p>
              <p>
               she seems to be doing a lot better than his other accusers? where are they?
              </p>
              <p>
               but what puts a hole in it is her lawyer
              </p>
              <p>
               he has ties and court cases that make me think he in Obama camp
              </p>
              <p>
               She doesn't seem the type to break a NDA
              </p>
              <p>
               Imagine the stories she can tell, I don't think there is much in her closet as to knowing what in others
              </p>
              <p>
               She never said a word about anyone till now, I didn't even know who she was
              </p>
              <p>
               maybe its just hopeful thinking
              </p>
              <p>
               doesn't matter to me either way as long as he keeps going and draining the swamp
              </p>
              <p>
               pretty gutsy of her either way also

                All sound reasoning. Yeah, I got the same impression a while back that they were best buds and that the money payoff was for an entirely different reason. Then when all this crap, I flipped my thinking and figured I was wrong. But then there was that revelation about our POTUS, his role, Q, and Stormy Daniels. I know it was a revelation because I wasn't thinking that way and my thoughts again flipped when I heard/read that prophecy about him being the Gatekeeper. I realized that this mission he's on started on 9/11. And it seems to be holding true because who did he recruit? Giuliani. Giuliani was lambasting Skankles during that time, but actually had to apologize to the bitch because he claimed she wasn't in NYC on 9/11 -- which she wasn't! The press showed a pic of her marching in NYC to view the damage, but that was on 9/12. The press acknowledged that, showed the picture anyway, and then Giuliani actually had to apologize! Why? No, he has an axe to grind, and all those faux pas he's making? No, it's all planned. He knows exactly what he's saying. I really do have to find that Q post and try to put it together. And I did find someone who tweeted along the lines I'm thinking.
               </p>
               <p>
                And her attorney wouldn't negate the speculation. It would mean that she'd successfully infiltrated the enemy camp.

                  Now David Seaman and Liz Crokin are going at it. Seriously, can't people on the same side take the high road once in a while. DS is hyper. LC is also hyper. Remember when she thought people were following her? She freaked out! I didn't see the tweet DS sent her [deletesville], but she goes into a rage saying Q called DS out in a post? No he didn't. Then she threatens him with her lawyers. Can't she just keep her cool and try to settle it off twitter? They've both done good work, and LC has said things that are nuts. I've said it before, but she's still seduced by PedoWood. And I'm sure she thinks they love her, but they don't, but that doesn't mean she's not trying to get things exposed.

                  All it shows is that we're all very different and come together because of a cause. I'd really rather have arguments than no arguments, because no arguments means a cabal wit high-ranking members ordering those under them to do or say certain things. Like the fake Women's March and Screaming at the Sky event. I mean, WTH? If someone in pizzagate suggested screaming at the sky, I would hope someone else would tell them it wasn't a good idea, but this kind of battling? Whatever.

                      Yeah, plenty of times I'll post something, and KABOOM! Someone comes out of left field with something I would have never even thought to look for. And I understand, but don't agree with DS's frustrations. I was there with Q being wrong ... felt the same things. We're all ... well, maybe not all ... most of us are impatient about 5:5 videos, the promised Barry pics, and LOCKHERUP.

                      I guess I see progress. That's why I'm not flipping out right now. As long as there's a discernible movement towards the goal, it calms the spirit. The Cannibal Elite really do seem as if they're caving and retreating. I have no idea what's about to happen, but this is going to be massive.

              I have no idea what pics you looked at, but she does have a brand. It's in the shape of a ''K''. There's no discrepancy. I didn't save the pic because I never do. I never save tweets or websites either and have to reconstruct everything which is fairly impossible. The pic was a screenshot from the video. Okay, I found this:

               so your saying it would be a brand that Mack had added her initals to right?

               not the older KR one right?

                I haven't even gone that far. I just noticed that the brands are very similar and that the K which you refer to being on its side turns into an A with a bar across it when it is flipped in that way. That turning over on its side is exactly what was being done [in some cases] in the recent DOS brandings.

                    It's true. It's why England has the problems they do. There was even a TV program -- a series that was on. It was an English detective story and even the show's lead character mentioned how the Masons had infiltrated the police force. I was like, "What?" So it's not like they don't know.

               Lastly, there are pre and post tattoo images being circulated now, the ‘tummy’ tuck is nowhere close to the markings in question.

              It's not a tummy tuck according to the guest poster who viewed the video. This branding is to the side. In the same spot the other women had it done. Tummy tuck incisions are centered -- not off to the side. How else would they tuck the stomach evenly?
             </p>
             <p>
              From a cosmetic surgery website:

             </p>
             <p>
              He's right. The incision is not even close. And the incision is never in the shape of a K. It doesn't make any sense.

                Okay, for whatever reason you're being ridiculous. Those are the exact same incisions. A clean incision across the lower abodomen, pubic region so the entire stomach can be pulled down. They don't make a ''K'' in one side of the abdomen because it wouldn't allow a uniform pull down of the stomach.

                   Aside from the cost/name, is there a difference in brand &amp; generic drugs? Are the generic always as good?
I rarely take meds. And I HATE pain meds. Had surgery &amp; was given generic Norco &amp; still have lots of pain so was wondering.

                  That's your opinion but it is MY body. The tat is to cover a scar and make me feel better.

 Want very vibrant colorful/realistic flowers and must be familiar with covering a scar. Location doesn't matter. I will travel

                  it is not hate at all, just really disappointed. You are such a beautiful lady, I just hated to see that on you

                  Guess you'd have been happier w/the terrible scar from my emergency surgery instead of the pretty&amp;meaningful tattoo covering it?

                   maybe surgery was laparoscopic surgery
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   they make nice little unusual scars

                  <p>
                   nothing wrong with her getting the surgery or tats
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   her lively hood is based on it, probably claimed tat on taxes as work related, same as the Breast job
                  </p>

                   never even knew she existed till now

                    as I mentioned before this all just what psychologists call "availability bias" we overestimate the risk of something or the probability of something if we can recall them easily.  NXVIM and Stormy are in the news so it just took someone a little photo-shopping to get a whole lot of people believing in something.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It's like we think about dying by being killed by a terrorist, but in terms of actual dangers more Americans die from falling out of bed or being accidentally shot by a child.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you stepped back to think about this it's highly, highly unlikely that Stormy Daniels had anything to do with NXVIM.  Simply because most Amercians had nothing to do with NXVIM.  Secondly, she doesn't seem to live any place that NXVIM is active.  Thirdly, no one mentioned her in connection with group in any context whatsoever at all.  The evidence came completely out of left field.  (Because we are going to find that brand photo was photoshopped and is a fraud.)

                    Also I just don't think porn stars are the type of folks who wind up in a sex cult.   I think it appeals to uptight women from more repressive backgrounds, then find themselves in an environment where they can lose their inhibitions...You don't need to brainwash a porn star to have sex.  And as you and Frank Parlato point out, nude photos of them make pretty ineffective blackmail material for that reason.

                      Yeah, I complete agree with this.   Also if white collar folks were signing up for executive performance seminars, would they feel better or worse about the company giving the seminars, if they knew that company was associated with the porn world?  Would that make them more likely or less likely to buy more classes?  Would that raise suspicions in the eyes of their customers/recruits?

                      To me It's a culture clash.
