<p>Santa Fe founded in 1984 by a group of scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory,..</p>
<p>From <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3179905/18234013">Digging deeper into Keith Raniere\'s &quot;Global Technologies Inc&quot; reveals truly global links and maybe, government agencies connections. This needs more eyes...</a></p>
<p>Global Technologies Inc is a privately held company in Idaho Falls, ID and is a Headquarters business....President: Francis Tsang..</p>
<p>According to his resume he was at the Idaho National Engineering Lab (1974-1995), then President of GTI ID (1995-2007), Principal Scientist at NSTec (Remote Sensing Lab, Las Vegas) from (2008-2012), Global Medial Isotope Systems CTO (Las Vegas) presently..</p>
<p>NSTec manages operations at the NTS and its related facilities and laboratories. Besides the Department of Energy\'s National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office, NSTec partners with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and <strong>Sandia National Laboratories on many projects</strong>. NSTec also works on projects for other federal agencies such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, NASA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Navy.</p>

<p>Interesting. Another Sandia Labs employee was nabbed for hacking and stalking Chester Bennington and his family in 2006. Can\'t help but wonder...was she a govt. gangstalker who was disowned when caught doing her job?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.informationweek.com/sandia-national-labs-worker-pleads-to-cyberstalking-linkin-park-singer/d/d-id/1056772">https://www.informationweek.com/sandia-national-labs-worker-pleads-to-cyberstalking-linkin-park-singer/d/d-id/1056772</a></p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&quot;Between Jan. 1, 2006, and Nov. 16, 2006, while still working at Sandia Labs, she used the e-mail account to view pictures of the Bennington\'s young children, read business correspondence, look at information about the family and the band\'s travel plans, and review online billing accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to stalking the vocalist online, the woman also traveled on two different occasions to try to see Bennington. On one of those occasions, she used information she obtained from his online accounts to listen to his voice mail to find out where Bennington would be eating.</p>

            Interesting. Another Sandia Labs employee was nabbed for hacking and stalking Chester Bennington and his family in 2006. Can't help but wonder...was she a govt. gangstalker who was disowned when caught doing her job?

            From the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Between Jan. 1, 2006, and Nov. 16, 2006, while still working at Sandia Labs, she used the e-mail account to view pictures of the Bennington's young children, read business correspondence, look at information about the family and the band's travel plans, and review online billing accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to stalking the vocalist online, the woman also traveled on two different occasions to try to see Bennington. On one of those occasions, she used information she obtained from his online accounts to listen to his voice mail to find out where Bennington would be eating.

               Great vid. Thank you. This helps me wrap my mind around why the dust and debris didn't shoot up and out which I believe would happen in the pancake scenario. All the air being expelled outward as if you had flour and your hands and clapped then together.

            I've been following (from the outside) HousatonicITS since the account was stood up 2 years ago.  He does some real deep dive research which shows an incredible, multi-generational and intertwined network of corruption, nepotism, and Deep State plots going back almost 100 years.

              Bryanston School is a co-educational independent school for both day and boarding pupils, located next to the village of Bryanston, and near the town of Blandford Forum, in Dorset in South West England. It was founded in 1928. It occupies a palatial country house designed and built in 1889–94 by Richard Norman Shaw, the champion of a renewed academic tradition, for Viscount Portman, the owner of large tracts in the West End of London, in the early version of neo-Georgian style[1] that Sir Edwin Lutyens called "Wrenaissance", to replace an earlier house, and is set in 400 acres (1.6 km2).
