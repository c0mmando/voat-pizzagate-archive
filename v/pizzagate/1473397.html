<p>Ms Eliane Kabile, a French lady from Guadeloupe island living in Paris suburbs got first admitted on December 22d 2000 in a hospital in the city of Gonesse for something quite benign : just exams following a right leg persisting pain. She was unexpectedly held in care for two weeks, going through exams and getting her treatment changed. Soon after she had returned home  she was called again by the hospital for further investigation about a detected anemia. Her family tried to have her admitted in a different hospital specialized in anemia cases, but nothing would do : the medical team would flatly refuse this option. </p>
<p>On January 27th 2001 she was admitted again at the hospital (strangely receiving two different admission numbers) and just next day was placed in a resuscitation unit under artificial respiration. She remained in this condition until her official death dated February 13th (even though her regular physician had received a death notice on February 9th…)</p>
<p>The family was informed that she had died while in care. This doesn’t have to be suspect, but it became when they were given three different death notices with different dates. They had a hard time getting the authorization for an autopsy report to learn that two different autopsies had been performed on what appears to be two different bodies at different dates from different places !</p>
<p>Before the funerals on February 27th the family could suspect that no autopsy had been performed on the body of Eliane Kabile.</p>
<p>Questions from the family lead to a second autopsy being requested which took place in strange circumstances in 2003. Instead of a body the family found in the coffin « an amount of human flesh, blood, the thorax of what appears to be a child and a skull. Not one limb was intact. »</p>
<p>Hereunder an article from local Guadeloupe press. The lawyer in charge of the case reports receiving advises that he should « look carefully right and left before crossing streets ».</p>
