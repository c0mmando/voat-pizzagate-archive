            Trump met with Pres. of Brazil who has CO-VID19    virus. Pence and Trump both declined testing. Huh 🤔?  Seems odd and Very Strange.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the wife of Trudeau has also treated positive after returning from London. They are both under quarantine. I expect more suspected pedos  to test positive.

              Gamepawn, I apologize for my comment. I realize none of us know exactly what is going on these days.  but personally I feel that the “cabal” is under threat here and hopefully these operations are working against them. Anyway, I was wrong to say what I did and appreciate your research. I do believe there is reason for hope and confidence now as ever, but God alone is worthy of that trust. God bless!

               Thank you. I have seen you here for years and I have been here for years so was like that was really unnecessary. It's fine. I hope so to, that's why I said what we could be witnessing is the storm.

                I agree and sometimes I jump to conclusions without fully reading or understanding someone’s comment neither way there is no place for comments like I made especially to sincere patriots who are doing honest and helpful research. Thanks for accepting my apology. I was wrong. Best!

            Time to invest in the correct Crypto:
           </p>
           <p>
            Mar 13, 2019 (AB Digital via COMTEX) -- On February 22, 2019, Philip Rothschild officially launched AFCOIN, referred to as AF, with a total of 700 million issued. AFCOIN is mainly based on the cryptocurrency of the whole industry application, non-traditional digital currency, will reach 100 to 300 entities + Internet landing application in August 2019.
           </p>
           <p>
            AF Digital Foundation as project sponsor, Philip Rothschild as chairman, Evelyn Rothschild as senior consultant, Warren Buffett (2.773%) as strategic investor, Peter Park as CEO General Mills (2.414%) and Edmond Rothschild (5.079%).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Rothschild family is a long-established financial family in Europe and the world. It was born in the early 19th century and its founder was Mayer Rothschild. He and his five sons, Roche Five Tigers, opened banks in famous European cities such as London, France, Paris, Austria, Vienna, Frankfurt, Germany and Naples.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2007, a "currency war" made most people know about the Rothschild family, but the general public's understanding of them is limited to the surface form. This family with more than 200 years of history is said to be It has a wealth of $50 trillion. What kind of concept is this? 50 trillion is equivalent to the total assets of more than 900 Gates or Buffett.
           </p>
           <p>
            AFCOIN is headquartered in the headquarters of Rothschild Bank in London, England. At this point, investors finally realized that a digital currency born less than one month, why there are so many big-name companies willing to cooperate with them, can not do without the power of this family.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first AFCOIN Rothschild Investment Application Seminar was held in London, England, in August 2019. 2019-2029, the Rothschild family will become the king of cryptocurrencies.

              50 trillion is conservative,  they're investing 5 T just in the crypto, some say the family is worth 300 T and growing.

            We should do like they did in the old days with lepers. Put a bell on the infected so the uninfected would know which way to run. Not a physical bell of course, but be sure Apple and the NSA have the tech to track every infected person, and cause their iphones to sound a loud but pleasant alarm. (It would do no good to swap phones, because every person's ethereal electronic persona follows them about like a shadow independent of any specific device.)

              Kawaoka reinvented a new virus based on H5N1, which he revealed to the public in 2011.[2] For now, no known vaccine has been found. Despite the great disturbance he has caused, Kawaoka argued that "it is part of valuable scientific research".[3][deprecated source] His research was halted by a moratorium issued from the US government in 2014. However in 2019 he was allowed to resume the research.
