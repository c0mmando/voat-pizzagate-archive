<p><em>Tech giants \'could stop child porn online if they wanted to\', says chief of National Crime Agency</em> is the headline in this Telegraph article, the majority of which is behind a paywall.  But I think we get the gist of it with what we can see:

<blockquote>
<p>Tech firms could end the proliferation of indecent images of children online instead of tolerating it, the National Crime Agency (NCA) chief leading the fight against child abuse has said.</p>
<p>Rob Jones said the firms had the technology to be more proactive to prevent images reaching the web in the first place to stop crime happening and to hunt down paedophiles grooming children.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Telegraph, he warned their approach was too reactive and there was a danger of online child abuse being normalised in society by the continued proliferation of thousands of images that were too easy to access on the “open” web.</p>

            Of course they could stop if they want.  We all remember Obama bragging about his massive database prior to last election.

            Right, because a child can make an adult decision?  Those of us who consider our role as guardians of not just our children, but children of the world. ..as a child needs protection keep trying to be heard.
           </p>

            Regular people who Would Never think of giving themselves over to such predatory, self-serving practices

            No one has to teach us. . .doesn't occur in our mind.  And NO it's Not a disorder, it's a selfish, willful allowance of their mind to absorb itself in what satan wants. . .

             young people.
            </em>
            . Yet another key phrase for these globalists, clearly luciferian, to make it appear appropriate, normal AND yet another of their Many Attempts to
            <strong>
             blur the lines,
            </strong>
            cause confusion and make people who even begin down a monstrous thought process to fall for their programming of. . ."well maybe it's okay."  NOT On Our Watch!

            This vile group even had women. . .which I know you all here are Already Aware Women are also big predators I and many others have covered even local reports dealing directly with this;  had them passing out pamphlets pre-internet days on the street at news stands (well at least no internet for the general public).  They actively went about trying to further their agenda.  I realize this is no surprise to all here.

            Those who haven't already heard of this organization, here is the leader in a 60 min. AU interview and this is just a short clip of the entire thing.  There was a lot of other footage which can be found where others in the group speak of the high profile abusers connected to them.

            Listen to him justify to all those who are evil how children of 10 can consent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently he has "shied away from" endorsing the 4 year old age, in which I heard him in an interview once speaking on how to negotiate sex with a 4 year old.  These people are depraved. . .it's a fact.  I know I don't have to convince you, but many, even those who believe in the protection of children still don't think these kind of people are literally everywhere. . .I assure you, the Are.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mark Minne, author of the controversial book ‘The Lost Boys of Bird Island’ devoted his post-police life to exposing the corruption and horrifying pedophilia he discovered while working as a detective. Minnie and his good friend Chris Steyn, also a former cop turned investigative journalist, worked together on the book to expose a government and business community who took children to Bird Island where they were abused, and some possibly murdered.

           <p>
            For those who had not heard or might have forgotten the details,
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The book details the level of their involvement in the pedophile ring, abuse of the children, alleged acts of murder to cover up the crimes, as well as corruption and abuse of high-level state resources by the network’s members.
            </p>
            <p>
             The book details the corruption within the last Apartheid government of South Africa and implicated officials all the way to the top, including defense minister Magnus Malan and the minister of environmental affairs John Wiley.
            </p>
            <p>
             Before his death, Minnie announced that he was approached by many more people with even more damning evidence which he planned to reveal in a sequel of the book. However, he died before he could finish it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The book was published earlier this month on August 5 and only nine days later, Minnie would be found dead. Officials claim they found a suicide note at the scene, but his family says they don’t believe it at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tersia Dodo, a family member of Minnie told reporters that just days before he died that if anything happened to him, they must know he was killed.

            Stop Online Exploitation Sex Trafficking Act (Sesta), which took down backpage, is our best hope in convicting Social Media Companies for knowingly facilitating trafficking rings.

            however, it essentially nullifies section 230 of the communications act which makes isp's and hosts not liable when users post illegal content.

            This is how Bernie Sanders pages were taken down. Malicious entities uploaded CP to political facebook groups and facebook took the whole pages down.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel that SESTA is almost a Trojan Horse for net neutrality legislation. If it becomes widely enforced, it lets the government control private webpages.

            Rob Jones makes some big claims with a slender foundation in fact. Yes, image filters do exist. Yes, tech companies could proactively censor all images that are uploaded to public services. This would not work well, but it would give the appearance of making a small effort.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rob Jones also throws out a number, very irresponsibly, when he says: “Why wouldn’t we stop tens of thousands of children getting exploited and abused if we have the means to do it?” He hasn't proven that the proposed tech would work. He certainly hasn't proven that it would stop tens of thousands of children from being exploited.  I doubt very much that Rob Jones is stupid enough to believe this plan would work. He is trying to get censorship power over the Internet and he is just using this as an excuse.

            The packaged goods giant Unilever is threatening to use its estimated $9 billion ad budget to force Facebook, Google and other tech platforms to address "toxic online content."
           </p>
           <p>
            Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, was scheduled to tell a group of internet advertising executives on Monday that the firm will stop supporting platforms that "do not protect children or which create division in society."
           </p>
           <p>
            In his prepared comments for the IAB Leadership Conference in Palm Desert, California, Weed said he had spoken about his mission to partners including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Snap and Amazon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google and Facebook have come under pressure in the past year for their roles in hosting abusive content and propaganda. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has been criticized for not doing enough to stop pedophiles from posting comments on videos and for not effectively curating its YouTube Kids section, while Facebook has admitted it was infiltrated by Russia-backed actors to spread propaganda.
           </p>
           <p>
            WOW.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weed said that research shows a big drop in trust in social media companies and a "perceived lack of focus" in addressing "illegal, unethical and extremist behavior and material on their platform."
           </p>
           <p>
            "2018 is either the year of the 'techlash,' where the world turns on the tech giants — and we have seen some of this already — or the year of trust," Weed said in his prepared remarks. "The year where we collectively rebuild trust back in our systems and our society."
           </p>
           <p>
            DOUBLE WOW.
           </p>
           <p>
            Facebook has noted a slowdown in people looking at its content and vowed to reduce the number of viral videos in its News Feed. In a report out Monday, forecaster eMarketer predicted that Facebook would lose 2 million users under the age of 25, as youngsters seek out other digital social venues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep leaving Facebook Twitter and Youtube.  It's Working.  I am keeping my fingers crossed.

                Ugh.  Unilever is bad I guess, but Nestle has been on my list for almost 30 yrs.  Child Labor.  They are located in Switzerland and own many companies all over, not only chocolate.  They made rugs in India with Little Children working so long and hard they turned blind.  60 Min.  did a piece on it then and it was heartbreaking.
               </p>
               <p>
                With the Vanilla they also use Child Labor.  Slavery.

              Nice to see you!  I hope this starts a whole brigade of others coming forward as well.  We must support these companies  They could possibly start a Movement Against Pedos.  OH NO.  That is MAP.. Darn. Movement Opposing Pedos.  Better.

               Of course I am tired of their games.  Evidently Unilever is playing along.  They see an opportunity to cover for their real agenda.  They will take whatever ways they can to convince people they are the good guys, while they are not.

                 You can bet I am.  They go along with whatever looks good and people believe it.  Really it is the people that are also fueling this.  They don't keep track of their ups and downs.  Getting charged one day and then coming out as do gooders the next.  It must stop.  Wake Up.  Btw, here is something else I am sick of.  More people that we think are do gooders and in the meantime some are defiling Our Children.  See my new post

            Yes, I completely agree. It's just that they don't want to.  They can shut down any remarks about Jews, pizzagate and elite pedophilia, but stopping pedo and porn accounts is so hard?? Oh please!

             This of course as you know, is what they do to our children to groom and Absolutely the directors of platforms allow it or they would have Ended it.

             Remember when facebook ran that survey?  Outed them very quickly (as if we all didn't know already)
            </p>
            <p>
             Did an article on this once and here was the jest of it,
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Facebook asks users if they, "should allow adults to ask minors for sexual images" Are you kidding me? Yet Good People are banned, harassed and censored!

            <p>
             Upon first glance any good, common sense person existing on this globe thinks they must be reading this wrong. No, sadly this actually happened! This would have happened on March 4th of this year, 2018 where Facebook actually ran a survey asking users advice on how they, facebook should handle grooming behavior. What has this world come to for progressives?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              First thoughts on this survey, It Is ILLEGAL behavior to begin with, so why would you "role play" this type of scenario? According to what other independent journalist findings have researched, a group called Heart Progress has been allowed to have and operate a facebook page. If you are not familiar with them, they are avid supporters of a group called NAMBLA also referred to as a type of mafia. Their name says it all in plain English, yet numerous leftists still condone and applaud their goals and behavior.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm sure all here are familiar with them and dedicated to exposing their subversive efforts to make their predatory practices upon children not just "normal," but LEGAL.  Not on OUR WATCH!

              Jimmy Saville was a major memeber of PIE, he was associated to the English Royal Family through his close connections to Prince Charles..  (Prince Andrew prefered to go the way of the Moussad and rub shoulders with Jeffrey Epstein)

               Also, what Saville was doing in showing up with the Priest. . .or better known as the feeder to predators. . .Exact same thing at BoysTown was going on in Omaha, Nebraska connected to the Larry King scandal and exposed the White House in same pedo scandal being conducted by an elite ring.  Bush senior was Vice then. . .he has always been a predator!  Generational, passed down, celebrated.

               You are correct about Saville, Epstein, Charles and Andrew.  Definite connections to Mossad with Epstein and his royals.
              </p>
              <p>
               Branson one of them too and I'm sure you know he has an island over there by Epstein also.  Bunch of vile predators.
              </p>
              <p>
               The elite royal family "pretend" they are there just for pomp and circumstance, as an honored tradition. . .but we all know about their links to people directly connected with the satanic cabal all throughout history.  There is ritualistic abuse in that family and Princess Diana wanted no part of it, but was forced through her love for her children to remain.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the priests don’t make a lot of money?  We know about their stores of treasures and hidden riches under that Vatican and other "churches" or "cathedrals."
              </p>
              <p>
               Their "institution" absolutely IS responsible for who they hire, how they oversee and supervise their "priests" and All of their Predatory practices.
              </p>
              <p>
               Get them out there with shovels. ..everywhere even in the Palo Alto and Dig, excavate, sell your stores of riches and pay up!  Get to Digging!
              </p>
              <p>
               For that matter, get over there to the Smithsonian who has always worked in conjunction with the Vatican and give it back to the people to be sold and used to pay due retribution to these abused.  The Smithsonian has been hiding artifacts and out true history for some time.  They even used to run articles about the mounds and bones they were digging up.  No doubt they have treasure also, just as their cohort the Vatican.  Vatican laid out like a Serpent's head. Clear to all of those who look at their art it's luciferean.  Filled with a great deal of their gnostic, mystery religion symbolism.  What a croc, what a Deception.  Not saying the people led astray by them who don't understand. . .God is after the Leadership (not those innocent in their congregations) of these liars, perverters. . .He has said, their father is Satan.  That is obvious!  They WILL FALL!  No question!
              </p>
              <p>
               They will continue to wreak havoc and harm as long as they can because this is their time...so they think.  It doesn't end well for them and their father Knows it!
              </p>
              <p>
               They are there to lead people down a path of destruction just as transhumanism is and All other "religions." God isn't about religion, He is only about belief in Him and following His ways.
              </p>
              <p>
               Too many, not all, but MANY churches are NOT obeying what God says.  Their time has come. They will Not be able to Continue preying upon the people!
              </p>
              <p>
               Prey vs Pray!  Our weapons. . .far more powerful than their tactics. No Weapon Shall be FORMED against you!   God wasn't talking to satan's bunch. . .US!
              </p>
              <p>
               People need to keep their children away from these churches.  Alter boy. . .are you kidding me?  None of this is "ordained" by God.
              </p>
              <p>
               They have just always made up their own rules to suit their needs. Nothing godly about their evil.  That's how satan works. . .he always pretend to be doing God's work because he sees himself as a god.  From the time he tried to usurp God's power and still attempts to do so while trying to drag all of us into it.
              </p>
              <p>
               The "priest" has no more access to God than we do.  All who are involved in these predatory practices or covering them up Have No Access to God.
              </p>
              <p>
               He doesn't hear the prayers of those in sin.  I can't stand this botched up lot of liars.
              </p>
              <p>
               The catholic church is on the front burners and they well should be, but so should these other churches no matter their denomination IF they harbor or attend to any of these pedophiles.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've come across a few stories and was aware of issues myself as a child.  Not saying All in these churches are corrupt, it is just that predators not only view it as a safe haven, but figure out pretty quickly how to run their scam and gain access to children.  I NEVER put my kids in nursery and was very leery of any Sunday school class.  I was so skeptical. . .wasn't even awake back then when they were very little and had people criticize me for never trusting people. . . looks like it was God protecting my Kids!
              </p>
              <p>
               God's sick of their garbage and the Light will continue to shine on their twisted evil they get away with under the cloak of "sanctity and piety!"
              </p>
              <p>
               God considers them Vomit!
              </p>
              <p>
               I've been called out on her recently on a different board for "throwing Jesus under the bus."
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus Never called us Christians.  This doesn't mean I am against Christians, quite the contrary.  I know Many Christians have no idea they have been forced into a societal construct that makes the name "Christian" confusing as heck to all the world and even those in their same circle who call themselves Christians.  This is Intentional.  Satan thrives on confusion because it gives him an opportunity to cause divides and make people ineffective since they don't know which way to go. . .methodist, lutheran, catholic, heck, some don't even realize the mormons have clear masonic roots.  We could be here all day with me naming.  Those who attempt to Not be under a denomination are on the right track, but even then, people too easily led off of God's intentioned path results in people lumping all "Christians" into one lot of deceivers.  Sad, they are not all like that.  It's why I Hate society's term and peoples misconception purposely perpetuated by evil doers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Throw Jesus under the bus.  What a farce.  Jesus wants no part of these people's attempts to put Him in a box.  He works the way He wants and Sees All!
              </p>
              <p>
               TIME IS UP for the Fakers!

                Im glad to see that there are others who think just as strongly as I do about the matter.
Its interesting that you talked about Smithsonian and giant bones..  Im actively following up on Giants at this precise moment...
It's completly irrevelant who I am, and what I believe.
Just going to say these following things...  They ARE going to shock.. Im just stating them, without judgement.
Just to show who we went from Gods and Baals to Yehu.. nope.. his name is YEHU.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to biblical canon.  Lucifer never touched a child.  He cant seeing as, if he were a Seraphim, 'it' has no genitals.
Lucifer never talked about pedophilia.....(and God never throw him into 'Hell', he walked the Earth and ended up being Melquart the Patron-God of Tyre.)
               </p>
               <p>
                However.. if you go far enough back in time, you'll come across a Mesopotomian God called Enlil.  Who..(if you've read the texts) met his wife to be by a river, tried to seduce her, she said no because she was too young and couldnt take his mighty penis (yeh they say soemthing along those lines..) so he kidnapped her on a boat and raped her...Take into account.. not even a God can get away with Pedophilia and Enlil was punished by his peers...NOT EVEN A GOD CAN ESCAPE JUSTICE FROM PEDOPHILIA..  now we just have child raping priests who cover each over up as tightly as Freemasons...
               </p>
               <p>
                Enlil is essentially (this is a over simplification.. but I cant be bothered linking everything relevant to the family structure and geo-politics of Sumer and Akkad.. either you can believe me or you dont) the God who spoke to Abraham.
The Gods used to be giants called Ba'als - (important!! - its an epithet, it isnt a proper noun), who were actively worshipped at the start of Isreal by Solomon..(who had help from the King of Tyre at the time if I remember correctly..)
I take it that the Topheth was built by Solomon..following the traditions and wishes of his personal army of women...This movement by Solomon was no doubt to some extent a political one, but it made the worship of Chemosh a part of the religious life of Israel for nearly 400 year until the reform of Josiah.

                I Kings 11:1-43
"5) For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites. 6) Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not follow the LORD fully, as David his father had done. 7) Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab, on the mountain which is east of Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon. 8) Thus also he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods."
               </p>
               <p>
                II Kings 23:13
13 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.

                Then the massacre started in earnest with Dan and the tale of Daniel and Bel (again, it's epithet)  Once the Gods were gone, the Isrealites massacred the priest classes in Babylonia and Assyria to instigate monotheism. 
Again.. Im only giving conclusions and I cant be bothered linking to the source books (its friday for fucks sake) which are mostly old musuem books by dead people that you can get yourself from www.archive.org because no one bothers to go looking at them anyway..

                According to the Book of Enoch, exactly 200 Watchers fell to Earth to take human wives. It names 20 of these, explaining that each one was a leader in a group of 10. There is no complete record of the names of all 200 Watchers.  The Nephilim were the offspring of the "sons of God" and the "daughters of men" before the Deluge, according to Genesis 6:1–4.  The Heb. nefilim means literally "the fallen ones" and the strict translation into Greek would be peptokotes, which in fact appears in the Septuagint of Ezekiel 32:22-27
From the third century BCE onwards, references are found in the Enochic literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls (the Genesis Apocryphon, the Damascus Document, 4Q180), Jubilees, the Testament of Reuben, 2 Baruch, Josephus, and the book of Jude (compare with 2 Peter 2). For example: 1 Enoch 7:2 "And when the angels,  the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamoured of them, saying to each other, Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children.
According to the texts, the first of the Nephilim to have such prophetic dreams was Mahway, the Titan son of the angel Barakel. According to his dream, a huge tablet was submerged under water, as the tablet surfaces only three names are left.
The Nephilim were unsure about the meanings of their dreams, and they spent time debating what Mahway had dreamed. However, they were unsuccessful in interpreting the meaning. Not long passed and two more Giants Ohya and Hahya, the sons of the fallen angel Shemyaza began having similar dreams: Ohya and Hahya dreamed a tree being uprooted all except three of its root.

Most of the content in the Book of Giants is derived out of 1 Enoch 7:3-6

                In Deut. 3:11 and later in the book of Numbers and Joshua, Og is called the last of the Rephaim. Rephaim is a Hebrew word for giants. Deut. 3:11 declares that his "bedstead" (translated in some texts as "sarcophagus") of iron is "nine cubits in length and four cubits in width", which is 13.5 ft by 6 ft according to the standard cubit of a man. It goes on to say that at the royal city of Rabbah of the Ammonites, his giant bedstead could still be seen as a novelty at the time the narrative was written. If the giant king's bedstead was built in proportion to his size as most beds are, he may have been between 9 and 13 feet in height. However, later Rabbinic tradition has it, that the length of his bedstead was measured with the cubits of Og himself... Relative to today :

               <p>
                Anakim were described as a race of giants, descended from Anak. They were said to have lived in the southern part of the land of Canaan, near Hebron
According to Genesis 14:5-6 they inhabited the region later known as Edom and Moab in the days of Abraham. Their name may come from a Hebrew root meaning "necklace" or "neck-chain"  (perhaps for the chain used to chain up slaves?)
Their formidable appearance, as described by the Twelve Spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. The Israelites seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the giants of the antediluvian age. Joshua finally expelled them from the land, except for some that found a refuge in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod (Joshua 11:22), thus the Philistine giants (Goliath) whom David encountered (2 Samuel 21:15-22 ) were descendants of the Anakim.

                So.. basically.. you go from Lots of Giants, becoming known as Ba'als, getting slaughtered by the local human scum and the Priests dedicated to worshipping Giants turning to Statues and eventually wooden crosses (which are a sign for Tammuz, who was called Dumuzi, who was supposedly a son of Marduk.. Relevance : The Isrealites wrote the Talmud in Babylon.. . . Christians didnt even bother with crosses until after the council of Nicae.
Early Christians were more interested in Leviathan (and the Book of Jonah..) than they were about a dying and resurrecting 'son of a god' and how he died on a wooden T for TAMMUZ  Here..

                 Now I do want to be clear.  You and I, as most people this is the case,  will Never agree on all.  I don't judge, I don't criticize, I understand people will never agree 100%.
                </p>

                 I say that because I agree with some of what you say, not all and I mean no offense whatsoever, neither would I dare to demand someone believe like me or stop talking to them just because they have a different set of beliefs or opinions.

                <p>
                 If you're willing to talk, so am I.  I believe in personal choice and so does the one true God I serve.

                <p>
                 My point was. . .those churches serve Satan when they are involved in this Catholics or Any denomination not furthering God's concepts, but satan's and their own selfish greed or self serving acts Whether it be pedophile activity, tricking people into increasing their coffers, building lavish buildings and dwellings not just for Catholic leaders (who I am Not sticking up for as I'm not Catholic) but this encompasses those who Think they are The Church and are not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is a remnant. . .the church is not a building or a denomination. . .It is a Group of Called people carrying out the Exposure of a deep seated ancient evil that continues to thrive today.
                </p>
                <p>
                 God is Exposing these False churches NOW!
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Angel Michael was the restrainer. . .No More.  Evil has ramped up for a reason.  Satan and those who serve him are continuing in their free reign, running amuck wreaking havoc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No satan who was Lucifer as God's most beautiful angel is not engaging in the actual acts, but IS promoting through the Very Same tactics he used to trick Adam and Eve into disobeying God.  This is All satanic and Not from God.
                </p>
                <p>
                 God Did Not create nor Condone the Catholic church.  These sanctimonious leaders are No Different than the Sadducees and Pharisees God called out as Hypocrites.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are One and the Same.  Just because they

                  say
                 </strong>
                 they come from God, doesn't make it so.  Satan did the same thing Over and Over. . .appearing as a light or angel, Nothing angelic about him once he tried to usurp God's authority.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Satan has access to people who give him access, so do the demons which Jesus while on earth cast out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Osiris story shows up across the board under different names. .. but similar story.  It was Usurped from the one true God, who is made up of three parts which humans cannot wrap their brain around because all knowledge has not been revealed.  We can choose to believe our Creator whose image we are created after, Or we can listen to Satan, who already tricked Adam and Eve who allowed sin to enter the world.  Once that happened, there was No Safe place from Satan's domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are right the Earth is where satan was cast down into.  He prefers the dark inner parts.  There is a reason the dark side celebrates all that lies below.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Once sin entered the world, satan and his minions as demons including those who allow him to influence them do all they can to harm and destroy humanity.  They encourage humans to prey upon one another.  They try to take people's peace away.  They strive to cause conflict, chaos, wars. . .yes, from the dawn of teaching humankind how to break matter down, so they could learn how to create aniti matter. . .satan absolutely has used humans as cohorts.  Are these humans he selects from the fallen bloodline.  Yes, not exclusive to.

                  6:1 Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, 2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.  3 And the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years."  4 There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them.  Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.

                <p>
                 Some believe sons of God meant the offspring of Seth (notice Seth close to Set the ancient deceivers used for their stories to confuse), Seth was close to God, not taken up into heaven while alive like Enoch, but nevertheless, he walked with God.  Cain and his offspring were not.  They were followers of satan's agenda.  I could source All of this, but as you said it's Friday.. .long week and we are all still working right.  So those who don't believe it, pick up a Bible and then realize satan's hidden a bunch of books from you.

                 At any rate. . .back to common sense where it clearly states,

                <p>
                 You are correct about size.  Also verified by the military, but kept under wraps as they didn't want civilians to know that orchestrated war going on over there in Afghanistan wasn't just about the Poppies Bush and his elite cronies including the medical industry wanted to keep control of to pad pockets and keep as many Americans addicted which we all know = under their thumb, no, satan likes to kill two birds with one stone so we have. . .

                  According to one of the interviews in the program, a Special Forces team operating in Afghanistan in 2002 encountered one of the creatures while on a patrol looking for a lost unit in an isolated part of the country. The soldier tells Marzulli his unit made its way along a goat path near a cave where the team noticed an unusual pattern of rocks, bones, and, ominously, a broken piece of communications equipment of the type used by the American military.

                  While pondering this, the team was surprised by a man “at least twelve to fifteen feet in height.” The creature had long, red hair and skewered one operator, identified as “Dan,” with a pike-like weapon. The remainder of the team opened fire, repeatedly shooting the creature in the face and eventually killing it. The full length of the engagement was only 30 seconds.

                 Look at how those monoliths were built in South America, the crystalizing of the stonework and how there was no mortar used to lock stones into place.

                   In Deut. 3:11 and later in the book of Numbers and Joshua, Og is called the last of the Rephaim. Rephaim is a Hebrew word for giants. Deut. 3:11 declares

                  <p>
                   that his "bedstead" (translated in some texts as "sarcophagus") of iron is "nine cubits in length and four cubits in width", which is 13.5 ft by 6 ft
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   according to the standard cubit of a man.

                  <p>
                   It is noteworthy that the region north of the river Jabbok, or Bashan, "the land of Rephaim", contains hundreds of megalithic stone tombs (dolmen) dating
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   from the 5th to 3rd millennia BC. In 1918, Gustav Dalman discovered in the neighborhood of Amman, Jordan (Amman is built on the ancient city of Rabbah of
                  </p>

                  <p>
                   A possible connection to Og and the Rephaim kings of Bashan can also be made with the much older Canaanite Ugaritic text KTU 1.108 from the 13th century

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   to the cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei in the Bible, and with which king Og is expressly said to have ruled from (Deuteronomy 1:4; Joshua 9:10; 12:4; 13:12,

                  <p>
                   31). The clay tablet from Ugarit KTU 1.108 reads in whole, "May Rapiu, King of Eternity, drink [w]ine, yea, may he drink, the powerful and noble [god], the

                   Isis was one of the last of the ancient Egyptian gods to still be worshipped. In the Greco-Roman period she was identified with the Greek goddess Aphrodite and her cult spread as far west as Great Britain and as far east as Afghanistan. It is believed that depictions of Isis with the infant Horus influenced Christian imagery of Mary with the infant Jesus.

                   Depicted as a falcon or as a man with a falcon’s head, Horus was a sky god associated with war and hunting. He was also the embodiment of the divine kingship, and in some eras the reigning king was considered to be a manifestation of Horus.

                  <p>
                   According to the Osiris myth, Horus was the son of Isis and Osiris, magically conceived after the murder of Osiris by his brother Seth. Horus was raised to avenge his father’s murder. One tradition holds that Horus lost his left eye fighting with Seth, but his eye was magically healed by the god Thoth. Because the right and left eyes of Horus were associated, respectively, wit

                  <p>
                   respectively, with the sun and the moon, the loss and restoration of Horus’s left eye gave a mythical explanation for the phases of the moon.

                   Seth was the god of chaos, violence, deserts, and storms. In the Osiris myth, he is the murderer of Osiris (in some versions of the myth, he tricks Osiris into laying down in a coffin and then seals it shut.)

                  In other words many different versions dependent on culture.  For God's story one version in the bible, but many try to co-opt it and change it for their self serving needs.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There are many False gods. . .but only One True God.  Because satan's goal is to confuse, confound and lead as many people astray as possible, he tricks people into believing his lies and the lies of those who serve him.  Satan is their god, thus they believe in many gods just as Chelsea and her mother Hillary wear an upside down cross. ..that's satanism and they're signaling to the other followers their allegiance to satan.

                  God tries to tell us Just how wicked satan is.  Am I saying these pedos and other globalists who prey on the people are not responsible for their actions. . .NO, They ARE responsible.

                  </strong>
                  to do it.  God is All about choices, not forcing, that is why he doesn't Stop.  He created us to be independent thinkers and wants us to listen to truth rather than deception.  Those people. . .pedos, murderers, etc serve satan rather they admit it or not.  God says satan is their father.

                   Just because it is in the Bible and even When some who are of God, know and trust the One true God, doesn't mean they always Obey.  This is Not a reflection on God, it is a reflection on mankind and the choices he or she are allowed to make.

                   Think about that "temple" on Epstein's Island in an attempt to mimic Solomon's temple.  Who paganized?  Who chose to do rituals and abuse not patterned after God's ways, but rather satan's ways?   What is all of that symbolism?  Is it in the Bible or is it the Cabals, mystery religion concepts of talmud and other Kabalistic styled books distorting and re-writing what really happened to enoch.

                    "Satan hates God". . . .Havent heard that one before.. where did you get that idea from?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Job 1:6-7
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. 7 The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is generally believed by scholars that the ancient Iranian prophet Zarathustra (known in Persian as Zartosht and Greek as Zoroaster) lived sometime
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    between 1500 and 1000 BC. Prior to Zarathustra, the ancient Persians worshipped the deities of the old Irano-Aryan religion, a counterpart to the Indo-Aryan
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    religion that would come to be known as Hinduism. Zarathustra, however, condemned this practice, and preached that God alone – Ahura Mazda, the Lord of
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Wisdom – should be worshipped.
There were two religious parties in the days of Zoroaster: the worshippers of the daêvas or nature-gods, and the worshippers of Ahura, the Lord. Zoroaster
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    appears in the Gathas as a priest of the highest rank who became the leader of the Ahura party. Zoroaster not only degraded the old nature-gods, the daêvas,
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    into demons,but also regarded them as representatives of a fiendish power which he called Angrô Mainyush, or Ahriman, which means "the evil spirit," and
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Druj,  i. e., falsehood. The Scythians in the plains of Northern Asia, the most dangerous neighbors of Persia, worshipped their highest deity under the
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    symbol of a serpent, and it was natural that the snake, the god of the enemy, became identified with the archfiend Ahriman.
"Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall not eat
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    from any tree of the garden’?"
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The concepts of Heaven and Hell, Judgment Day and the final revelation of the world, and angels and demons all originated in the teachings of Zarathustra, as
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    well as the later canon of Zoroastrian literature they inspired. Even the idea of Satan is a fundamentally Zoroastrian one; in fact, the entire faith of
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Zoroastrianism is predicated on the struggle between God and the forces of goodness and light (represented by the Holy Spirit, Spenta Manyu) and Ahriman, who
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    presides over the forces of darkness and evil. While man has to choose to which side he belongs, the religion teaches that ultimately, God will prevail, and
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    even those condemned to hellfire will enjoy the blessings of Paradise (an Old Persian word).  Many of these concepts were introduced to the Jews of Babylon
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    upon being liberated by the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great. They trickled into mainstream Jewish thought, and figures like Beelzebub emerged. And after
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Persia’s conquests of Greek lands during the heyday of the Achaemenid Empire.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The traditional claim that the Jews learned monotheism from the Zoroastrians during the Babylonian captivity can be disputed by the fact that by that time
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Zoroaster's strict monotheism had been compromised by polytheistic practices. The famous inscriptions of Darius, although mentioning the supreme God Ahura
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Mazda on almost every line, nonetheless refer twice to “other gods which are".
It was not so much monotheism that the exilic Jews learned from the Persians as it was universalism, the belief that one God rules universally and will save
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    not only the Jews but all those who turn to God.  This universalism does not appear explicitly until Second Isaiah, which by all scholarly accounts except
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    some fundamentalists, was written during and after the Babylonian exile.  The Babylonian captivity was a great blow to many Jews, because they were taken out
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    of Yahweh's divine jurisdiction.  Early Hebrews believed that their prayers could not be answered in a foreign land.  The sophisticated angelology of late
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    books like Daniel has its source in Zoroastrianism.
The angels of the early Hebrew books were disguises of Yahweh or one of his subordinate deities.  The idea of separate angels appears only after contact with
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Zoroastrianism.
The central ideas of heaven and a fiery hell appear to come directly from the Israelite contact with Iranian religion.  Pre-exilic books are explicit in
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    their notions the afterlife:  there is none to speak of. The early Hebrew concept is that all of us are made from the dust and all of us return to the dust.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There is a shadowy existence in Sheol, but the beings there are so insignificant that Yahweh does not know them
The fiery judgment and immortality mentioned in Ps. 21:9-10 has also been used to support the idea of an advanced eschatology in the psalms.
The Canaanite parallels show that God makes the king, not any other human, immortal.  Furthermore, those who are burned are the king's foes, not all the
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    wicked; and the burning furnace is probably the mouth of Yahweh and not any burning Hell
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Some say that the Hebrew ge-hinnom is fiery hell independent of Persian influences.  But all references to ge-hinnom refer explicitly to a definite
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    geographic place, the valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem.  The only eschatological implications we can find are in Jer. 7:31ff, where Jeremiah predicts that
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    the Lord will destroy the place and it will be used for the disposal of dead bodies.  This is obviously not the place of fiery torment of the New Testament
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    gehenna, which was definitely influenced by Zoroastrian eschatology.  Even an evangelical scholar admits that gehenna a place of eternal torment is a late
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    concept, probably first century B.C.E.
Saosyant, a savior born from Zoroaster's seed, will come and the dead shall be resurrected, body and soul.  As the final accounting is made, husband is set
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    against wife and brother against brother as the righteous and the damned are pointed out by the divine judge Saosyant.  Personal and individual immortality
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    is offered to the righteous; and, as a final fire melts away the world and the damned, a kingdom of God is established for a thousand years.
Satan as the adversary or Evil One does not appear in the pre-exilic Hebrew books.  In Job, one of the very oldest books, Satan is one of the subordinate
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    deities in God's pantheon.  Here Satan is God's agent, and God gives him permission to persecute Job.  The Zoroastrian Angra Mainyu, the Evil One, the
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    eternal enemy of God, is the prototype for late Jewish and Christian ideas of Satan.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In 1 Chron. 21:1 (a book with heavy Persian influences), the Hebrew word satan appears for the first time as a proper name without an article.  Before the
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    exile, Satan was not a separate entity per se, but a divine function performed by the Yahweh's subordinate deities (sons of God) or by Yahweh himself.  For
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    example, in Num.  22:22 Yahweh, in the guise of mal'ak Yahweh, is “a satan” for Balaam and his ass.  The editorial switch from God inciting David to take a
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    census in 2 Sam 24:1, and a separate evil entity with the name “Satan” doing the same deed in 1 Chron. 21:1 is the strongest evidence that there was a
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    radical transformation in Jewish theology.  Something must have caused this change, and religious syncretism with Persia is the probable cause.
 There is no question that the concept of a separate evil principle was fully developed in the Zoroastrian Gathas (ca. 1,000 B.C.E.).  The principal demon,
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    called Druj (the Lie), is mentioned 66 times in the Gathas.  But the priestly Jews would also have been exposed to the full Avestan scripture in which Angra
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Mainyu is mentioned repeatedly.  His most prominent symbol is the serpent, so along with the idea of the “Lie,” we have the prototype for the
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    serpent/tempter, in the priestly writers' garden of Genesis.

                     The Bible calls satan out many times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I realize not all will choose to believe in the Bible and make that choice to believe other texts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I firmly believe people are free to make choices as does God, but He Is very clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Many Israelites did indeed turn away from their teachings, many embraced the mystery religions.  That was a bad choice, but none the less. . .their choice to make as God does not force people's hearts to turn to Him.  He didn't want puppets, He wanted people to choose His ways willingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Call him Satan, the devil, lucifer, deceiver, liar. . .he comes under many names and those who are part of the remnant do battle with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     By testimony of former satantists who got out. . .he Does indeed exist and despises All God offers to his most loved creation. . .humans formed after God's own image.

                    <p>
                     Satan wasn't formed after God's own image.

                    <p>
                     I despise all religions as their are based on false statements made in some cases by men purposely attempting to lead people down a path of destruction; in other cases by people too easily deceived.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In the same manner there are many sheep led astray in society and even in these 501c3 churches that have elements of good, but their end will be the same if they don't know the way to their Creator and true Salvation.

                    <p>
                     As for hell. . .
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>
                      Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                     Very clear what hell is.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>
                      Revelation 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                     As noted earlier God calls the devil satan among various other names like serpent and beast.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>
                      <p>
                       Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
                      </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      <p>
                       Matthew10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
                      </p>
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                     So the body Will be destroyed in hell.  It is No Paradise of Any sort, I assure you.
                    </p>

                     He speaks of
                     <strong>
                      Eternal Fire
                     </strong>

                      Jude 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                     Definitely talking about on ongoing burning fire,
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>
                      Revelation 19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                     This is So important about what we know of hell, notice he repeats it in two verses very close together,

                    <p>
                     42 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

                    <p>

                    <p>
                     45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
                    </p>
                    <p>

                     47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

                    <p>
                     So many believe that God he is All love and there is no satan.  God tempers mercy with justice.

                     He gave a way out, but many refuse to accept it, think they are smarter without His gift of salvation and do all they can to prove it wrong.

                     That is their choice and sadly will lead to their own destruction as the bible is Very Clear.

                     Most have heard this before, I assure you it is Nothing to scoff at or take for granted.  There is a window of time, but some Will Choose Not to Believe.

                    <p>
                     Now to be clear, God wishes for None to perish, but as stated before, people make their own choices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Many Will Remain in Open Rebellion even though God made sure they hear the truth, the way to be saved from this damnation of hell and torment, some will choose to listen to that crafty deceiver. . .God considers satan their father.  They are the ones choosing the deception over the Truth!  God isn't confusing as All these other mystery religions and false "christianity" where they mix in with the world and think it's Cool to be a Christian.  What garbage.

                      You're very well versed and you have interesting points, as I've tried to explain, the book you're pointing to is a copy of older parables and copies of battles and ideas from an older (perhaps more civilised) time, the ideas contained within were nothing new, even when it was written in aramaic.
                      <br/>
                      The Angels that are praised today, were just as praised and in exactly the same way, when they were called Baals.  Please, do read this, its an excellent article on Tas Mikal (MKL meaning King, Owner Messanger) and how we got to Saint Micheal.

                      Once again the term "christian" is a societal construct meant to confuse.  Not saying I don't support their rights, it's more about knowing and trusting The Plan of a Creator over the deception of satan and man made churches ( at least the many not following God's ways and under the 501c3).

                      2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

                      8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

                      9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

                      12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

                     <p>

                     Even more visibly, the relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (&lt; 10%) is essential to integrated circuits — most computers, cell phones, and modern technology depend on it.

                    Silicon is an essential element in biology, although only traces are required by animals. However, various sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica.

                    A silicon atom has fourteen electrons.

                   <p>
                    Silicon has
                    <strong>
                     a small energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band).
                    </strong>
                    The Fermi level is about halfway between the valence and conduction bands and
                    <strong>
                     is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not.
                    </strong>
                    Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That gap is important.  Think. . .anti matter.

Bill Gates???
Ok.. so sorry for the slight tangent.. but (just in case someone is following this and needs context..and sorry for the wall of text..)
The Rockefeller Foundation was the front organization for a new global business venture of Rockefeller and his accomplices. This new venture was called the pharmaceutical investment business.  These institutions had become missionaries of a new breed of companies: the manufacturers of patented, synthetic drugs.
The Rockefeller Foundation uses the Spanish flu epidemic – and the media (that it already controlled by this time) – to start a witch-hunt on all forms of medicine that were not covered by its patents.  Within the next 15 years, all medical schools in the U.S., most hospitals and the American Medical Association all essentially became pawns on the chessboard of Rockefeller’s strategy to subjugate the entire health care sector under the monopoly of his pharmaceutical investment business.  On the other side of the Atlantic, in Germany, the first chemical / pharmaceutical cartel is founded in order to compete with Rockefeller’s quest for control of the global drug market. Lead by the German multinationals Bayer, BASF and Hoechst, the I.G. Farben cartel was founded.  1942-45 : In order to cement its global leadership with patented drugs, the I.G. Farben cartel tests its patented pharmaceutical substances on concentration camp inmates in Auschwitz, Dachau and many other sites..  1945 : The corporate shares of the losers, I.G. Farben, went to the Rockefeller trust (U.S.A.) and Rothschild / J.P. Morgan (U.K.).  1947 . In the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal, 24 managers from Bayer, BASF, Hoechst and other executives of the I.G. Farben cartel were tried for crimes against humanity. These crimes included: leading wars of aggression, instituting slavery and committing mass murder. In his final pleading, U.S.-Chief Prosecutor Telford Taylor summarized the crimes committed by these corporate criminals with the following words: “Without I.G. Farben, the second World War would not have been possible”.  Amazingly, the real culprits for the death of 60 Million people in World War II – the I.G. Farben executives – received the mildest verdicts. Even those executives directly responsible for the crimes in I.G. Auschwitz only received a maximum of twelve years in jail. Surprised? You shouldn’t be, you see.. By 1944 Nelson Rockefeller had already entered the executive branch of the U.S. government. He started off as Under-Secretary of State and ended up a few years later as Special Adviser of President Truman for Special Affairs. In other words, at critical junctures of the 20th century, the Rockefeller interests took direct charge. They decided the post war shape of the world and the distribution of its wealth.  As such, under the influence of the U.S. State Department, the verdicts in Nuremberg against the I.G. Farben managers can easily be explained. In return for taking over the corporate shares of I.G. Farben, and thereby global control of the oil and drug business, Nelson Rockefeller made sure that the real culprits of World War II were not hanged.
The role of the Rockefeller brothers was not limited to their taking over the global monopolies of the oil and drug businesses. They also needed to create the political framework for these businesses to thrive. Under their influence, therefore, the United Nations was founded in 1945, in San Francisco.

If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it." (italics and underline added - ed)

                       Initially the inner core of the secret society was called "The Circle of Initiates," the second tier was "The Association of Helpers," from 1901 to 1910 the third tier was called "Milner's Kindergarden," and from 1910 to 1920 it was called "The Round Table" or "the Group." The following year (1921) the cabal established the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States and branches of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) in the Commonwealth nations.  Fifty-two years later (1973) the covert movement established the Trilateral Commission.
Does the Trilateral Commission (and the CFR) control the U.S. government today? Yes. Between 1977 and 2008, every president and/or vice president of the United States was a member of the Trilateral Commission: i.e. Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Dick Cheney. In addition, during the twenty-one year period (prior to 2009): six of the eight presidents of the World Bank were members of the TC, eight of the 10 U.S. Trade representatives were members of the TC, seven of the twelve secretaries of state were members of the TC, nine of the twelve secretaries of defense were members of the TC, and most of the other key positions in the Republican and Democrat administrations were held by members of the CFR. At the present time TC members hold 11-12 key positions in the Obama Administration, and most of the other key positions are held by members of the CFR.

Nancy Pelosi worked with Congress on the basis of Agenda 21 of the United Nation's Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, and House Joint Resolution 166 to pave the way for the Presidio to be available to such entities as Gorbachev's. Working with Pelosi, John Murtha played a key role in working with US Navy officials, Pelosi's nephew and PRESIDIO PARTNERS to ultimately bring about Gorbachev's tenancy at the Presidio

                       Gorbachev’s "Brain Trust": The New World Order gang
It is important for the uninitiated observer to understand that the Socialist New World Order is not being assimilated by so much officialdom (legally commissioned governmental agencies). More often, it is being fabricated by foundations, non-governmental organizations, academia and agents of behind-the-scenes secret societies, referred to by Malachi Martin as "the Capstone" (a term referring to the Luciferic "Illuminati" types, whose diabolic schemes have been evolving for centuries).
