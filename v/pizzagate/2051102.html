<p>So what do pizza and Christianity have in common? Meal is another name for flour, in this verse leavening is added to it. </p>
<p>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.
(Matthew 13:33)</p>
<p>Flour without leavening was a sin offering:</p>
<p>But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.
(Leviticus 5:11)</p>
<p>Flour and leavening are of course the main ingredients in bread:</p>
<p>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

            IMO the differences between the Abrahamic traditions are sufficient to solve the problem. Why do you think that the Rig Vedas are so important?

            Sorry for not replying earlier. I have no interest in pushing the argument that the cult is the bloodline of Jesus. I recognize that the facts support that possibility, but there's another reason for the secrecy surrounding the Priory of Sion. My argument begins with the heuristic that apparent contradictions are indicators that significant information has been suppressed. The contradictions begin with the
            <a href="https://bible.org/article/synoptic-problem">
             synoptic problem
            </a>
            and the contradictions relating the three accounts of the
            <a href="http://torah.clonehost.net/jonah.html">
             sign of Jonah
            </a>
            . The doctrine of the virgin birth is another one, the prophecy referred to by the gospels doesn't mention a virgin. This is compounded by the doctrine of perpetual virginity, which doesn't have good historical support. Then there's the problem of the timing of the "star". Astronomical events were considered to be signs, so it's reasonable to think that a triple conjunction would be considered to be significant by "wise men". However the timing of the this event isn't consistent with the traditional date of December 25. Then there's the problem with the resurrection timeline, which is compounded by the contradictions relating to the sign of Jonah. The main problem with the resurrection timeline is that the gospel accounts don't support the three days and nights as described by the gospels. Beyond this there is the theological problem that causing an innocent man to be tortured to death isn't consistent with the principleds of justice described by Judaism.

            The thing with Mary Magdeline and the Priory of Sion has some support from the Bible though, from the suffering servant prophecy (seed means descendants):

           <p>
            Yet it pleased YHWH to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of YHWH shall prosper in his hand.

            Here's the bee in the Merovingian king's symbol (also Star of David, hexagon).
           </p>

           <p>
            Bees feature as part of Sampson's riddle (Sampson's adversaries worshiped Dagon, the fish-god):
           </p>
           <p>
            And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. (Judges 14:8)
           </p>
           <p>
            Bees use hexagons to construct their hives and there's a hexagon at the south pole of Saturn, which is the sixth planet from the sun. Saturn/Chronos as a mythical figure connects back to pizzagate, since according to the myth Chronos was a cannibal who ate his own children. Eating one's own children was part of a curse from the Bible:
           </p>
           <p>
            And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
(Leviticus 26:29, also Deuteronomy 28:53, Jeremiah 19:9, Ezekiel 5:10)

            On this, your night of grace, O holy Father,
accept this candle, a solemn offering,
the work of bees and of your servants’ hands,
an evening sacrifice of praise,

            Occult knowledge has always been treated with suspicious, and there's a good reason for the taboo surrounding black magic. But knowledge itself isn't good or bad, unless perhaps you're talking about the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This connects back to pizza via the living bread of John 6:51 via the other tree of the garden, the tree of life.

            In the scientific paradigm there's no reason to think that these associations have any meaning, there's no theoretically testable mechanism. If you accept that the associations are meaningful, then that leads to the question of how does the world work, such that these things are possible?

            Yeah, ordinarily I wouldn't bother but some of the posters here seem to be picking up on the religious significance of pizzagate. Christianity doesn't have a very good understanding of satanism, it connects with sacrifice from the oldest book in the Bible, the book of Job.

            Also the fish connects with the country of New Zealand. There's a legend that that North Island was a great fish that was caught by Maui. It does look a bit like a  fish. Also the capital of New Zealand has a government building called the beehive, because of its shape. Bees feature in the Catholic exsultset and in connection with the Merovingians.
