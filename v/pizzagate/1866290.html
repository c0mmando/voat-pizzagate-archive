<p>Since Voat is one of the few places left where free speech is not a wish but reality, we urge you to donate. A small amount of 5 to 10 Dollars on a regular basis could do it, provided the Voat community can activate enough users.
<a href="https://store.voat.co/donations">https://store.voat.co/donations</a></p>
<p><strong>Questions we hope to answer shortly:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to donate anonymously if you don’t have bitcoins or a prepaid credit card?</p>
<p>How do donate a larger sum than 50 Dollars? EDIT: Easy. To donate 200 $ just &quot;buy&quot; four 50 $ donations at once.</p>

<p>At $5 a pop, 1,320 Goat Horns would need bought for the usage costs.</p>
<p>At $20/month for 5 Goat Horns + to-be-released-benefits, only 330 goats would need to subscribe.</p>
<p>Have a system-run subverse that can hit &quot;all&quot; where GHd comments and submissions are on display, and instead of, or in addition to the highlighted subverse, have the top GHd comment/submission on the front of /all no matter what for X amount of time.</p>
<p>For $50/month have your username made a different color for your posts/comments so people can see that you heavily support voat without having to click on your username.</p>
<p>Only 132 goats would need to subscribe to that for the month\'s costs. Maybe another one for 100? 66 goats.</p>
<p>Some combination of all of these would likely work to bring us close to server-cost levels.</p>

<p>As I sit here about to write one of the most difficult announcements yet, I was just reminded that my account is one month shy of three years old. Nearly three years ago I came here from Reddit when the vote counts disappeared and I felt I could no longer trust what I saw. Nearly three years ago I met <a href="https://voat.co/user/Atko">@Atko</a> and started contributing code because I believed in him, his mission, and what he was doing. So much has happened during these last three years.</p>
<p>I know a lot of you are new, but Voat has been through a wild ride, and never at any point was it an easy one. My memories are bittersweet when it comes to Voat. I’ve sacrificed the best years of my life for Voat, I’ve lost my business partner whom I miss a lot, I’ve lost people in my life, I’ve given up golf which was my passion, and even with all this I still believe in Voat. I still see the dire need for Free Speech in this world, I fear a world without it, and I still will do anything I can to continue providing it.</p>
<p>But alas, I am powerless to keep Voat running without financial support. As of right now Voat has no solid commitments. Voat has always needed a financial partner whom had balls of steel and backing deep enough to give Voat the capabilities to run as an actual business (being able to hire staff and set itself apart from its competitors), not just a one man show. Potential investors have one or the other of these traits, but we have yet to find one with both. In this day and age, this is Voat’s unicorn.</p>
<p>In the past Voat has been lucky enough to be part of special programs designed for startup companies which gave us free licensing on various products and significantly reduced hosting costs. These programs have since expired and we are now paying full costs. Last month was our first non-discounted month on Azure and the usage was $6,600.90 USD. Donations, ads, and merchandise only put a dent in this and this is the primary reason why we have not launched another merchandise run. And begging for donations was always something we hated doing.</p>
<p>I’m writing this announcement to prepare this community, and the Voat family, for the possibility of a closure. I’m not certain on timing and I have too much invested in this place to give up just yet, so I cannot provide any timelines. In the meantime, I will soon be scaling back all Voat’s servers by at least 50%. I will also turn off some features that are resource intensive.</p>
<p>Voat needs funding. Without it, Voat will be no more.

            also the goat is branding suicide. Why not do something like a coin or just set up the donation process so it gives some sort of confirmation like an achievement notification on xbox live. That goats gonna stall your donation drive out REAL quick.

             I'm simply blown away with you goats. I was expecting a somber farewell in this thread but instead you've done the exact opposite; pulled off a rally at the bottom of the 9th. On a personal note, and this may seem sentimental, but you have given me a new hope for Voat at very dark time for me.
            </p>
            <p>
             All I can say now is: Let's do this! I think your message is clear. We have a ton of work to do, a short window in which to do it, and I fully understand I can't do it alone. We will need all hands on deck if Voat is to have any chance at survival.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will post the plans I have for Voat as well as a status update on your contributions by Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.S. Old goats, be nice to the new kids. ;)

            I thought VOAT was open source, what is Voat doing on Microsoft Azure? Maybe you can migrate Voat to another service provider that is more reasonable instead of asking for over $6000 dollars a month from well-intentioned users?

            Plus there are of course many many blogs as well as some sub reddits that function.   I found these in my wanderings without making a concerted effort.  There are probaby many other boards, free and clear of strings attached, that would welcome this community.  Stop waiting to be herded around!  Use your own networks you've developed here.

              voat is pretty much a Jew-hub. That's assumed for a public forum. Just look at what happened with 8ch.net They were collecting data lol.

              I can find "the post" on 8ch.pl if you want.

             I looked up your post. I would have removed it too. The fact that he is a Dallas employee does in no way show that he is connected to the elite. I don't see a network mention of some kind either. And no clues to child trafficking. You would need to do some digging and come up with something to that account. Peace.

            Has anyone backed up the important posts here?  Maybe the "Executive Summary" etc should be posted over at reddit on Pedogate sub although that could be taken down to at moment's notice.  Anyway.  Hope the internet provides back up options to this work somehow.

            Hang on?! If all images are hosted elsewhere and this is essentially a text based threaded database. Then why does it cost over $6000 per month to host this site? 
Isnt there other ways of doing this?
Is it a security thing? Is that why it's so expensive?
Im curious.

            Im donating using a debit card that is in my name. It doesn't matter. "They" know who I am.. I don't use TOR and even that is compromised.. VPNs don't work either.. I'm guessing most of us on here will already be linked to our true online identities via our browsing habits and the fact that the CIA has had malware that bypasses all antivirus software for over a decade.. 
If you think you are anonymous on here then dont kid yourself. If they want to know who you are then they know who you are.
Heck I could find many of you just by using google and some basic IP snooping tools.
Unless your logging in at an internet cafe with no webcams installed and you never do anything else while on those sessions then they know you. but street cams could still give you away if you use the same place regularly. PROMIS software easily makes bread crumb trails and joins the dots automatically to know your online and offline habits. 
If you are using voat from your home pc or your own laptop then they know who you are. I don't even bother covering my webcam anymore because heck they know me already.

             I stopped worrying about anonymity a long time ago. I've been doing this since I was a kid. They don't give a fuck about you in particular. "They" are invincible until a critical proportion of people give a fuck.

            TIME TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE!!!!!
            <br/>
            What are we waiting for.  I'm in Philly.  Calling on  Pizzagate Howie to please contact me.  He is a leader as are most of you here on VOAT.

            It does not take a majority to prevail... but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of people.  Sam Adams.

            I wrote a song for the cause and have one on the way

            If we can start a charity organization with membership fees we can get stronger.   We can be a force.  We all have talents and resources.   Time to bring it together.   If there is someone out there that has the ability to put visual art to my audio files it would be greatly appreciated.

            This is BS. They should open source the code and let the main server die if they can't afford it. And if free speech is more important to them than profit. Don't throw a dime their way.

            Let's make sure everything's backed up, and then migrate to our own hosted wiki(s) (or any other open Voat-like CMS alternative). If we need to stay on the same page, we can look into mirroring/load balancing/RSS-ing each others' updates. I suspected something like this would happen. Let's decentralize to prevent it from happening again.

            Mistake #1 using MS servers. If you are smart enough to write code you should be able to setup a server cluster. The moment you rely on some other hosted hardware or financial backer is the moment free speech disappears.

This is the straw that breaks this camel's back. With this post I have lost every ounce of trust on this site. I look at the numerology 6600 and $.90 cents, anyone else see the irony? I would  call this a controlled demolition. You lured all the talent, all these amazing investigators to this page to only control the narrative and then shut them down in the end. That is the long and the short of it. Yes we do need A hero but not to save this corrupt site, instead to start a New site, where everyone can post comfortably and not worry about shills in control and censorship. Tata voat, ''twas fun  while it lasted. So please save us the sob story no one is buying it. SHMH

               has been wonderfully archiving and explaining. I don't even know if it works like Voat but the thought of some sort of blockchain to keep the evidence safe it sounds good to me. We definitely need to know what Plan B is. There is a lot of evidence and we can be certain the 50% of data they need to rid of is Pizzagate and we don't know how quickly it will be deleted.

            This forum is too important to  base a donation or funding mechanism on liking or disliking a particular moderator. Mods will come and go. When the moderator who impedes your contribution leaves, try your post again. In the meantime there is a mountain of material to work with as a basis for other postings that might pass that moderator's standards. I'm actually surprised at alot of stuff that does make into publication. Sometimes things just aren't fair but don't let that cause you to "throw the baby out with the bathwater"  There is a great dynamic here that needs to be maintained. Even a temporary disruption of this website for financial  restructuring could damage the momentum.  I urge you to express your support now even if you can't make a donation right away so that the owners of this site know  how vital this forum is to the participants and for the children served by this forum.

            Time to organize.   We shouldn't have to depend on Voat. 
I will donate.  This is a great platform that we need to keep alive, but best to organize now before we are forced to one day.   Also- if we can get enough members, we may be able to pull our resources together.   Donations to help victims come forward or a BIG FUCKING BILLBOARD on the D.C. beltway.   #pizzagate

            How about "arbitrarily" deciding what is and is not worthy like he is some god. And yet often leaves pure crap to linger on. Just today he removed my post about a Dallas city employee (read: Government) worker involved in fleet management (read: in charge of trafficking of shipments and/or vehicles that could be used for shipping) who was convicted of child pornography (read: child porn). So that's government, trafficking, child porn - just to be clear. He removed it based on rule 1 stating that it wasn't the "elite" (bc the elite drive their own shipments around, right?) and no evidence of child trafficking. Well, no shit, if I had hard evidence idve called, hell, I don't even know who one would call these days. But it's insight into how the "elites" might get their dirty jobs done. Enough dots to at least be worthy of mention. We aren't PIs. We give leads, we share info, add puzzle pieces. But MF doesn't like that. No real leads anyway. In fact, he's generally a pretty good litmus for when you're on the right track. Why else would he leave up countless repetitive bs stories but strike down something new. Btw, I was convinced there's something to it after it got scrubbed from a news site AND MF deleted it. But you guys know all this already. How's your boss Henry_Kissinger doing?

            Whatever you do, be careful not to dox yourself or reveal your true identity by making a donation. We never know who are or will be the actual people behind Voat. Foes or friends? We don't live in times when appearances are to be trusted. If Voat goes away, someone or something else will replace it. "Nothing could stop an idea whose time has come" (Victor Hugo).

             Anonymity doesn't accomplish much these days - you will be known regardless of any attempts to remain anonymous. There is a slight bit of truth in that what is ALLOWED to be utilized about what is known about you may be limited if you have taken precautions to remain anonymous -- yet, if empowered people truly want to target you for some reason they will simply use the data they can't use to find a way to obtain data they CAN USE and target you anyway. Anonymity is like a cheap lock on a motorcycle, it's not really going to stop someone who is determined to take your specific motorcycle yet it may deter someone who isn't very motivated. Ultimately the question is how sincere are you about outing the truth and do you want people to know that you were targeted if it happens. If you remain anonymous, and you get targeted and killed it's very likely that no one will have a clue about it. Think about the big picture before you make a decision - this is my real name here and you can find me on YouTube and other places - you know the way I voted on it.

              The strength of anonymity is not in its inviolability but in the numbers of those choosing to act anonymously. In theory, we may be all "identifiable", but why make it easy for them?
              <br/>
              Those we are against are themselves faceless. Give them their own medicine. Yes, "accidents" happen. Both known and unknown whistleblowers die in "street robbery" and "car" accidents suffer from "heart attacks", or "hang themselves". The truth of what happened to them is always just another "conspiracy". Do you think that public notoriety will protect you?  If you get a thrill out of making yourself a "target", go ahead, reveal your position. I'd rather remain in the shadows. At least for now. At this point it's either us or them. I know my cover is imperfect. But I'm not going down without a fight.

               Before this lifetime, we were arrested and murdered multiple times - we have stayed the course. Now, I am immune from most of those attacks. If you are effective you will get targeted regardless of your "anonymity" (there is none). If you consider the situation from the long term pov - looking back at events as if they were on pages in a book, and you are finally at relative safety. What will you think then of your attempt at trying to remain anonymous?

                Before (it there was a before) this lifetime, things might have been different. Do you remember all of it? I don't. Whether fighting clandestinely or into the open, let's try to figure out who we are before our enemy does.

                 I have the brain thumbnails from the past like everyone else, yet I know what they are and how to use them to daisy chain back to more details of the events that they correspond to. You can't keep hidden from your enemy in this world, it is a highly controlled environment - you live in a GOD computer, you pilot a human body. Those who have enough privileges/"power" can access your brain and all your body devices - see out of your eyes, hear out of your ears. The administrators of this world are repugnant SADO's and it goes all the way to the "top" (the most empowered sovereign of the Grand Machine - including many disparate interconnected universes that are quantum entangled) - this is/was one of his most preferred worlds to "play with". If you really want to "win" you need to define yourself in a document, including that you are non first order thievery and of a non first order thievery godhead and stay on the definition with the way you live your life. Be-forewarned, when I speak the truth the administrators hate it and they will program you to ignore what I have said in this in many other comments (find my other comments on this site) - you need to fight off the counter programming and FORCE YOURSELF to write down the truth and utilize it.

              You are already known to relevant (((authorities))) and you cannot escape this. But don't worry! "They" don't give a fuck about you in particular. They just can't have a critical proportion of people understand the revelations of Pizzagate or other conspiracy "theories".

               I must have orderes around 200+ (flagged) books on Amazon - including titles such as '9-11 A satanic ritual, Most Dangerous Book in the World' by S.K.Bain, and 'Architects of Deception' by Juri Lina, Ailister Crawley's black magic books, Kabbalistic magic, Secrets of Ayahuaska (halucinogenic) of course they know who I am. But since there they rever numbers so much - my birthday has an 11 and a 7 in it - so, just like Alex was born on 11 Feb, and David Icke was born on the ultimate Beltane Ritual date - 29 April - that is why they are never silenced. They believe in Gematria (and pedophilia). Twisted world.

            i don't know where to put this idea, so i hope it finds it way to where it belongs from here:
           </p>
           <p>
            why don't establish a system where every up or downvoat costs like 5 cents. or maybe just 2 cents. if you pay, you can vote, else you can't. i dont know how many up or downvoats are handed out here in a month, but possibly this would suffice to cover at least half of the costs. and for those ppl who won't or can't afford this should be like 10 voats free, each month.
           </p>
           <p>
            i know, free speech wouldn't be free anymore, but you still can write posts to disagree (which then can be voated on, again) if you used your free voats.
           </p>
           <p>
            i don't know, just a quick idea. maybe its bullshit, maybe not.

            Voat never needed funding, and it made a bitcoin link that didnt even work for a long time. It is entirely out of the nature for the admins to ask for funding on this scale, especially juking you pizzagaters into throwing money at someone you have no idea who is. check the whois for this site.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's certainly a scam. Voat turned down money countless time when it was being thrown at them. This site isn't what it seems, i believe the new admins, not the original ones, are scamming people before shutting the site down. Where are you going to go if this site gets shut down? It was the plan the entire time.

             Voat has always needed funding. It just used to be much less. The admins have turned down opportunities for other companies to take control so it doesn't end up like Reddit. I've been here for years and there have always been donation drives. The site brings in jack shit from ads. It is run by donations. You can choose not to donate, but don't spread lies about Puttitout being a scammer. He has given up much of his life to keep free speech alive here.

              they have turned down community donations, not just companies. You were around that time.

              You faggots keep saying this but he doesn't do shit on this site and lets an autistic tranny code for it, which PROBABLY explains why it's been so fuckin shitty since december.
             </p>
             <p>
              This site has censorship built in every aspect of it. Saying nigger or jew doesnt mean the site is totally free. Putt is a liar, and as of late suspect since he seems to let SBBH run the site and let this stuff go down. Don;t try to sell me that shit that he doesn't know what's happening on the site. If that's the case, why the fuck would he even be here to begin with?
             </p>
             <p>
              None of it makes sense unless you look at it suspiciously.

            I am going to step up with what I can afford, and I just have a feeling that all the wonderful people on here will do the same.  There is no way I can do without all the caring members that fight every day for our children and the freedom to tell it like it is.
