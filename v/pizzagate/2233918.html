<h1>Yup! The media is always there to cover up these PERVS!!!!</h1>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>In responding to a poster, I came across this. I don\'t know if Marc Rubio got involved, but this blog was encouraging people to contact the senator. It\'d be good to follow up on to see if he did champion Pye\'s release! </p>

<p>An especially good target for pressure is Republican Senator Marco Rubio. As a member of the Christ Fellowship Church in West Kendall and a favorite of the Christian Coalition, one would think Rubio would be especially interested in (and in an especially good position to take advantage of the benefits of) seeing to the speedy release of one of the more (genuinely) faithful and pious of his constituents.</p>

            I have posted on this too. They were in jail at the same time. Silsby and Pye, yes disturbing and I've been saying we should start here because the friends of the orphans thing never got cleared up. Regardless if they were together. He's not in the video of them arrested where Silsby is looking down with her eyes closed cause she's telling lies. But what's really really gross,from what I read the wife of Pye was home and in the house. according to one young girl every time.itwoukdnt be so gross if she didn't have a blog also. Arrogance! She wrote that when Daniel got a rrested she was "spazing out in two langauges"disturbing. Where is she? IsLeanna Pye still doing children charity work? YikesbutdefinitygetSilsby out. Main question her WHO IS THE HATIAN WHO REPORTED THE CHILDREN STOLEN BY FRIENDS OF THE ORPHANS? Wasn't there a Haitian whistleblower, that's who would know if they all were in jail together.

             Did the dates coincide? I mean, theoretically, could they have been in jail at the same time? Is the jail system different in Haiti? In the U.S., males &amp; females are not kept in the same facilities, so do they there?

             Oh, ho, ho, ho!!!! I might have found a smoking gun!!!! Not to Silsby or Clinton, but to MARC RUBIO!!!! Found a blog where they're asking people to get in touch with representatives in Florida to put political pressure to bear on Haitian officials, but the last part goes like this:

              An especially good target for pressure is Republican Senator Marco Rubio. As a member of the Christ Fellowship Church in West Kendall and a favorite of the Christian Coalition, one would think Rubio would be especially interested in (and in an especially good position to take advantage of the benefits of) seeing to the speedy release of one of the more (genuinely) faithful and pious of his constituents.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Wonder if Rubio was contacted and whether he got in touch with Haitian officials. I'll have to follow up on this!

              I'm off on the dates she was he was arrested in Haiti 2011 minutes video on him though even this guy connects Pye to Silsby still can say they are in jail together, and he was mailed over a property dispute. That's weird.

               But again, even if they were in prison together, it doesn't mean they saw each other. It would be usually for female prisoners to be within reach of male prisoners. There has to be  networking thing. Some organization where they worked together. Did Pye ever use a different name? Remember a blog saying that Pye wanted to be a rock star. Don't know if that's because he used to sing or if it was fantasy. And, yes, there is a Pye that sings, but it's not Daniel John Pye.

             I haven't even looked. I'm assuming there have to be. I just happened to see this so I posted it. That video is so disturbing. Here's an old Voat thread. It might be a place to start. Vindicator flaired the post for leads.

             It is true. The spiritual camouflage makes it worse. He's a freakin' devil perv. Anybody who aided him in raping these children should be in jail with him.
