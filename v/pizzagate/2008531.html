<p>In May 2017 Oliver Sohngen, 52, a married father of two and noted Queens music school founder and children\'s voice teacher, was arrested for child sex trafficking.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sohngen is charged with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, sex trafficking of minors, attempted sex trafficking of minors, and attempted inducement of minors to engage in sexual activity.</p>
<p>Bronx District Attorney Darcel D. Clark said:  “This defendant came to the Bronx to allegedly engage in the dehumanizing treatment of girls ensnared in sex trafficking, even allegedly trying to arrange sexual encounters with girls as young as 8 years old. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pedophile codes used:</strong></p>
<p>When Sohngen and a Bronx trafficker texted one another they inverted the numbers in the children\'s ages.  For example, age 13 would be texted as \'31\', age 8 as \'80\'.  Age 11 was texted as Ii. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16-year-old accomplice:</strong></p>
<p>Heartbreaking!!  The \'61\' meaning the 16-year-old, was taking a group of children to Chuck E. Cheese in Harlem.  She was planning to let Sohngen remove two of these children from outside the front of the building.  He was then going to take them to a hotel.  Afterwards he was to bring them back to the front of Chuck E. Cheese, while their families thought they were at Chuck E. Cheese the entire time! </p>
<p><a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4313/35813639691_1e3974dec1_o.png">Screen capture</a></p>
<p>And why did Sohngen know whether there is only one Harlem Chuck E. Cheese? </p>

<p>Which is good news, but then I saw this article in The Telegraph.  Apparently there is a <strong>huge problem of CSA and cover-ups in elite music teaching:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Does Elite Music Teaching Leave Pupils Open to Abuse?&quot;</strong></p>
<p><em>[...] renowned pianist and teacher Ian Pace asks if we need a fundamental change in the way we teach music to put a stop to exploitation and abuse:</em></p>
<p>As organiser of a petition <strong>calling for an inquiry into abuse in music</strong> I have been made aware of <strong>many horrendous allegations (a great many of which have not yet become public),</strong> including further afield in the US, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Russia.</p>
<p>In the last few months, the musicologist Geoff Baker has recently published his findings of numerous allegations of sexual abuse within the massive El Sistema music educational project in Venezuela</p>
<p><strong>Musical institutions are often found to have dismissed allegations (and sometimes dismissed or threatened allegers)</strong> prioritising their own reputations, <strong>a pattern which continues following convictions.</strong></p>
<p>These institutions rarely reach out to the victims who are as much a part of their legacy as the successful musicians who adorn their publicity materials.</p>
<p>In this rigidly hierarchical and anti-democratic culture, it should be no surprise that <strong>some musicians have had little problem flourishing under dictatorships.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two months before Oliver Sohngen\'s arrest a carefully worded unenthusiastic profile of his accomplishments appeared in the Huffington Post; it almost seemed the reporter might have heard something:</p>
<p>The school, Long Island City Academy of Music, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>has two dozen acclaimed teachers and nine music rooms and offers lessons in everything from piano and drums to voice.</p>
<p>[Oliver Söhngen] brings his Instagram account up on his smartphone and starts showing off videos of his pupils.</p>
<p>He’s particularly proud of a 7-year-old girl who has a big voice.</p>
<p>And listen to this one: She’s the [--]-year-old who will be performing [at a festival in Italy] this summer.</p>
<p>She will be accompanied by her family <strong>and Oliver,</strong> who is designing the sets and singing in the production.</p>
<p>“Of course, I love what I do,” he says.</p>

           Two months before Oliver Sohngen's arrest a carefully worded unenthusiastic profile of his accomplishments appeared in the Huffington Post; it almost seemed the reporter might have heard something:
          </p>
          <p>
           The school, Long Island City Academy of Music,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            has two dozen acclaimed teachers and nine music rooms and offers lessons in everything from piano and drums to voice.
           </p>
           <p>
            [Oliver Söhngen] brings his Instagram account up on his smartphone and starts showing off videos of his pupils.
           </p>
           <p>
            He’s particularly proud of a 7-year-old girl who has a big voice.
           </p>
           <p>
            And listen to this one: She’s the [--]-year-old who will be performing [at a festival in Italy] this summer.
           </p>
           <p>
            She will be accompanied by her family
            <strong>
             and Oliver,
            </strong>
            who is designing the sets and singing in the production.
           </p>
           <p>

           If elite music teachers are this protected, some may even traffic their students to more powerful elites in order to gain more favor.

            Thank you for your post.  As usual it was so very informative.  This will help us know to keep our eyes and ears open and hopefully people will inform friends and relatives to beware.

             You're welcome.  I had never heard of this elite music school horrible situation before.  And I just read that public school music teachers are the school employees most arrested for CSA against students (Dr. Charol Shakeshaft.)  So pedophiles are drawn to school jobs that require them to be on their own with students.  They seem to get caught more than elite music teachers, perhaps.  And apparently, it's even a problem in universities!  I just came across this article:

               Vulnerable Students - Recent charges of sexual assault and harassment by music professors raise old questions about a "sinister trend" in the discipline. Experts blame a mix of cultural factors and unique windows of opportunity.

              This is shocking imo.  I believe that when things like that are going on, there is someone at the top in the school possibly that is allowing these things to happen.  They have put people in at the top that are like them.  That is why we have teachers abusing and also trainers, etc.  Most teachers are very trustworthy, but then there are those that have been allowed to slip in due to lax laws and rules and those that are hiring them.  We must pay attention and not be so trusting of everyone at the top.  Those are the people that are letting the infiltrators in.
