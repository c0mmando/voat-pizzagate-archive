<p>Is the &quot;Christian&quot; Right inadvertently promoting pedophilia by supporting the Zionist movement?</p>
<p>As we know from both FBI Anon and Ronald Bernard (Dutch Banker), Zionism/Zionists play a huge role in the ongoing pedogate scandal. </p>
<p>Ronald Bernard interview:</p>

<p>FBI Anon interview with Victurus Libertus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James asked:  What is the main concern (meaning what is the biggest case) going on inside the FBI at this time?</p>
<p>A:  Israel. We are truly in danger of becoming the United States of Israel.  They own 80% of our politicians. They have infiltrated our media, our tech companies, our banking systems.  The average Jew in Israel or America is not a problem, they are regular people. But, the ones who either serve Zionism, or work on the so called “Greater Israel” manifest destiny pose a serious risk, both foreign and nationally.</p>
<p>If we can move forward with a full investigation into the CF, Wiener, and HRC, it will eventually lead to exposing the vast reach of the Israeli lobby. The best thing we can do as a nation is to continue to bring this stuff into the light. That’s why platforms like /Pol/ on 4chan, and so called “truth” channels provide the people with some kernel of truth.</p>

<p>And this is from the DHS insider interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration?</p>
<p>A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything.</p>
<p>Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?</p>
<p>A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.</p>

<p>That Zionism is implicated might be due to the teachings in the Talmud, in reference to 3 yr old girls and 9 yr old boys.</p>
<p>Reverend Ted Pike (maker of the video &quot;Zionism and Christianity: Unholy Alliance&quot;) talks about pedophilia in the Ultra Orthodox rabbinic leadership and how the Talmud endorses child sex:</p>
<p><a href="http://thisiszionism.blogspot.com/2008/10/pedophilia-thriving-in-judaisms-right.html">http://thisiszionism.blogspot.com/2008/10/pedophilia-thriving-in-judaisms-right.html</a></p>
<p>From the article, he notes that the Religious Right is basically allowing ignorance about the Talmud to flourish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet evangelical Christians are dedicated to exempting &quot;God\'s chosen people&quot; from searching scrutiny and inevitable criticism; thus, they allow the Talmud to remain unexplored and unchallenged. Century after century, this wellspring of evil pollutes the flock of Israel. As God says of Israel\'s false shepherds, &quot;And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.&quot; (Ezek. 34:19)
Unlike the Old Testament prophets, evangelical leaders raise no alarm or criticism as evil Jewish leaders continue to corrupt their own and others. As a result, immoral Jews in Hollywood, Brooklyn, and Tel Aviv -- the last people who merit special privileges -- live in a realm of total freedom from Christian scrutiny and displeasure, a privilege almost never granted any other group in history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following article, Reverend Pike provides specific passages that support the claim regarding 3 yr old girls and 9 yr old boys.</p>

<p>The editor of the article also notes the deafening silence in both the mainstream and evangelical media regarding sex abuse in Jewish communities.</p>
<p>So does that mean all Jews are to blame? Not really, since the VAST majority of &quot;Zionists&quot; in America are in fact Christians (particularly the Religious Right)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In its October 2013 analysis, the Pew Research Center reported that at a whopping 82 percent, “A majority of white evangelicals believe God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, compared with 40 percent of American Jews who believe the same.” But just as jaw-dropping as the fact that white evangelicals are twice as likely as American Jews (40 percent), and five times more like than “Jews of no religion” (16 percent) to believe this are the implications for U.S. policy:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to James Perloff, the Israeli state would not have ever been established with out the support of the Christian community:</p>

Without these ideas being sweepingly disseminated, there might have been no Israeli state created in 1948, no 9/11, and no Middle East wars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even worse, President Bibi Netanyahu has promised in the past to establish the Talmud as Israeli law!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/180440">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/180440</a></p>
<p>Bad enough that the Religious Right is lambasted by the Left for promoting wars in the Middle East wars and genocide of the Palestinians!</p>
<p>Now it looks like they may have helped inadvertently promoted Pizzagate as well!</p>',

            As I mentioned before, I am definitely in the minority among Progressives in liking religion and believing in the existence of Satanic abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the comments I read from on a left-wing website regarding the "After School Satan" program, many liberals consider Christians (particularly right-wing) as evil as the Satanists!
           </p>
           <p>
            Many even think that Roman emperors feeding Christians to the lions back in the day was not such a bad idea!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            To many of them, it is a debate on who they think is a bigger threat to the nation:  the Religious Right or the Alt-right (white nationalists/Nazis).
