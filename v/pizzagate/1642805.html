<p>&quot;She entered Texas’ long-term foster care system. For the next six years, she cycled through 19 homes and institutions.

<p>The article goes on to describe the efforts to combat and prosecute but when it comes to funding, they claim they need more funding. I think this article is great up to that point. I think we all started to redpill these past few months when it comes to the foster system in this country. The article itself is still a great read and a great article to share with the exception of that option that they need more funding to keep better track of the kids.</p>

            If people don't believe that CPS removes children without warrants and they use law enforcement to do so just watch this video.  This happened a week ago and the children are traumatized.  Happens every single day in this country in every state to the tune of 427000 children currently in the system.

             I don't have them off the top of my heads, but Tom Woods had Carlos Morales on his show discussing this topic (Morales is a CPS whistleblower). Nearly half of all foster kids who age out of the system are homeless at age 18. Mental illness, drugs, crime, death, are all much more common in kids who've been through the foster care system.

            "After 10 years of locking up sex traffickers, the lack of progress frustrates him." That's what happens when they're not allowed to investigate the "upper management " of trafficking rings. 
The article states they need more funding....funding they're not going to receive, as the ones that approve funding are the ones that don't want to be investigated.

             Yea I guess that's true that funding is still needed, but here I am thinking that the funding would just expand a corrupt system rather than be used to help the current system improve. That's something we'll never truly have control over I guess. It comes down to get the high level creeps outta here and then funding a system that legitimately can help these children.

              Funding is not needed, what they need to do is stop removing children from homes unnecessarily and this happens nationwide.  Case in point...AZ removes 900-1050 children per month and the majority are from Maricopa county!  Does anyone honestly believe that there are that many children in imminent danger?
             </p>
             <p>
              Understanding the funding from the Fed is key here because each child is worth 85k on average per child to the state when that child is placed in foster care and only a fraction goes to the welfare of the child.  The remaining goes to subsidize salaries of judges, social workers, court appointed attorneys, bailiffs, therapists, foster families, transporters, group homes and more... up to 35 employed positions.  Without the children they wouldn't need all these employees removing children guarantees their positions.  And who do they target?  The families who don't have the financial means to fight back with a good attorney.  Families across the US are screaming from the rooftops as their children are being removed without any just cause yet MSM won't touch this subject which should surprise nobody here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Currently there are 427000 children in the system according to the last official report filed in 2015 and that everyone can "thank" Hillary for because it was she who penned the ASFA  in 1997 and her husband signed into law.  ASFA did two things.  1- It gave adoptive parents a monthly maintenance subsidy, tax free for that adopted child until that child aged out at 18 or till 21 if the child goes on to higher education.  Adopted children get Medicaid and adoptive parents also receive $13200 tax credit they can write off their taxes up to a period of five years.  2- It gave states bonuses for each child if and only if they adopted out more children than the previous year currently from 5k-10k per child depending on their age and those bonuses can be used for anything the state sees fit to spend it on and does not have to go back into child welfare.  And to top things off many parents are ordered to pay child support both when their child is in foster care AND adopted.  You read that right....they have to pay child support.  States are raking in millions of dollars annually just on their bonuses alone and TX is the only state that has consistently made their bonuses since this law's inception without missing one single year.
             </p>
             <p>
              Children are physically abused and sexually abused in both foster care and adoptive homes, not to say all are like that because they aren't but any abuser and or pedophile who has a hankering for having his/her own little sex slave would do well to go through the foster care system and they know it because there is little oversight in foster care and zilch once adopted.
             </p>

              There is a post here on pizzagate where Jabbaroos who is a friend of Alefantis attended an adoption event in DC and Alefantis liked his Instagram post.    Now why would a known pedo be attending an adoption celebration?  And why would his friend Alefantis like that post when he has stated he doesn't like kids?

              The supply (children) is plentiful in the system and it wouldn't be a stretch to think that any pervert wanting a child/children would have his wishes filled.
