<p>I finally found the YouTube video cited in an earlier post originally (letting that stay where it is for now), and it\'s from a YT channel known as &quot;kelcie little&quot;... and guess what? The voices are similar, the faces are similar (though it seems Patience Carter is a much more &quot;produced&quot; version, as in the HD video linked below you can SEE where here RIGHT EYEBROW has been drawn on HIGHER than when she\'s playing &quot;kelcie&quot;)... etc. etc</p>
<p>At any rate, what would Patience Carter - Orlando Pulse shootig victim and budding reporter - be doing making a &quot;stand-up&quot; spot for Comet Ping Pong anyway? I AGREE, it makes ZERO SENSE on the surface, but hells - what do I know.</p>
<p>Parallels between these two &quot;budding reporters&quot; abound, so without further adieu, here\'s the &quot;kelcie little&quot; Comet Ping Pong Package video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXczVfgt7HYYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXczVfgt7HYYouTube</a></p>
<p>and here\'s the Patience Carter (an actual Orlando Pulse shooting victim) as reporter, in her Fox newcaster demo reel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI4YLv7yPDgYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI4YLv7yPDgYouTube</a></p>
<p>Anyone with voice analysis software out there? Give it a shot, I\'m 98% down with the idea that this gal probably runs all over the place for &quot;well connected daddy&quot; (or someone like that) who has a vested interest in doing these little one-off stand-ups to make her way through broadcasting school - up to and including, perhaps, even Pulse Orlando event (though let\'s not go there, that\'s pretty much a side show for now).</p>
<p>I mean, I\'m definitely not 100% certain, but... WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!?!?!?!? For the curious, I didn\'t initially ID Patience as being in the Comet promotional by her look (which is nice, young and fairly unique) - but rather, I RECOGNIZED HER STILTED LINE READS, which are precisely the type of line readings that only an aspiring journo might use in ANYTHING... not being over dramatic, because that is true -  and yes, upon hearing this style of line reading AGAIN in the Comet piece, I BELIEVED I\'d heard and seen this voice and these types of stilted line reads before, most memorably while researching her place in the Orlando Pulse affair., and then discovering that the INJURED Patience Carter was also a budding reporter with several videos posted to social media.. for the record, Patience was the &quot;hospitalized victim&quot; from Pulse, as the record shows.</p>
<p>So allow me to play JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS for a minute, and then this seems to indicate that: James Alefantis (Comet owner), John Podesta (in whose emails we identified Comet and Alefantis), David Brock (Alefantis\'s former lover), Media Matters (Brock\'s&quot;baby&quot; and mouthpiece for liberal causes that pay) and Patience Carter/perhaps &quot;kelsie little&quot;, are now all associated via Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis, at minimum... </p>
<p>very interesting indeed if inconclusive, considering others online have recently posited David Brock\'s various associations (Media Matters, Correct The Record, etc) as being perhaps the &quot;brain child&quot; groups/Liberal think tanks behind numerous, or various, &quot;false flag&quot; and/or bag-of-dirty-tricks events...</p>
<p>and so, if I\'m looking at this from that angle, then we now have a complete line that directly connects: Orlando Pulse, Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, David Brock, Media Matters and our poor dear Orlando Pulse victim, one Ms. Patience Carter, a budding news reporter from (New York? Philadelphia? Washington, DC? Orlando?).</p>
<p>Very open to comments and suggestions, AFTER careful comparisons of the person/s in these two video above, whom I believe are one and the same, despite names and YT channels.</p>
<p>[Background: I sat opposite a hallway from several household names in broadcast for years, so please don\'t try and explain to me how I can\'t spot a bad line read for 50 paces, or identify a reporter from a few seconds of a news clip... I\'m not having that unless you can prove it.]</p>',

            weight has nothing to do with it - women's weight varies greatly, even during "times of the month", and she's never shown below waist in demo reel. Same person, many months apart.

            Voice. Mouth. Face. Eyebrows. Nose. Voice. Can't tell with ears yet, but dollar-to-a-donut her ear whorls match, which is like fingerprints. It's Patience Carter, which is the "more polished" and streamlined version of "kelcie little".
           </p>
           <p>
            Patience has also had more time, classes and training. Her YT channel is active, she's following new people - while little kelcie's is languishing in comparison. interesting.

            Possible. Studio clip girl seems to have a mole or something on the right side of her chin. Can't quite make it out in Comet video because that side isn't lit.
           </p>
           <p>
            VO is better in studio clip. Maybe improved with practice?

            CERTAINLY can't rule out that they are same person.

            What are the odds indeed. Conveniently the comments are disabled for the promo video. Same speech patterns, sounds like... complete with the lippy lisp thing. Although there are a lot of hired hitmen and you're-on-your-own-mentality-so-take-care-of-it-yourself tactics involved, I'm convinced that most of these people are connected through normal channels and use each other like businesses.

            Smithsonian and National Zoo - now might those 2 institutions also be connected to the "mythical" tunnels which are not used any more - or else, have their own underground systems already in place? Sounds reasonable, knowing a little about the history of the place.

             cannot tell earlobes in the Comet video - BUT, the ARE wearing almost identical earrings, aren't they.

            <p>
             And if you're watching on a high-def monitor, you'll clearly see that Patience has her right eyebrow drawn very high, and the outline of her natural, shaven eyebrow is visible slightly below that exaggerated cometic line... and that line, the natural line, matches PERFECTLY with our dear reporter "kelcie little".

              Alright, alright. I paused the top video at 1:07 and the bottom at 4:43 --- Now, it looks like identical ears to me. The same pointy top and what I thought was a dangling lobe on top girl is actually her earring.
You may have something here. The ears look quite a bit alike.

               AND she's wearing nearly identical (the same?) earrings. If I didn't know better... and I dont...
              </p>
              <p>
               Truth is, I did not recognize her by any of that - it was by her stilted line reads, which I'd seen and heard this summer when researching Pulse. ALSO, the Comet clip appeared in another video, so I had a 5 second clip to work with then - not the full video, as above. Spotted her voice instantly, backtracked, and there was "Patience".
              </p>
              <p>
               She's truly living a charmed life at present. Not advocating anything, except exposure.

            My best friend went to the first fundraiser for victims in Orlando, and being a conspiracy theorist I asked if he could ask people one question. Did they personally know any victims of the shooting? He asked over 50 people at the event. Nobody knew a single person who died.

             Yeah, it was totally a false flag. I got a kick out of the video of the guys carrying the "victim" TOWARDS the site of the "shooting."

               To be fair, it's heavily edited, and they claim they edited it heavily, so you wouldn't see any of the bodies.

             I have contacts in "the community" in Orlando as well, and THEY can't find anyone personally either... so yeah, there is a healthy dose of skepticism regarding all things "Pulse" going around in some circles.

             A lot of gay folks actually went out and bought guns for personal protection after that, so if it was a gun-control psyop - well, that sure backfired.

             I found a gay rights activist in Orlando and emailed them on LinkedIn, asked if they knew any of the victims personally... Same thing. Only said, "I have friends who knew several of them personally." 
It seems everyone was at least 2 degrees of separation from the "victims."
