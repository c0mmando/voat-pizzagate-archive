<p>In short, “Sea-A Trading secured millions of dollars in incentives to make its Haiti investment more attractive,” writes NYT. Sea-A Trading’s chairman Woong-ki Kim became a Clinton Foundation donor after his firm secured the lucrative contract in Haiti. Adding to the intrigue, when Mills left the state department, she started a company called BlackIvy Group—for which Kim is a financial backer. NYT describes the relationship this way: “The partnership with Mr. Kim sheds light on the business activities of Ms. Mills—a longtime Clinton loyalist who is likely to play a significant role in any future Clinton White House—as well as the interlocking public and private relationships that have long characterized the Clintons’ inner circle.”</p>

            <p>
             I could not find any other out of place/hinky reference to Seven in Podesta's or Clinton's email...however; John Podesta did read for a theater-type performance called "Seven", but this was in 2015 (3 years later).

             Just a guess but it could be the play "Seven", which John Podesta did readings for and Hillary has a link to, maybe Cheryl Mills was with him or just went to watch one of them?
