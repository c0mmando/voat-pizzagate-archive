            If Polly were Amazing she would know where the Dominicans, Sicilians, and Franciscans forged an Alliance with many others - in Racine, Wisconsin.

           </h2>
           <p>
            If Polly were Amazing, she would know those involved at the top levels will never be held accountable in any justice system.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Polly were Amazing, she would know that Rudy is as corrupt as the rest, and is part of the deception with Trump, who both have a history of working with the mafia, while pretending to be against it. Why did the Bonanno family and others protest taking out Rudy?
           </p>
           <p>
            If Polly were Amazing she would explain what The Young and the Guest is, and how James Alefantis is linked to Caron Butler, Kristin Bauer van Straten, Huma Abedin, Eric Braverman, Mae Podesta, John Legend, Jay-Z, Mark Wahlberg, and many others. She would explain why Mark and Caron are partnering on a movie, why Mark missed his plane on 9/11, and why John Legend just passed one of his Voice singers to Kelly that is linked with these same groups. When will the human trafficking video be shown? Why did Chris Kutcher back out of the I-94 Project Polly?
           </p>
           <p>
            If Polly were Amazing she would explain what the Art in Embassies program is, and how companies in Racine, Wisconsin were behind the development of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amazing Polly is not qualified to investigate the ingredients of a pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is really amazing is how Polly praises Rudy Giuliani and blames the mafia for her false definition of pizzagate, yet avoids his role in 9/11 and never mentions the Jewish mafia, the Knights of Pythias, or where the Emanuels were "made" - Racine, Wisconsin.

            Not to brag, but I already posted about this way back when people were discussing the J'aime L'enfants t-shirt worn by an Alefantis Instagram friend (French for I love children) and whether the name Alefantis was based on this. While researching,I stumbled upon l'Enfant Plaza and the original "Pizzagate" mob story. Amazing Polly must read our site. LO! What is it about pizza??????
Polly usually does a good job with her videos.
