            Casey Anthony's father was reported to have been raping Casey since age 8 and her mother knew and did not protect her. Her psychological evaluations demonstrate know mental health issues except those of a severly sexually traumatized child. Their is a high likely hood that her father George could have even fathered the child Caylee...hence no father ever really confirmed except a deceased ex.  George Anthony was prior law enforcement had a history of sexual deviant problems. He is the one who found or more like drowned caylee in the pool and hid her body. Read the psychiatric depositions. Caseys depositions, etc.  The truth is staggering

            Search for photographs of Caylee. In some of them she displays massive under-eye circles. This profoundly is characteristic for a victim of (sexual) abuse.

            My view on that Casey Anthony case......it was another charade.  Theater.  From Nancy Grace talking "live via satellite from the courthouse", when she was really in the same studio parking lot....to "Zanny the Nanny".  Just an exercise in producing a fake national news story.  Look at Casey now....living the high life in a rich community down in FL.  Her parents in the show didn't have a lot of money.  What does she do for a living?  Oh that's right, she was an actor on the "news".  She was even filmed at one of the anti Trump protests in FL.   Or how about the "news story" where officer Anthony Baloney pepper sprayed innocent "protestors".   Tony Boloney?  The stuff is so in your face and yet people still take it all as real.  Stories like Casey Anthony's are what would be known as "lurid literature" many years ago, and no responsible parent would allow such material into their homes....because they were wise to the influence it could effect.  A story of a mother killing her child is not something libraries or homes would allow.  Not anymore...now its presented as reality on the "trusted news sources"....which if you so some research, are largely theater nowadays; actors used to make news stories to affect the nation.  Media programming isn't called programming for nothin'!

            In another post, since deleted, it mentioned how Jon Benet Ramsay was "dealt with" in a similar manner by her parents and seven paying customers.  You are probably right.  It is amazing what people will do for money and power.  Your post may be deleted, but I like how you think.

            Why don't you ask Disney what happened to Caylee? In released documents there were four different guys named George Anthony who had photo security badges for Disney...and not one of them was George Anthony, Casey's dad. Disney knows exactly what happened.

             Not her dad....the Disney security guards who were impersonating him. There were 4 of them in the case file &amp; none of the photos matched George. They looked like dirty old men. Disney is a pedophile's playground.

              So maybe the dad was renting out Caylee to other Security Guards maybe like he did Casey?  Maybe HE sold her, and Casey having been abused herself, and it being her dad, did not want to squeal on her father.  Even though abused, children rarely want to tell on their dads.

               I don't think so.  It makes no logical sense.  Why would he lend his own name to that?  So he could further implicate himself.  No I don't buy it

               The mother killed her kid and dumped her quick in the woods nearby.  Blamed a Mexican babysitter who had long moved away for kidnapping and then promptly went out and partied.
