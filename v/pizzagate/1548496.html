<p>3 photos were added to Google Maps of the 11&amp;Monroe park, right after the Pegasus Musem thread spreaded at Voat. 
Here are some observations of these weird panoramic photos:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the boy with the brown jacket is the son of the photographer (Lee Watkins), came to the park with his little bike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the arrival photo contains, his sons glitched head, the girl with the pink jacket in a stroller all alone and an interesting piece of cloth that resembles a huge underwear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the second photo contains, the girl with the pink jacket on a slide and her head intentionally photoshopped to ground, his son is either missing in the photo or talking to the 2 adults that show a very awkward body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the second photo you can view the pegasus building, notice that the two windows of the building were closed and a new window was erected in between them and a strange writing that is not readible is visible!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the third photo contains, the stroller of the pink jacketed girl parked next to the photographers sons bike and the brown jacketed lady with the pink jacketed girl walking towards the photographer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the third photo, the photographer stands from a point of view where his back is against the pegasus building but the building is photoshopped out of the view!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i have checked this photographers (Lee Watkins) google + account. that is how i confirmed that he is his son. the photographer gave reviews to many restuarants in Baltimore, so i assume he is from Baltimore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the photographer added photos of 3 eyebrow raising places, 11&amp;Monroe Playground, 1225 Fairmont St NW and Euclid Street Community Garden. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some screenshots for those having difficulty,

<p>i would like to emphasize on the writings on the wall of the pegasus building, which is not readible anywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you walk along the Monroe street, you will see writings on the wall of the pegasus building and only one window in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you walk along the side street and come infront of the pegasus building, you will see the google photos are from 2014 and the building contains two windows and no writing.</p>

            This guy's photos were probably taken on a phone (possibly an iPhone) and "stitched" together to form a panorama... figured that when I noticed the old familiar "gouge" in the upper left corner of the final image, the black horizontal "box" shape, where the phone moved a bit too much for that shot so data was missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was wondering why the girl's head would be "Photoshopped" (as you say) into the playground, but it's because the panorama software did this, when it tried to "stitch" several images together. Makes it much less creepy, though it's still weird.

            Mmmmmm.... if I'm seeing the building I think I am, the one where the son's back is to the fence... you can see that it's in the double window position. Because you can see a window, even though it's cut and repeated from misaligning... it's far enough over to mean that in that photo it had 2 windows.

             you can clearly see 2 windows from google streetview 2014 photo.

             if you check out the photo with one window, you can also see the closing of the 2 other windows. (look around the writing on the wall)
