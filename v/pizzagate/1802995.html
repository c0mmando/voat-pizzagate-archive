<p>One name stood out to me, <strong>Amy Rao</strong> (probably due to Arun Rao; have not found any link between the Rao\'s, exception of sharing a last name)... she has ties to Georgetown, shipping, and China (<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12508.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12508.png)</a>). Oh, and a <strong>big</strong> fan of Hillary Clinton for Pres ( <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12479.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12479.png</a> ). It\'s a premature supposition, but the trifecta of Georgetown, Shipping, and Clinton Buddy makes me think she\'s tied to CIA or some other alphabet agency/entity. Shipping makes me think guns, drugs, or people. </p>

<p>Her blog is full of posts (and lots of guest posts) of her adventures in Africa (mostly in Democratic Republic of Congo aka DRC), helping human rights watch. Maybe she wants to really help people. Maybe she wants to scout out the lay of the land and create a philanthropic cover.

<p>I started looking up the addresses for these various registrants for Amy Rao\'s business &quot;franchises&quot; ... Terrell, TX is very popular. It\'s a suburb of Dallas. </p>
<p>The address per google earth: <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12487.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12487.png</a>

<p>One of the businesses associated with the address was an entity called Daimilus, LLC. The &quot;agent&quot; for that is one <strong>Cecilia Wichmann</strong>... her bio says born in FL, moved to Sweden, now lives in Terrell, TX. Her twitter page banner has USA flag and Swedish flags as butterflies. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12427.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12427.png</a></p>
<p>(monarch slave?)  Her profile pic has her hand placed in such a way as to draw attention to her ring, which seems to have an emblem of some sort, looks like a double-headed eagle. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12425.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12425.png</a></p>

<p>Per EquineNow, Daimilus is a horse ranch specializing in Swedish Warmbloods. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12411.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12411.png</a> 
Before you get all &quot;OMG THERE&quot;S BLOOD!&quot; please note in the horse world, a cold-blooded horse is big, slow, and calm, such as draft horses. Hot-blooded are your Arabians and Thoroughbreds... basically any horse that can\'t stand still long. Warmbloods are crosses between the two. So, the terminology is relevant to the horse world, but with how there\'s butterflies on her twitter account and that association with monarch programming, maybe it\'s code for something less...horsey. But until proven otherwise, I\'m definitely leaning toward typical equine definitions. <a href="http://www.equinews.com/article/hot-blood-warm-blood-cold-blood-horses">http://www.equinews.com/article/hot-blood-warm-blood-cold-blood-horses</a></p>
<p>Daimilus also goes to another address in Terrell, TX. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12495.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12495.png</a></p>
<p>Cecilia is a busy lady, running all sorts of businesses from her home address, in addition to horses. There\'s photography, Saint Cox and Harlequin Solutions, her newest endeavor (reg in 2015)

<p>Saint Cox is listed as a Animal Training Center. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12417.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12417.png</a> Makes me wonder if the name is a play on <em>cocks</em>, and the training center isn\'t for horses or dogs, but kids ala MK Ultra training. We know that sex is used as a torture... so yeah. It\'s bolstered by the notion that there\'s an office of Saint Cox in Dallas, as well, per <a href="https://bizstanding.com/directory/TX/SA/1003/">https://bizstanding.com/directory/TX/SA/1003/</a>  <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12415.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12415.png</a></p>

           Per EquineNow, Daimilus is a horse ranch specializing in Swedish Warmbloods.

           Before you get all "OMG THERE"S BLOOD!" please note in the horse world, a cold-blooded horse is big, slow, and calm, such as draft horses. Hot-blooded are your Arabians and Thoroughbreds... basically any horse that can't stand still long. Warmbloods are crosses between the two. So, the terminology is relevant to the horse world, but with how there's butterflies on her twitter account and that association with monarch programming, maybe it's code for something less...horsey. But until proven otherwise, I'm definitely leaning toward typical equine definitions.

           , and the training center isn't for horses or dogs, but kids ala MK Ultra training. We know that sex is used as a torture... so yeah. It's bolstered by the notion that there's an office of Saint Cox in Dallas, as well, per
