<p>Like most serious citizen investigators here, I follow George Webb\'s videos every day. I watch them multiple times each day. The story that George Webb is spinning, more and more, is starting to look like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CIA is corrupt</li>
<li>The Clintons were involved with the CIA corruption going back to Mena airport, Arkansas, and Iran/Contra</li>
<li>The Bushes were involved with CIA from the beginning, Bush Sr. was CIA director, and potentially involved in killing Kennedy</li>
<li>The CIA is now so corrupt that it (A) topples countries, like Iraq, Libya, and Syria, mostly for gold and oil, (B) kidnaps children and uses them in brownstone blackmail operations and/or sells them to Middle Eastern princes (Qatar, Saudi Arabia), all in the name of the greater good for U.S. security.</li>
<li>A lot of this corruption is associated with the Clinton Foundation, and the CF might even be a CIA operation entirely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now... here\'s the weird thing. Webb\'s story tells a lot of evil. But it DOESN\'T discuss satanism or cannibalism. It doesn\'t discuss the occult at all. It doesn\'t discuss Moloch, Minerva, Thelema, spirit cooking, or the various pentagrams, 666, and baby-eating references that we\'ve seen, dozens of times, on the Comet Ping Pong instagram and its associates websites.</p>
<p>I want to bridge these two things together: George Webb\'s evil CIA child trafficking story, and the occult, satanism, cannibalism, Comet Ping Pong story.</p>
<p>The bridge, I suggest, is Michael Aquino, founder of the Temple of Set. The beauty of this explanation is that Aquino was a known CIA operative. He was used in the CIA Phoenix Program:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program</a></p>
<p>And that program basically involved torturing the North Vietnamese enemy, among other evil and corrupt things.</p>
<p>So what happened? Well, we don\'t know for 100% sure. But my guess is that Aquino was a creepy, weird Satanist, who was public about his Satanism, before the CIA adopted him as an asset. I could be wrong - the timing could be reversed - and please correct me if I am wrong. But my guess is that the CIA, in Vietnam, was looking for someone to totally torture and do evil, corrupt, unspeakable things to the North Vietnamese.</p>
<p>And, if you\'re looking for someone to totally torture, humiliate, massacre, and murder the North Vietnamese, then what better person that... a weird Satanist who walks around bragging about how he loves Satan?</p>
<p>And that\'s how you become a trusted, protected, CIA asset.</p>
<p>Aquino went around Vietnam, with CIA permission and encouragement, doing disgusting, revolting, evil, corrupt, unspeakable, inhumane torture and murder to essentially innocent North Vietnamese people. The CIA justified it based on the idea that the North Vietnamese were the enemy, and so they had it coming.</p>
<p>And then... the Vietnam war ends. The CIA doesn\'t need Aquino any more for Vietnam. But he is still valuable, and they still protect him. They use him in intelligence and mind control research. He is setup at the Presidio. Of course, he\'s a fucking Satanist, so he gets involved with Satanic ritual abuse, and the Presidio scandal happens. Instead of going to prison, the CIA protects him, because he\'s a CIA asset, and the case disappears. The CIA and Aquino even have the nerve to put him up on the Oprah show, and other mainstream talk shows, because he is presentable, articulate, and decent on camera.</p>
<p>That was in the mid-1980s. Flash forward thirty years. Now we\'re starting to see the victims and the associates of Aquino from all of his evil CIA, Satanist bullshit. People like James Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong, and everyone else on his Instagram. This is what happens when the CIA protects and encourages a public Satanist who engages in Satanic ritual abuse of innocent children, other victims, and potentially cannibalism.</p>
<p>Of course, the Satanism could go back to the Nazis and CIA Director Dulles.</p>
<p>But I think a big part was Aquino. The Aquino-CIA connection is too strong. It explains a lot.</p>',

            IMO the smoking gun is The Finders in the late 80s.  The CIA literally said "it's an internal matter" to the DC police.

            I don't think anybody smart enough to run the world actually believes in Satanism. I think Satanic rituals just make the best blackmail material. A charismatic politician can weasel out of incriminating photos with a prostitute (sex addiction, alcoholism, etc), but they can't weasel out of photos of them sacrificing an infant to Satan.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA can only assassinate so many people before the public gets suspicious, so in order for a big conspiracy to work, the blackmail material needs to be inescapable.

            Great thought, but I would suggest Aquino is not the only link, maybe a more visible, single one.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Ie, the records from "The Finders" documents show the CIA protecting a ritualistic, abuse syndicate trafficking children internationally.) It's another link to what you're talking about - the bridge between the CIA, and "satanic" ritual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will be really interesting if CPP &amp; surrounding area really IS infested with CIA for this reason.

            The Orange Pill - explained by the end.
           </p>
           <p>
            No history of the CIA can possibly be considered complete or even understood without knowledge of and reading of relelvant chapters in this book -"Acid Dreams"
            <a href="https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Acid_Dreams.html?id=kX6XR0bdUJcC&amp;redir_esc=y">
             https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Acid_Dreams.html?id=kX6XR0bdUJcC&amp;redir_esc=y
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "With new information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the authors reveal how the CIA became obsessed with LSD during the Cold War, fearing the Soviets had designs on it as well. What follows is one of the more bizarre episodes in the covert history of U.S. intelligence as the search for a “truth drug” began to resemble a James Bond scenario in which agents spied on drug-addicted prostitutes through two-way mirrors and countless unwitting citizens received acid with sometimes tragic results."
           </p>
           <p>
            There is so much more to this.  It is my theory that it was decades long involvement with LSD, including ingestion, that made the CIA go rogue and more than a little mad - "drunk like Gods" on their own power.   Including the coup of the JFK assassination.  LSD combined with ritual occult practices run riot and amok.  And their willingness to use LSD in mind control experiements on adults and children alike also warped the men and their mission beyond belief.
           </p>
           <p>
            You should not look at the CIA without looking at Satanism, LSD, Mind Control, Pedophilia and billions in covert funding - ultimately a breakaway culture running covertly and blackly underneath regular culture.  (That's why the MK ULtra media productions of Heavy Breathing hit such a nerve; they literally encapsulate all of the above into a ball of "evil" and even when the average person doesn't know about these elements specifically, they instinctively sense a shock of evil when they encounter it. And recoil.  Many many people report they can't even bring themselves to listen to it at all, or watch it.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people still don't know this either:  The CIA's ideas of running the world go back to Nazi like cultural programming practices through art and are so grandiose that they took hold of the idea of Modernity in art and decided to make it an American cultural idea as a cold war weapon,  AND IMPLEMENTED this program including placing a CIA friendly reporter on every newsdesk in America.   So much of modern art has developed into meaningles and soulless expressions with no resonance and no cultural value to people- this is why! Modern Art Was A CIA Weapon
            <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html">
             http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is easiery to control populations when you debase their music, their art, their culture over time - this is straight from the Nazi playbook and the CIA carried on the lessons well, starting right after WW2.
           </p>
           <p>
            Huge elements and whole vast tracts of history and culture since WW2 have been literally shaped by the CIA and not in our best interests.  This is the secondary red pill - I call it the Orange Pill.

            Just thought of something else. Clay Shaw, a CIA agent involved in the Kennedy assassination was found to have some strange things in his house.
           </p>
           <p>
            " . . . search of Shaw home produces whips, chains, robe, etc. . . . Giant [Garrison] now convinced it was a sadist plot . . . has read Marquis de Sade . . . says sadists escalate from whipping to killing . . . 'Shaw is a Phi Beta Kappa sadist,'"
           </p>
           <p>
            Photo of Shaw:

            There is by far a deeper connection to this. The CIA is originally Catholics in Actions formulated here in the  US following WW11. After the war Hitler's top scientists including the notorious evil Dr. Mengele from Aushwitz was brought here a specialist in mind control and other evil things. To wrap your head around this you have to understand that the Vatican/secret societies/ illuminati was aligned/helped Hitler. The public face of helping the poor but behind the scenes very sinister. So now in the United States you had all of it brought back and evil in charge of intelligence the CIA... Dr. Mengele was even given a new identity. Think of that a war criminal you can look it up there is live testimony from victims to the senate. Now do some research on the Bushes lineage and fill in the blanks. This has is important if you think about Kennedy he was Catholic the United States was vehemently opposed to a President who was Catholic. Think about why that might be true. The founding fathers wrote the constitution purposely based on inalienable rights partly in opposition to the Vatican the Roman Empire Royalty etc.  The point of the United States was our own individual rights as given by God. So Kennedy was a challenge That he would not submit to the Vatican but be the President of the people. And he did he won people loved him he was a powerful speaker but his most powerful speech was that the United States would have no part in secret societies, that he tear apart the CIA etc. this was not Long after it started. Then trashed happened. Do the math.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Satanism has been a part of this from the beginning but starting from more recently Aleister Crowley known satanist called himself the beast wrote "the book of the law" founder of Thelmaic religion. Coined the term "do what thou wildest" He was also known for pedophelia, beastiality, and everything in between. I believe blood sacrifice and invented spirit cooking and the recipe for it disgusting. Thelmaic religion is demonic as well as the rest of them involved canninbalism, the story of Osiris and the symbols of 14 and fish on the palms of the hands. Think John Podesta research Osiris and spirit cooking with cutting the middle finger and pull up the picture of him with his hands open. Now think this is one of the most powerful men in the world who was President Obama Chief of staff until 2015, then HRC Chief through election, who is top lobbyist with his brother to Saudi Arabia, whose brother Tony has a multi-million dollar house full of art painted depicting young children bound and appearing,dazed,injured, or dead half dressed in his home painted by a known victim of satanic ritual abuse; and topped off with a sculpture replica of the arch of hysteria depicting Dahmer's victim in his living room. Needless to say President Obama (who is also pictured wearing an Aleister Crowley shirt) just secured the house two doors down so you can be neighbors next year. Nothing to see here.
           </p>
           <p>
            So back to a little satanism besides the outright symbols that are shown in plain sight and my extremely long explanation of how how in recent history all theses groups who disguise themselves as goodguys came together. WW11 and brought secret societies, world bankers, ultimately the Vatican that used Hitler, Crowley, others to do their evil bidding. Satanism is the attempt to corrupt, lie, deceive, to kill, steal, and destroy what is God's. That is why this evil has always used children, and it has only gotten worse not better. Hiding in plain sight. They are mocking us with art on the walls, with satanic blood rituals in plain sight just calling it "art". With sculptures or performance art acting out cannibalism this is satanism mocking the rest of us and when just a few say something or we look away as society we arrive here. It is time to stop looking away

             I was thinking, what is the one thing all espionage agencies fear the most? Infiltration, what they have by setting up this Satanist cult inside their organization is that it makes it infiltration proof. By demanding adherents do unspeakable acts they know no decent person is going to do them simply to infiltrate them.

            There are keys in every branch of military as well as CIA. Children are trained for different purposes. Pedophilia,  RSA and Mind Control ops are rampant in nearly every country.

            D.C. Hammond on Monarch and MK-ULTRA programming
           </p>
           <p>
            Serious students of mind control may know of this talk by Dr. D.C. Hammond on artificially induced Multiple Personality Disorder--i.e., the deliberate fracturing of a person’s personality and consciousness coupled with mind "programming": by means of ritualistic psychosexual abuse as well as drugs and EM/RF signals. These operations are often carried out by "satanic" cults directly linked to intelligence/military covert government agencies for the purpose of creating Monarch-type agents. I am including in this report a portion of some of his comments on this topic. I found it to be one of the most lucid and understandable explanations of the entire system and how (tragically well) it works and has worked, on a truly unbelievable number of people nationwide.

            George Webb posts videos every day, usually multiple ones.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can find them here. I genuinely believe that these are the most important videos on the entire internet.

            Yes, Aquino is not the only Satanist. But he is the public face. We can use him to get our foot into the door of the investigation, so to speak.

             I honestly think that Aquino is a missing piece in George Webb's puzzle. The Satanism is just another gang that the CIA uses, just like ISIS and Sinaloa.

             The pieces are starting to come together.
