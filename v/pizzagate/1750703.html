<p>That advertisers are pulling out of Google has been all over the news. It seems to center around Google\'s YouTube and concerns about extreme content:

<p>This is Eric Schmidt, CEO of Alphabet (Google\'s parent company):
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/8o27Y">http://imgur.com/a/8o27Y</a></p>
<p>In a leaked email from Wikileaks, John Podesta said he personally met with Eric Schmidt about helping Hillary Clinton. I met with Eric Schmidt tonight,” wrote Podesta. &quot;...he’s ready to fund, advise recruit talent&quot;

<p>It is odd, I thought, that advertisers would be suddenly threatening to pull away from Google unless Google removes extreme content.  
</p>
<p>So, looking at some of the ads more closely, something stuck out:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/gjNJn">http://imgur.com/a/gjNJn</a></p>
<p>This appears to be a separate organization that is NOT Google, but seems to be used by Google in Google\'s ad newtork. It appears that the organization is Digital Advertising Alliance.</p>
<p>Here is a close-up of the logo:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/ID2b8">http://imgur.com/a/ID2b8</a></p>
<p>The Digital Advertising Alliance is a group of regulatory organizations that started a program called AdChoices, after the FTC suggested that advertisers begin self-regulating:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices#History">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdChoices#History</a>.</p>
<p>They describe themselves as &quot; an independent, non-profit organization led by the leading advertising and marketing trade associations.&quot; <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/participants">http://www.aboutads.info/participants</a></p>
<p>I cannot find any information about who designed their logo and what they were thinking when they designed it. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the people who designed the boylover logo said modifications are allowed: &quot;The BLogo\'s use is restricted to BL positive use only. Modifications and variations will be tolerated (indeed, are encouraged!) as long as the BL positive message is respected.&quot;
<a href="http://archive.is/wCfKo">http://archive.is/wCfKo</a></p>
<p>Because of the dotted \'i\', in my opinion it is too ambiguous to say for sure whether this logo\'s resemblance to the &quot;boy lover&quot; logo is merely unfortunate coincidence or by design. The lighter blue color does seem intentional. But I don\'t want to jump to any conclusions. </p>
<p>I don\'t want to start a false lead, but on the other hand there does seem to be pressure on Google by advertisers to remover &quot;extreme content&quot; and so I wonder if there\'s any kind of deeper context that is worth exploring.</p>',

            Good eye but mitigating factors are that it resembles a play button presumably because it will forward you to another site. Pursue the Google angle for sure but we already know they suck
