<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Children who come up out of the foster care system and are not feeling connected, and therefore, are very vulnerable to being approached as somebody who can offer them a quasi-family or financial support,&quot; explained McGee.
The council calls it the &quot;least recognized epidemic in the country.&quot;
&quot;There\'s children being trafficked within their own families,&quot; said council member Yolanda Schlabach. &quot;There are women that are in prison that have been arrested for prostitution that are actually trafficking victims.&quot;
<strong>Delaware\'s location along Interstate 95, which helps to fuel Wilmington\'s heroin epidemic, only adds to the trafficking problem.
&quot;We know that they\'re here, and the I-95 corridor is a vessel that traffickers use throughout Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania--that whole Eastern Shore, the I-95 corridor Washington D.C. and Baltimore, that\'s often the interstate that they use to travel,</strong>&quot; she said.</p>

Western Sonoma County’s Art at the Source was founded in 1995, and paired with Sonoma County Art Trails fall open studios, <strong>provides a long-established creative ritual for thousands</strong> of regional art lovers and wine country tourists.</p>

<p>This is PG related because these logos are swirls and triangles similar to those identified by FBI and pedo symbols and because .  there has been a lot of focus on the Pegasus Museum.</p>',

            I am sorry you are having problems.  I did not know that about derram. I have not heard anything about it, really.  Thank you for your kind words.  I don't post a lot I do a lot of research mostly. We certainly do not need any lurking on here, for we have enough with the paid shills.  I hope you have better luck with your account.

               Quarter lives again. Guess Derrum isn't that good. Now I am quarter and wigger. Maybe I'll look through his posts as wigger, he has made comments that he is a brutal fascist . That's scary, he's also interested in official documents about the rules for violent sex. My gosh he could be a rapist. Anyway beware.

                I never answer shills or muggers.  Be careful yourself.  Develop a good reputation and get well known under your name and you will stand out.  That way you will be able to push them off and gain much support.  Keep in touch.

                 I am looking forward to my new pacer account. I should get my code in the mail. I'll let ya know what happens. Looks like Brony Alexander James Carlsson  from Florida  has something weird with his case. It's all over the map. Did you know that there are even audio files you can hear in court? Any thing cracken where you are. Where was is that guy you said got you hooked on cuz he is so interesting in his posts? I can't remeber? Maybe it's not you, it's tough to keep up with individuals.

                  which I and others are doing some really deep digging and making connections with the most startling people and places.  We are connecting Rigby Idaho to Eleanore Rigby, etc. in relation to William Gray the truck driver killed in a questionable accident in Logan, Ut.  Amazing.  Check it out.

I really think we need to looks into all of these museums.  Even the non-children ones have children programs..  That last one does look like a horror movie blood scene.

              It does! I wasn't even thinking that, wow that is horrifying.  I recently read (to loosely paraphrase) a survivor asked her doctor about her misformed finger, and he told her it was a partial amputation, and I think it triggered her memory of pedogate torture.  I can't remember who wrote that, and I may have some details wrong.

             Thanks for posting that.  You would think "art" councils/museums would be able to come up with a more  creative design than a simple spiral, a scribble that kids doodle when they are young.  ....oh,  ..

            Arden in Delaware is supposedly one of the worst for child trafficking. Also note that Joe Biden and his son were Mayors of Delaware.

            Search: 'Arden Delaware Satanism' on Youtube and there is some interesting vids - this one is worth a watch:

            under the Board of Trustees I decided to pick Roberts Brokaw III because I thought he might be related to Tom Brokaw, but cannot find any link between them.  I cannot seem to find any personal stuff on this guy except he went to Harvard and Yale and worked at Meryl Lynch and is big in Investment Firms.  I did find that he and his wife are members of The Nicholas Society which really should be looked into

            The names on here are not very familiar but sound snooty But there is someone with the last name of Johnson (Racine connection?).  Under the Trustees list is a Carol Rothschild, and well we know that name.  There seems to be a block on her info.  All I can find is she is a Principal at Steven Rothschild Atty.  and she lives in Wilmington Delaware and is 71 yrs. old.  Edit: OOPS.  Meant to add this was for the Delaware Art Museum.

                I haven't been looking for logo matchups specifically yet, but, have indeed noticed a few strange images out of the corner of my eye as I've been reading.

                Could be a valid angle of practical investigation, to help identify which people/organizations deserve more/less focus.

              You will find tons of pics on here with their red shoes and others as well including pope B.  If you want to get a pair, there are tons of red shoes too, There is even now something called The Red Shoe Movement.  That sounds scary.

                Notice the very tall sexy black women's spike heels with a painted red sole  They have been made popular by Christian Laboutaine  a very famous French designer.  I think the fashion industry could be  laundering just like the Art.  The gowns are pretty expensive and also they can dictate fashion.  I read that Les Wexner who owns A &amp; F is probably up to no good because they can bring their clothes in without inspection so plenty of room for hanky panky.

                 You have a point there.  The fashion industry is most likely a player, too.  Most of their art is downright ugly or perverted.   Same could be said for some of the fashion they try to push.  That Illuminati fashion show in London.  Shoving ugliness and perversion at us and we are suppose to like it.

                Yes, the checkerboard look they all love.  Actually it was quite a popular flooring many decades ago.  In the kitchen, before they criminalized it like everything else.  I have always loved the look until now.  But I am going to do whatever I want I have decided.  Otherwise I will have to stop eating pizza, cheese, hot dogs, wearing purple and red, the list goes on.  They will not dictate my life.  They see evil in everything.

            Oh and I realize I have a 10 minute account, but I've lurked since this story broke.  I had an account but couldn't remember the password! I've eaten up nearly every detail of the saga for a year, hours per day.   Completely red-pilled, and spreading the word!

             Ok now I'm freaked out a little bit. I've lived in Delaware AND in Belleville/Collinsville IL near the Cahokia Mounds. They're practically behind a walmart.... I remember making the right turn at light right past it... but the strange thing is that I've lived in those places because of the Air Force Bases nearby so there's definitely a solid connection between the two locations.
