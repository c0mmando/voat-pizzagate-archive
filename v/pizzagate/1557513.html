            Now that the media has "outed" some British guy as the source, how can this connect to TRSPrudence?  And could TRSPrudence be dead or kidnapped (i.e.: the story is so embarrassing they did limited hangout with the random British guy and kidnapped TRS).
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone gets ahold of TRS, here's a message: leak what you have.  If you do, taking you out causes too much of a mess.  If you don't, there's incentive to take you out.  Rule #1

             I spoke to

              @trsprudence
             </a>
             , the /pol/ user about his claims. FUCK CNN, they did have to do with this:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/trsprudence">
              @trsprudence
             </a>
             created le dossier in a document which was actually formatted based on FBI declassified intelligence reports (hence it looked a lot better, less amateurish) which contained much of the information which was eventually released in the reports, but not all of it: namely the FSB Russian intelligence mentions were not originally conceived by Prudence.
Anyway, he made these documents which the help of his flatmate while he was studying overseas, as they were purely intended to troll the media: he sent it several personalities, including Rick Wilson, Shapiro etc.
THIS ALL HAPPENED IN THE PRIMARIES. It was not in September or anything like some autists on /pol/ have claimed. Prudence deleted his twitter account because he saw a lawyer today at 3:30 (he's British) and he was working on the advice of that lawyer as to what to do next regarding libel and two party notification laws etc. He actually tweeted about this meeting, but not the time at which it was at, if you want to verify that.
So, what appears to have happened is that much of the information in the Buzzfeed report has been fabricated, received from this original troll report which
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/trsprudence">
              @trsprudence
             </a>
             crafted in a highly legitimate form (resembling declassified reports) which somehow made it's way into this Buzzfeed dossier prepared by the M16 agent. (Was the deceptively well-formatted information passed around media/intel circles after being initially submitted to journalists?)
SPREAD THIS FUCKING EVERYWHERE. FAKE NEWS media will be BTFO'd if I somehow get evidence of this conversation through our twitter dm's, which were I can't access atm as they have been deleted as a result of him deleting his account. I know, I am an autist for not screenshotting earlier but what can a guy do
EDIT: You have permission to repost this as many times as you like. Spam it on TWITTER, 4CHAN, etc. If you don't believe me, I can't do anything about that since as I explained I'm unable to access my proof, but eventually you'll probably be proven wrong ;)

            I didnt believe this guy at all, he couldnt even post a shred of evidence.  For example, he claimed he had sent it to all kinds of media.  So why not just post a semi-censored screen capture of his email sent folder?  He had absolutely nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get it, they were countering an unverifiable story with an equally unverifiable story (that it came from 4chan).
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, 24 hours, and there is zero evidence 4chan was connected.  None of the posts
            <em>
             predicted
            </em>
            anything accurately.

             There is a lot of very very coincidental timing between verified 4chan posts that precede twitter happenings by 24 hours, and such coincidences occur multiple times, maybe a half dozen, over many months.  It's not proof, but it's reason to believe that this could be true.  It's better than what CNN has.

             Posting evidence would be incriminating on who knows what bullshit charges could come against him.
Not only that.  Maybe he wasn't expecting to actually blast off like it did. Guy probably shit his pants and nuked his hard drive.

            Isn't it odd that pizzagate and pissgate are phonetically so similar? Almost like tptb want the two to be confused as fake news and misunderstood and maybe even confused in search engines.

            The fact Twitter censored his account does imply that The Powers That Be are still colluding to try to prevent truth from coming out -- which has direct implications for the Pizzagate investigation.

            I would be willing to wager that Trump and/or intelligence backing him helped leak this pissgate story so they could bash the CIA and MSM to death with it.

             Agreed.  Honestly I think this is spy vs spy.  Fbianon said that they monitor /pol.  They would have known.  I think this was payback to the CIA for the FL shooter Alaska FBI story.
