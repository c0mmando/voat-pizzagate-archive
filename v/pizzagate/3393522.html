            ,@antelafogo, @-think, I've noticed in this case a similarity to the Green River Killer as well:

             See 16:24 in this video
            </a>
            . Sorry, kinda gross, but it mimics details of this Spain Case where they talk about pyramid shaped stones on/in the body. The end of this linked vid talks about the real perp being an intelligence agent with the highest security clearance. Perhaps this is also the case with the Alcasser girls, with the intelligence agent skulking around the crime scene there too.

             I was just looking at LoField's series again yesterday, in the wake of Mindhunter's new season, &amp; really wanted to download his whole collection in case they disappear off YouTube some day. Is Invidious a backup site, or a mirror/portal site that links back to YouTube?
            </p>
            <p>
             In any case, he's already uploading to BitChute &amp; I thank you very much for always archiving.

            More details: Here's a listing of one of the most recent posts on this forum mentioning problems in the film in relation to the facts:

             Well, first of all, I have to say that the Netflix documentary doesn't show too many unanswered facts that ruin the official story.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean all these facts listed below that doesn't appear on the documentary:

              According to their friends, the previous weekend Desirée went to Coolor nightclub and go out the nightclub for an hour or so. She said nothing to her friends about that, so no one knew what she did. It might be she was flirting or having a one night stand with someone, but girls tend to talk such kinds of things with their friends. As she said nothing about, we can figure out if she made plans for the next weekend for something else, such as a casting for work as a gogo dancer or something.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whether she arranged another plan for the next weekend different than going to Coolor nigthclub, then the whole official story makes no sense.

              The incident of Miriam Garcia with an unknow hooded man within the previous weeks prior to the disappearance when one night while walking down the stairs of her commieblock for put the rubbish inside a rubbish bin, she saw a hooded man, then she throw the rubbish at him and ran away through the street until the nearby telephone box to rang her parents.

              The inconsistencies between the two members of the couple that took them from the last traffic light of Alcàsser to the petrol station of Picassent, as Francisco Hervás told he drove a gold-coloured Seat Ronda and how the three girls were hitchikking by raising their hands up in a clear, direct way, whereas his girlfriend Mari Luz told they drove a white FOrd Orión and the three girls were hitchikking in a somewhat shy, discreet way.
             </p>
             <p>
              Such inconsistencies at the very beggining of the investigation would make Francisco Hervás a potential suspect of something, but the judge didn't pay attention to the inconsistencies.

              The unaccurate timeline of what the witness Dolores Badal might have seen from her window, as she said two contradictory facts: She saw the three girls around 20:30 but she also saw the three girls below her window when the street lights switched on, which in mid November in eastern Spain happens around 18:00 or 18:15, but not at 20:30 when it is black night.

              There was a secondary school party held in Coolor that evening which was a fundraiser party for collect money for a final school trip. Although there were presale tickets available within the previous days, any of the three girls buy those presale tickets, and according to either their parents and the amount of money found in their pockets, they didn't have enough money to buy the tickets at the entrance of the nightclub that evening.

              Two men members of Civil Defence Services where hit by an unknown car in the countryside near Picassent, so one of them died and the other was heavily injured. It happened when they were searching the three girls two days after their disappearance. Their names were Fernando Castilla and Francisco Conejo.

              The crazy, unbelievable flee of Antonio Anglés, when sometimes he was a nimble man being succesfull to escape the police manhunt, other times he acted crazy by saying 'hey, I am Antonio Anglés, help me to avoid the police' when he kidnapped a man who drove him from Villamarchante to Minglanilla, and then other times he acted foolish when he left some of his own pictures inside a empty house in Villamarchante where he kept hiding for two or three days.

              The two jumps off the City of Plymouth vessel that Antonio Anglés did within the trip from Lisbon to Dublin, just one of them somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic ocean when a French helicopter arrived to rescue him, and the other while being nearby the eastern coast of Ireland, when he presumably drowned.

              The disturbing findings made by the forensic Frontela during the second set of autopsies when he found a small cross nearby the vertebrae bones of Desirée, the two small volcanic stones found inside Toñi's nose (such kind of stones for decorate luxury gardens), and the bullet found inside Toñi's skull. All these things were not found by the first set of autopsies made by the forensic Verdú.

            Thus, the documentary shows the criminologist Juan Ignacio Blanco and Fernando García (father of Miriam) with ugly angles and poor half light with dark and ugly bakcgrounds, whereas the two female journalist and the police officers interviewed who are supporting the official story appeared in clean rooms. I guess this is a red herring to make Fernando García and Juan Ignacio Blanco untrustfull persons, and everytime the documentary shows an interview of Juan Ignacio Blanco at home they show a black night panoramic view as a trick to ridicule him in front of the spectators' eyes. That's bullshit!
