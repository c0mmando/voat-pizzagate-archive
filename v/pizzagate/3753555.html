<p>Man questioned on &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; murder. Helen Miller, pretty 19-year-old brunette, told Los Angeles police yesterday that Donald Graeff, 28, a railroad fireman, had carved his initials on her hip while holding her captive in his hotel room for a week <em>&quot;because he wanted to show everybody she belonged to him&quot;</em>. The police found jagged three-inch letters cut deeply into the woman\'s flesh. They are holding Graeff on suspicion of kidnapping and have questioned him concerning the unsolved &quot;Black Dahlia\' murder, which was committed 11 months ago. Graeff told the police: &quot;When I get drunk I don\'t know what I am doing.&quot;</p>

<p>Donald Graeff, 27, was booked on suspicion of kidnaping in Los Angeles after a young woman complained that she had been imprisoned in a downtown hotel room for a week and had been subjected to having the initials &quot;D G&quot; cut into her flesh. Detective Lieut. Charles King said the woman, Mrs. Helen Miller, 19, told him she escaped from the hotel room after finding the key to the door while a man she identified as Graeff was asleep. The detective said the initials, about two inches in height, had been cut in the flesh of her hip. King said Mrs. Miller related that she met Graeff in a restaurant.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For those who don\'t know, Helen Miller is connected to Michael Aquino and Danielle Roberts, the NXIVM doctor who branded women with Keith Ranieres initials. Miller was known as &quot;The Witch&quot; and &quot;The Snake Lady&quot; when she was accused of dealing drugs to teenagers in the Round Lake, Illinois and Rock Lake, Wisconsin areas and was implicated in a wave of 33 suspicious teen suicides in the 80\'s, many by train. That area continues to be a teen &quot;suicide cluster&quot; to this day. See here for more details: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3639101">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3639101</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/3703689">https://voat.co/v/whatever/3703689</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC54317B561B6E707&amp;feature=plpp">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC54317B561B6E707&amp;feature=plpp</a></p>
<p>The fact that so many of the suicides attributed to Miller were by train is curious in light of this article about the Graeff kidnapping affair, edited by Diane Keaton, which reads: <a href="https://archive.is/xpBw7">https://archive.is/xpBw7</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On December 23, 1947, a Tuesday, Mrs. Helen Miller, <em>proud as a peacock</em>, raised up her skirt and revealed for the eager readers of the Los Angeles Herald Express that she had been held captive for eight days and was the victim of &quot;thigh branding.&quot; Why was she captive? What do the symbols on her thigh mean? How did she escape? Local News is cruel that way; slim, enticing phrases here and there explain these lurid, macabre images. But soon enough even the need for explanatory text vanishes as these lost souls and suspects speak for themselves and become complicit as we read heavily into their circumstances. &quot;<strong>DEATH ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS</strong>,&quot; &quot;&quot;NEW MAN\' STEPS ON &quot;OLD SELF,\'&quot; &quot;DEJECTED PUPPY AWAITS OWNER&quot; -- there\'s nothing in the world quite like the misfortune of others. &quot;These details are the remnants of the dreams people came to town with,&quot; Diane Keaton writes in her introduction. &quot;That\'s what their faces say to me. They say, we\'re holding on, and yes, it may be a small-minded, idiot\'s folly that could only come out of L.A. with its lame-o promise of eternal youth, but it\'s ours.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that she was proud of her thigh brand suggests she had a mindset similar to Allison Mack. After seeing this, the natural question is obviously &quot;Who is Donald Graeff?&quot; which is an interesting question because the tell-tale signs of scrubbing are present when you try to do any google searching for the name &quot;Donald Graeff&quot;. The similarities between his branding of young women and Keith Ranieres branding are too close to ignore, and it\'s possible that digging on this guy could reveal a progenitor group to organizations like NXIVM. The other obvious question that needs to be asked is &quot;did this guy ever go to jail for this or even see the inside of a court room?&quot; Does anybody know how to look up arrest records or court convictions dating back to 1947-1948?</p>
<p>Since there is not much to be found on Donald Graeff himself, I checked his family name and discovered that he may be connected to the incredibly wealthy and influential De Graeff family <a href="https://www.houseofnames.com/graef-family-crest">https://www.houseofnames.com/graef-family-crest</a></p>
<p>This family was influential in the founding of Switzerland and the United States, and was prominent throughout the Dutch Golden Age. They were the Mayors of Amsterdam and the head of the Dutch East India company for centuries. For example, Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff was both a Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs and was a Governor General of Dutch East Indies until September 11th, 1931. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_Cornelis_Dirk_de_Graeff">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_Cornelis_Dirk_de_Graeff</a></p>
<p>What really strikes me though is that his father, Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek, had a brother named colonel Gijsbert Carel Rutger <strong>Reinier</strong> de Graeff. That name is strikingly similar to Keith Raneire.</p>
<p>Another potential connection is that Keith Raneire attended a Waldorf school growing up, and both Astor Waldorf and Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff both attended the League of Nations Seventeenth Ordinary Session of the Assembly in Geneva, September 21 - October 10, 1936.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~league/17thordinaryassemb.htm">http://www.indiana.edu/~league/17thordinaryassemb.htm</a>     <a href="https://archive.is/5lpVm">https://archive.is/5lpVm</a></p>
<p>Although I\'m unable to find much on the surnames Reineir or Raneire, I did notice that the similar surnames Reiner <a href="https://archive.is/EpSPi">https://archive.is/EpSPi</a> and Rainier <a href="https://archive.is/He8M1">https://archive.is/He8M1</a> both mean <em>counsel</em>, and the name Graeff <a href="https://archive.is/vBCoF">https://archive.is/vBCoF</a> is the Dutch and North German name for the chairman of a town <em>council,</em> which may be another point of connection between Donald Graeff and Keith Raniere. This may be why Kieth Raniere called himself Vanguard, which means both <em>a group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas</em> and the foremost part of an advancing army.  In addition to meaning &quot;counsel&quot;, Rainier also means army. The De Graeffs have been major patrons of the arts for centuries, which make them a group of people leading the way in new ideas.</p>
<p>Their connections to shipping and the slave trade are obvious due to them basically controlling the Dutch East India Company for centuries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company#Dutch_slave_trade_and_slavery_under_the_VOC_colonial_rule">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company#Dutch_slave_trade_and_slavery_under_the_VOC_colonial_rule</a>. The fact that the De Graeffs have been such prominent patrons of art and rare artifacts may also be relevant because it is well established that art is at the core of pizzagate. See: <a href="https://archive.is/iIIiA">https://archive.is/iIIiA</a>      <a href="https://archive.is/LaM4L">https://archive.is/LaM4L</a> and also because it provides a realistic explanation for how Helen Miller may have obtained the missing crown of Liechtenstein. </p>
<p>Is this enough to start <em>branding</em> Donald Graeff as the &quot;original Keith Raneire&quot;?</p>',

           , and the name Graeff
           <a href="https://archive.is/vBCoF">
            https://archive.is/vBCoF
           </a>
           is the Dutch and North German name for the chairman of a town
           <em>
            council,
           </em>
           which may be another point of connection between Donald Graeff and Keith Raniere. This may be why Kieth Raniere called himself Vanguard, which means both
           <em>
            a group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas
           </em>
           and the foremost part of an advancing army.  In addition to meaning "counsel", Rainier also means army. The De Graeffs have been major patrons of the arts for centuries, which make them a group of people leading the way in new ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Their connections to shipping and the slave trade are obvious due to them basically controlling the Dutch East India Company for centuries
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company#Dutch_slave_trade_and_slavery_under_the_VOC_colonial_rule">
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company#Dutch_slave_trade_and_slavery_under_the_VOC_colonial_rule
           </a>
           . The fact that the De Graeffs have been such prominent patrons of art and rare artifacts may also be relevant because it is well established that art is at the core of pizzagate. See:
           <a href="https://archive.is/iIIiA">

            https://archive.is/LaM4L
           </a>
           and also because it provides a realistic explanation for how Helen Miller may have obtained the missing crown of Liechtenstein.
          </p>
          <p>
           Is this enough to start
           <em>
            branding
           </em>
           Donald Graeff as the "original Keith Raneire"?

            , you appear to be conflating a Helen Miller from Los Angeles with a Helen Miller from the midwest, without any evidence showing these are the same person. They appear to be distant from each other in time as well as space. We need linked support for them being the same person, to satisfy Rule 2. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit.

             I tried contacting someone who was an eye witness to some of the crimes alleged to be committed by the helen miller from the midwest. i don't know if he will get back to me or not, but if he does he can confirm if it's the same woman or not.

             I have edited the post to clarify that it may not be the same Miller. However this thread is about Donald Graeff being related to Keith Raneire,
             <em>
              not
             </em>
             Helen Miller. The evidence that Graeff may be related to Raniere is pretty well laid out in the OP, but I'll summarize it here because I understand that sometimes it's hard to sort through lots of text.
            </p>
            <p>
             1) The surname Raneir and Graeff both mean the same thing in a different tense. Ranier
             <a href="https://archive.is/He8M1">
              https://archive.is/He8M1
             </a>
             means "
             <em>
              counsel
             </em>
             " and Graeff
             <a href="https://archive.is/vBCoF">
              https://archive.is/vBCoF
             </a>
             means "head of a town
             <em>
              council
             </em>
             ".
            </p>
            <p>
             2) The uncle of one of the Governors General of the Dutch East Indies, Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff, is named Gijsbert Carel Rutger
             <strong>
              Reinier
             </strong>
             de Graeff, which is strikingly similar to the name Keithe
             <strong>
              Raneire
             </strong>
             .
             <a href="http://nl.wikisage.org/wiki/Gijsbert_Carel_Rutger_Reinier_de_Graeff">
              http://nl.wikisage.org/wiki/Gijsbert_Carel_Rutger_Reinier_de_Graeff
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Keithe Raneire attended a Waldorf school growing up
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Raniere#Early_life_and_education">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Raniere#Early_life_and_education
             </a>
             , and both Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff and Astor Waldorf attended the same League of Nations Ordinary Session of the Assembly in 1931.
             <a href="https://archive.is/5lpVm">
              https://archive.is/5lpVm
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             4) Keith Raniere was a slaver and the Dutch East India Company, run by a De Graeff with an uncle with "Reineir" in his name, has been a central part of the slave trade for centuries.
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company#Dutch_slave_trade_and_slavery_under_the_VOC_colonial_rule">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company#Dutch_slave_trade_and_slavery_under_the_VOC_colonial_rule
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             5) Both Graeff and Raniere branded young women with their initials.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once again, I updated the thread to clarify that the Helen Miller who was branded on her butt by Donald Graeff may not actually be the same Helen Miller as "The Witch", despite the fact that The Witch was connected to NXIVM via Danielle Roberts, the doctor who branded women with Raneires initials. How do I edit the thread title? Or can only mods do that? Sorry if it was not clear that the topic was really about Donald Graeff, but I think my edits clear that up. Why don't you give the thread a "help dig" flair? That would be pretty useful, don't you think?

              The problem is, if the two Helen Millers are not the same, we don't really have a connection here to the abuse of kids by the global elite, since you've given no evidence the Graeff from the 1940s had anything to do with hurting kids. This is very very speculative at this point, without a direct connection to pizzagate, and will need to be reposted in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              if no connection can be found. I will leave it up for the full 24 Hours from my original comment, though, so that folks can help dig up connections.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would recommend using one of the background check services to document everyone's family tree that can be found here. Those often list the names of relatives. Then you can search obituaries for the deaths of relatives in the particular towns to confirm if there is a relation. There is a LOT of ancestry information online now.

              <p>
               I'm sorry, I don't follow your logic here. Branding women in the exact same style and manner as Keith Raneire automatically creates a very strong connection between Raneire and Graeff. I cannot think of a single other person in the world who has branded their initials on women, except for Raneire and Graeff,
               <em>
                whose last names have the same translation
               </em>
               . Obviously, if there is a connection to Raneire, there's a connection to the abuse of kids.

                 They have the same root in Ragnar/Raginhari, your example is simply translated from French whereas mine is translated from Anglo Saxon, but they are the same word.

                 Also, town council and war council are not mutually exclusive roles and have often overlapped historically. The De Graeffs are a good example of this, as their history is full of not only the leaders of town councils, but also the leaders o armies and naval armadas dating back to their very founding.

                 How many people can you name who branded a teenage girl with their initials? The more important question, though, is how many of those people have last names that translate to the same thing?

                <p>
                 That really just hinges on the semantics of the word "same". What's important, and not deniable, is that Graeffs and Ranieres brands are similar. I would also point out that branding with the modern medical tools Danielle Roberts used on the NXIVM victims would not have been possible in 1947, and that it would make sense for the branding to become more sophisticated as time went on.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, you completely ignored the connection between Raneire attending a Waldorf school growing up and the Waldorfs and De Graeffs attended important League of Nations Assemblies together.

                  1) Graeff's victim was 19. Not a minor. That is the biggest problem with this post, and the main reason it belongs in pgwhatever. Not only that, but to be the same Helen Miller as the one associated with teen suicides in the midwest, she would have been in her 50s in the 1980s, and 91 now. Unlikely. This post asserted that a victim in 1947 turned into a perp in the 1980s and afterward. We don't make those assertions here without actual evidence. You then edited your post to abandon that claim, but the headline is still wrong.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  2) Regardless of how you translate the surname meanings, the two are different nationalities, so not enough to connect them. Even if they were exactly the same name, you would need to show they were actually related. As I said in my DM to you, there are a lot of Podestas in the world. Most are not pizzagate related. We're not going to witchhunt them based on a shared name without evidence showing an actual connection to abusing minors. That is one of the reasons the subscribers of this subverse voted for the submission rules we have -- to prevent the discrediting of real pizzagate evidence here by loose, baseless accusations of those who are not connected. You provided no evidence Graeff is a descendant of the de Graeff slavers.

                  3) The "branding" similarity
                  <em>
                   might
                  </em>
                  be evidence these people belong to the same cult, or are possessed by the same demon, or what have you. But that is purely speculative. Should we allow all submissions where a perp marked a victim with his initials like owned livestock? Hitler tattooed everyone sent to camps with an inventory number, including kids. What about them? On the basis of your logic, we'd have to accept every post about every kid who died in a camp. That is an avenue to useless spam, not likely one that is going to help expose the pizzagate blackmail network that controls world affairs, which is the mission of this board. The place for that kind of speculation is
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                   v/pizzagatewhatever
                  </a>
                  . It's why we have a speculative board in the first place. Following that clue might lead to documentation of a real connection, such as geneology that relates Graeff to the de Graeff slaver family. But to post on
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

                   Yeah, like Allison Mack was a victim who turned into a perp. Being in her 50's in the 1980's matches the description given of her by eyewitnesses, who described her as a middle aged woman in the 1980's. She was the right age in 1941. No one is claiming she is still a perp because she is most likely dead by this point.

It draws attention to "what they don't want you to see" and your conduct here will be used to bolster the claims made in this thread when it's shared elsewhere on the internet. The Streisand effect is real and censorship is a double edged sword.

                   Yes. Obviously. Branding is extremely rare behavior even as far as pizzagate perpetrators go. The vast majority of pizzagate victims were

                   branded. If branding were as common as you say, then we would have had more threads about perps doing it, but after more than three years of collective research, we only know of three perps total who did this. Mack, Raneire and now Graeff.

                     I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with that thread, I'm saying the rules here are not applied equally. The Rockstar Games thread would be removed if the same lame "reasoning" for removing this one was applied. You should consider spending a few hours on this thread, too. Read the OP and then look at the reason the moderator gave for deleting it and ask yourself it it doesn't look like he is desperately grasping at straws for any and every reason to delete this.

                      To defend your own research you attacked mine. That's called being a complete asshole. You accused me of cluttering the board and wasting peoples time. Your research may or may not be pizzagate related, but that does mean you attack another researcher and accuse them of bullshit. Your fight with Vindicator did not involve my thread or myself and yet you dragged another researcher into it to make a point. That's fucked up.

                       Also, if I may explain my comment a little more, my thread was accused by Vindicator of cluttering up the board because he said we can't have threads on every criminal who
                       <em>
                        branded their slave
                       </em>
                       on the pizzagate board because that would clutter up the board (I challenge you to count on more than one hand the amount of people you know of who branded their sex slaves. I can't do it), yet predictive programming threads are allowed to stay up. Imagine if we made a thread on every single movie, game or book with predictive programming in it? By the same logic, wouldn't that clutter up the board? So why are some threads allowed to "clutter up the board" (using Vindicators logic) and others aren't? Looks like they are trying to hide something to me.

                       You're right, sorry about that. I don't actually think your research is a waste of time, predictive programming is an important angle in pizzagate. I didn't mean to bring you personally into this, but this board seems to automatically make a post in any threads that I link to and I'm unaware of any way to prevent that. Sorry again for saying negative things about your research.

                 How many times have I seen these Danish Kringles featured in various news articles relating to influential people from Racine? I almost brought these up out of the blue the other day but didn't do it because I thought it was too much of a stretch.

                 Are you talking about Dennis Hastert? I believe he was the longest serving speaker of the house and friend of Tony Podesta, and he went to jail for trying to silence his sexual assault victims, who I think were minors, with hush money. I think Hastert was with Tony Podesta in Nose, Japan when they were young, i think before they got into politics.

                 Probably not, although I'm not sure what you are getting at with this question. Most deals don't happen over night so I wouldn't expect this one to have occurred over night either.

             <p>
              A mysterious "Virus X" has stricken one out of every ten persons in Los Angeles during the last six weeks, reports City Health Officer Dr. George M. Uhl. He said more than 200,000 cases have been reported, but there have been no fatalities. It has hit adults and children equally, with attacks lasting from three to seven days. Victims suffer from chills and fever, cramps, nausea and pains. It's similar in some symptoms to influenza. Apparently highly communicable, the virus has yet to be put to laboratory test. But Dr. Uhl expressed the opinion it was not the same as Q fever, another mysterious malady being investigated by state health authorities.

              So different were the strains of 1946–47 that initial classification of human influenza A viruses designated them as “A prime” (1) and somewhat later as “

             I only vaguely understand what I am reading, but if I understand correctly, Covid-19 is an H1, and virus X was the first H1 to ever exist. So, the current coronavirus pandemic is based off of a mysterious "virus x" that was first seen in 1947? Has it
             <em>
              always
             </em>
             been their plan, as early as 1947, to unleash a virus in response to their pedophile network being uncovered? Is that why Virus X occurred contemporaneously with the arrest of Donald Graeff, just like coronavirus occurred shortly after Keith Raneire was convicted?

               X is more than just a placeholder for the unknown? X is a rating for pornographic videos, but I don't think that term was being used in the 1940's. "X" is also said to "Mark the Spot", and it certainly puts a mark on all these related newspaper articles.

               I am not sure. I know Helen Miller was the target of a secret Reagan-era operation that was illegally canceled during the Clinton administration. I may also have stumbled across a cult of vampires, because it is not very hard to catch a glimpse of this cult if you use Graeff as your starting point. For example, take the name Gijsbert Carel Rutger Reinier de Graeff. Google "Rutger" and you immediately get results for Rutger Hauer, a Dutch actor who starred in productions like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Rite (which is about an Exorcist. The Exorcist was one of the movies, along with Return of the Jedi, that inspired Jeffrey Dahmer) and The Heineken Kidnapping. This last movie, The Heineken Kidnapping, is interesting because the plot is very similar to that news article in The Missourian about Madge Meredith kidnapping her professional adviser.

He has been active in UK politics, formerly as a member of the Conservative Party[1][4] and since 2016 in the Liberal Democrats.

                 Earlier today someone who you told me not to trust sent me a private message telling me I might want to look into the

                 </em>
                 Stefi Graff because Graff and Graeff are interchangeable. Should I start looking for a connection between these two tennis players?

                 interesting because I have been talking about Racine and the Witch to a friend I met in an online game. This friend met another person in a completely different online game who was from Wisconsin, and so he started talking to him about what I had told him about Racine and the Witch. It turned out this person from Wisconsin had family from Liechtenstein. So I asked my friend to ask this person who his family from Liechtenstein was and it turned out to be this guy who makes paintings about the coming of the Anti-Christ, and who claimed that the Christian Cross was actually the Mark of the Beast...

                 What should I think of this? Is this Norbert Cox person trustworthy? The way I found his site, through an online friend of an online friend, now seems as bizarre as what caused me to freakout about Austin Steinbart. Can you explain why bizarre stuff like this keeps happening?

                 Easter without church being held? Is this the first time in history that church gatherings will have been banned on Easter? Will there be a false flag? Perhaps blaming a Christian who is angry about being locked down and unable to attend church?
