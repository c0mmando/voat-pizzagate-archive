<p>Take a trip with me... and I hope I don\'t give anyone whiplash as we travel from the past to the present multiple times. </p>
<p>It happened in 1961 when Michael Rockefeller went to Papua New Guinea to gather artifacts for his family\'s museum...</p>
<p><em>Michael wanted to gather artwork for his father’s museum, but without going through intermediaries. A natural adventurer, he would go right to the source.</em></p>
<p><em>Aware of the untouched world of Asmat in Dutch New Guinea, a place known for its intricate woodcarving, Michael made plans to scout out a location there to do some art-hunting.</em></p>
<p>*In October 1961, Michael traveled to Asmat with anthropologist Rene Wassing. Carrying bartering goods like steel or tobacco — which the <em>Asmats had become addicted to — he visited <strong>13</strong> villages in <strong>three</strong> weeks, never spending more than <strong>three</strong> days in one location.</em></p>
<p>Notice the ritualistic numbers of 13 and 3. These people are slaves to this stuff, so naturally they were addicted to following such order. </p>
<p><em>He gathered hundreds of items, among them bowls, shields, spears and the most prized possession, <strong>four sacred bisj poles, spiritual artifacts that are often dedicated to the deceased</strong>, which now hang in the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</em></p>
<p>What are bisj poles? <em>A Bisj or Bis pole is a ritual artifact created and used by the Asmat people of south-western New Guinea. Bisj poles can be erected as an act of revenge, to pay homage to the ancestors, to calm the spirits of the deceased and to bring harmony and spiritual strength to the community.</em> </p>
<p><em>Carved out of a single piece of a wild Mangrove[1] tree, Bisj poles can reach heights of up to 25 feet (7.62 m). Their carvings depict human figures standing on top of each other, as well as animal figures, <strong>phallic symbols</strong>, and carvings in the shape of a canoe prow.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisj_pole">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisj_pole</a></p>
<p>No surprise there\'s phallic symbolism carved onto them. Here are the ones featured in their museum, and remember that the Met Gala is also held here for the elite, and that a gala by definition includes special entertainment of an unspecified nature. <em>The Asmat honored their dead with feasts and rituals, which both commemorated the deceased and reminded the living to avenge their deaths. The towering Asmat &quot;bis&quot; poles were made for these funeral feasts. The basic form of the bis is an openwork pole incorporating several ancestor figures and a winglike projection that represents the pole\'s phallus. In Asmat belief, no death was accidental. Each death was always caused by an enemy, either through headhunting raids or sorcery. Death created an imbalance in society, which the living had to correct by taking an enemy head.</em> <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/313830">https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/313830</a></p>
<p>So, back to the story...</p>
<p><em>The scavenging trip was a success. But one trip wasn’t enough.</em> </p>
<p>Doesn\'t the following sound so much like what Hellywood and the media project onto society today? </p>
<p><em>Men had sex with men. They shared wives and practiced polygamy. They sometimes drank each other’s urine and covered themselves in human blood during bonding rituals.</em></p>
<p><em>This was a “complex spiritual world balanced by ceremonies, ritual and reciprocal violence,” writes Hoffman.</em></p>
<p>Remember at the MOCA Gala where they had heads of models poking out from under the tables, so it appeared as though severed heads were the center pieces of the table? In case you missed it: <a href="http://observer.com/2011/11/losing-our-appetites-marina-abramovics-moca-gala/">http://observer.com/2011/11/losing-our-appetites-marina-abramovics-moca-gala/</a></p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p><em>This spirit world centered around the practice of headhunting and its outgrowth, cannibalism. A founding story of the first brothers in the world described how to exactly butcher, eat and honor a human.</em></p>
<p><em>Cannibalism was not about getting protein.</em></p>
<p><em>“Headhunting and cannibalism were as right to them as taking communion or kneeling on the carpet facing Mecca,” he writes.</em></p>
<p>What they believe happened to Michael Rockefeller: </p>
<p><em>One of the men drove a spear through Michael’s ribs. With one blow of an ax to the back of his head, he was dead. The ritual would now begin.</em></p>
<p><em>According to documentation on the Asmat headhunting ritual, they would first remove Michael’s head, then slit him from the neck down his back. Entrails would be removed. Legs and arms would go into the fire while the group chanted. His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.</em></p>
<p><em>His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.</em></p>
<p><em>Everything not eaten would be saved. Some would be used in weapons, others as religious icons.</em></p>
<p>Or it\'s also suggested that Michael Rockefeller drowned and was eaten by sharks, but that theory gets blown out of the water when four tribal men approached a priest to reveal where Michael\'s head is, which his family had been searching diligently for: </p>
<p><em>“It hangs in the house of Fin. And it looks so small, <strong>like the head of a child</strong>,” they said.</em></p>
<p>Due to this information, the priest declared: <em>“IT IS CERTAIN THAT MICHAEL ROCKEFELLER WAS MURDERED AND EATEN BY OTSJANEP.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2014/03/15/how-a-young-rockefeller-died-at-the-hands-of-cannibals/">https://nypost.com/2014/03/15/how-a-young-rockefeller-died-at-the-hands-of-cannibals/</a></p>
<p>It is said that the Rockefeller family still believe that Michael drowned and was probably eaten by sharks. </p>
<p>I don\'t know about any of you, but it sure seems that the MOCA Gala and many of the other things we\'ve seen the elite do, such as this: <a href="https://imgur.com/r/LadyGaga/jJ0tcbo">https://imgur.com/r/LadyGaga/jJ0tcbo</a> seems directly related to the practices and beliefs of the cannibal tribe in Papua New Guinea. </p>
<p>Then there was that time that Bill and Hillary visited Papua New Guinea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRF7zoQhjq8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRF7zoQhjq8</a></p>
<p>And Hillary visited again in 2010 <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/clinton-continues-asian-tour-in-papua-new-guinea-106599343/166585.html">https://www.voanews.com/a/clinton-continues-asian-tour-in-papua-new-guinea-106599343/166585.html</a></p>
<p>So, fellow researchers, are you also seeing a pattern with this? What do you believe happened to Michael Rockefeller? Did he become a meal for cannibals or a shark? This is a deep rabbit hole indeed!</p>',

              He sailed to Hawaii, tribes are normally warlike. It's harvest season so there is a truce between tribes so they can get the food in. They also have a religious belief that the God will return from the Ocean. He comes in and rips them off selling them nails in trade off sometimes for their woman. They cant commit war because of custom. Then they see one of the die in an accident. They realize they are not gods. His troops are ran off the island. They sail for home but damages to the ship make them return. It is now not harvest season. The natives commit raids and steal as much shit as they can. (using tools they bought earlier or stole on raids.) Eventually they sneak aboard the ship and kills good old Captain Cook. The rest sail home and lick their wounds.

                When they attacked the boat they wanted the swords, Night ambush. Not many survived. They were looking to kill him for bragging rights. To them they tricked them into believing they were gods. Special honor to the killing blow. America forced the last queen out a few years later. They still lose. Hawaii people are offshoot of Samoan no cannabals.

            Backlash after CNN presenter eats human brain on TV
"Aslan met with the Aghori, a nomadic religious sect based in India. The Aghori worship the Hindu deity Shiva, but reject many of the tenets of Hinduism and practice a range of unusual ceremonies, including cannibalism."

            "While staying with the Aghori, Aslan drank alcohol from a human skull, and ate a cooked piece of brain. He later wrote on Facebook: "Want to know what a dead guy’s brain tastes like? Charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!""

            Wasn't Hillary recently seen stumbling around India?  Her Bff Lady Lynn deRothschild has her own orphanage there as well as many business interests:
"Not long after Sir Evelyn retired from the Rothschild bank in 2003, the two founded their own business, E.L. Rothschild. Their first venture was an agricultural concern based in India, where the couple saw the greatest growth opportunities. “In terms of business, I’m on fire there,” says Lynn, who with Sir Evelyn spends a week in India every month. “It’s 7 a.m. until midnight, every day.” Having sold the farming business to Del Monte in September, they’re now looking at opportunities in Indian luxury goods, while expanding their charitable interests, including an orphanage that Sir Evelyn built in southeast India in honor of his wife’s 50th birthday.

            Michael wanted to get the items himself, not through intermediaries- so the guy was trying to steal artifacts from tribes people..........uh huh, so its true Rockefellers are truly owned by back wood cannibals? Don't they all think if you eat your enemy you own them?

             Interesting picture you paint! Hadn't considered that, but after all, you're probably right. These people think they're entitled to everything and socio/psychopaths have no problem stealing, let alone anything else.

            I wonder if this had anything to do with the Grasberg mine - a massive open cast gold mine at the top of one of the biggest mountains on New Guinea and visible on google earth from space. The Clinton's activities on Haiti were also said to be part of a depopulation agenda so they could get at the island's gold reserves.

            <p>
             "The reason for Michael's horrific killing was revenge. Before Michael arrived, the Dutch had taken over the archipelago and the man overseeing the colony, Max Lapre, had ordered five elite Asmats to be gunned down., 
A recent graduate of Harvard, Michael Rockefeller had been to Dutch New Guinea on a prior trip in October 1961 with René Wassing on an artifact-finding mission for the Museum of Primitive Art that his father had founded in New York in 1957.
             <br/>
             He knew this ethnic tribe, Asmats, that has lived cloistered from civilization for more than 40,000 years when they first arrived on the island.
He had visited 13 villages in three weeks on his first trip --- bartering steel and tobacco for their hand-created bowls, shields, spears and the most sacred objects – the bisj poles, objects that are dedicated to the dead.
The first trip was a big success but one trip wasn’t enough. "

            He was deliberately killed because he was the weak link in the Rockerfellers crime family. 
Everything turns full circle - today we have Clay Rockerfeller who just arses around taking sexulised photos of his kids but doesn't engage in politics - so thats OK.

            Great post.  Many don’t know about the West’s century long uninvited fascination with Papa New Guinea - working with bordering Asian Pacific Govts to cripple their population with Genocide and slavery - drilling oil for decades easily displacing natives while pillaging and certaintly taking serious advantage of their people resources - and stories like this where wealthy ‘adventurers’ come to manipulate and rob the locals of their art.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember a Shirley Temple film where she’s in Papa New Guinea as a toddler, paraded on film by her handlers during the rise of Hollywood.

            Papua New Guinea is where kuru comes from. There's a documentary on YouTube about how a white doctor figured out the cause is from eating dead brains.

             You're exactly right. The government there tried very hard to set precedence against cannibalism to curb the disease. It's believed now that only women eat the brains of the deceased, and I've theorized that Hillary participated in one of these rituals when she was there in 2010 advocating for women. What better way to earn their trust then to feast on brains with them? Also, it can take 5 years for symptoms to show, which would be about the right time she started to have odd medical issues. Hmm...
