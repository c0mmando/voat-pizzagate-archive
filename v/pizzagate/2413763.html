            Harvey was exposed to distract from the pedo ring in Hollywood and New York and D.C. so by now Harvey should understand why he was thrown to the wolves. He might know about the pedo players he can give them up to get a better deal but first they have to arrest him. I think he might have already been interrogated by some white hats who squeezed him for information.

             Do we know if Harvey was involved with underage actors?
They started with adults, but took him out before we would see how low he could go.
This man is a pig.  Nothing would surprise me.

            No, there will be no justice. Who is going to arrest them? Who is going to prosecute them? Who is going to lock them up and make sure they stay locked up? Even tho there is tons and tons of evidence The elite are completely untouchable.

               All modern presidents are, to some degree, compromised. Bear in mind, an agency named the (Secret) Service puts suited G men with guns around their families? Wouldn't they be Presidential Security if that was their actual job? Something tells me the Secret Service exists to protect secrets. Starting with their convenient original purpose of being the primary investigators of counterfeit currencies, which America's spies have always been masters of, going back to Washington's inner circle. There is no bigger secret than the fraudulent production of one's own currency, then ratified in whatever meager assets our young nation possessed. Any country is built on secrets and sacrifice. Ours is the most powerful nation in history, and our secrets are inevitably the darkest.
              </p>
              <p>
               I should be clear, I'm not defending the Deep State, I'm simply explaining their motive. The President has the power to make anything that comes across the Resolute desk a matter of public knowledge with the stroke of a pen. Fearing a new Nuremberg, the swamp likely utilizes a handful of bad hombres inside the Secret Service to effectively hold the President's extended family at gunpoint. Killing an actual First Family member would be counterproductive, as it would just rally the President's base. Killing a President is a last resort, but the following is not exactly a controversial statement: The presidency has been stolen with lead once, if not twice. In total, four US Presidents have been shot, each beloved by the majority of the population. What does that tell you about how tight of a leash is kept?

                 Not sure if you're referencing the last line or just the fact that I was in full essay mode. Going a couple messages back, I should clarify what exactly a Whistleblower in Chief would be. First off, we need a bunch of political insiders. Specifically, talented people that've seen some shit. We also need them to have proof. I suggest rounding up this dream team about a decade before the election, giving them plenty of time to collect the requisite diet before they move over to the campaign. Every single campaign leadership member would be a source. Many other members of the campaign would be sources. All of this information would be handed over in an encrypted form to WikiLeaks. If the candidate is killed, it's all unencrypted. If the candidate loses, it's still unencrypted, but it comes in a trickle, with the best saved for last.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course, if the President wins, the information is shown to those that it's about. They either agree to cooperate and bring in additional evidence of wrongdoing in the government or it gets released in the Press Room, unannounced, that very day. If their information isn't good enough, their dirt comes out anyway, alongside whatever they disclosed. No matter what, WikiLeaks can decrypt it all 8 years after Inauguration day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The result is a President capable of actually draining the swamp without getting killed. The best choice for President in this case is somebody with very few members of their extended family. The less targets the better.

            Harvey Weinstein is a card in Satan's world order. People take it more likely that adults are sexually assaulted, and not a hellagenic society that loves the blood and skin of babies and youth.

             I've said this several times. They want the masses to think that adults getting their asses grabbed is the worst thing that goes on in Hollywood, when in reality, what goes on behind the scenes would make grown men vomit.

            Arizona offers a haven?  What you talking about?  Weinstein is free to travel anywhere he wants in the United States.  No US Senator or Governor can prevent that even if they hate Weinstein.  There's a couple investigations going on, but Weinstein is not charged with anything.   What would you have John McCain do about that?

             Weinstein isn't charged with anything?  Could have fooled me.  And travel restrictions can be issued with an indictment post arraignment.  Maybe you should spend more time eating dirt than posting here.  I think you are imminently more qualified to do that.  Have a sack of downvoats.

              Hi,
             </p>
             <p>
              This is not a criminal case.   There is no arraignment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you understand that this a Civil Rights Lawsuit against the Weinstein Company?  And Harvey and his brothers as executives of the company?  This is a civil suit, not a criminal suit, so travel restrictions do not apply.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's the prses release.   Indictment is never mentioned.  Charges is never mentioned.   Harvey Weinstein's travel can not be restricted by the AG, because he has not criminal charges against him.

              <p>
               A.G. Schneiderman Files Civil Rights Lawsuit Against The Weinstein Companies, Harvey Weinstein, And Robert Weinstein.
              </p>
              <p>
               New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman today filed suit against The Weinstein Company (“TWC”), Harvey Weinstein, and Robert Weinstein for egregious violations of New York’s civil rights, human rights, and business laws. The suit, filed today in New York County Supreme Court, includes new and extensive allegations about longtime company CEO Harvey Weinstein’s (“HW”) vicious and exploitative mistreatment of company employees. Today’s suit includes numerous employee-victim accounts of sexual harassment, intimidation, and other misconduct.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to the Attorney General’s (“OAG”) lawsuit, despite many complaints to TWC’s human resources department and widespread knowledge across the company’s leadership of HW’s persistent misconduct, TWC executives and the Board repeatedly failed to take meaningful steps to protect company employees or curb HW’s misconduct.
              </p>
              <p>
               “As alleged in our complaint, The Weinstein Company repeatedly broke New York law by failing to protect its employees from pervasive sexual harassment, intimidation, and discrimination,” said Attorney General Schneiderman. “Any sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enablers will be unjustly enriched. Every New Yorker has a right to a workplace free of sexual harassment, intimidation, and fear.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Today’s lawsuit is the result of an ongoing four month investigation by the Office of the Attorney General (“OAG”). The investigation included interviews with multiple company employees, executives, and survivors of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual misconduct. The investigation also included an exhaustive review of company records and emails.
