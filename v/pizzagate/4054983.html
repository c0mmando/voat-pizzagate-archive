<blockquote>
<p>Among the horrific revelations of a 1,356-page Pennsylvania grand jury report that found more than 1,000 identifiable child victims were abused by over 300 Catholic priests, one stands out starkly: Priests allegedly used church property to produce child pornography.</p>
<p>With one priest, George Zirwas, the grand jury says his diocese knew of complaints starting in 1987 that he purportedly sexually abused children. Zirwas was shuffled among positions until he was placed on “personal leave” in 1995, which lasted until he was murdered in Havana, Cuba, in May 2001. The report claims Zirwas and three other priests created child pornography in parishes and rectories using whips, violence, and sadism while raping their victims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>George said he never discussed the nude Polaroids, or the twisted, secret gifts he and the other kids had been given decades ago by the men who preyed on them. These weren’t the kinds of things you could share without feeling humiliated, especially if you grew up tough, like he did on the South Side of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>But you can’t outrun your nightmares forever. So on Dec. 17 — a week before Roman Catholics around the world celebrated Christmas — George met with a Pennsylvania grand jury and told it about the Rev. George Zirwas, a friendly young priest who once took him to a rectory in Munhall, a borough about 25 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, and introduced him to some friends: The Revs. Francis Pucci, Richard Zula, and Francis Luddy.</p>
<p>During a conversation about religious statues, the priests told George to get onto a bed and remove his shirt, and strike a pose like Jesus on the cross. Then they instructed him to strip off his pants and underwear, according to a grand jury report released Tuesday by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro.</p>
<p>In the unnerving moments that followed, George claimed that Zula or Pucci began taking photos of him on a Polaroid camera. All of the priests giggled — and then added the photos of George to a collection of photos of other teen boys. According to the grand jury, these men and another priest, the Rev. Robert Wolk, were part of a “ring of predatory priests” who raped children, shared intelligence on potential victims, and manufactured child pornography in parishes and rectories.</p>
<p>“This group of priests used whips, violence, and sadism in raping their victims,” reads one line of the nearly 900-page document, which outlines horrific abuse that occurred in Pittsburgh and five other Catholic dioceses across the state.</p>
<p>The men gave a specific gift to children they favored, something they could wear that would mark them as prime targets for abuse. Zirwas “had told me that they, the priests, would give their boys, their altar boys, or their favorite boys these crosses,” George told the grand jury. “So he gave me a big gold cross to wear.” ,...</p>
<p>According to Tuesday’s report, Zula “engaged in violent sexual activity” with a child at a rectory in the Pittsburgh Diocese. Church records further described parties Zula hosted for children that featured marijuana, alcohol, oral sex, attempted anal sex, and whips. He was sentenced to five years in prison in 1990, and died last year.</p>

           Stop giving the Catholic Church money. Insist others do the same. Take a stand against the Catholic Church.

           Researchers can look into the people covering for these priests then report them and even file whistleblower forms against their businesses and nonprofits to collect 10% reward money if they have profited from their crimes.

            Thomas J  Benestad made a 9 yr old boy perform oral sex on him and the. he did same to him. Get that through your head. Read it again. Yes a little 9 yr. old boy. A child. Then he “purified” the poor boy by making him drink holy water. We know very well who needed the  purifying. Benestad is down in Fla. we’re Children roam outdoors freely all yr. round. Think about that. Vile.

            There is a massive movement within the Catholic Church to deprive complicit clergy of funds. Many Catholics simply do not know that their archdiocese (the bishop) can take whatever $ it wants from their individual parish. They don't realize that the parish (or their good parish priest) has now say in the matter. The only way to prevent this is to earmark funds explicitly for things like building maintenance, new hymnals or whatever.
           </p>
           <p>
            Folks may want to know that Church Militant, the independent lay Catholic investigative journalism organization funded solely by individual contributions and subscriptions has a fund devoted to putting abusive clergy in jail. They've successfully busted a number of priests who were later convicted and incarcertated. Here's the link:

              Just had dinner with some friends from a parish I used to attend. They were complaining about how bad the parish is now hurting financially. I told them I was glad -- that's exactly what SHOULD happen when you play along with a Communist takeover of the United States, lock the church doors and refuse to administer the Sacraments. Duh!

               <p>
                We took the occasion to make the fulltime switch to a parish in another city (40 min drive each way) that offers the Traditional Latin Mass exclusively, since our bishop mandated sacrilegious Communion in the hand. Covid rule doesn't apply to parishes operating under the pre-1962 Code of Canon Law, so we can receive without trampling on crumbs of Christ.
               </p>
               <p>
                Ever since I watched
                <a href="https://youtu.be/NMsCoTCozSM">
                 this
                </a>
                , Communion in the hand has been a no go. The fact that bishops around the world have illegally banned receiving on the tongue -- turning every Mass into sacrilege that basically makes it unnecessary for devil worshipers to steal Consecrated Hosts for black masses -- adds a truly macabre perspective to Covid1984.

                 Thank you for this video !  It’s is horrifying to think how carelessly Our Lord is treated.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now some people come to receive with masks ON - then step away from priest- procede down aisle then self communicate host.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Priest  has had to chase them down the aisle, and instruct them to consume right away, I cannot explain how intense it is. It is such a disturbing scene to observe.
                </p>

                 Such a mess.

                  Incredibly disturbing. Literally the Crowning with Thorns -- the mocking of the Lord's kingship -- right at the height of His Glory.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of all the terrible things I've seen/learned since October 2016, the fact that the bishops MANDATED this and denied people the Sacraments, from Baptisms and the Eucharist to Weddings to even Extreme Unction, has made me angry at a level I didn't even know was possible. They can weasel out of responsibility for the abuse of kids and seminarians, but they committed this crime as a group, almost to a man. If the bishops had stood up and refused to comply with the lockdowns, they could have stopped the globalist tyrants around the globe. Instead, they legitimized them and
                  <em>
                   literally threw Christ down to be trampled
                  </em>
                  .
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can't be in the presence of that without becoming enraged. It makes me want people to roast in Hell.  :-(

                  "Whatever you do to the least of these little ones, you do to me," Jesus said. Well, they hurt the little ones, so this shouldn't be a surprise. But damn. Still blows my mind.

                  The parish I attend has a Communion rail, and uses it exclusively. Not sure where you live, but look to see if you have any

            It is important to note that the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the clergymen, those in positions of power or authority, are not of God. I agree that people should more vocally oppose the Catholic Church, as i have been doing for years now; but also to know that their beliefs and behaviour are not at all in line with what God commanded.  Nearly every doctrine, teaching, or belief of the Roman Catholic Church stands in opposition to what the Bible/God/Jesus taught. They are known by their fruits, and corrupt fruit they do produce.

            Christianity is fucked up.  A god like they believe would not give you free will and lust if it didn't have a good purpose.  Whatever god is it intended men and women to fuck and procreate.   Abandoning that has led to some fucked up shit in the church.  I guess it has never occurred to those faggots if they starting banging women their problems of child sexual abuse would go away.
