            Hillary has pissed some higher ranking members off and is being sacrificed to the public/if indeed it actually happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the same time (just posted earlier)...

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As we play wag the Julian, here a year later still the debate/is he or isn't he fill in the blank. It's a game, one that we play willingly.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now thousands of children are being transported around the country (and other countries) for several high satanic festivals. We are not talking a few hundred children. We are also talking moving thousands of infants. When we should be scrutinizing all modes of transportation (to start) we are waiting like pavlov dogs for the next crumb from Julian. Think of the holding facilities that are needed for all the infants and children...all the cages etc/manpower to manage (care for) and move (transport). Food and water are needed bc while they don't care if the children die/they need to keep them alive long enough for the rituals. They would have a certain loss ratio that is acceptable but beyond that for the investment to 'pay off' a large percentage need to make it to the altars. Think of all the body disposal facilities that have to be lined up and ready/and processing the die off now that happens re the loss ratio. Think of all the organs that might be harvested bc why let a good ritual go to waste profit wise? Think of the transplant operations/if they are gearing up for an influx of organs. Think of cold storage materials that might be needed. I don't even know how far it goes...is there a sudden uptake in Styrofoam containers, dry ice (or whatever they use) and if so where are these shipments going to. These are the details that would give us clues. These would be ways to find the children who wait in cages languishing, waiting for hell on earth to come to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             But instead we play over and over wag the Julian. I'm not trying to be unkind to your statement bc I played wag the Julian too. I also 'believed' bc I wanted to believe. That is the nature of bias and it is used against us most effectively.
            </p>

             in regard to scrutinizing transportation.......the shipping harbours are paid off, the customs agents are paid.
what can we do.   someone mentioned renting a drone in Maryland and recording every lic plate leaving the harbor.
then someone has to get the plates run.......good luck as the local police are in it.   two buildings have been addressed etc. then
the conversation just ends?   whats up with that?

              Wish I had answers for you bc you are one dedicated digger.  Watching the various agents at work here manipulating the narrative from different angles not sure how far an in-depth discovery can go.  The range of tactics by the agents from the flamers, race baiters to the more intellectual personas direct the narrative much more than is actively realized.  This effectively hampers the energy field that is directed towards solving the problems of discovery.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am always impressed with your dedication and tenacity.  You can only do what you can knowing there are higher energies that are also helping regardless of what it 'seems like' here.  We have been conditioned to see the dark side/to live in fear.  There is another reality and more are waking up to it.  Ppl like you shine so brightly in the darkness.

             I'd re-post what you wrote but I need a link verifying it's thousands in the USA. Unfortunately some of my online forums don't care about Muslims, although I already slipped in the info re the 18,000 Syrian kids sold for nefarious purposes, and the future wars coming to replenish the supply for greater $$$.

              There is no universal figure for missing children/babies/it keeps morphing to create confusion possibly?  However looking at the stats for US, Mexico, Canada just for starters the numbers are staggering/many many times over thousands.  Note in the comment did say thousands being transported around this country and other countries (ie Mexico, Canada) .  Trying to find stats on numbers of satanic groups/offshoots off again can't get a universal figure understandably.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm looking at this from a farming perspective.  Infants, children are 'live' stock.  This livestock needs to be prepared for rituals.  The rituals would be specific as to what condition the 'livestock' is delivered.  Please understand this is not to be insensitive or dismissive.  In order to service the many rituals (happen all year long, this month is especially important as I read) the ones sacrificed I would best guess need to be in a fairly decent condition, in specific attire etc.  To be blunt can't be dragging in feeble, shit, urine, lice infested children for a high satanic ritual.  And it is not logical that they would be just rounded up on the streets and 'processed' immediately.  As I read a lot goes into preparing victims and rituals.  To provide this constant resource a network of transportation, care takers, nourishment (even minimal), clothing, waste disposal, body disposal, cleaning supplies (personal and commercial), cage cleaners etc.  It would be no different than the dead animal that winds up on the plate just kinda magically appeared bc the farmer said let there be cows.  A whole network happens before the cow becomes dinner/including sale barns, feed lots and everything in between.  And just like with farmers, they don't do everything themselves/it is hired out.  I don't think the satanic cabal does all the dirty work and I don't think the ones that are hired are necessarily satanist/immoral sure but not part of the 'religion'.  With everything compartmentalized those providing say hundreds of diapers etc would not even be aware.
             </p>
             <p>
              Same with organ harvesting.  What kind of containers are used etc/trace orders.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shipping...shipping agents move product all over the states 24/7.  Looking for what it would take to warehouse 'product' would give clues to where they are being kept.  Excellent researchers have discovered so many tunnels but where are children stored before and after?
             </p>
             <p>
              Services of a security firm (of some sort) would also be necessary/critical.
             </p>
             <p>
              There would also be some kind of sorting of the 'product'.  Not product to me you understand but it is product to them.  Once sorted what is the next step along the assembly line.  In a very sick sense and bc of my feelings about Amazon, could it be very vips can have guaranteed 2 day delivery while regular customers are given ground?  What about the huge Foxconn facility that will be going up in Racine.  Think I read 20 times larger than Amazon warehouse but don't quote me.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a strong emotional reaction to these horror stories of course.  The emotional response (get killary, podesta etc), waiting with baited breath for the next bread crumb (guess I missed the HUGE one today from Julian bc I don't see a thing) when even if killary and podesta were hung at high noon none of this would stop.  Finding the warehouses where children and infants are kept, the warehouses where supplies for the operation are kept.  Finding the garment factories that supply whatever is needed would give some idea of either proximity or following transportation routes to the other holding areas/what size even?  Somewhere within the 'business' model dots would connect even more.
             </p>
             <p>
              So a link to verify 'thousands'...all I can verify (from reading) is if you add up the numbers (even tho it's not universal) thousands go missing yearly/something like 14k in Mexico alone.  Subtract from that the usual (family abductions, runaways. random sick perverts etc) and you are still left with a staggering number.  The same stats apply to the US.  The children and their bodies are going somewhere and it's a lot more than a pig farm here and there imho.  Clinton F and Haiti...again staggering numbers.
             </p>
             <p>
              If your forums don't care about Muslim children do you really think they possess enough humanity to even start researching this?  Ppl will do what they will do, they will challenge you, try to tear it apart/bc it hits cognitive dissonance.  Frankly I don't waste my time on anyone who cannot see the innocence in a child's eyes and feel a moral obligation to protect him/her from harm.  Those kinds of ppl don't possess enough fiber to make a difference on this issue in the first place/but I commend you for trying.

             Look, it's very nicely written but BS. Everybody's a critic and now they're criticizing and framing our actions under a derisive "catchy" label. I'm really sick of it. I listened to Heather Unruh who I never heard of before. I listened to Rose McGowan who I did hear of, but wasn't a particular fan. I listened to Kim Dotcom when he said he had contact with Seth Rich. I listened to Mike Cernovich who delivered some dishy dirt. I listened to Laura Loomer when she went to LV and pushed the timeline around due to her digging. I listened to an anonymous tweeter who said that at the age of ten, Roman Polanski took nude pics of her in a fur coat on the beach. I listened to Griffin O'Neal when he posted a pic of his dad and Polanski together on a dinner date and hinted that his family was into dark thing. I listened to Dylan Allen when she grew up and told her story to the world about the abuse she suffered at Woody Allen's hands. I listened to Corey Feldman who said Hollywood's #1 problem was pedophilia. I listened to many woman tell their horrendous experiences with Harvey Weinstein. And I listened to numerous indie news/media channels when they printed about the Awan brothers. I also listened to the members of Reddit before #pizzagate and then I moved and listened to the members here, none of whom I know or would recognize on the street. Am I making my point clear? If not, I will listen to fucking ANYBODY that tells the truth of what the hell is going on! I'm not a sycophant of Assange, nor does he control my movements. Rather, he's a prisoner of the people he told the truth about. Now he's living in an Ecuadorian embassy, and still he goes on TELLING THE TRUTH! Why? Because he's the one with the emails! He's the one with the sources! he's the one performs those dumps! So anybody else out there, if you want to tell the truth, I'll listen, and not because some two-bit critic who's too cool for school wants to make a name by declaring themselves the "ONLY" free thinker and independent person out there. I call BULLSHIT! When someone tries that long and that hard to prove themselves free from the shackles the rest of us wear, they're the biggest sucker of them all! After all, where would they be without Assange to whack apart and bolster their own ego? Nowhere!

              Small story for you. When I started out in Hollywood, movie and TV extras were divided into 2 groups. Of course I wanted to join the much, much higher paying union group then under the Screen Extras Guild. Now under SAG-AFTRA, that meant I'd be getting fab medical &amp; dental benefits, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              However there was fierce competition to get the fab paying union gigs even as a background artist, if you didn't have a relative who was a producer and solid connections to request you. Numerous non-union and union members, on set crew, those in hiring positions, all told me that I "would have to go to the parties."
             </p>
             <p>
              What's wrong with going to the parties? As told to me by at least 1 crew member, "That means doing what NO Hollywood street hooker would ever do." I now realize everything would be filmed too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those that run Central Casting have had this practice since Day -1 of the movie industry. I once saw one of their casting directors French kiss and grope every single young woman who showed up at different "call times" for their wardrobe fittings.
             </p>
             <p>
              I knew of other background artists who were a little more flirty on set who were asked by dishonest crew members to check the women's bathroom, as they supposedly had to repair something. Once inside the restroom, they were grabbed by the jerk who demanded a BJ. In essence they were then passed around to whomever.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes I know of 2 minor casting directors who got fired when their behavior got way, way out-of-hand. One worked for Central Casting. The other did all the casting for a Soap. Young men get passed around more so then young women. Common for actors to be given nicknames which EVERYONE in power knows, based on a combo of their name and sexual attribute. Yes that's a LOT of people knowing the sexual monicker that you've been given.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was famous for being beyond naive and completely missing all of the sexual inuendo thrown at me. Didn't realize what was going on at all at the time. Then again I never used coke nor got drunk. Still I was given a sexual nickname teasing me about a certain body part.

               Thanks for the small story :)  It's like as with everything else...ppl love to focus on the big cheeses...like Harvey and forget that the abuse is much more extensive and prevalent than realized.  Harvey may be hung out to dry but it won't stop unless the whole network is exposed.  It's more like (as with killary and podesta) the 'Let's Lynch A Celebrity' show and then the coliseum spectators all go home satisfied.  It's all designed to be entertainment and distraction so the abuse can continue.  We are given bread crumbs so we won't look at the whole loaf.  Others wait in the wings to fill the power vacuum.  Not that it can't be shifted but our attention spans need to last longer than the ones 'thrown to the lions' so to speak.

            Just thought I'd pass this on:

           <p>
            "Pay attention so you don't lose the opportunity to approach this right and look like fucking heroes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember when I said you won't see Hillary go down for pizza, but you will see her go down for big shit?! Then, I told you if you keep looking for her being charged for pizza, you'll miss all of the big wins and REAL HAPPENINGS?! This is exactly what I was referring to.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is Assange's final release (to the EXACT DAY, A YEAR LATER) of his promised, pre-election "October surprise". He was set to release it on 10/21/16 and since 10/14/16, you've hardly seen him since the embassy and his Icelandic HQ went dark, with the rest of his employees other than Jacob.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like I said in the thread before, these are the Weiner files the NYPD mirrored/retained as evidence before handing the hardware to the FBI. Some of the files are pizza-coded creepy, just like Podesta's. Don't get me wrong but, the NYPD recovered ALL of the files on Weiner/Huma's computer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The majority, are directly tied to ALL of Hillary's dirty Secretary of State Middle East dealings and her backdoor foundation profits thanks to hundreds of millions in cashed payroll checks for their dirty "cooperation". Yes, the pizza will burn, but she will ultimately go down for the shade she threw to our nation, as our Secretary of State.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just want to be clear... you're not getting 650k of pizza related files. You're getting 650k of NYPD recovered files from Weiners/Huma's computer that will mostly focus on their EXTENSIVE international/Terror funding and fueling crimes. As you read through the files, yes, you'll see a bunch of creepy Podesta-style, back and forth files/communications, sprinkled in between. PLEASE don't let yourselves get so excited over pizza that you completely miss the actual fucking happening you're being given in this release."

             This is completely false.  The NYPD never had Weiner's laptop.  The laptop was subpoenaed by the US attorney and seized by the FBI as part of a Federal case.

              Here's one from her this morning... exciting info if true.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Relax. I've said a hundred times over the last 2.5 weeks before, "specific timeframes" screaming "it's happening today, right now, in an hour, etc.", should be the biggest fucking "LARP" signal on your radar. Look at Assange... even he just publicly tweeted last night that Wikileaks planned to release this dump October of last year as the final, 3rd piece of their promised "surprise", but NBC pulled the Trump/Bush bus tape and he was forced to pull his release from being published. ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THIS ALL WORKS, knows "timeframes are bullshit because literally, ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, COULD HAPPEN to thwart an ACTUAL "HAPPENING".
              </p>
              <p>
               All I will say is that the wheels are in motion and have been, it's all teed up... now, keep your eyes peeled, ears opened and WAIT for it, like EVERYONE ELSE.

              Its MegaAnon, who said she won't use that trip again so she's posting as Anon now. She's known by her comments and writing style and has been posting these past few weeks. Interesting stuff. If you search for MegaAnon in the archives you should find some threads.

              I think you're valuing this "pushback" a little too highly, although I can't say I'm not curious as to what he's alluding to. Open up your schedule, gentlemen, we may have something on our hands here.

               It's not only the pushback, it's who's pushing back.

               Pushback is extremely relevant.

                Drives me crazy how they announce ahead of time then make us wait - I don't mind waiting but it gives the enemy time to intervene --- shut down the embassy's internet etc.

                 I fully understand the reasonable, but it still is just horrible. And in this case, I'm glad they announced it. I sprang out of bed this morning like a big jungle cat and I haven't done that in ages.

                 Sean Hannity is not going to keep saying TICK TOCK TICK TOCK and now suddenly tweet BOOM without delivering. He wouldn't do that. Other people would. We have Assange focusing full attention on Killary and dropping the key, we have Cernovich picking up on it and now Hannity goes BOOM! Nope, it will happen. Absolutely. And she's in London? All of a sudden she's in London?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nope. This is going down, but I respect your waiting it out. I am, too. I'm getting excited, but patience ... patience.

                  I agree that hannity wouldn't do this then not deliver.  Other smaller journalists and "insider anons" absolutely we've seen it time and time again but hannity is too big a name to not deliver and judge Jeanine on Saturday told us too.  She's a big name as well - not just YouTube journalists
