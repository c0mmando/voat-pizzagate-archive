            , the link you've provided pretty much debunks the idea adrenochrome is a drug for the elite -- the catalog says it's cardiotoxic (poisonous for the heart). But your title doesn't make any wild claims, and you clearly state the accounts of this are fictional, so I will leave it up and give it the theory the "Unverified" flair.

             In the French quarter of New Orleans, John Edgar Browning is about to take part in a "feeding". It begins as clinically as a medical procedure. His acquaintance first swabs a small patch on Browning’s upper back with alcohol. He then punctures it with a disposable hobby scalpel, and squeezes until the blood starts flowing. Lowering his lips to the wound, Browning's associate now starts lapping up the wine-dark liquid. “He drank it a few times, then cleaned and bandaged me,” Browning says today.
            </p>
            <p>
             To Browning’s bemusement, he was not quite to his host’s taste. “He said my blood was not as metallic as it should have been – so he was a little disappointed,” he recalls; apparently, diet, hydration and blood group can all make a subtle difference to the flavour. After they had cleaned up, the pair went to a charity dinner in aid of the homeless.
            </p>
            <p>
             A self-confessed “needle-phobe”, Browning had not been looking forward to the feeding. “I’m actually pretty fearful of anything sharp approaching my skin,” he says. But as a researcher at Louisiana State University, he was willing to go through with it for his latest project: an ethnographic study of the New Orleans “real vampire” community.

            It was used by the fake "Royal Jews" to keep them from bleeding out through their joints. Hemophilia B was and still is a  problem for those fake fuckers because they are so inbred through the centuries that they could not shake the condition. They didn't drink blood for no reason, it was used as medicine. This is why, when they would get caught slaughtering a child, it would be found out that they passed the blood around to other relatives in the family. They powdered the blood and mixed it with their food. This is probably why they marry "outside the family" every now and then.

            </p>
            <p>
             Haemophilia figured prominently in the history of European royalty in the 19th and 20th centuries. Britain's Queen Victoria, through two of her five daughters, Princess Alice and Princess Beatrice, passed the mutation to various royal houses across the continent, including the royal families of Spain, Germany and Russia. Victoria's son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany also suffered from the disease. For this reason, haemophilia was once popularly called "the royal disease". Tests on the remains of the Romanov imperial family show that the specific form of haemophilia passed down by Queen Victoria was probably the relatively rare Haemophilia B.[1]

            </strong>

            Porphyrins are **light-activated chemicals that can be used to combat ills including tumors and diseases of the eye. **But they
            <strong>
             have a dark side
            </strong>
            : when the wrong forms of them build up in the body, they cause a disease called porphyria.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Porphyria is named from the ancient Greek word porphura, meaning purple. The Greeks borrowed the term from the
            <strong>
             Phoenicians, who extracted a purple pigment from purpura mollusks to dye the garments of their royal family.
            </strong>
            Later, in the Byzantine Empire, the term porphyrogenitos, or
            <strong>
             "born to the purple," literally meant that the imperial heir
            </strong>
            was born after the fathers accession to the throne, in a palace room draped in the color.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            However, those with the misfortune to be born to the purple involved in porphyria--a group of diseases that result from abnormal accumulations of red and purple pigments produced by the body, called porphyrins--receive far less than royal treatment. There are at least eight types of porphyria, which vary substantially in their symptoms and severity.
            <strong>
             Historical victims of the worst, most disfiguring forms may have inspired tales of werewolves and vampires.
            </strong>
            Even today, managing the disease can be challenging.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Light-Activated Toxins
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Hippocrates is often cited as the first to recognize porphyria (which was then referred to as blood/liver disease) but the causal role of porphyrin pigments was only established in 1871 by the great German pioneer of biochemistry Felix Hoppe-Seyer. In 1889, Dr. B.J. Stokvis described the clinical syndrome as "porphyria," and from then on more and more forms of the syndrome were discovered.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            All the versions of porphyria have one thing in common: they each result from faults in the bodys heme-building machinery. Heme, a component of the oxygen transporter hemoglobin, is made in a sequence of eight steps, as in a factory assembly line. Each step is catalyzed by a separate enzyme. If any of these eight steps fails because of an inherited genetic mutation or an environmental toxin, then the whole assembly line gets jammed. The products of the earlier steps, porphyrin intermediates, may build up to toxic levels. These porphyrins accumulate in the skin and other organs before being excreted in feces and urine (which may turn a port-wine color). Exposed to light, the porphyrins can turn caustic and destroy surrounding tissue.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            (Put to medical use, drugs containing porphyrins can attack tumors and other ailments. Unlike most natural porphyrins [but like chlorophyll] these drugs are not purple but green, as they have been modified chemically so that they absorb light at wavelengths that can penetrate into biological tissues. See "New Light on Medicine," by Nick Lane; Scientific American, January 2003.)
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Exactly which porphyrins accumulate depends on the site of the jam, and it is this that gives porphyria such a wide range of symptoms. The severity of the jam also varies. In some cases the jam is total, preventing any heme synthesis at all. In others, it is only partial, permitting limited heme synthesis. The blockage of the assembly line also means that the body cannot make enough heme to produce normal red blood cells. Some of these abnormal red cells rupture, leading to hemolytic anemia, while the spleen detects abnormalities in other red cells and breaks them down, making matters worse.

           </p>
           <p>
            One of the more common types of the disease is acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), which famously afflicted the unfortunate King George III of Britain--the "mad king" of Alan Bennetts play. In AIP the most notable symptoms are neurological attacks, such as trances, seizures and hallucinations, which often persist over days or even weeks. Luckily, most people with AIP have a latent form, and never develop any symptoms.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Another relatively common form is porphyria cutanea tardea, which presents a very different spectrum of symptoms. In this case, the hallmark is photosensitivity (an excessive reaction to light),
            <strong>
             which causes chronic blistering and even burns on sun-exposed areas. Healing is slow and is associated with scarring and hair growth, especially on the face. Most of the time the facial hairs are fine, so the hirsutism is barely noticeable. Sometimes, however, the hair growth can give the appearance of a werewolf, leading to speculations that the myths may have had a medical basis.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            In congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), one of the rarest forms, 18 different mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase have been reported in different
            <strong>
             families.
            </strong>
            These mutations
            <strong>
             obstruct heme synthesis
            </strong>
            to varying degrees, giving a spectrum of severity. At its worst, CEP causes appalling photomutilations from the light-activated porphyrins, including
            <strong>
             loss of facial features and fingers, scarring of the cornea and blindness.
            </strong>
            The condition may have been less rare in the past, especially in
            <strong>
             isolated pockets where inbreeding could occur such as the valleys of Transylvania--perhaps giving rise to tales of vampires.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            While the accumulation of porphyrins is usually caused by a genetic mutation, toxins (such as alcohol excess) and environmental contaminants can also cause the disease. The most notorious environmental episode happened in Turkey in the 1950s, when 4,000 people developed a form of porphyria after eating wheat seeds that had been sprayed with a fungicide, hexachlorobenzene. Hundreds died, and use of the fugicide was later banned around the world.

            In most cases of porphyria, blood or heme transfusions can supply some relief from the symptoms, and this is still the mainstay of treatment.

             Interestingly, the heme pigment is robust enough to survive digestion, and is absorbed from the intestine (even though the protein parts of hemoglobin are broken down). This means that, in principle, it is possible to relieve the symptoms of porphyria by drinking blood

            Heme infusions help in the treatment of porphyria patients in two ways. First, they overcome the bodys shortage of heme, relieving anemia. Second, the extra heme suppresses further heme synthesis via a negative feedback loop. This effectively switches off the assembly line, bringing an end to the production of toxic porphyrin intermediates. Drawing blood (phlebotomy) can also help, because this quickly removes porphyrin intermediates from the circulation. In most cases, some degree of normality can be restored within a few days of an attack.

            In the more serious forms of porphyria such as CEP, however, treatments are less effective. Sometimes the spleen must be removed in an attempt to treat the hemolytic anemia. In CEP, the genetic fault affects the stem cells in the bone marrow, which divide to produce new red blood cells. In principle, CEP can be cured by bone-marrow transplantation, which replaces the faulty stem cells with fully functional ones. Bone-marrow transplants have been carried out successfully in at least five children with CEP, usually within the first few years of life. The treatment apparently cures the disease over a period of years.

            No, adrenochrome is a substance.  It's oxidized Adrenalin.  It's a medication that is used to stop people from hemorrhaging.  That's why you can find it for sale.
           </p>
           <p>
            The conspiracy theory....which is false....is that people take to get high. Virtually zero people do this.   Another part of the conspiracy that is false, is you can only get adrenocrhome from a human being.  This is the spooky part and it's ridiculous.  Chemists have been able to synthesize adrenaline in a lab for other 100 years.  To oxidize this into adrenochorme, you could expose it to air and moisture.  Or you could use an oxidizing agent like peroxide or silver oxide. Sigma-Aldrich Corporation makes this stuff in a lab and they are not the only ones.

            You can find stories from dedicated drug users on the web like this one who did try it and were very disappointed.

             You are referring to adrenochrome, the official drug and the official use. They seem to be obsessed with it and won't stop putting it in their movies with what you admit is a false way of using it. So why are they obsessed with false use of adrenochrome? Or is there a twisted version that they like to extract?

            It's hard to admit even to myself, but fear is what they were after.  Then they were going to kill me. (think Andrenochrome).   Not being afraid kept me alive many times.  They didn't expect that.

              We know it is not a documentary. What kind of lame comment was that? They show hidden reality in moves to fictionalize it, and dolts like you can say 'but it's only a movie". The movie industry is theirs and filled with their nonsense. Ratchet your game up, that was weak shit.

              Either way this movie/book explains that satanists take the pineal gland from a living human and get high from that shit. Your comment did nothing to disregard that.

            That's why many victims have been tortured before raping and murdering.  SRA consists many times of horrid torture before sacrificing the victim. The fright within the victim creates something that they crave.

               Took about a year reading about it here to admit it to myself.  It's part of my memories that i didn't want to face up to.

               It ( the gland removal while alive) was first described to me by auto repairmen who wanted it from me but only when terrorized.  They decided I was rather difficult to scare and potentially more useful if sold alive.  So I'm still here and THEY ARE ALL DEAD. It was a very close call about age 5.  Had many others.  You got it girl, fear not!
