I didn\'t find anything particular about it in the end but the building is what initially intrigued me.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.bexar.org/775/Complaint-Investigation-Resolution">this page of theirs</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/1MMfk">archive</a>) you can see the file name for their badge is &quot;PamerleauShield&quot;. This is referring to Susan Pamerleau (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Pamerleau">wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/2wIbF">archive</a>)</p>
<p>IMPORTANT INFO ON SUSAN (from her wikipedia, though all of this info can be found elsewhere and I really recommend you fact check it yourself)
&quot;Pamerleau served in the United Stated Air Force for 32 years, being promoted to brigadier general in 1994 and to major general in 1997. Her first assignment as a general officer in the United States Air Force was as commandant of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. Her next assignment was as the Commander of the Air Force Personnel Center, followed by her last assignment at Headquarters Air Force in the <strong>Pentagon</strong> as the Director, Personnel Force Programs.&quot;</p>
<p><code>Susan Pamerleau (hereby abbreviated as SP) has a very impressive background prior to her career as sheriff of Bexar County</code></p>
<p>&quot;After retiring from the Air Force in September 2000, Pamerleau worked at USAA, first as vice president of membership development; and later as senior vice president of specialized operations &amp; international.&quot;</p>
<p><code>Not sure of any connection to USAA but it\'s important to note her retiring at 2000.</code></p>
<p>&quot;In 2012 Pamerleau was elected the first woman sheriff in the history of Bexar County, Texas. In the November 8, 2016 election, Pamerleau lost her bid for a second term to Democrat Javier Salazar.&quot;</p>
<p><code>Not sure of any connection to Javier Salazar, important to note she only served one term</code></p>
<p>While she was sheriff there were <strong>3 people who were suicided in their jail cells</strong> (<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/crime/article/Bexar-County-jail-inmate-41-found-dead-of-8402860.php">article</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/fKONe">archive</a>). &quot;All three hanged themselves with bed sheets in their cell.&quot;</p>
<p>VICTIM ONE: Melvin McKinney (<a href="http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Wife-of-suspect-in-standoff-cites-variety-of-woes-4803435.php">article</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/K2E72">archive</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;A sister of Melvin McKinney was on scene shortly after and told police she had gotten some calls from her brother, saying “he was at the Super 8 Motel and wanted the police to kill him,” the report says.&quot;</p>
<p>VICTIM TWO: Jonathan Campos (<a href="http://www.ksat.com/news/second-suspect-arrested-in-shooting-death-of-7-year-old-girl">article</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/NHFO2">archive</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;A 22-year-old man was arrested Tuesday in connection with the shooting death of a 7-year-old girl.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;\'I\'m sorry about the little girl but I didn\'t do it,&quot; Campos said, while being escorted by SAPD officers to a patrol car.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>His mother claims he was murdered (<a href="http://www.ksat.com/news/mother-of-inmate-who-died-in-bexar-county-jail-claims-son-was-murdered">article</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/GxwxO">archive</a>)</p>
<p>VICTIM THREE: Victor Casas (<a href="http://www.kens5.com/news/investigations/i-team/i-team-inmate-committed-suicide-hours-after-plea-deal-to-avoid-jail-time/274540140">article</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/cziOX">archive</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;Inmate committed suicide hours after plea deal to avoid jail time&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On June 27, a state district judge granted Casas probation and <strong>dismissed a felony child abandonment charge</strong> after he pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. However, records show he remained at the jail because he had yet to post bond on two misdemeanor cases: a family violence charge and a theft charge.&quot; </p>
<p>VICTIM FOUR: Jesus Jose Lopez (does not seem to have any significance, maybe someone else can find a connection)</p>
<p>All four suicides show the department is clearly doing shady shit, but victim 3\'s dismissal of a felony child abandonment charge shows they are ignoring laws persecuting people committing crimes against children. Victim 2\'s quote gives the impression that he\'s saying sorry about his role in the little girl but he did not kill her.</p>
<p>**Now that I\'ve shown the type of police department Bexar County had (has?) I will show they have allowed people involved in child trafficking/pedofile charges. 
**</p>
<p>&quot;Rebecca Alvarez, 22, Christopher Castareno, 34, Veronica Diaz, 26, and Adrian Colon, 44, all took part in trafficking a minor (16 years old) for sex&quot; (<a href="http://www.ksat.com/news/4-arrested-for-trafficking-a-minor-and-sexual-assault-of-a-minor">article</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/bkC4r">archive</a>) (December 2015)</p>
<p>&quot;Police said the victim told them she was sold two weeks ago from one couple to another for $4,000 after she refused to perform sex acts.&quot;</p>
<p>Sold to Alvarez and Castareno.</p>
<p>&quot;That second couple then forced the child to have sex with men and women in exchange for money at numerous locations across the city.&quot;</p>
<p>Here\'s <a href="http://archive.is/J3bvG">another picture</a> of Rebecca Alvarez with more about her charges.</p>
<p>Rebecca Alvarez happens to be in a relationship with a man named Patrick Quintanilla, a man who was wanted for &quot;Indecency with a Child-Contact stemming from an incident on July 2, 2016 in south central Bexar County, when he committed a sexual offense against a 13-year-old girl in a swimming pool.&quot; (<a href="http://archive.is/SotBe">archive</a>) (February 2017)</p>
<p>This is Patrick\'s <a href="http://archive.is/KuonF">facebook</a>
He can be seen in a relationship with a &quot;MelodyMF Quantanilla&quot; who is actually Rebecca Alvarez (compare Melody <a href="http://archive.is/aREJm">1</a> <a href="http://archive.is/CAi96">2</a> with Rebecca <a href="http://archive.is/J3bvG">1</a>. Make note of eyebrows that go outwards with prominent brow line below, shape of lips, etc.) Rebecca Alvarez also has a tattoo on her leg of the name &quot;Patrick&quot; (<a href="http://archive.is/h8wk7">archive</a>)</p>
<p>Patrick is listed as awaiting trial on the Bexar County Inmate Records (<a href="http://archive.is/zYtRr">archive</a>)</p>
<p>Of the four arrested for the trafficking charges (Rebecca Alvarez, Christopher Castareno, Veronica Diaz, and Adrian Colon) only Adrian Colon has an inmate record, listed as &quot;motion setting set&quot; (<a href="http://archive.is/mZzn2">archive</a>), would love if someone who understood the court talk could explain the extra details provided on his case. Rebecca Alvarez seems to be free as she has been active on facebook as recently as May 7th. </p>
<p>So Bexar County police department let three people go in a case of child trafficking, one of which is in a relationship with someone who has a charge for inappropriately touching a 13 year old girl. </p>
<p>Am I grasping at straws here? Bexar police department don\'t have a clean background (based on inmates that seem to have been murdered and labelled suicides) and it seems that three traffickers have been let go without punishment.</p>
<p>Edit: Also found a Veronica Diaz on facebook who\'s age and location add up, hasn\'t posted in a long time and the only info I can glean from the profile page is the heart within a heart profile picture...

           Patrick is listed as awaiting trial on the Bexar County Inmate Records (

          <p>
           Of the four arrested for the trafficking charges (Rebecca Alvarez, Christopher Castareno, Veronica Diaz, and Adrian Colon) only Adrian Colon has an inmate record, listed as "motion setting set" (
           <a href="http://archive.is/mZzn2">
            archive
           </a>
           ), would love if someone who understood the court talk could explain the extra details provided on his case. Rebecca Alvarez seems to be free as she has been active on facebook as recently as May 7th.

           So Bexar County police department let three people go in a case of child trafficking, one of which is in a relationship with someone who has a charge for inappropriately touching a 13 year old girl.
          </p>
          <p>
           Am I grasping at straws here? Bexar police department don't have a clean background (based on inmates that seem to have been murdered and labelled suicides) and it seems that three traffickers have been let go without punishment.

           Edit: Also found a Veronica Diaz on facebook who's age and location add up, hasn't posted in a long time and the only info I can glean from the profile page is the heart within a heart profile picture... (

            IMO, yes, you're grasping at straws.  So you have one case of sex trafficking, and someone IS being prosecuted for it.  It's entirely likely that there simply wasn't sufficient evidence to prosecute the 3 other suspects in the case.

            Thumbs down. Suicide #1 shot a policeman in the head facing a life sentence or death penalty, nothing to do with children or sex , Suicide#2: one of 4 men who shot at a young family in a dispute at a park possibly over the use of basketball court, presumably this man did not shoot the one bullet which is why charges were dropped. However he remained detained over other unrelated charges and must not have been able to cope  Suicide #3 : pled guilty to a felony and thus less serious charge of child abandonment dropped but couldn't post bond on 2 pending misdemeanor charges involving domestic violence , no mention of sex or children, Suicide #4: by your own admission has nothing to do with sex or children. Absolutely no connection with trafficking on part of suicide victims. Now what? The real trafficking case? It's being prosecuted is it not? A total lack of critical thinking here. Maybe there's a tatoo somewhere in the shape of a triangle. ..this nonsense has got to stop.

             The 4 suicides were not to indicate trafficking (nor did I claim that). The 4 suicides were to show the type of background this police department has.

            <p>
             You're also getting details wrong about the victims and assuming why they did it, along with excusing their suspicious "suicides" while under Bexar County prison protection (which prides itself on its superior handling of mentally ill patients) as actual suicides because they did crimes. Not only that, but excusing 4 suicides in 4 weeks in the same place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Victim #1: You are right about these details. Never claimed it had anything to do with children or sex though so you saying it doesn't is pretty redundant.

             Congrats, now that you understand that part of my post which isn't supposed to relate to trafficking now we can get onto the next part which I labelled with "Now that I've shown the type of police department Bexar County had (has?) I will show they have allowed people involved in child trafficking/pedofile charges." in the middle of my post.

            <p>
             There are multiple cases here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Patrick Q.'s case is being prosecuted (never implied he was trafficking, he's charged with inappropriately touching a minor and is in a committed relationship with one of the people who aren't being prosecuted for child trafficking, Rebecca Alvarez).
            </p>
            <p>
             Of the 4 charged together (not the same as the suicide 4) only one person (Adrian Colon) is being prosecuted (as far as I can tell through public records).

            Something to consider is that the police may not be the source of the real problem in this case. It might be the D.A. is the reason there is no convections or aggressive legal action in many of theses cases.  I would say someone in the area needs to ask some face to face pointed questions. Maybe a journalist. As for your efforts you got my support, I have found that investigating is like a tug of war between thoughts about wasted time and thoughts about this being important. Don't let your own thoughts foul you up. The bottom line for me is there are only 3 conclusions to what we do. 1. We find a bad guy and expose them. 2. We find a good guy and rejoice that the kids are safe. 3. We run out of resources and have to put what we found up for grabs and hope someone else can use it for some good. Your time was well spent.

             That would be awful for the investigation of Pizzagate. Not only would it convince others that this is a partisan issue (which people already think it is), it would silence a lot of investigation that doesn't have to do with her (which is a lot because while Hillary is involved in pizzagate she is far from the only one/the top one).
