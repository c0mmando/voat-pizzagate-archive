<p>Most people don’t realize that he’s had a remarkably varied, prolific career, spanning the arts, media, business and politics.</p>
<p>One could say Saban Entertainment was the <strong>&quot;unpaid babysitter&quot;</strong> for a lot of kids childhoods, You may know that he’s the force behind many Cartoons (offshoots and reboots)</p>
<p>None of these series won any awards. High-quality entertainment they were not — but they were colorful, <strong>addictive</strong> and <strong>over-the-top</strong>, and the shows had a certain heimish feel that embodied the spirit of ’80s and ’90s TV</p>

<p>&quot;Israel is his “issue”
In 2001, Saban Entertainment was sold to the Walt Disney Company as part of a deal with Fox Family Channel for $5 billion. Saban’s take? $1.7 billion. “I’m a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel,” Saban told The New Yorker in 2010. He said he advances his advocacy in three ways: he funds think-tanks, invests in media outlets and donates a whole lot to political parties. Between June 2015 and June 2016, Saban donated $7 million to Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton Super PAC. He’s currently chairman of Univision In 2006, a group of investors led by Saban made a bid to purchase Univision Communications. They won the bid, and purchased the communication company for a whopping $13.6 billion, which is currently the largest Spanish-language media company in the US.</p>

            Saban bought DiC, he was not the originator of the catalog. DiC was a Luxembourgish company and I have worked with the founder in the past. Basically the source of all wildly popular shows in the 80s and 90 like Inspector Gadget and Care Bears. All of it utter consumeristic trash in my opinion. What fascinated me most about Chalopin is his complex tax avoidance organization. Also, it's because of him that I know how expensive it is to own a castle in France and property in the Carribean and wouldn't care to have either LOL

            Probably the biggest money in politics is the Koch Brothers who have built a whole network over the years, they don't show up as high on invidual lists but they control the full network's contributions. Almost a billion dollars over the past decade.

            The title sequence explained the plot; Kidd Video and his band of the same name (played by live-action performers in the first half of the title sequence) were kidnapped by a villain named Master Blaster, and transported to Master Blaster's home dimension, a cartoon world called The Flipside. They were rescued by a fairy named Glitter, and subsequently spent each episode of the series either helping to free the denizens of the Flipside from Master Blaster's rule, or trying to find a way back to the "real world". Master Blaster, a caricature of a corrupt rock manager or music executive, flew around the sky in his floating castle, which resembled a giant jukebox.
           </p>
           <p>
            The show was dominated by an MTV-esque, music video theme. Each episode featured at least one action sequence set to a popular song, and the heroes would often distract their enemies by showing current music videos, and sneak off while the enemies were entranced. Each episode also ended with a live-action music video by Kidd Video.

           <p>
            Animated television series (1981) that updates the Greek mythology of Odysseus (known as "Ulysses" in Latin) to the 31st century.
           </p>
           <p>
            produced by DIC Audiovisuel in conjunction with anime studio Tokyo Movie Shinsha.
           </p>
           <p>
            The plot line of the series (made by the French Jean Chalopin) describes the struggles of Ulysses and his crew against the divine entities that rule the universe, the ancient gods from Greek mythology. The Gods of Olympus are angered when Ulysses, commander of the giant spaceship Odyssey, kills the giant Cyclops to save a group of enslaved children, including his son. Zeus sentences Ulysses to travel the universe with his crew frozen until he finds the Kingdom of Hades, at which point his crew will be revived and he will be able to return to Earth.

             That mark in the saturn logo is also a 666 which signifies the "mark of the beast" from the Bible. Nobody is quite positive whether it is devil worship, or something deeper. It is everywhere. Let this man show you what I mean using a T-mobile commercial as an example:
            </p>

             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNIkNlW4VU&amp;list=PLjiPOC8yurzuuTD_HkcUudB0tslPIsWLX">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyNIkNlW4VU&amp;list=PLjiPOC8yurzuuTD_HkcUudB0tslPIsWLX
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             That logo is used ubiquitously by Jews (the super fucked up ones) in their global "market". (6)eats headphones all have three 6's. Google chrome logo is three 6's. Ubuntu logo. Literally most international Jew companies have some sort of bullshit symbolism in their logos.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anywhere you see an "XXX" or a "OOO" or any of their mixtures, its a nod to the same whatever it is. This is because X and O are the 24th and 15th letters of the alphabet, and reduced gematria gives you 2+4=6 and 1+5=6. This allows these guys to hide their public symbolism in plain sight. In addition to "666", the crossing of the X and O is the mark of his throne, whoever "he" is.
            </p>

             I don't fucking understand why their entire mantra is sodomy, and sexual perversion, which is evident by the food allegories. I doubt that it is just a cult (which happens to own the world) saying "fuck you" to what they perceive to be a "god". This seems deeper.

               searching for names of art collectors on Pinterest gives better results for finding pieces inside there collections
for example "peter norton" or "norton collection" but also for the artists, for example Kara Walker.
