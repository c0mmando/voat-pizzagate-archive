<p>At least 8 Wisconsin priests are on the Jesuits\' latest list of accused abusers</p>
<p>At least eight Catholic priests with ties to Wisconsin are among those identified in an effort by the Jesuit religious order to make public the names of priests and brothers with credible allegations  against them.</p>
<p>The Midwest list includes four accused of molesting minors while they were serving at Marquette University or Marquette University High School. Allegations against four others stem from their time at Campion High School in Prairie du Chien.</p>
<p>It also identifies two additional Chicago priests supervised by former Marquette University President Robert Wild.</p>
<p>The Jesuits are the latest Catholic institution to divulge the names of known/suspected offenders  which identified more than 300 abusive priests believed to have molested at least 1,000 children and prompted at least a dozen criminal investigations of church activities across the country.</p>
<p>Midwest Provincial Brian Paulson said the decision was in response to the growing demands by Catholics for transparency and accountability by church leaders and that he hoped releasing the names would provide a &quot;measure of healing for victims.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jesuit priests with Wisconsin ties
The following Jesuits were accused of abusing minors during their time in Milwaukee, according to the Midwest list:</p>
<p>Robert J. Joda, who was accused of abusing a minor in 1970 while at Marquette Univ. He was permanently removed from public ministry.
Robert E. Joyce, who was accused of abusing more than one minor between 1963 and 1965 while at Marquette Univ High Schl. He was dismissed from the order in 1965.
Michael R. Kolb, who was accused of abusing a minor in 1986 while at Marquette Univ High Schl. He was permanently removed from public ministry.
Perry L. Robinson, who was quietly fired in 1988 from Marquette Univ H Schl for taking nude photographs of students. He was transferred to a parish in Ralston, Nebraska, but was permanently removed from public ministry in 2011 after that history became public. Robinson was twice sent to a Maryland treatment center, including once before the cache of photos was found, according to a 2011 letter from the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests to then-Wisconsin Provincial Tom Krettek.
Four others — J. Michael Cannon, Thomas R. Haller, J. Roger Lucey and James V. O\'Connor — are believed to have abused minors while at Campion High School in Prairie du Chien.</p>
<p>It\'s unclear how many of the Midwest priests who molested minors elsewhere may have also served in Wisconsin because the Midwest province, unlike the others, did not publish members\' assignment histories. But cross-checking the names with other lists shows at least three: Burton J. Fraser and Francis M. Landwermeyer, who had served at Marquette University; and Francis X. Nawn, who had been at both Marquette High and Campion Prep in Prairie du Chien.</p>
<p>The Midwest list also includes the Revs. Lawrence Reuter and Donald O\'Shaughnessy, both of whom had served at Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Illinois, during Wild\'s tenure.</p>
<p>O\'Shaughnessy was accused by at least three men of abusing them at the academy, where he taught. He was removed from ministry and the Jesuits paid about $2.6 million to settle those claims.
Reuter, who served as the school\'s president , was removed from active ministry in 2010 after admitting to an &quot;inappropriate relationship&quot; with an 18-year-old male student during his time there, according to news accounts. The Jesuits reached a settlement with the student in the 1990s but allowed Reuter to remain in ministry. A second man also alleged Reuter abused him while he was a student in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Jesuits\' West Province earlier identified Donald McGuire, a former Chicago priest accused of molesting several boys, including some in Wisconsin, for decades beginning in the 1960s. He was convicted on several state and federal counts in 2006. He was defrocked a year later and died in 2017 while serving a 25-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>Terry McKiernan of the nonprofit advocacy site BishopsAccountability.org said the west and south-central provinces omitted at least 30 names of abusers who had served in their jurisdictions in the lists made public Dec. 7. </p>
<p>Paulson, who heads the Midwest Province, said it was questioning by student journalists and not the pending release of the Jesuit names that prompted Wild to pull his name from the new Marquette dorm in September.
At least $3 billion in settlements
The sex abuse scandal has cost the U.S. Catholic Church at least $4 billion since the 1950s.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, there are at least 122 Wisconsin priests and brothers, and one Catholic sister, who have been publicly accused of sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable adults, according to church and court records and an extensive database maintained by BishopsAccountability.org. Most of those are diocesan priests, including more than 50 who served in the 10-county Archdiocese of Milwaukee.
The archdiocese paid $21 million to about 350 victims to emerge from a bankruptcy in 2015.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee archdiocese lists 48 diocesan priests with credible allegations on its website. Lawyers for abuse survivors say there are at least 100 additional accused abusers identified in documents sealed as part of the bankruptcy record. </p>
<p>None of the other Wisconsin dioceses — Madison, Green Bay, La Crosse and Superior — lists their abusers online. </p>

            A FIFTH North American province, the NORTHEAST, plans to release its list of accused clergy on January 15, according to a spokesman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Combining the four public lists, more than 230 Jesuits have been credibly accused of sexually abusing a minor in the United States since the 1950s
           </p>
           <p>
            THE JESUITS are trying to confuse the public. Each successive release of Jesuit Priests makes the uninformed think the successive releases are "old news". Additionally, these lists are verifiably INCOMPLETE based on publically available court documents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Experts who track abuse and priest assignments in the church have questioned the Jesuits' lists, saying they omitted dozens of priests who have been credibly accused.
           </p>
           <p>
            "If the Jesuits aren't including guys we already know about on their lists, then I don't have a lot of confidence that they're including the guys that nobody knows about yet," said Terence McKiernan, president and co-director of the watchdog website BishopAccountability.org.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is all because of Pennsylvania. The Catholics are only pretending to clean house/act contrite because the public is waking up

            P.S. Pope Francis' birthday was December 17. I find it interesting that 2 provinces released these lists. Last year he celebrated with a 13 foot pizza and a lot of little kids
