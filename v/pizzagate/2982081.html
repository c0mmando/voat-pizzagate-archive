<blockquote>
<p>If Oregon Governor Kate Brown has her way, the Beaver State will become the first to <strong>require universal home visits for newborn children in the care of their own parents.</strong></p>
<p>Senate Bill 526, introduced this month in the Oregon Legislative Assembly as part of Brown\'s budget, orders the Oregon Health Authority to &quot;study home visiting by licensed health care providers.&quot; Lawmakers went so far as to declare that SB 526 is an <strong>&quot;emergency&quot; measure</strong> — one that requires a resolution by the end of the year. The intro to the bill, the language of which has not yet been crafted, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oregon Health Authority shall study home visiting by licensed health care providers in this state. The authority shall submit findings and recommendations for legislation to an interim committee of the Legislative Assembly related to health care not later than December 31, 2019.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the 18 sponsors of the bill claim that its passage is “<strong><em>necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety,&quot; and therefore &quot;an emergency is declared to exist.</em></strong>”</p>

             They want to make sure every baby gets vaccinated. Then, when parents see the affects in their children (autism, speech delay, seizures,etc.) the health worker can cover it up. Perhaps the children who develop AUTISM will be told to take TRANSGENDER meds. SICK!

"A whistleblowing teacher has claimed that numerous vulnerable children at one British school are being tricked into believing they are the wrong gender, the Mail on Sunday reports.
The anonymous teacher reported that she was asked not to tell colleagues or parents if a student stated that they were transgender.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the paper, older students at the school who already identify as transgender are influencing younger pupils."

Now—we have remarkable new information: a respected pro-vaccine medical expert used by the federal government to debunk the vaccine-autism link, says vaccines can cause autism after all. He claims he told that to government officials long ago, but they kept it secret."

              AUTISM/ VACCINE BACKGROUND
1986, Reagan signed a Big Pharma protection bill which removed corporate liability for VACCINE MANUFACTURERS.  AUTISM RARELY HEARD OF.   1987, Vaccine schedule was expanded, increasing overall mercury (adjuvant) content.  NEW SCHEDULE SAFETY NOT TESTED. As a result of more vaccines, combo vaccines were introduced. BY 1990, THE AUTISM RATE EXPLODED:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Up until 1990, autism was not included in legislation aimed at guaranteeing an education to individuals with handicaps. In 1990, the new Individuals with Disabilities Education Act added autism to its list of categories of children and youth served under the act. The new law also added transition services and assistive technologies to its requirements. Autism had never been tracked as an educational statistic before 1990. Since 1990, the incidence of autism in schools has risen dramatically.
In 1991, the Autism Diagnostic Interview was published. This was the first generally recognized tool for diagnosing autism.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1992, the American Psychiatric Association released the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV), which refined diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder. Autism became a spectrum disorder; in essence, it became possible for someone to be very autistic or mildly autistic. New diagnoses, including the "high functioning" Asperger syndrome and the "catch-all" PDD-NOS, were added to the manual.
In the early 1990s, with new diagnostic tools and categories available, autism diagnoses began to soar. In the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, the number of American schoolchildren with autism diagnoses increased by over 800%. Between 2000 and 2010, the number went from 1:150 to 1:68."

               "Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health contributed to a new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that finds the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among 11 surveillance sites as one in 59 among children aged 8 years in 2014 (or 1.7 percent). This marks a 15 percent increase from the most recent report two years ago, and the highest prevalence since the CDC began tracking ASD in 2000. Consistent with previous reports, boys were four times more likely to be identified with ASD than girls. The rate is one in 38 among boys (or 2.7 percent) and one in 152 among girls (or 0.7 percent)."

            Oregon is a very sinister place to try to stay alive. When I was visiting family there Kate Brown tried to pass a bill making murder legal. It passed the senate.
When it got to the House  they wouldn't vote on it. Kate Brown is a psychopath. Oh, the people she tried to murder were old people diagnosed with altzheimers and dementia. And the mentally ill.

             Most of modern day brain diseases are caused by insulin toxicity ...caused by refined foods that lack vitamin b's...
Insulin toxicity is also the cause of cardiac problems, high blood pressure and diabetes...
            </p>
            <p>
             The scientofic papers clearly show this...one has to read about a dozen papers on i sulin toxicity to relaise that the pwtb know this ...
So they feed us to poison us...and when we fall ill...they milk us via pharmas...and to avoid the costs and pensions they r arranging to kill us...doctor with a licence to kill..
..
Keep feeding the debt system folks..and keep complaini g about the sociopaths we feed...
Dont do anything about revering the system via debt  reduction..
Not one here will even spend even 10 dollars annd instruct the treasury to reduce its debt ...
But u will spend hours and hours complaning ...when all it takes is one email to ur own treasury .instructing them to reduce debt ..and aknowledge ur surety right over them...
The American public deserves these sociopaths ...because it would rather imprison themselves and their children ...than send one email and 10 dollars and even try to reverse their predicament ..
Amoronica ...not America

              Did you happen to catch the President's tweet a month ago in which he said "He who has the gold gets to make the rules"? That was a signal that we are ready this time to stick it to the bankers when they attack us again. The whole world has been preparing for this event and thanks to POTUS, we are now prepared too. It will hurt in the short run but it will set us free.

               "“If an individual has had 5 consecutive flu shots between 1970 – 1980 (the years of the study) his / her chance of developing Alzheimer’s Disease is 10 times greater than if they had one, two or no shots.”   When asked why this is, Dr. Fudenberg stated that, “It is due to the mercury and aluminum buildup that is in every flu shot. The gradual mercury and aluminum buildup in the brain causes cognitive dysfunction.”"

               Just like autism. The shots help create the problem, which is then solved by giving more meds (more drug money) or death. A relative is currently in an Alzheimer's assisted living. Flu shots are pushed. 5 people died within 2 weeks after getting the shots. Just a "coincidence." This was in October, when they first start giving them, and no one had the flu. Most patients are 50-60 range, and a surprising number are doctors and college professors. They would have had many vaccines. Of course this is just anecdotal..... Costs can be up to $5,000/ month. This is why insurance companies do not want to pay.  They are being diagnosed much earlier. The Age of Autism children are turning 30 and soon they will need the same type of care and facilities.....Lying and coverup saves money!

                In Asia they have cost-free and sanitary ass sprayers next to the toilets, like a bidet.  Here in the USA one must pay approximately $25 a month just to wipe one's ass!  Talk about montetizing life!

                 "The scientist, Hattiesburg native, and now William Carey Assistant Professor is awarded with the patent for a DNA vaccine she and her team at the University of Pennsylvania have worked on since 2011...."The vaccine prevents infection from a neurotoxin that’s produced by a strain of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum." 
The vaccine would protect the U.S. military against what has been deemed a bio-weapons agent, teaching the recipient's immune system to fight off a potentially deadly infection.
"The vaccine is a DNA vaccine, which is a synthetic vaccine, meaning we don't use any cells or any viruses," Scott said. "We use genetic DNA that is inserted into a structure called a plasmid."
If someone in the military inhaled the toxin, it could cause their muscles to stop moving, including the muscles associated with their lungs that help them breathe. The vaccine would prevent this."

              I am not up to speed on Oregon politics, other than that they are severely Left Coast. My comment is based on the clickbaity title of the post and the lack of anything talking about "in-home surveillance" in the text of the bill that was linked.

                Bills and statutes are introduced so as to control the debt bill of the US fed ...prison populations exist to control inflation via the creation of a slave labour low wage work force..
Keep feeding the debt system folks..and keep complaini g about the sociopaths we feed...
Dont do anything about reversing the system via debt  reduction..
Not one here will even spend even 10 dollars annd instruct the treasury to reduce its debt ...
But u will spend hours and hours complaning ...when all it takes is one email to ur own treasury .instructing them to reduce debt ..and aknowledge ur surety right over them...
The American public deserves these sociopaths ...because it would rather imprison themselves and their children ...than send one email and 10 dollars and even try to reverse their predicament ..
Amoronica ...not America

                Someone needs to give them the finger, and then take it to the Supreme Court. I do believe this might fall under "unreasonable search and siezure". That's a hellish path to tread for a family, but it's the only way we are going to be able to stop this crap, ultimately.

                I can tell you, if I were an Oregonian, I would refuse. Or at the very least, have some nanny cams recording everything any time those statists were in my home, as corroborating evidence.

             I'm just picturing it now, the dystopian future. A room filled with screens, on every one there's a different baby; sleeping, playing with blocks, being fed, crying in an apartment surrounded by squalor. In the corner of each screen,  there's a 5-character identifier. A well dressed man walks into the white, fluorescent room and sits in the single chair that's set in the middle of the room. He studies the screens until one of the babies catches his eyes- a little boy is laughing, hands pressed against the window of his room, while a small bird is chirping from outside. "C45J1", the man calls out, licking his lips. He stands up, straightens out wrinkles that had formed on his jacket, and calmly walks out of the room. The focus goes back to the baby, who's now pressing his face against the window, playfully pounding his fists against the glass. Suddenly the baby's focus is stolen from something off the camera. He starts crying. Moments later, a man dressed in a SWAT-type uniform, comes into frame. He picks up the now-crying child, and turns to take him out of the room. As he does, you can catch a glimpse of his department badge on his sleeve; "DCFS."

              I also think that part of your image of the future is already partly true.  Many children in squalor with zero guidance these days with crack/heroin/fentanyl/etc/etc addicted mothers, thinking their babies and toddlers should raise themselves!

               I just read the book for the first time in the past year. What a mind fuck as to how long this globalist human-farming plan has been in the works. I worked in social work years ago and left because it became clear that the states intention is to fuck families at every turn.

              They are doing to us, just as "Wall Street" and their lackey Karl Marx did to Russia.
Read GULAG ARCHIPELAGO by Russian dissident  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1973). You will never be the same. The first-hand descriptions of communist torture sounds much like SRI.
             </p>
             <p>
              THE BLACK BOOK OF COMMUNISM is also a good read on the topic. Communism murdered/tortured more people than Nazism. 60 million under Mao and 40 million under Stalin.
This time, though, they will not be so direct. Vaccines?
