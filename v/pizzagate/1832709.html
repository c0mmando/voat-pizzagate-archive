            "CIA is not Jesuit, it's Jewish" I love watching you make this shit up, and state it seriously without citing evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Jesuit is Jewish" - I guess my electric bill is a Cabala-loving Jew too, huh. Wow.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Jewish fairytales. Hey, while we're add it, do you believe in the holocaust then?" Another piece of bullshit deflection from this issue which is the military and elite sexually abusing kids. Go to a conspiracy sub if you want to argue for or against the holocaust.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Military Nazi type" was my shorthand for exactly what Aquino is; unlike 99% of what you've said which had no evidence supporting it, Aquino was accused in court by victims of ritual abuse specifically as part of the MKULTRA program. The victim, Bonnacci, was awarded $1 million in his lawsuit where he testified regarding this.  (You probably don't know what the Franklin Scandal was. Lel) Unlike you, I've cited facts and evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've repetitively spouted half truths, and straight up crap. I wouldn't bother feeding a low level troll like yourself, except for the unfortunate fact that gullible people might not realize how full of shit you are.

            Again, a few of the facts you stated are true, most are bullshit. I know that any fact that doesn't fit your narrative is just going to have "JOOO" spluttered in all caps all over it. But just for the luls.

            " MK-Ultra was created by Jewish-controlled CIA"
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA is Jesuit. Have you looked at Georgetown? There are more than one faction operating in all this. You're either a shill working on having pedogate dismissed as a crazy alt-right narrative, or you are a well intentioned idiot.

            "Nazis" had nothing to do with any kind of mind-control experiments."
           </p>
           <p>
            Rofl. That is straight up bullshit and you know it. We imported the Nazi experiments done by Mengele (which if you knew anything you'd know
            <a href="https://xeper.org/maquino/nm/AquinoVitae.pdf">
             Rockefeller

            funded in part prior and during WW2) and we continued them. We imported Nazi scientists and developed MKULTRA which also went along with SRA.

            Want to talk about

            Who died and made you king of all knowledge?  Since you are aiming to put throwaway345678 in one of only two boxes maybe it is you that fits in one of those two boxes.  Your argument is not an argument to persuade rather, it's a statement of opinion.

            I'm always so on the fence with these videos.  I watched the original with the subtitles and the guy seems very serious.  Especially when he tears up.  He seemed legit at first glance.  I've seen a lot of videos of supposed 'whistleblowers' that detail the elites being Satan worshippers and partaking in rituals and sacrifices...but at the same time...they bring in the aspect of this all being a God. vs. Devil issue and they're heavily religious themselves.  But this guy...he mentions the devil worshipping and he mentions how he didn't pay it any mind as far as it being legit or him believing in Satanic magical powers...and instead remarked on how he believes that at least the elites believe in it and the elites believe in the power of worshipping Satan....instead of him being "God will save us all!!"  Because...I am more inclined to believe a man who is unbiased in detailing how he witnessed others participating in SRA and the like without shilling his own Christianity on top of a pedestal.
           </p>
           <p>
            But again...on the other side of it...you're right...he doesn't name names.  He doesn't have much evidence outside of the testimony.  And if you argue how he'd be risking his life by divulging exact names and places,,,,isn't it enough of a risk already to even come out in the first place? Why not just give names if you’re already neck deep in whistleblowing exposure?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ugh...see...I love these vids because part of me wants it to be a smoking gun...but...I just don’t know...thoughts?

             Did he say anywhere that he got far enough into the ring to actually know details like where the kids were, who exactly was doing the abusing, etc.? From what I read, he was invited by refused to participate, and that the shift was rather sudden. My impression was that he was doing large trades to launder money...which may or may not give you insider knowledge. Does a rich guy's broker know where his limo driver is picking up hookers for him? Not likely. But I haven't had time to read the entire transcript of the video.

              The video lacks all those details, it's more like an overview. Regarding pizzagate, the most important claim is that he was required to participate sacrificing of children to enter the next circle of trust, in my understanding to be part of 8000-8500 persons ruling the economics in the world.

               Thanks for the clarification. That confirms my impression that he was invited but may not have gained access to the kinds of details people are expecting him to be able to report.

            I'm aware that while some of that is true - the Rothschilds are Jews. They are obviously fucked up and part of the international group of pedophile/satanist types.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, to scream "IT'S ALL THE JOOOOSS" is retarded and shows a lack of research.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jesuits, the CIA and the Nazis created the MKULTRA programs which are related to SRA. They are not Jews, nor do they like Jews. The Podestas and many MANY perps in this are Catholic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I think all Catholics are part of an elite child massacring cabal? No. But some establishment ones are.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there's Tavistock which is an entirely additional conversation, also not Jewish. Major figure Freud was Jewish, but the consensus I've gotten is that it's basically a branch of the Brit military.

             No it's not. And it's testimony, but he does not give evidence - no names, no dates, no places. There ARE books worth of evidence on this forum and others, buried in trash posts. And very few bother to read it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you think this is the only evidence/best evidence we have, you have not been paying attention.

               My point is that there is a lot of evidence for pedogate. This video (
               <em>
                unfortunately
               </em>
               ) is not evidence, it is personal testimony.
              </p>
              <p>
               Evidence would be: Banker named x told me to kill children. Or
              </p>
              <p>
               Financier Y was at a sex party with minors.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or: An elite group comprised of these (x, y, z) members wants me killed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or, if he really gave a damn: "They are keeping kids in these (x, y, z)  locations. Right now."
              </p>
              <p>
               If he had this type of info he could have anonymously released it to the public (I understand the authorities are full of shit).
              </p>
              <p>
               Or he could have been brave like Regina Louf in Dutroux and just told everything about everyone and taken the risk.

                 I see that. As Paul watson states: There is no indication of the validity (or not) to the man's statements. I never questioned his identity. I questioned his lack of evidence and questionable turn towards antisemitism. Which is not uncommon in this forum - but if it becomes the rallying cry of pedogate, then any hope of mainstream awareness WILL die.

                 Sigh. I am really really FOR anything that helps pedogate. I don't understand how people don't get the way this is
                 <em>
                  potentially
                 </em>
                 harmful. Do you think the elite are above using one of their own to misdirect and shill us? I hope he is legit and in that case will provide hard info. If not, then this entire investigative group is being very successfully psyopped.

                  My impression is the thirteen [crime] families compete for supremacy, sometimes cooperating and splitting up territories and income [drugs, arms, slaves] and sometimes competing.  I would expect some sort of struggle when the current "top dog" Queen Elizabeth dies - though I assume she has a succession plan.   About the best I can make of it - and then there are the "aliens!"

                I agree it is tantalisingly incomplete.  But the authorities don't seem interested in investigating.  He's giving a public talk soon - more might fall out of that.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have a feeling he might have been giving the interview to promote his bank and was led further than he intended - or, he seems a smart cookie he put out something controversial to attract coverage - or he was giving a "don't mess with me" message to people he has dirt on - or anything!

            I am not saying the guy isn't legit: but the fact that he blames this all on Jews is highly suspect to me and an old, worn out shill tactic to make us all dismissible, alt-right crazy Nazis. FFS The protocols of Zion? BTW if a person knows anything about conspiracies, they understand that part of the cabal we are currently fighting ARE the Nazis that came over after WW2 during project paperclip, &amp; others. The Nazis were the ones experimenting on MKULTRA in the early days.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's sickeningly ironic that we'd all be misdirected into hating Jews. Get a laugh on pol about (((them))) then use your damn brain.

            This voice over doesn't really capture the sorrow in Mr. Bernard's voice and this might make some people doubt his validity﻿. I recommend the subtitled version of the full interview posted here already earlier:

              Basics of journalism: When using a first hand source (like in this case, an interview), source reliability plays a key role and is determined by body language, tone, claims etc. Actually your reference to Hollywood makes you look like a shill, so have my down vote... btw, which one of these videos did you find better then?

               It's not that: He does not give any actual evidence. At all. If you think that's asking too much, see the X witnesses in Dutroux, who told everything and gave names. Especially Regina Louf. They managed this after having grown up in these rings.

               Or Bonacci in the Franklin coverup, who testified against his abusers in court including against Michael Aquino. He and other victims gave real evidence.

                We don't know if he's done that or not (anonymously). He knows he knows too much to be safe enclosing anything more under his own name. What he already did was huge - the evidence of that the problem exist and includes very high profile persons is there, not helpful re investigations but
                <strong>
                 very helpful for spreading the awareness

                which is equally important while the public still remains unaware.

                 This does not help the pizzagate/pedogate narrative. It's actually the same line shills use on this sub all day long. They just packaged it nicely in this guy.

                 ETA: It's kind've like saying Thernovich is helpful for spreading awareness after his pro Epstein, Dershowitz bullshit.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is a long history of witnesses who have come forward in the press and in court to testify on this. They gave names, dates, locations. None of them mentioned the protocols of Zion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you see the damage this does, if well intentioned people then start believing that crap? It allows the shills over at WaPo to successfully paint us all as Nazis.

                  And considering that multiple FBI anons as well as the DHS insider have mentioned the integral role of Zionism and Israel in the Pizza/Pedogate scandal, Ronald Bernard's testimony is just further confirmation of this.

                  How could anyone get an impression like "they are all Jews" from this video... It claims some of the persons he was in contact with, regarding child sacrifice, were following Luciferian religion and some protocols of Zion. This might very well be part of the pizzagate, but definitely not all.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If WaPo or others try to use this video for the claims you suggest, they're achieving nothing but shooting down their own reliability.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course, we should all be wise enough to not enter into spreading expressions like what you just did. Learn some basics of media critics, please, and have my down vote in the meanwhile.

                   If this general community gets behind a antisemitic sounding message, then that will absolutely be exploited by mainstream press.We have to be able to raise awareness, as you mentioned, among the general population who has no idea this is happening. There are already shills on here every day screaming "It's all the Jews" etc, for exactly that reason.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If we are successfully portrayed as "Nazis," then that effort will be utterly dead. People who might have been open minded about child trafficking will not hear us.

                   I care about the kids. When something is too good to be true, it often is. If you think I'm shilling, check my post history. I respect you as a poster and I'm not trying to tear you down. Critical thinking is required on this because so often, shitty people are propped up as leaders for us in this topic.

                    He mentioned Zionists.  A lot of Jews AND Christians (mostly Protestants/Evangelicals) subscribe to this philosophy.  It is CRUCIAL to look into the Zionist movement IMHO...

                    Let's avoid any generalizations and keep up spreading the awareness. Your point is important and valid in general, but not regarding this particular video. It really does not announce all of them as Jews. And no, I don't think you're a shill, and I hope you never will be.
