            Church officials were in touch with Castillo until Feb. 21, when several people attempted to contact him unsuccessfully, said Helen Osman, a diocese spokeswoman. She said the diocese had to check every jail and hospital in the area before they could report him missing Feb. 23
           </p>
           <p>
            .Less than a week later, he was apparently located by police. Oakland police on Friday informed church officials that Castillo had been “found” but would not confirm where, Osman said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “They would not provide us with information on his whereabouts, except that he has left the country,” she said. “They also informed us they have completed their criminal investigation.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Church and law enforcement officials have not released other details about the alleged sexual misconduct. Castillo remains on leave and may not present himself as a priest or work as a priest in a public ministry, church officials said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It should be noted during this investigation so far, it has not been determined any crimes have been committed in the City of Oakland,” said Johnna Watson, an Oakland police spokeswoman.
           </p>
           <p>
            The case is now being handled by the Alameda County district attorney’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            WOW.  If this isn't a Classic Case of Collusion between the Church and LE, I don't know what is.
