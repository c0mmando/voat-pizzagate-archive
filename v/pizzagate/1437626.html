           Using a throwaway for this, and no, I've never used Voat before the pizzagate subreddit was axed. I don't have any proof and my sleuthing skills are a bit sub-par (at least, compared to you lot) but I had a thought come up and figured I could toss it your way and see if anyone wanted to have a look.

            How would you find a list of freemasons?  Isn''t that not public information.  Most freemasons are harmless probably, no need to inflame them. If the child sex allegations are true, just focus on the people that got out of line.   Child slavery is a worldwide issue, all you can do is to protect your own.
