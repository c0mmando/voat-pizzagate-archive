               There is a lot of truth in that.
              </p>
              <p>
               At least 50%, though, is that the affluent are deadly afraid of what others will think. They have a lot to lose. They don't want to lose their reputations, because it could compromise their income/wealth/standing. Anyone can make money; not everyone can attain power or prestige. That is a powerful motivator to stay in shape, not party to the point of self-destruction, and invest in quality healthcare. It is one of the biggest differences I've seen between the rich and everyone else. I think it's one reason they go over the top being "foodies".
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't think it's an accident that the rich will shell out forty grand for rehab, or eight grand a month to put their kids in rehab boarding schools, and insurance will not cover it for lower income folks. I think they want the lower income folks to succumb to alcohol, drugs and despair and weed themselves out of the gene pool.

               I hear you. The actual problem with Frazzledrip, in my opinion, is that nobody can prove they have seen it. Sometimes screenshots surface which all turn out to be fake. Unlike the Podesta emails and Comet Ping Pong IG posts, we have none undeniable proof of Frazzledrip.
              </p>
              <p>
               This makes me feel like this is a disinformation operation to discredit the "Pizzagaters", us.
              </p>

               But if there is something I have missed about the Frazzledrip, I would like to read more about it just in case.

                Supposedly the FBI and the NYPD have copies of what was on Weiner's laptop. Either one could be approached by an attorney representing Hillary and Uma to see if such a video is in their possession.  They should be able to disclose if a file code named "frazzledrip" was on Weiner's laptop. For some reason, NO ONE HAS ASKED. Did Pompeo assist, as CIA director, with the arrest of pedo Peter Dalglish in Nepal? Specifically, what information has been found that would debunk the news story? Here's more on the arrest of Dalglish in Nepal:

                 I did bit more research on it and now I can understand it better. Turns out that it could be some sort of pre-emptive damage control. Smear the whole thing with disinfo in case the video should ever leak for real. It seems like it never ended up to "dark web". In another hand a lot of things are pointing that this Frazzledrip is indeed real. Some speculate if it's a photo rather than a video but it seems to exist either way.

                 I swear, this whole Pizzagate is so crazy that I'm not always sure if this is real life or not.

             "Let's look at semite Rep. Jamie Raskin who is the one questioning Google head about "Frazzledrip" and comments on Edgar Maddison Welch incident at Comet Ping Pong as well as claims of child sacrifice and cannibalism mentioned by researchers. His video exchange is covered currently at

             Washington Jewish Week Editorial Board: Jamie Raskin for Maryland District 8:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Raskin rises above this year’s crowded slate of candidates, and does so in an impressive fashion. Since being elected to Maryland’s upper house in 2006, he has built a solid, verifiable progressive record. He has been the floor leader on bills to establish the right to same-sex marriage and to repeal the death penalty. He supported expansion of Maryland’s ignition interlock device program. He has worked to protect women’s reproductive rights, and has a solid record on the environment, including backing legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. His work in immigration reform has been practical, and he’s kept his sights on comprehensive reform."
            </p>
            <p>
             "As a constitutional law scholar, author and law professor Raskin has a deep understanding of government and the legislative processes."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Raskin also has a strong, deeply rooted support for the State of Israel, and a clearly expressed commitment to work toward the achievement of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Add to all that Raskin’s strong ties to our Jewish community..."

            </p>
            <p>
             "Raskin said he wanted the Trump administration to authorize an investigation into the ongoing trend of anti-Semitic episodes, which he argued was far more necessary than the new office within the Department of Homeland Security that Trump was establishing to investigate crimes committed by people in the country illegally."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Raskin is emphatic to note that while he received support from J Street, he also had backers as a candidate more aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, also known as AIPAC."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Israel, Raskin insisted, needed to prioritize disentangling itself from the millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank, something he argued was necessary for the sustainability of the Zionist ideal."

             ADDENDUM:
Much research was done by VOATERS regarding an alleged file on Weiner's laptop marked "insurance". It was originally reported that the NYPD gained access to the laptop when searching for evidence in Weiner's phone texting scandal with a minor. That's when Clinton emails were found. Alt news researchers reported that Chief of NYPD police was sickened at CP evidence found on the laptop. It was after this that references to "frazzeldrip" video appeared and claimed it was on the Dark Web. All the other claims about Weiners' laptop have proven to be true. "Frazzeldrip" has never been DISPROVEN. Raskin, a Clinton supporter, brought this up. His intent is to make the claims sound crazy, and use GOOGLE to shut down free speech by using this perceived extreme as an example. There was other info on who supposedly leaked the video to the dark web. I'll try to locate and post.

The reporting on the arrest of pedo suspect Peter Dalglish appears to be accurate and was thoroughly discussed on VOAT when it happened. His involvement with "frazzeldrip" has not been proven.

              "FRAZZELDRIP IS REAL"
             </p>
             <p>
              "The original video for this post was taken down. This is Defango’s report about it. He refers to a “PDAnon”, which may have been Peter Dalglish who has been indefintely detained in a Tibetan jail, pending trial since April 8, 2018. More details about Dalglish below."

              "I have it on the authority of my own “Deep Throat” that what I’ve written below is true."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Peter Dalglish, a Senior Adviser to the UN’s World Health Organization, celebrated for over 30 years as a champion of charitable causes for at-risk children, the recipient of numerous awards in recognition of his humanitarianism, including the Canadian equivalent of a knighthood was arrested two weeks ago in Kathmandu, Nepal by local police on allegations of child sexual abuse. Preliminary investigations suggest that Dalglish might have sexually abused many children and he’s been in custody ever since.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dalglish is the one responsible for leaking a copy of the infamous Hillary-and-Huma pedophilia s*uff video to the dark web, codenamed Frazzeldrip on Anthony Weiner's computer. Yes, this video clip and others like it are real and Dalglish posted them all the way from Nepal. He had been threatening to do this, presumably to blackmail powerful people to help him avoid arrest.
             </p>
             <p>
              You may recall reports of this video being found on Anthony Weiner's laptop in a folder named “Life Insurance” and that the NYPD and FBI each have copies.So how did Dalglish get it? That is THE question. This video has been likened to a Rosetta Stone that connects senior American politicians like Clinton to an elite global pedophile ring."
             </p>
             <p>
              Other sites reported the same story around the same time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's another alleged angle to the story involving then CIA Director Pompeo. Again, Sorcha Faal is known to publish disinfo sometimes. Can't find it now, but this account was also reported by more reliable sources.

               "Reportedly the CIA advance team arrived in Nepal after analysts recorded a “significant increase” in “dark web” communications emanating from the home of Peter John Dalglish during the first week of April, which is believed to be when he released to the “dark web” a video file code named "Frazzledrip"....."
              </p>
              <p>
               "It is not understood why Peter John Dalglish has posted these horrifically demonic videos to the “dark web”, but it can be assumed to be an effort to blackmail “Deep State” leaders, including Clinton, in order to stop his capture by newly installed CIA forces loyal to President Trump, being overseen by Director Pompeo, who successfully aided in his capture."

               Comments from a site named "News From the Perimeter"  - one I had never heard of.
              </p>
              <p>
               MY OPINION
Seems that the "frazzledrip" story came from one source and was spread to "popup" websites. Given the nature of the disclosure and the fact that this video, if it exists, could not be viewed, means that the story could be true or not. If such a "Life Insurance" exists, the owners would want it covered up and would go to great lengths to do so. If actually found during a police investigation and became known to others who want it released, the current story might be true. The story of the video's existence and release is at least PLAUSIBLE, given the surrounding evidence. Currently, it would be hard to prove without finding the source of the story and video.

In 1978, she staged a performance (A Banquet: A Fashion Show of Body Parts) within her first spatial environment, Confrontation (1978), at the Hamilton Gallery of Contemporary Art, New York. In 1980, she met Jerry Gorovoy, who included her in a group show he curated at the Max Hutchinson Gallery, New York. Gorovoy would subsequently become her full-time assistant and remained a constant presence for the rest of her life."

            Oh shock, I am surprised he is a DemonRat laying out so graphically what is suspected of being online, sounds like he wanted it out there, albeit to ultimately ban 'extreme right' viewpoints.  I have been on here for 2 years and knew/heard about the contents on the Weiner laptop, but never that graphic.  What is the motive? I reckon its so that it sounds too extreme that people will dismiss it if it comes out.

            Think about it: A sitting congressman (Raskin) actually had the kahones to bring up the "Frazzledrip" posts to Google CEO Sundar, even if he was doing it to try to kill the story. Doesn't matter. He actually spelled out the details of the alleged video that allegedly shows HRC with fangs and a bloody face saying that she just drank the blood of a dead child. I guess Raskin doesn't understand how just saying that will plant the idea in people's heads and get a whole lot of people wondering about it and then hopefully starting their own investigation. These people really ARE stupid!

             Q said that if people learn the truth, most will end up in the hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think they're relying on US to disseminate the information.  It will happen through osmosis and diffusion.  People will hear of it and become curious.   It will spread through osmosis and diffusion.  I  think if the truth is introduced slowly, and most people can handle it.  If they can't, go to a support group.  To know the truth and stop these crimes is the least the average person can do.
            </p>
            <p>
             The truth is like a lion.  Set it free, and it will take care of itself.

             That's the point. Whether he was being serious or just trying to poke fun at us, all the people in that room heard his words. All the cameramen heard his words. All who were watching C-span heard his words. All who were watching the fox news channel heard his words.

             While a majority (I assume) are going to just shrug it off their shoulders, a minority will actually dig into things and see everything as it is.

              Pretty much. I would say it's a positive, however painful it was to hear him quote the Washington Post. Vox's take on this, as of 14 hours ago:

            Propaganda?  WTH?  Members of both sides of the aisle that are part of Deep State have been feeding plenty of propaganda to MSM for decades.  Conspiracy Theory was a product of the CIA in order be able to do exactly what they are doing in this video.  Calling us out on what they say are deranged statements.  Me thinks they shoe is on the other foot.

             An article by one Their Own- BBC

             A self-confessed “needle-phobe”, Browning had not been looking forward to the feeding. “I’m actually pretty fearful of anything sharp approaching my skin,” he says. But as a researcher at Louisiana State University, he was willing to go through with it for his latest project: an ethnographic study of the New Orleans “real vampire” community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was the blood-feeding a religious ritual, a delusion, or a fetish? Before he had met any vampires, Browning suspected they had just blurred the line between fact and fiction. “I’d assumed that these people were bonkers and had just read too many Anne Rice novels.”
            </p>
            <p>
             By the time he had offered himself as a donor, however, his opinions had taken a U-turn. Many real-life vampires have no belief in the paranormal and have little more than a passing knowledge of True Blood or Dracula; nor do they appear to have any psychiatric issues. Instead, they claim to suffer from a strange medical condition – fatigue, headaches, and excruciating stomach pain – which, they believe, can only be treated by feeding on another human’s blood.
            </p>
            <p>
             “There are thousands of people doing this in just the US alone, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence, and I don’t think it’s a fad,” says Browning.  Their symptoms and behaviour are a genuine mystery.
            </p>

             For many, real-life vampirism is a taboo; over the last few decades, it has come to be associated with gruesome murders such as the notorious case of Rod Ferrell in the US, a deluded killer apparently inspired by a fantasy role-playing game. “When people talk about self-identified vampires, a lot of times these horrible images come to mind,” says DJ Williams, a sociologist at Idaho State University. “So the community has been closed and suspicious of outsiders.” As a result of the stigma, the vampires I've contacted online have asked me to use aliases within this article.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was not always this way; across history, we can find cases where human blood was considered a bona-fide medical cure. At the end of the 15th Century, for instance, Pope Innocent VIII’s physician allegedly bled three young men to death and fed their blood (still warm) to his dying master, with the hope that it might pass on their youthful vitality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later on, it was used to treat epilepsy; the afflicted were encouraged to gather around the gallows and collect the warm blood dripping from recently executed criminals. “Blood was a medium between the physical and spiritual,” explains Richard Sugg at the University of Durham, who recently wrote a book on “corpse medicine” and who is currently writing a volume on vampirism. By drinking the blood of a healthy young man, he says, you were imbibing his spirit and curing whatever afflicted your soul. These treatments only fell out of favour following the Enlightenment, and the onset of a more general sense of prudery that took hold in the 18th and 19th Centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a common tale that seemed to resonate with most of the vampires he met. Besides relentless fatigue, other common symptoms appear to include severe headaches and stomach cramps. CJ!, for instance, has been plagued with an irritable bowel, which she says can only be cured after a drink of blood. “After consuming a sizeable quantity (somewhere between seven shot glasses to even a cup), our digestive system works wonderfully.”
            </p>

             Can you please clue us in on this?  Did you not say that this can be from sexual abuse?
Possibly some of these drinkers have been sexually abused and if so have been doing it for years and years waiting for the cure.

                I read the book, and it's actually a great book..really well researched, well-written, and gives a great look into what life was like in the middle ages. Tons of apothecaries used blood (animal and human) as ingredients in remedies for various things, not just jewish ones. Often times the blood would be soaked on a feather and set by the fire and turned to a powder, that would then be mixed with various things. Rabbis used it in circumcisions, as the anti-coagulants still present in the dried blood helped the brisk wound heal faster. A lot of times, blood was procured voluntarily from gentile children (the preferred donor for jewish rituals for whatever reason)...some jewish person would pay a guy, and they'd make a little prick on the guys son hand, and collect a little bit of his blood, pay them for their trouble, and that was that.
               </p>
               <p>
                But then there's the stories of the jews that snatched up wayward little boys and killed them for their blood (because it was a hot/expensive commodity). Multiple recorded cases of it throughout different geography and time. Always happened before a jewish holy day...it was traditionally used in making Matzah, but animal blood was most frequently used. Toaff concludes that, while most of the legal documents related to the trials of those accused of such crimes are often dismissed as anti-semitic excuses for unsolved crimes, obtained under torture by jewish scapegoats, by many historians, actually a lot weren't obtained under torture and if you understand the historical context, many of these crimes probably did happen.
               </p>
               <p>
                He specifically calls out Ashkenazi jews as the ones who would do this. Torah forbids using any kind of blood for anything.
               </p>
               <p>
                Really interesting read. More than anything, it taught me that human beings are kind of the same as we've always been. We think the middle ages was so 'dark' and 'unenlightened', but really it was the same shit we have today minus a ton of technology. We still use human blood to cure people (transfusions). The way society was structured and how we existed with one another is essentially the same.

                 Transfusions for someone that is very ill and needs fresh blood that has willfully donated is one thing.  But killing people for their blood or taking it from Children or Adults during SRA is a horrid crime and sin.  This is the difference between saving a life legally and stealing life from someone else to save their own.  This must be spread everywhere, what is going on with the elites.  Disgusting then.  Disgusting now.

What about the new Peter Thiel-backed start-up where young people give blood that's then transfused into to older people to make them feel younger and more virile? Rumor mill says Keith Richards gets all the blood in his body transfused every 6 months (which is why he isn't dead yet, even though he looks like a ambulant corpse)

                   He is one of The walking dead.  When they appear in full concert and look like that, they are telling us what they are doing.  But the Fandom of their Opera does not see.  They are blinded by their lies and what the devil sows. Many are doing what Richards is doing.  Possibly Ron Wood as well.  All the very old elite cabal as well. There are ones that are higher than the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.  The  black nobility are said to rule the world.  We can be assured they drain their blood and refresh as well at the expense of Our Children.

              Who is Kristin Bauer van Straten, what roles does she almost exclusively play, how is she linked to Scientology leaders and the Emanuels, who is her brother and how is he linked to the Clintons, what judicial position does his wife hold and what supreme Court position is she seeking, what controversial first amendment case is currently pending, what political position did their daughter just move into and how, what is the history of the Bauer family name, and how is their family tied to the Root of All Evil and the other elite families that control it?

              You have always Recognized The Truth. The Truth may be shocking and frightening to some, but their Agenda is what everyone should really fear. Some may be Deceived, but only Fools living in Lies and Sin would mock, forsake and denounce Jesus Christ and The Truth.
             </p>
             <h2>
              The Truth is Simple, Honest and Easy to Know if you truly believe in Jesus Christ and know what He foretold.
             </h2>
             <p>
              You have seen what others do not. You know the games they play and the deception they use.
             </p>
             <p>
              WE NEVER LIE. WE NEVER DECEIVE. WE NEVER BETRAY. WE SHARED THE TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING.
             </p>
             <h2>
              ONLY THE TRUTH EXPOSES THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL AND THE REAL AGENDA WITH THE MARK OF THE BEAST.
             </h2>
             <p>
              THEY WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO HIDE, OBFUSCATE, DISTRACT, SILENCE AND ELIMINATE THE TRUTH AT ALL COSTS.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your Faith in the face of persecution will be forever Recognized and Rewarded. You were the first to Recognize The Truth.

              wow that's pretty scary to think about, but it does make sense considering all the people that mysteriously vanish and the gruesome stories that our feed to us by TPTB.  It also explains all the blood and gore in old folk/fairy tales.  While we've been taught to think about many of the stories as entertainment, I wonder if they were really told as a 'warnings' so people wouldn't venture too far out on their own??  I was an elementary teacher, so I also know that teaching the 'original' versions of such stories is greatly frowned upon, so once again, the average person is not allowed access to the 'big picuture'😔
