  'formattedContent' => '<h2>A former priest in the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas remains licensed to practice medicine in Kansas and Missouri despite being defrocked this year after church leaders determined that he abused three minors.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John H. Wisner who had been a priest for more than 45 years, also is a forensic psychiatrist who holds a medical license in both states.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts, which oversees licensing of doctors in that state, is investigating the allegations against Wisner. If the board determines that he has violated the rules of professional conduct, Wisner could lose his license.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kansas Board of Healing Arts would not say whether it also was looking into Wisner’s case.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<h1>It is unclear whether Wisner is still practicing medicine. For years, he also served as an expert witness in numerous civil and criminal trials, among them high-profile murder cases and those involving sexual abuse.</h1>
<p><strong>Victims’ advocates said Wisner, 71, should not be allowed to retain his medical license.</strong></p>
<p><em>When contacted by phone, Wisner declined comment about the allegations or the investigation. “I don’t even know about it,” he said.</em></p>
<p><strong>An activist said not only should Wisner have surrendered his medical license, the archdiocese should have reported him to the licensing boards when it learned of the allegations six years ago.</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><em>Ordained in 1972, Wisner served as an associate pastor at St. Agnes Parish in Roeland Park and worked at Sacred Heart and Christ the King parishes in Kansas City, Kan., and St. Joseph Parish in Shawnee.</em></p>
<p><em>In 1979, he joined the University of Kansas Medical Center as part of the psychiatry faculty while serving as an assistant professor at the Kansas City VA Medical Center. He later became director of the Adult Psychiatry Inpatient Unit at the KU Medical Center. Other positions included associate professor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in the psychiatry and behavioral sciences department.</em></p>
<p><em>Wisner retired in September 2012, according to the school, the same year the archdiocese first revealed the allegations against him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Over the years, Wisner often was sought out by the media to comment on various psychiatric issues, appearing on CNN in 2004 to talk about the case of Lisa Montgomery, who strangled a pregnant woman in Skidmore, Mo., then cut the baby out of her womb and tried to claim the child as her own.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 1995, Wisner testified for the defense in Johnson County’s first sexual predator trial.</strong></p>
<p>The defendant had pleaded guilty to five felony counts of aggravated indecent solicitation of a child and had previous convictions for exposure, making obscene telephone calls and battery, which resulted from the attempted rape of his wife. <strong>At issue was whether the defendant would continue to commit sexual crimes against children if released from prison.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wisner testified that he did not believe the man was a sexually violent predator</strong></p>
<p><em>Of course....birds of a feather....</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1997, <strong>Wisner testified for the defense in the capital murder case of Gary Kleypas, who was convicted of raping and killing a Pittsburg State University student in 1996</strong>. The jury was hearing evidence to determine whether Kleypas should be executed or sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p><strong>Wisner testified that Kleypas’ problems could be treated through medication and a structured life, such as prison.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall said <strong>the use of Wisner as an expert witness in sex abuse cases raised serious concerns.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“If they relied upon his expert opinion, his independence and his ability to be a prudent and thoughtful expert, I believe, is completely compromised by his own personal criminal conduct,” he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rebecca Randles, a Kansas City attorney who has represented hundreds of clergy sex abuse victims, said <strong>Wisner’s testimony could bring some of those cases into question</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>“His testimony was probably impaired by the fact that he, too, is a predator,” Randles said. “And so he would be suspect in any cases where he said that the defendant was not a predator.”</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><em>The archdiocese said that in 2012 it had received multiple allegations that Wisner had sexually abused minors. He was immediately suspended from active ministry and law enforcement was notified, the archdiocese said. An investigation by the archdiocese found the allegations to be credible, it said, and in November 2012, archdiocesan officials sent the results to the Vatican.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The archdiocese had removed Wisner from active ministry after receiving a complaint from a 45-year-old man who alleged Wisner had inappropriately touched him in 1982 on a youth outing when he was 15. The archdiocese received two more allegations after that from men in their 40s.</p>
<p>Wisner denied that he engaged in sexual misconduct, the archdiocese has said. <strong>He was never criminally charged in relation to the decades-old allegations.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Friendly reminder: The statutes of limitation in cases of sexual abuse have to go.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wisner and the archdiocese settled a lawsuit last year with a man who accused Wisner of sexually abusing him when the man was a minor</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The lawsuit, filed in 2015, alleged that Wisner — identified in the suit as J.H.W. Jr. — sexually abused the alleged victim in the mid-1980s when the youth was between the ages of 15 and 17. Wisner held parties at his house at Table Rock Lake, the suit said, where he provided liquor to underage male parishioners and encouraged them to drink until they passed out, then sexually assaulted them.</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the alleged abuse, Wisner was an associate pastor at St. Agnes Catholic Church and was also the victim’s primary physician, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p><em>Records show Wisner received his medical degree from the University of Kansas Medical Center in 1976 with a specialty in psychiatry and was licensed to practice in Kansas in 1977. His current license describes him as a medical doctor with a specialty in forensic psychiatry and says “no derogatory information on file.” The license is set to expire on July 31, 2019.</em></p>
<p><em>Missouri records show Wisner is board certified in psychiatry and was licensed to practice there in 1979. Under “current discipline status,” the licensing document says “none.” The license is scheduled to expire on Jan. 31, 2019.</em></p>
<p><strong>According to Kansas law, a license may be revoked, suspended or limited or the licensee censured or placed on probation for grounds that include committing “an act of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct or professional incompetency…”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Missouri statute says a person’s medical license can be revoked for “conduct that is unethical or unprofessional involving a minor.”</strong></p>

             Remember the case we discussed recently from Norway?
            </p>
            <p>
             A pedo forensic psychiatrist abused his own kids, but they had to return to him after one of his fellow pedo psychiatrists said he wouldn't cause any further harm to them.
            </p>

             He served as an expert witness in family court in many cases, and parents demand that these cases should be looked into again, but authorities refuse.

            The statute of limitations laws must be reviewed and lifted.

            Local residents are in the strongest position to send letters to their representatives and the Board and the University to express their awareness and opinion.
Then, if nothing happens the Board Members become complicit, but mostly the gatekeepers will back down. They don't like light being shed on them.

            This is disgusting but should not surprise us.  There are many in the medical profession that have been abusing children.  Dentists, nurses, doctors, eye doctors, you name it.  This all has made me feel sick, really.  There has been an explosion of articles regarding the RCC and it's satanic pope.  I really can't bear it.  This weekend was just too much.  I was horribly disappointed by the removal of the priest that burned the Rainbow Flag at his church.  He explained he did not hold any grudge or hatred against the LGBTQ community and that they were welcome in his Church.  But some city official came and protested and demanded he be removed.  Cardinal Cupich was more than happy to comply.  This is a priest that was raped by a gay man when he was 11 and then raped by a priest when he was a 19 yr old seminarian.  He has had to be treated for PTSD ever since and his Church and his Cardinal have no remorse or sympathy for this poor priest.  I can't even.  tears :(

             Have an ex who was repeatedly groped by her pediatrician. Parents didn't believe her at first but when it became more apparent and they tried to take legal action the cops pretty much shrugged their shoulders and said without evidence they could do nothing. They ended just taking her to another pediatrician.

              I have never had this problem I have only had 2 male doctors.  But.  I have 2 friends that have told me that doctors tried to make a pass, one when she was a teen and the other said when she was with Child.  Good God.  Her tummy was huge!  Sick.

                Psychiatrists starting to creep me out as much as children’s dentists. 
maybe Q asked, maybe rando but ? stuck: active shooters often have psych issues. Why do the psychiatrists disappear? &amp; Why not pursued aggressively by media once underground?
