            OMG! Anyone that isn't broken up after reading this story does not have a heart. That poor child. Moved from one monster to another, her life was hell all thanks to CPS. It doesn't say why she was originally removed, or why parental rights were terminated. The system is broken, diverted so it can inflict damage and feed the beast.

            Cripes!  How hard is it to check the police record of someone trying to be a foster parent?  Is there a shortage of foster homes?  Is CPS taking away too many children from their parents?  What the heck is going on here?

             If you're familiar with The Fosters, it used to be an ABC family show but now it's on some channel that I don't care about, the plot touches several times on specifically privatized foster care.  There's an end-of-the-season story line presented where the protagonist, Callie, finds out that Arbiter Group (a privatized foster care company) was knowingly placing foster children into unsafe homes all in the pursuit of the almighty dollar.

              I'll never figure out why people have kids when they know they're not capable of being a good parent.  There is birth control and even abortion, but the welfare check and copping out on working hard for your keep is simply made too easy.

                Worthless and priceless have the same value on earth, don't they.   That choice of which to shoot for, the worthless or the priceless, is the real human choice.  Move towards the priceless and you walk with God, so to speak, work towards the worthless and walk with Satan, so to speak.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now, figuring out what is worthless and priceless in a world where gangsta rap outsells Mahalia Jackson or even Ella Fitzgerald....that's the difficult part to sift through.  Good luck.

             Many of these children taken from their homes are placed with adoption agencies whose main concern is to get the child placed under a roof and other than the 30 hrs of training for fosters and sometimes finger print checks there's little else done to check on backgrounds of fosters.  Yes there is a shortage of foster homes all over the country but the  reason is they are removing too many children for inane reasons for the simple reason it helps to subsidize state coffers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children are seen as a free commodity which  in turn enables them to receive an avg. of 85k per child for a period of 18 months.  The 85k helps to cover judges salaries, case workers, social workers, therapists, court appointed attorneys, foster families, visitation transporters, etc etc etc   So the state can employ an inordinate amt of people and only a portion of their salaries come out of the state coffers because the Fed IV-E funding (85K per child) subsidizes them.   Two years ago ( the last official report) the state of Louisianna received an 80% return for all the expenses incurred for operating their CPS system.   The state of AZ received a 67% subsidy.   It's a complicated financial structure where the states receive from 50%-80% for their expenses.  For example administrative costs are reimbursed at 50% whereas a group home placement would return 75%.
            </p>
            <p>
             States have caught on to this and some have hired Maximus a consulting firm to maximize their returns so what has happened is states reduced the line items that returned a smaller subsidy and have put their sights into those that give a higher return.  Lockheed Martin is now getting into this consulting business for child welfare just as Maximus has done.  Here's an article that explains it better and you can scroll down to the part about Rev Max to understand it better than I've explained.

              Thank you for providing the link.  The corruption involved with CPS and the foster care system in Arizona (and elsewhere) is sickening and despicable.  Literally trading children for money.

             CPS gets paid lots of money to steal children.  So the federal government has incentivized the kidnapping and adopting out mostly poor people's children.

              So you're telling me they get a bonus for stealing children?  How is that a "good" thing?  Shouldn't a list of criteria and an unbiased child advocate be the best assessor, not one who needs the bonus money to pay this summer's air conditioning bill?  I don't understand that at all.

             There are corrupt people in leadership positions who provide children to pedophiles under the guise of a foster family. The Franklin cover up had a few of them, I'm in Ireland and our foster system, I know of one family personally the father has abused at least 2 children and had more afterwards, and I've heard of other cases which went on for decades...

              Indeed.  The foster care system was a prime source of child victims in the Franklin scandal.  It's been going on for a LONG time.  The state has a variety of "reasons" they use to remove children from their biological parents (as in this case) and place them in foster care.

              Hello Ireland!  It seems to be a global problem and I'm sure your input and reasoning is needed here.    Make sure you find someone to trust to tell your story about that one "father" if he is still fostering children.  Are most caseworkers well-intentioned people?

               Yea, the town found out about that guy I think about 6-7 years ago cuz he seemed to just disappear, I think he at least gave up the kids he had at the time, don't think he was punished tho, although he might have been in the years that passed. As for the system, I think you get a lot of people who join as a vocation, but some who take it as a job and become jaded, and they seem to come into contact with predators and allow it to happen. I think the system is left intentionally shaky, they've had cases that sparked public outrage, but they ignore fixing the root causes, like just having a good vetting system, simple things, I think good, caring people wud be disgusted after a while and wud have to leave, it's a depressing system.
