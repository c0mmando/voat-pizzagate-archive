<blockquote>
<p>He was made a life peer in 1997 as a member of the Labour Party, and is on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since 15 July 2013.[3] He served in the government as the Minister for Science and Innovation from 1998 and 2006.</p>
<p>He is a major donor to the University of Cambridge and in 2011 was elected Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>In July 2006, he became the first government minister to be questioned by police in the &quot;Cash for Peerages&quot; inquiry.[16][19] On 10 November 2006, he resigned as Science Minister, stating that he wanted to focus on business and charity work.[20] He categorically denied that his resignation had anything to do with the &quot;Cash for Peerages&quot; affair, stating that he was &quot;not directly involved in whether peerages were offered for cash&quot;,[21] although this was contradicted by subsequent press reports attributed to &quot;Labour insiders&quot; which suggested that his resignation was indeed a direct consequence of the affair.</p>
<p>David Sainsbury has also been associated with the Institute for Public Policy Research and Progress. Between 2001 and 2011 he provided £2 million of funding for Progress.[25] In 2009, he created the Institute for Government with £15 million of funding through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatsby_Charitable_Foundation">Gatsby Charitable Foundation</a> to help government and opposition politicians to prepare for political transitions and government.[23][26] Sainsbury donated £390,000 to Progress and the Movement for Change between December 2011 and April 2013, while he was not on a UK electoral register, which is contrary to electoral law, leading to Progress and the Movement for Change being fined by the Electoral Commission.[27][28]</p>
<p>Sainsbury funded the &quot;Remain&quot; side of the 2016 European Union membership referendum campaign,[29] giving £2,150,000 to the Labour and £2,125,000 to the Liberal Democrats &quot;Remain&quot; campaigns.</p>
<p>In 2013, together with his wife Susie, joined the Giving Pledge, the group started by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates, pledging to donate half his fortune to charitable trusts during his lifetime.</p>
<p>In 2011 he became Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, succeeding Prince Phillip (cough, cough)</p>

            Thanks for posting this LDT. You might want to edit a list of the names from the comments into the main body of the post so they are searchable on SearchVoat (comments aren't crawled). This is the first time I've seen some of these come up, and future researchers may need to be able to find them again. Google does crawl comments, but it's a bit of a crapshoot.

            <p>
             ged 27, Verjee approached Tom Monaghan at a conference in the US, and persuaded him to sell the franchising rights to Domino's Pizza in the UK.[3] Verjee launched the chain in Britain and it now employs over 20,000 people in the UK[5] [6] Verjee sold his stake in the firm in 1989, and went on to oversee the development of the Brompton Hospital site. From 1993 until 1997, Verjee, alongside the singer Elton John, co-owned Watford F.C.[4] In 1995, he bought Thomas Goode, which holds two royal warrants and has over 160 years experience in iconic glassworks.

            <p>
             Verjee established a UK Charity, The Rumi Foundation, in 2006.[9] The Foundation supports humanitarian work through education, innovation and knowledge building. Its work is principally focussed in the UK but has also supported projects in India, East Africa and South America.
            </p>

             <li>

Alongside Holly Branson, Verjee co-chairs the UK initiative, We Day which encourages young people to take a greater role in their communities.[12] Princess Beatrice has since gone on to become involved in WE Day.

             The Frankopan family was one of the leading Croatian aristocratic families which dates back to the 12th century.. Along with the Zrinski family it had, in Croatian and Hungarian history, ranked high in terms of importance by virtue of power, wealth, fame, glory and role in Croatia's public life.. Some scholars consider them (according family's tradition) to be closely connected with the Roman patrician Frangipani family..

             Lady Nicholas Windsor was born as Paola Louise Marica Doimi de Lupis (she used this name until her time as an undergraduate at Cambridge; by the time of her marriage she was known as "Princess" Dona Paola Doimi de Lupis de Frankopan Šubic Zrinski) in London in 1969.. Her father is Louis, "Prince de Frankopan", "Count" Doimi de Lupis, born in Split in 1939, a member of the old Croatian and the Italian nobility.. Lady Nicholas' father came to England from Croatia after the Second World War to attend a boarding school and then go to Oxford University.. Her father is a barrister, and a member of Middle Temple and a businessman. Lord Nicholas Windsor was born in 1970 at University College Hospital, London, and was the first member of the British Royal Family to be born in a hospital.. He is a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II...

            <p>
             Just track the funders for his Media Standards Trust. Esmee Fairburn, Gatsby (Lord Sainsbury), Joseph Rowntree (with funds of £millions), Eranda Foundation (Rothschild),  Pearson Foundation (yes, David Bell’s old company), Nuffield, Scott Trust (Rothschild &amp; Guardian Media Group) and others. Just what are the real interests of Moore’s powerful backers?
            </p>
            <p>
             Another clue comes from the links between Moore and Will Moy, budding press and media critic from Fullfact.org. A pushy little organisation funded by four of the very same funders who fund the Media Standards Trust (see Fullfact article opposite). Just who did set up Fullfact and why? Could it be that the aim is for
             <strong>
              Rothschild, Sainsbury, Pearson
             </strong>
             and other rich powerful shadowy figures to create and inflame the press and media saga, for Leveson to introduce the very controls they want in the first place?
