<p>Here\'s the snippet from one of the testimonials:</p>
<p>&quot;On the other side of this coin, we’ve got the pro-contact crowd. Before Virped, whenever I was speaking in any forum with other pedophiles, that’s who I always found myself sparring with, and I never could seem to get around it. I tried at times to just stay silent on the contact issue, but I always found the things the more vocal pro-contacters said to be so grotesquely wrong that I never could keep my mouth shut for long. I don’t suppose I need to tell anyone that this did not make me very popular in some of those old pedophile groups. Eventually, I always wound up vastly outnumbered, would be shouted down, and would wind up leaving out of pure frustration. Thank god for Virped.&quot;</p>
<p>---- What is Virped and has that forum been investigated?!</p>

            I am wondering if it is "Virtuous Paedophiles," the forum that the paedo writing for Salon talked about.
