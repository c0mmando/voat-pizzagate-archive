<p>A conspiracy theory has been promulgated according to which John and Tony Podesta were involved in the abduction of Madeleine McCann. Following link:</p>

<p>In what follows we will examine the relevant details and provide our final answer on whether the theory has any justificatory merit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our method will be straightforward and uncontroversial. We will consider only the facts that can be verified. The facts are all available on public record and cannot be disputed.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>We will then determine the best explanation of those facts.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Fact 1  : Madeleine McCann was abducted on May 3, 2007.</strong></p>

<p>That McCann went missing on May 3, 2007 is confirmed on Wikipedia, the Guardian, the BBC, and the Telegraph, and cannot be disputed.</p>

<p><strong>Fact 2 Official police sketches look very much like the Podesta brothers.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/30748819321_9f078bf394_b.jpg?w=570">https://i0.wp.com/www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/30748819321_9f078bf394_b.jpg?w=570</a></p>
<hr />
<p>There are some important points to make about Fact 2. As follows:</p>
<p>That the sketches look very much like the Podestas cannot be disputed.</p>
<p>That the sketches are real and official cannot be disputed.</p>
<p>Confirmed here. </p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/maddy-mccann-cops-release-sketches-kidnap-suspects/story?id=20563026">http://abcnews.go.com/International/maddy-mccann-cops-release-sketches-kidnap-suspects/story?id=20563026</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The sketches match so precisely that even the mole above Tony Podesta’s eyebrow is captured. And they match so precisely that they capture the small depressions on the ridge of John Podesta’s nose that would be caused by wearing glasses for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The likelihood that one sketch should match one brother, in virtue of sheer coincidence, is low. The likelihood that not one but two sketches should each match each brother, in virtue of sheer coincidence, is extremely low.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lU1eaN.png?resize=799%2C1024">https://i0.wp.com/www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/lU1eaN.png?resize=799%2C1024</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The likelihood that not one but two sketches should each match each brother, and should match each brother so precisely as to accurately capture minute details about each brother — including the mole above Tony’s eyebrow, the depression on John’s nose caused by glasses, the skin complexion, the 5 O’clock shadow facial hair, the distance between the eyes, the facial contours and symmetry, etc. — in virtue of sheer coincidence, is vanishingly, incomprehensibly low. To put into perspective how improbable this is, it is about the same likelihood as, say, being struck by lightening three times in a row followed by winning the lottery three times in a row.</p>
<p>As many as six: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24539403">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24539403</a></p>
<p>Images from find Madeline Campaign. <a href="http://findmadeleine.com/campaigns/unidentified_people.html">http://findmadeleine.com/campaigns/unidentified_people.html</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Some have responded that the sketches are only representations of one person. This is false. Initially reports indicated just one suspect, but it has grown to potentially as many as six. As confirmed by the BBC. The newest images can be seen on the Find Madeiline campaign.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another point needs to be added here: police did not conclude with certainty that there was just one suspect; far from it, they only tacitly accepted there was one suspect based on preliminary reports.</p>
<hr />
<p>Due to the inductive nature of police investigations, initial suppositions can always be overturned in light of new evidence. So if new evidence emerges suggesting that more than one suspect was involved, the original accounts would be revised. It would be contrary to the spirit of rational inquiry to maintain that preliminary reports have veto power over any forthcoming evidence.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that is indeed what we have here. The hard factual resemblance of both Podesta brothers — down to the mole above the eyebrow — outweighs the mere possibility that there may have been only one suspect.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Fact 3  John Podesta’s emails dating back to the time of the abduction are missing.</strong></p>
<p>John Podesta’s emails were wiped or are missing from the WikiLeaks release leading up to the date that McCann was missing. This cannot be disputed and is verifiable by Google authenticated email leaks released by WikiLeaks. Here is a screenshot showing one of the earliest emails from WikiLeaks — note the date of May 4, 2007, the day after McCann went missing.</p>

<p>John Podesta\'s Emails: </p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Fact 4  An assistant was sending emails on John Podesta’s behalf on May 4, 2007.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The email that starts on May 4, 2007, the day after McCann’s abduction, is written to Mr. Sandler. Crucially: is not written from John Podesta himself, but on behalf of John Podesta, by an assistant named Elizabeth, indicating that John Podesta was either out of town or otherwise unavailable to handle emails.</p>
<hr />
<p>You can view the email here: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9364">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9364</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Let us pause briefly here to consider two rival explanations of the data:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explanation 1 Call it “Coincidence” for short):</strong>  The police sketches of McCann’s kidnapping suspects coincidentally match John Podesta, the police sketches of McCann’s kiddnapping suspects coincidentally match Tony Podesta, John Podesta’s emails coincidentally are missing during the time McCann was abducted, John Podesta’s assistant (not John himself) was coincidentally sending an email on John’s behalf on May 4, 2007, the day after McCann was abducted.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Explanation 2  (call it “Involvement”):</strong>  The Podestas were to some degree or another involved in McCann’s abduction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Readers must determine whether COINCIDENCE, or INVOLVEMENT, best explains the facts.</p>
<hr />
<p>But first, let’s consider some additional facts. What you are about to see might shock you, but it is important to stress that none of this hinges on speculations or assumptions — we are working only with what is known and empirically confirmed.</p>',

           Another point needs to be added here: police did not conclude with certainty that there was just one suspect; far from it, they only tacitly accepted there was one suspect based on preliminary reports.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           Due to the inductive nature of police investigations, initial suppositions can always be overturned in light of new evidence. So if new evidence emerges suggesting that more than one suspect was involved, the original accounts would be revised. It would be contrary to the spirit of rational inquiry to maintain that preliminary reports have veto power over any forthcoming evidence.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           And that is indeed what we have here. The hard factual resemblance of both Podesta brothers — down to the mole above the eyebrow — outweighs the mere possibility that there may have been only one suspect.

            Fact 3  John Podesta’s emails dating back to the time of the abduction are missing.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           John Podesta’s emails were wiped or are missing from the WikiLeaks release leading up to the date that McCann was missing. This cannot be disputed and is verifiable by Google authenticated email leaks released by WikiLeaks. Here is a screenshot showing one of the earliest emails from WikiLeaks — note the date of May 4, 2007, the day after McCann went missing.

            Fact 4  An assistant was sending emails on John Podesta’s behalf on May 4, 2007.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           The email that starts on May 4, 2007, the day after McCann’s abduction, is written to Mr. Sandler. Crucially: is not written from John Podesta himself, but on behalf of John Podesta, by an assistant named Elizabeth, indicating that John Podesta was either out of town or otherwise unavailable to handle emails.

           <strong>
            Let us pause briefly here to consider two rival explanations of the data:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Explanation 1 Call it “Coincidence” for short):
           </strong>
           The police sketches of McCann’s kidnapping suspects coincidentally match John Podesta, the police sketches of McCann’s kiddnapping suspects coincidentally match Tony Podesta, John Podesta’s emails coincidentally are missing during the time McCann was abducted, John Podesta’s assistant (not John himself) was coincidentally sending an email on John’s behalf on May 4, 2007, the day after McCann was abducted.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Explanation 2  (call it “Involvement”):
           </strong>
           The Podestas were to some degree or another involved in McCann’s abduction.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           Readers must determine whether COINCIDENCE, or INVOLVEMENT, best explains the facts.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           But first, let’s consider some additional facts. What you are about to see might shock you, but it is important to stress that none of this hinges on speculations or assumptions — we are working only with what is known and empirically confirmed.

            Haven't found anything about orphans yet, but Clinton Foundation has dirty laundry regarding Fukushima. Stuff that put a lot of people in danger via bioaccumulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, bioaccumulation is when poisons absorbed into fat tissue become more concentrated the higher it goes up the food chain. This is what nearly caused Bald Eagles to go extinct after exposure to DDT. I went to the very site that solved this case during my studies in college.

            Japanese culture regarding adoptions and extended families makes the prospect of a link connecting Fukushima relatively unlikely.

            This is a fantastic thread. Shows that at best (in their favor) the Podestas are accomplices in this abduction and/or murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            To add more weight to the argument against ot being a coincidence, said argument is dependant on so many coincidences that it would require a statistical miracle for it to be "just a coincidence". To quote a famous detective game, "Once is a coincidence, twice is the start of a pattern."

            I would not call that plugging as much as it would be a "support thread". "Support leads" is a solid tactic used by law enforcement for gathering evidence that can lead to new finds.

             IIRC, what we've got is a very strong circumstantial evidence case. However, the white hats want a rock solid case that's basically impossible to defend. That way there's no mistakes that "Fake News" can use to protect them.

           <p>
            Here's why I ask. There isn't much real proof of when the girl disappeared. If we assume she was abducted or killed when the McCanns claim, the theories are in conflict. For example, the very accurate tracking dog detected blood under the window where the children slept and in the trunk of the car they later rented. To me, this signifies no abduction took place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Statement analysis of the McCanns proves to an extent that they are lying. Bear in mind, they were both doctors and might handle the death of their child differently than others would. The person doing the analysis concluded that the "event" occurred possibly days before it was reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why that conclusion is interesting is that it opens up the possibility that she was abused sometime before her death, which may have been intentional or accidental. It also means, if true and the Podestas were involved we need to be looking at their whereabouts beginning a few days before the reported abduction.

            Just read your thread too.  Mind Boggling.  Orphanage and Party Place?  What could be strange about that.  People are not making the connections, but what is hard about that?  Pretty obvious to me that there is something very strange about the two that just do not add up.

            This is good, but I feel that it is coming from the wrong direction. While cause for investigation, it isn't conclusive, yet.

             Good point. FBI Anon did say to follow the money. Those leads could lead to RICO charges, then while they're in the slammer, evidence gets gathered for the other crimes.

            Your post has just blown me away.  Excellent Compilation of Verified Facts.  This will be extremely valuable in hopefully convincing Newcomers.  There is no denying certain proven facts.  There is also their being acquainted with Clement Freud who invited the McCanns to his home for lunch a short time after Maddy's abduction.  Now this is not factual and it is only my opinion that the picture of Maddy's  progression and the picture of the girl years later with Podesta and family/friends are a very close match.  There are people that have said that she is his grand daughter but imo that should be further researched due to all of your facts that you have so eloquently stated.  Thank you again.  UpVoat4U

             Spam implies that ESOTERICshade profits from slave trade topic.
If the topic is too embarrassing, then a pedophile slave owner would need to mock and deflect.
You are suffering from survival instincts. Even feral animals who eat their offspring have as much humanity as you.
