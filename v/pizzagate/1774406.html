</blockquote>
<p>That\'s kind of a weird way of putting it.  Do they mean somewhere less than 2,000? I heard people say it was 650,000 emails on the laptop.   650,000 is more than 1.000 but is that how you would say it. I wonder if the reporter asked the question in an odd way.  Did they mean only 1,000 of the emails involved Clinton? (Also this story has 19,000 comments.  Wow.)</p>
<p><a href="http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/">Nov 2:</a> NewPundit publishes this Bombshell: NYPD blows whistle on New Hillary emails.   This article makes several claims.  We can see if these have turned out or not.</p>
<p>NYPD turned over a laptop to the FBI</p>
<p>Clinton, her crew and several members of Congress were facing life in prison</p>
<p>500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>The FBI and Comey read these emails and that\'s why Comey sent his letter because the crimes were way worse than mishandling classified info</p>
<p>NYPD officials including a chief will go public if indictments don\'t happen.  They have copies of the info and will hold a press conference or go to wikileaks.</p>
<p>Weiner flipped and was cooperating.</p>
<p>The FBI and the NYPD split up the case.  &quot; FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. &quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/10/31/inside-fbis-internal-feud-over-hillary-clinton-probe">Oct 31  </a>Found out where the 650,000 email figure comes from.  The majority don\'t concern Clinton. WSJ reported it, they also reported that at the time of Comey\'s letter, the FBI did not have a warrant to look at Clinton\'s emails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigators found 650,000 emails on a laptop that they believe was used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide, and underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used........Officials had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails—which they received over the weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter—because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So can we say  At the time of Comey\'s letter on the 28th, the FBI didn\'t have a warrant for the Huma/Clinton emails.....their original warrant would have only applied to Weiner.  The warrant was granted on Oct 30th.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/comey-tells-congress-fbi-has-not-changed-conclusions/">Oct 7 </a> Comey says email review doesn\'t change conclusions and no criminal charges are coming.</p>
<p>There\'s no way for all of the above to be true.  Either Comey, the FBI and prosecutors are lying, TruePundit is lying or TruePundit was lied to.  Can anyone think of any other possibility?</p>
<p>Evaluating the claims.
**NYPD turned over a laptop to the FBI. ** Contradicted by earlier NY Times story on Oct 3.   Can anyone find a source in Oct that says the NYPD got the laptop?  This becomes pretty big, because unless the FBI showed it to the nypd, this would falsify all the claims about what was on the laptop.</p>
<p><strong>500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton.</strong>  This is contradicted by WSJ/Fox story.   The total number seems to be 650,000, but only thousands  would apply to Clinton.     That\'s 1/11th of 650,000.  So 650,000 seem to be every email by everybody on that laptop.   Remember during her 4 year term as Secretary State her server only had about 30,000 work and 30,000 personal emails.</p>
<p><strong>Clinton, her crew and several members of Congress were facing life in prison.
The FBI and Comey read these emails and that\'s why Comey sent his letter because the crimes were way worse than mishandling classified info
NYPD officials including a chief will go public if indictments don\'t happen.  They have copies of the info and will hold a press conference or go to wikileaks.</strong>
These are all contradicted by Comey closing the case against Clinton, no indictments coming down and no response from NYPD, no press conference, no wikileaks.  Also the FBI didn\'t have a warrant to examine the Clinton emails until the 30th, which if true, means Comey was not forced to reopen case by reading about stomach turning crimes on weiner\'s laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Weiner/Huma flipped and were cooperating.
The FBI and the NYPD split up the case.</strong></p>
<p>I haven\'t seen anything to support these claims.</p>
<p>Laying all this out, just makes me realize how improbable all this is.  There\'s supposed to be all this evidence of horrible and serious crimes and Comey knows that the NYPD had the laptop first and thus, many, many people may have seen this evidence.   If multiple NYPD detectives had a copy of this evidence including NYPD brass, they wouldn\'t have to leak to Wikileaks.   They have power.  They could go public and would be able to garner coverage from every media outlet in the country.  If this was true, they could easily take Comey down.  Especially ever since January 20th.  If there was genuine evidence of this baroque conspiracy, they would get a hearing in the White House.</p>
<p>Is there any way these claims can actually be true?</p>',

            I'm not sure I follow you. The chemical attack was just this week. I'm not sure why you'd expect proof it was a false flag in two days time. It literally just happened. I think it's a false flag because this is their MO. I've seen so many you begin to recognize the pattern.
           </p>
           <p>
            But yes we need proof to be sure. That just takes time, people have to go in there and take samples then send them to a place like the chemical weapons lab at Porton Down in England. It'll take months to process the raw data.

            Don't try to wiggle out of it. I've been here 4 months and have seen 1000 shills spout a 1000 different types of bull shit. You're par for the course.

            You're a fucking heartless shill. Assad didn't do this. He'd be out of his mind to give the Deep State a reason to attack. A canned ham could have seen this false flag coming from a mile away.. The Deep State did this. This is what the people you are shilling for do on a daily basis.

            Aaaaand you're a shill. You'd think evidence of child rape, organ harvesting, drug smuggling, and charity fraud that kept 98% of the relief money because..........actually I don't know why. I'm not a psychotic racist so I can't comprehend how you could steal money from poor black people, import cocaine to hook poor black people on crack, import mango-flavored heroin to hook poor white people on opiates, kill journalists who ask too many questions and maintain a robust human trafficking network to fuel the Brownstone Operations that are used to keep the whole thing from falling apart.

            Wow. I don't often come across such a fucking idiot I wonder how he was able to get on the internet let alone pick up the subtleties of "The False Flag Attack" the Deep State have carried out yearly since the first one they pulled in the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into the Vietnam War.

            I post this and they don't like it then pizzagate bot shows up: "Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types."

             They closed the case on Clinton and there's an active case on Weiner.  This is the latest on the Weiner case.

            Now you're rockin' two names
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/AreWeSure">
             @AreWeSure
            </a>
            , what's up with that? Did you get sick of the horse shit old AreWeSure was flinging? Did you start to have trouble looking yourself in the mirror every morning?
           </p>
           <p>
            AreWeSure your arguments above are about as tight as a soup sandwich. Let's take this gem for example:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The majority don't concern Clinton."
           </p>
           <p>
            Monumental moron, the person at the top of any organized crime family rarely gets involved in the day to day operations of their money machine. If you need me to explain why that's true then you're a bigger idiot than I thought. When those emails come out the real dirt will be lower down the food chain. But that's ok, you only need one connection to the top for Killary to be sucked up in the maelstrom about to descend on the perps in this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides this clown fraud is so massive there's plenty of evidence OUTSIDE of the 650,000 Weiner emails. Let's be topical and talk about evidence Assad wasn't behind the Ghouta Sarin gas attack. Steven Sotloff tweeted this out a short time before he was killed:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/stevensotloff/status/340144057743450112">
             https://twitter.com/stevensotloff/status/340144057743450112
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I know you have trouble reading but it's pretty clear that tweet pissed off some people and as you can see their last name wasn't Assad. And they're most likely the same people behind the Sarin gas attack this week. Then there's the Porton Down testing and all the rest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Give it up dude, you need to start saving your sanity at this point because your mind is going to implode when the truth finally comes out.
           </p>
           <p>
