              https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/the-cost-of-courage-part-vi-dr-tom-philpott-a-man-ahead-of-his-time
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Excerpt from the article:
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The death of Dr. Tom Philpott
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Just days after filming Boys for Sale, Dr. Philpott would die of alleged suicide on October 9, 1991. Almost no information exists as to the exact cause and circumstances of his death, but one of his students, Vern Nelson, was told Dr. Philpott suffered from manic depression and shot himself in the heart.(8) In Dr. Philpott's University of Texas obituary it is alluded that he was suffering depression due to growing issues about the Gulf War.(9)
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite the suspicious connection between the circumstances of Dr. Philpott's death and the home invasion in which he was shot 10 years earlier, at this time it was not part of Texas police practice to perform an autopsy on suicides.(10)
            </p>
            <p>
             Since this happened in 1991 the chances of being able to recover such information is dwindling. The Texas Legislature did propose a bill in 2012, HB3546, or "Kari's Law", that would have given investigators the legal ability to conduct autopsies on suicides. The bill, however, is considered dead.(11) Until such legislation is put into place, cases like Dr. Philpott's may never be solved.
            </p>
            <p>
             All hope is not lost, though. As this article shows Dr. Philpott's work is still alive and well. In his memory I will commit the inspiring eulogy given to Dr. Tom Philpott by his colleagues at the University of Texas forever to the blockchain that would have meant so much to him:
            </p>
            <p>
             The untimely death of Tom Philpott reminds us that a great mind and a good heart offer no assurance of an easy life. Tom taught history, but to those who knew him, he taught much more.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no individual at the University of Texas who meant so much to so many. He symbolized a college education as a learning experience. He was that rare breed of University professor committed to students and learning. Tom did not mold minds, he opened them. He taught, through example, that every one of us had the power to initiate change. Students were drawn to Tom - not because he ran against the UT grain - but because he managed to remain one of "us." At every turn, Tom confronted the University bureaucracy. He constantly fought a losing battle to keep the University a place for education, not for business.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he battled, it was done full tilt, without regret or reservation. He stood in protest with students on the West Mall more times than memory serves.
            </p>
            <p>
             The written word was his tool. Tom depended on the pen of others to deliver his message as quickly as he relied on himself. There were so many books . . . Altgeld's America, The Book of Lights, My Name is Asher Lev, A Rumor of War, Souls on Fire, to name but a few. They are all studies in the human spirit, lessons in overcoming obstacles. Lessons Tom thought we should learn.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can extend his commitment to learning by obtaining the best education possible; and retaining our convictions in the process. We were proud to have him as a teacher. We shall not see his like again...
            </p>
            <p>
             Fiat lux, Dr. Philpott.

              What a beautiful man!!!He didn't suicide! All that Satanic Panic was a lie!! An excuse to put a stop to people looking into Satanic Abuse-Ritual Abuse. Lots to add on this. I could write paragraphs about the EVIL False Memory Syndrome Foundation. It was founded by CIA and pedophiles!! Yup, to ridicule and discourage anyone looking into ritual abuse and to testify at trials s 'experts'. Turns out they were CIA plants and pedophiles. One asshole was even taken to court for pedophilia by his own daughter!!!

               I personally knew kids who were McMartin preschool victims. They were seriously effed up from what happened. It really happened and has always pissed me off that they were dismissed as liars and part of the bs "satanic panic".

                Wow! I had met Ted Gunderson and he was the first to tell me about it. I know some people think Gunderson was a double agent but I don't know what to think. He helped me understand that I was put on some list
