            First of all, Trump nods in the affirmative twice when the reporter says "You criticized Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton in the past," so it's not like he was pretending to "know nothing about the Prince Andrew situation" as you characterized it. He is not denying anything he said in the past, here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reporter asked, "Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison, and a lot of people want to know if she is going to turn in powerful people and I know you've talked in the past about Prince Andrew and you've criticized Bill Clinton's behavior -- I'm wondering, do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working out?"
           </p>
           <p>
            To which Trump replies, "I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly."
           </p>
           <p>
            Saying he has not been following Maxwell's case closely enough to know whether she is going to nark on Prince Andrew or make some kind of deal is NOT the same as him backtracking. He is saying he is staying out of the case and letting the DOJ handle it. A more polished speaker who had spent a lifetime in politics would have said exactly those words. Shame on Trump for responding like a regular human being.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagine if he had answered yes!  The media and his teeming political enemies would have been all over him with "Trump weaponizing the justice department, blackmailing political opponents" and "Trump jeopardizes diplomatic relationship with UK". I'm amazed people actually expect him to do something so stupid.
           </p>
           <p>
            I live in an area close to two cities in which ANTIFA revolutionary terrorists have literally taken over territory. Local Democrat mayors have forced local law enforcement to stand by idly while so-called protestors have burned businesses, taken over multi-block areas, handed out guns, looted and denied essential services such as garbage pickup and ambulances to local taxpaying residents. Kids were murdered. Cops were killed. Every major shopping area near me was destroyed by coordinated, simultaneous looting and rioting after already suffering massive financial losses due to the CoronaCon shutdown, just two weeks before they were going to be allowed to re-open.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump quietly deployed federal law enforcement personnel to disarm those patrolling with guns and to protect federal property -- notably property essential to the operation of the justice system.  Local and national media has been screaming about "secret police" and "Gestapo" in reply to their efficient arrests, one of the most insane and unjust things I have ever witnessed in the media. Three of these brave federal officers have been permanently blinded by lasers directed at their eyes by Antifa assholes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, local and national media are pushing "skyrocketing" infection rates for coronavirus, with states threatening to reinstate lockdowns and ban in-person voting in November, even though hospitalization and death rates are plummeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the fearmongering Dems and the media succeed in convincing people they must vote by mail to be safe, or it's too risky to vote in person, voter fraud and low turnout will rig the election for the Dems. Trump just might lose.
           </p>
           <p>
            And guess what happens then?  Maxwell and Prince Andrew will go free and we'll all be force-vaccinated against Covid1984.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because he is now recommending masks, the Dems have lost their ammunition against in-person voting.
           </p>
           <p>
            A relevant Trump tweet:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/274267628166586368">
             https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/274267628166586368
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Trump's "I just wish her well" to Maxwell:
            <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/d3j2n9.png">
             Over two years ago, on January 29, 2018, QAnon translated a Comey tweet and said this phrase was Deep State code
            </a>
            for [187] -- which is police code for murder. It's quite likely this was Trump trolling them about his Feds getting hold of Ghislaine before they did.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who turned their noses up at Trump's attempt at direct communication with the American people -- Q -- shouldn't be surprised when his words seem incongruous.

             I consider myself Q agnostic. Q has been right on some stuff but also said stuff like Podesta was already in custody before and that Bolton was trustworthy. You are right that Trump wasn't going to say "Yes. I am actively involved with this case." Still he could put it in a way that doesn't sound like he is chummy with a human trafficker.

             Great points you make, thanks Vindicator.  Trump administration could bring about the collapse of organized child sex trafficking, via his DOJ and coordination with other countries and Trump haters would give him zero credit.  Epstein and Ghislaine would be going on business as usual under any other president imho and some variation of tranny bathrooms would be the topic of the day for the sheep.

              Seems a lot of people were triggered by this statement by Trump today. I find it amazing, after three years of Trump delivering on promises and foiling every insane scheme orchestrated against him, that people would just leap to the conclusion that he wants a pedophile free. It flies in the face of the fact that

              and denied her bail. Or that by appointing Acosta, he threw irresistible bait into the water for places like the Miami Herald, who then made a ruckus about Epstein's shady plea deal, leading to his re-arrest at a time Epstein, Dershowitz, Bill Gates, Harvard and everyone else thought that sick fuck had gotten away with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Result? Now everyone also knows Gates and Harvard endorse pedophiles, so their relationship to the Wuhan virus was immediately suspect and people are questioning everything the media, Gates, and university researchers are pushing.

               That is because on this board there are those that hate Trump. From day 1 on this sub that's been an element. No proof to the contrary will dent the biased opinions. Their minds are shut. As for me, if there was proof that POTUS is/was involved with child trafficking then hang his ass with the rest. But there isn't or Nancy would be screaming it.

            I feel like vomiting since I saw this yesterday, and read the excuses made by some Trumpists and Qultists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is a pervert, he hired accused pedo Dershowitz as one of his impeachment team members. Which was a slap in the face of all survivors.
           </p>
           <p>
            He employed his friend John Casablancas after he was exposed as a sex trafficker and child rapist.
           </p>
           <p>
            He threw a party for Prince Andrew in 2000, but now claims he doesn't know him.
           </p>
           <p>
            His friend and mentor Roy Cohn was a child rapist and sex trafficker.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is still a good friend of Naomi Campbell's ex Flavio Briatore, who had ties to Epstein, and was involved in the bunga bunga underage girls scandal in Italy. Trump and Briatore have been friends for three decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            His first wife Ivana allgedly procured girls for Ghislaine Maxwell, according to a former Epstein employee.
           </p>
           <p>
            He just meant what he said. All his life, he has loved to hang out with sex traffickers and pedos. He talks about his daughter Ivanka like no decent father would.
           </p>

             I can't argue with that, even if I disagree with his intentions. Trump has always been a flawed character, but I think you'll see his better side yet.

               "prohibiting the Government, it's agents and counsel for witnesses from making extra judicial statements concerning the case" (US v Ghislaine Maxwell).  My point being that most anything Trump could have said other than what he did say would have been construed by Maxwell's lawyers and the MSM as an impediment to a fair trial.  It's obvious on its face without the order however imho.

                 If he said 'no comment' people would still spin it to mean that he knows names that are going to be named.  No comment is almost always construed to mean an affirmative imho.  By saying he wishes her well, the MSM can't spin it.  I didn't like his comment but I could see how he would want to distance himself from saying anything for people to construe as casting an opinion that would influence a fair jury trial.  MSM can attack him for his past socializing but if they do then his past 2015 comments about the island and Prince Andrew/Epstein would come to the forefront.  Epstein survivors will have to take heart that there is a trial at all, it would have been buried under any other president imho, and Epstein would still be in business.

                  It wasn't the FBI who investigated Epstein prior to his arrest last year, it was the Obama  connected SDNY. The FBI only took over two weeks beore his arrest. Same with Maxwell.

                    I have no idea. Imo Epstein and Maxwell's combined Mossad/CIA operation was only one of several similar childrape and blackmail schemes. The others are still operating, (after all, someone needs to blackmail all those who are into raping little boys), and I am also pretty sure that Epstein's operation has already been replaced.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also, imo Prince Andrew was singled out to be the fall guy very early on. Ever wondered why he has been the focus of attack, and not a US politician like Bill Richardson, who also raped Virginia Roberts  - it's because he is British, and had diplomatic immunity due to being the trade envoy for Britain, imo.

            Can we talk about how he regurgitated every main stream media talking point on wearing masks before wishing the highest profile child trafficker well and claiming he knows nothing about the Prince Andrew connection? Where do these optics fit into the "4d chess game"? Is this winning?

              Trump is full of contradictions, he once said they (pedos) should get death penalty, he also was very supportive to Bradley Edwards who took fight to Epstein. But on the other hand there is circumstantial evidence pointing to Trump being involved in all of this. I guess we will maybe never know.

               <p>
                There's two ways to view the Bradley Edwards-Trump interaction.
               </p>
               <p>
                One is that Trump wanted to be helpful and was a complete open book.
               </p>
               <p>
                The other is that Trump knew he would be subpoenaed to give a depostion to Edwards because it was obvious that Trump knew Epstein well since the 1980's.  For one Trump said in 2002, he knew Epstein for 15 years.  For two, there are tons of photos of Trump with Epstein and Maxwell, dating at least to the early 90's.  For three Epstein was always at Mar a Lago, in fact, Maxwell recruited a victim from Mar a Lago.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember by this point Epstein was already convicted, so isn't not a secret that Epstein committed statutory rape and other crimes
               </p>
               <p>
                AND
               </p>
               <p>
                It's to Trump benefit to distance himself from his nearly 20 year friendship with Epstein.  After Epstein's arrest he floated a story in RADAR.com that Trump had barred Epstein from Mar a Lago.  This was not known before Epstein's arrest and RADAR is owned by Trump's friend who owned the National Enquirer, the same guy who in the Michael Cohen case reached a plea deal with the government, where the government agreed not to prosecute him on tax fraud and campaign finance crimes if they told the government what they knew about the illegal schemes to cover up Trump's affairs before the election.
               </p>
               <p>
                www.justice DOT GOV/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1119501/download
               </p>
               <p>
                So the Bradley Edwards interaction could be seen as Trump avoiding testifying under oath and getting his side of the story out first.  Another step in a campaign to pretend he wasn't as close to Epstein as he was.
               </p>
               <p>
                Looked at this way, it changes how you view Trump wishing Ghislaine Maxwell well.   And Trump has damned many people before their conviction, so it's not about process whatsoever.

             Exactly, I don't get why people well nm it is reddit. They act like Trump saying things means he has to be in leagues because how dare he doesn't accuse of someone being guilty when we live in a  judicial system that sees someone as innocent until proven guilty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now if they haven't been taken in yet, there is no problem to make negative comments or regards to the status of a person, like locking up Hillary however I do believe if Trump felt Hillary was being made accountable for her actions she wouldn't bring it to the medias attention about his desire for her to get her due process, which seems to be staying out of any MSM news. Not looking forward to September at this point.

              Nope, in another comment thread, I recommend torture for Ms. Maxwell until she gives up her caches of blackmail videos and photos. Go look at my comment history faggot.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyhow, most people in the Justice department are not going to tolerate CIA torture methods.

              So, Trump may be trying to elicit cooperation from her.  OR

             <p>
              He is pretending he wants no harm to come to her so he won't be a suspect in her death.

              I have no idea which it is. Only time will tell.

             for [187] -- which is police code for murder. It's quite likely this was Trump trolling them about his Feds getting hold of Ghislaine before they did.

             Qtard here- just a hope, with the ability for the federal government to execute people who commit crimes against humanity, Epstein didn't kill himself but was executed. So wishing Maxwell well is a twisted joke since he's the one that is figuratively and maybe literally putting the noose around her neck.

             It’s a relatively neutral comment you might make if trying not to become embroiled in an ongoing legal matter. I’m hoping that’s what it is. The accusations against her are obviously foul though, so it sounds bad and the MSM/left social media are going to have a field day with it.
