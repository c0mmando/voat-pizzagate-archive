<p>I did some digging last night and came across something interesting. I think this NGO called Americares may be the even bigger global picture:</p>
<p>From the C2C website: “C2C’s partner in Haiti, AmeriCares, was instrumental in the founding of the Haiti Adolescent Girls Network.” Notice that this statement is just above the video with Bill Clinton. (<a href="https://care2communities.org/2012/02/28/haiti-adolescent-girls-network-2/">https://care2communities.org/2012/02/28/haiti-adolescent-girls-network-2/))</a>))</p>
<p>Who is behind Americares? “AmeriCares guidance includes Honorary Chairman Zbigniew Brzezinski, Ambassador at Large Barbara Bush, and Prescott Sheldon Bush, Jr.“ (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419055700/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/AmeriCares">https://web.archive.org/web/20170419055700/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/AmeriCares))</a>)) ...
A look at AmeriCares\' advisory board shows links to both the U.S. government and right-wing organizations in the United States. Besides its links to the former CIA director, AmeriCares\' board includes his brother Prescott Bush, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, former U.S. Secretary of State Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Colin Powell, and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. If asked what word best characterized this group of people, would anyone say &quot;humanitarians&quot;?” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419060521/http://truedemocracy.net/td2_2/68dyk.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20170419060521/http://truedemocracy.net/td2_2/68dyk.html))</a>))</p>',

           I did some digging last night and came across something interesting. I think this NGO called Americares may be the even bigger global picture:
          </p>
          <p>
           From the C2C website: “C2C’s partner in Haiti, AmeriCares, was instrumental in the founding of the Haiti Adolescent Girls Network.” Notice that this statement is just above the video with Bill Clinton. (
           <a href="https://care2communities.org/2012/02/28/haiti-adolescent-girls-network-2/">
            https://care2communities.org/2012/02/28/haiti-adolescent-girls-network-2/))
           </a>
           ))
          </p>
          <p>
           Who is behind Americares? “AmeriCares guidance includes Honorary Chairman Zbigniew Brzezinski, Ambassador at Large Barbara Bush, and Prescott Sheldon Bush, Jr.“ (
           <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419055700/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/AmeriCares">
            https://web.archive.org/web/20170419055700/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/AmeriCares))
           </a>
           )) ...
A look at AmeriCares' advisory board shows links to both the U.S. government and right-wing organizations in the United States. Besides its links to the former CIA director, AmeriCares' board includes his brother Prescott Bush, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, former U.S. Secretary of State Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Colin Powell, and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. If asked what word best characterized this group of people, would anyone say "humanitarians"?” (

            AmeriCares Foundation
Robert McCauley (founder, chair), Zbigniew Brzezinski(honorary chair), Peter L. Keating (exec vice pres) Bert Schwarz (vice pres), William S. Post(comptroller), Leila McCauley (sec). Advisory Committee: J. Peter Grace (chair; chair, W.R. Grace &amp;Co.), Louis F. Bantle (chair UST), Prescott S. Bush, Jr. (Prescott Bush &amp; Co. Inc, brother to Vice President George Bush), Sol M.Linowitz (Coudert Brothers), William E. Simon (Treasury Secretary under Richard Nixon), Gen. Richard G. Stilwell (USA ret.).(1)
           </p>
           <p>
            AmeriCares is a high profile organization. Often a prominent political figure in the 1980s, frequently a member of the Bush family, was on board to deliver the shipment, and the U.S. ambassador to the recipient nation was at the airport to receive the delivery. (2) Of course Bush Sr. was a leader of the Council of Foreign Relations, working toward bringing in the NWO under the guise of a mild mannered Christian. He was also the ex-director of the CIA, and who better to trust than his family to oversee his and their agenda? The activities of AmeriCares appear to echo U.S. foreign policy, so much so that investigative reporter Russ Baker wrote that "AmeriCares resembles a private foreign-policy operation of the U.S. government."(2)
           </p>
           <p>
            The organization received significant contributions from the Moon founded Nicaraguan Freedom Fund (NFF) during its brief existence. Hal Eberle, a board member of the NFF, was quoted in the New York Times as saying the Nicaraguan Freedom Fund contributed $300,000 to Americares. (3, 4) The Nicaraguan Freedom Fund's 990 tax return shows the contribution to AmeriCares to be $165,648.
           </p>
           <p>
            In l985 and l986, AmeriCares shipped more than $l00,000 worth of "newsprint" to the opposition daily, La Prensa, in Managua, Nicaragua. This included delivery of 200 tons of newsprint to the newspaper in l986. (5, 6) Of course we can see the need to send a member of the Bush family, and involve the U.S. Diplomat delivering such volatile material as "newsprint". It is no wonder that this was seen as a national security matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Knights of Malta handled the local arrangements in Nicaragua. (7) It's l985 tax return indicated that AmeriCares delivered $73,136 worth of food and medical supplies to La Prensa, but Jim Schaffer, a former official in the organization, says that only newsprint was sent. (6) An attempted shipment of another l5 tons of "newsprint" from AmeriCares to La Prensa in April l988 was blocked by the Sandinista government which accused AmeriCares of being a CIA front and part of the secret network of private groups used by Lt. Col. Oliver North to deliver aid to the Contras. (5) The Sandinista claim they received corroboration from the organization's own tax records which indicate that AmeriCares is financially linked to a number of other individuals and organizations that supplied the Contras or were working with the CIA in Central America. (6)

           <p>
            When you see the Bush Family there is more often than not a link to the Moon Family (Sth Korean Cult/Unification Church) and of course US intelligence. And what do you know - bingo they are all linked in with 'Americares'.   The book, Hot Money and the Politics of Debt explains some of their goings on...as does Rense.com ...

            Really excellent post,

            !
           </p>
           <p>
            I did some digging last night and came across something interesting. I think this NGO called Americares may be the even bigger global picture:
           </p>
           <p>
            From the C2C website: “C2C’s partner in Haiti, AmeriCares, was instrumental in the founding of the Haiti Adolescent Girls Network.” Notice that this statement is just above the video with Bill Clinton. (
            <a href="https://care2communities.org/2012/02/28/haiti-adolescent-girls-network-2/">
             https://care2communities.org/2012/02/28/haiti-adolescent-girls-network-2/)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is behind Americares? 
“AmeriCares guidance includes Honorary Chairman Zbigniew Brzezinski, Ambassador at Large Barbara Bush, and Prescott Sheldon Bush, Jr.“ (
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419055700/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/AmeriCares">
             https://web.archive.org/web/20170419055700/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/AmeriCares)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            “The timing of the recent planeload of supplies to Iraq is hardly the first controversy over a shipment from AmeriCares. Sandinista officials accused AmeriCares of being a CIA front and part of the secret network of private groups used by Marine Corps Lt. Col. Oliver North to deliver aid to the Contras. In 1988 the embattled Sandinista government in Nicaragua rejected an airlift of newsprint donated by AmeriCares to the right-wing opposition daily newspaper, La Prensa. It had been timed to arrive just before the elections. The newspapers that supported the Sandinista government were unable to buy newsprint at that time because of a U.S.-imposed embargo on newsprint, but Vice President George Bush's staff called the Nicaraguan Embassy to try to expedite the shipment to La Prensa. Two years earlier, AmeriCares had delivered 200 tons of newsprint to La Prensa during another crisis created by the U.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            AmeriCares has also delivered supplies to contra terrorists based in Honduras. AmeriCares' tax returns revealed donations of cash and materials to the brother of contra leader Adolfo Calero. The Nicaraguan Freedom Fund, a front organization of Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, channeled $350,000 to AmeriCares.
           </p>
           <p>
            The AmeriCares website shows that its shipments seem to find their way to wherever the CIA is most active. Special "humanitarian supplies" have been shipped to contra forces in Afghanistan and their rear bases in Pakistan. An airlift was organized for U.S.-supported forces in Eritrea and Tigre during the war in Ethiopia. During the civil war raging in the Balkans, aid was sent to Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.
           </p>
           <p>
            AmeriCares often acts as an arm of U.S. foreign and domestic policy by reinforcing and supplying the most reactionary organizations. It controls the distribution network to millions of people in desperate need. This strengthens the infrastructure and influence of groups with a political agenda supportive of U.S. corporate goals. Millions of dollars of supplies flooding into a region during a war crisis or famine can exert enormous political influence. As Forbes, the magazine that calls itself the "capitalist tool," enthused, "AmeriCares is a splendid example of what a free-enterprise approach can accomplish in charity."
           </p>
           <p>
            A look at AmeriCares' advisory board shows links to both the U.S. government and right-wing organizations in the United States. Besides its links to the former CIA director, AmeriCares' board includes his brother Prescott Bush, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, former U.S. Secretary of State Zbigniew Brzezinski, General Colin Powell, and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. If asked what word best characterized this group of people, would anyone say "humanitarians"?”  (

             Awesome research. 
Do you know how the money was channeled from Unification Church to AmeriCares? I was looking at a few donation sites and wondering if there's a way to follow or dig deeper into these money trails. I haven't researched yet who owns these donation sites, but, here's a few I found

            isn't a shill. If I remember right, he's the one who figured out where the kill room was. He's contributed a lot. You've been here for 3 days and all you have is a comment downvote. Be careful who you judge or immediately label as a shill. You've already made yourself less credible.

            James. As for the Rothschild thing, only if we can prove it beyond any doubt. As that would be a big discovery since many are wise to how the Rothschild's operate.

            The link to the half-shell has been established. I think we'd also be wise to consider the time frame at play here. Alefantis took joint ownership of Buck's in 2003 and says himself in that interview that he was at the half-shell in his early twenties. A lot of time has passed between when he was there and where we are now. I'm not saying there is no link whatsoever, there could well be, but we're talking about 20 years here, that's quite some time. I'd be inclined to lean much more heavily towards this being a loose link at best.

            One of the businesses listed at the 711 address is Evergreens came up on a George Webb video so I did a little mapping - takes us here near the Burlington Northeastern Uni Campus.  Also listed at the same address is a Google-like Street Scan business which is now gone.

            Great post!! I had read that article awhile back and never caught that. This a perfect point as to why the traffickers are worried. All these minds, all of the world,  pouring over the internet. Sheehan. Going back to my research notes. I know she was involved in something I found. Not saying evil just some other article.

            Has anyone noticed addresses? This is the second time I see 213, which adds to six. 213 in Jewish gematria is apparently Nimrod ",the first Mason"

            There is only wild coincidence here and that is the link of Sheehan to a restaurant which was one of several employing Alefantis which I can assure you would go nowhere in a court of law. The rest of the links are rational. A liberal donates money to the DNC like thousands and thousands and also goes to Haiti like hundreds and hundreds to assist those most vulnerable, women and children, by providing desperately needed medical services in a converted shipping container. Read the article I cited and tell me if you feel any different about Sheehan. Please don't be thin skinned, I upvoted you after all. I am just cautioning you and others about large leaps of faith. Alefantis didn't become big cheese until his association with David Brock and his fortuitous acquisition of Bucks and CPP in 2009. By the way, Robert Sheehan provided the DNC with his occupation - lawyer - and his address in Central West Village NYC. I am rarely snarky in my comments, I just try to be helpful and thanks again for your focus on Alefantis.

             It helps to see where they got the idea to look at this org. I agree the connection to Alefantis is tangential, at best, but the orgs in question still deserve further digging, especially since shipping containers would be a good way to traffick with the right connections.

On the front page is none other than a video with Bill Cllinton ready to extol the wonders of the Org.  There are many girls and they are all adorable.  So another connection is Americares and the Population Council.   Take a look.  I am going to check on the Dr.

             They want to give the girls a place to let their guard down. Wow, if they only knew. It makes me SICK how Bill Clinton looks like some great person who cares about these poor people when it's the exact opposite! These people always appear great behind these charities. Outrageous.

               I was just thinking about Ted Buddy the other day when someone mentioned how these creeps look like just regular people. Looks can be so deceiving. It's more natural to think of them looking evil

                I think things will happen, but it will take time.  If Trump does not do it, I believe we can get those in LE that just can't stomach this stuff either.  The stuff I just read about in Racine and Oklahoma is shocking and can't continue.  It just can't. We have to find a way to blow this up.

              TY There are gold mines out there.  We just have to find them and dig.  This was a great post too.  I have a feeling that if we had enough people on this and enough time, we could find plenty more in there.  Dr. Jean Eric Calvaire is Manager of the Clinic Coq.  Coq in French is Chicken.  CLINIC CHICKEN???

               George Webb said as much about 3 months ago, CP&amp;PP was a trafficking front and Alefantis was a failed Yale student so he was relegated to a NOC job in child trafficking for DC elites and running a blackmailing brownstone operation thru CP&amp;PP, his stature rose to 49th most influential person because of the exponential growth rate of child porn pedophilia and Satanism in the corridors of power. The art scene is used to launder the money. The art get togethers  feature after event pizza parties where the willing are initiated, the not so willing are drugged the photos or footage are staged with naked Monarch trauma based mind controlled programmed sex slave kids  performing sex acts on scopalamine or roofied politicians or people in positions of power or authority. They are then "owned" by the bankster backed Rothschild Cabal and voluntold to contribute to the Clinton Foundation, or to do the bidding of these fucks as it pertains to arms sales to PedoNations in the Middle East, voting on war resolutions or pro-war NDAA bills in congress and/or in anything that enriches the web of ultra crooks known as the ruling elites.

            *****  On their facebook page there is the cutest bunch of children but in there you will find one with a panda shirt on. That is on their front page.  I also found a type of logo of a hand making the shape of a heart, well inside that heart was another heart, making it a double heart symbol.  There is an event also from the past with Harry Bader of USAID as guest speaker.  We know USAID is compromised.  There are quite a few pics of little darling children pictured by themselves which I think,  as we know can be used to sell the children.  Also at the very beginning was a video of a crate being driven to be shipped.  It said Clinic Shipment To Nimibia. Maybe this is the Shipping Container?  Check this out maybe your eyes can find more?

             Wow. It's really odd to show that carrier. What would be the point of showing that video other than some alternative motive. It's chilling to think that people go in these things. How scary! Think of the noise, being bounced around, being hot, hungry, thirsty and have no clue what awaits you. On top of that, being ripped from their families. People that work there have to be hearing the screams. They probably hire people that could care less. How can people be so heartless.

              Traffickers love these containers as it helps get rid of the weak and sick while enroute to the US. When they open container and see the ones that die because of what you just described, they write that off as spoilage. Nothing to see here move on.

               Yes! That's what I was just telling someone this morning. I read an article like a month ago about one of those where a lot of people died. Then, the ones who did survive were thrown out roughly and got injured. People had broken limbs. One kid got their arm broke 🙁

               It tears me up just to use a mouse trap. I couldn't even be mean to an animal. I have to turn my head if I see a dead animal on the side of the road. So, it's shocking to me that there are so many people out there willing to treat humans this way. Especially children. There is no amount of money that would make me do what these people do. Next time we think life sucks or we had a bad day, we need to remember how much worse it could be. I have changed so much since all of this has come out.

              I know.  My stomach sank as I watched it being lowered, probably onto a ship.  There is no food in there or water either I am sure.

                A while back I wrote about how they were shipped, and someone attacked me.  I believe it was a shill.  I have seen many reports on here verifying it.  It is beyond thinkable.  This should be what they are subjected to if found guilty.  If they are lucky enough to survive, we keep doing it until they don't.

             Good catches. Saw the crate headed to Nimbia. Reminiscent of the Instagram post . It's the one of the little girl and the comment was something like, "She needs a crate."

            I got to thinking, NOT saying this is what is going on with this company, but does anyone know who are Planned Parenthood "partners" worldwide? I wonder if it could be clinics like these

             There are so many of these places in Haiti and South Africa and there is even a place in DC that teaches people in these countries how to abort babies even though not medically trained so they can "plan their families."  They are rabid for these stem cells and fetuses.  Also, no fuss or muss in obtaining these from poor women and minor aged girls where birth certificates and govt regulation is non-existant.

              That makes me so sick and sad. In countries like these, it would be so easy for the Elites to create all kinds of organ harvesting and human tissue farms. We'd never hear about it or hear about how many women don't survive do to unsanitary conditions.

                Truly disturbing.  Thank you for those links. I never saw Clinton's "Foundations" directly connected to PP until I saw that PP Global website. And how many damn Orgs does Clintons have? CGI was closed yet I saw a couple different ones mentioned. If you go to Clinton's Foundation website, of course, I didn't see PP mentioned at all.
               </p>
               <p>
                I went back and looked again at the PP Global and see the partners names missing now?? WTH?  Found this article tho

             Ok...doesn't relate to this directly, but was searching the PP Global angle. Am I the only one that didn't know Clintons are "partners" with Planned Parenthood Global? And some have an asterisk next to it meaning " *Denotes partner for the 2017-2018 fellowship year". So
             <a href="http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org/">
              http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org/
             </a>
             just signed for 2017-2018? I don't see on Clintons website any mention of Planned Parenthood. This is very sketchy

            Appreciate your efforts..love when there's research on the DC scene. But I'm with "are we sure" on this one. There's a good chance that Sheehan is a genuine do-gooder. She is a physician's assistant who actually throws herself into the healing arts. There is a movement to convert surplus shipping containers into low cost housing like "tiny houses" so her idea to convert them into clinics was great

            ^feature. We always need to remind ourselves to do a thorough Google search when we zero in on a person or organization to avoid the risk of erroneous conclusions. You got my upvote for effort and for searching out Alefantis connections. I don't regard your post as 100% inaccurate..I'm just urging to proceed with caution. When we make a post on an individual it stays on the Internet forever.

             If your idea is that people like alfeantis affiliate with a few legit orgs for cover, just say so.  Googling them will never prove much. Persoannly I think you're naive.

            So yes he know the restaurant owner.   The owner knew this woman in college years before Alefantis worked at the restaurant.   She now lives in Massachusetts and runs this NGO.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not a link, that's a leap.  Unless you're playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon, this is not a link whatsoever.   Even if he knows this woman, it's still a giant leap to say he is linked to her organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you really surprised that a restaurant in DC has representatives or senators as customers?   I like the quotes around "serves" by the way.

            Where's your evidence Alefantis knows this woman or has ever heard about this organization?

            The guy from Johnny's Half Shell is 14 years older than Alefantis, so they didn't know each other when this guy was in college?   So what are the chance Alefantis know the college crush of his old boss?

            I was wondering how you were going to tie it together, but you did -- neatly, logically, and precisely. Why this doesn't have more upvoats I don't know. Definitely, an upvoat from me.

             The problem is the people who came from reddit are slowly trickling away.  Let's pretend we have evidence that is 99% certain it is hillary clinton molesting a child.  Other than showing the world I don't know what would happen.  We keep getting closer but at the moment there is no end game.  When we can have an end game and work towards it then people will come trickling back.

               Maybe you tried Voat's own search button? That one doesn't work, you are right. Try the link I gave.

            One of them is Direct Relief. Am still new here, so bear with me, but I remember "suspicious" logos contain some kind of butterfly and spiral? If yes, this one does.

             Looks like a nod to this common medical symbol with Greek roots (of course):
            </p>

             <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus">

            </p>
            <p>
             The "swirl" in this case is a nod to the snake. It could be a double entendre, of course, but let's see what we can find on this org besides sketchy symbols.

              That symbol is very well spread in europe and stands for medical health shops / drug stores. That symbols taking place for a very long time in europe, look different in every country and are absolutely not related to pizzagate!
