<p>The definition of “pedophile” is an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent.  Joe Biden, 76, is a former Vice President in the Obama administration and a 2020 Democrat candidate for President.</p>
<p>Baxter Dmitry reports for Newspunch, April 3, 2019, that according to Paul Tatchell, a roommate of Joe Biden at the Syracuse University College of Law, Biden admitted he was sexually attracted to children.  Tatchell reportedly said that Biden “used to say it was his ‘civic responsibility’ and that if he didn’t ‘choke the chicken’ or ‘clean the hosepipe’ before spending time around children he wouldn’t be able to keep his hands off them.”  Urban Dictionary defines “choke the chicken” as masturbation; so is “clean the hosepipe”.  Tatchell said that Biden’s “attraction to children is also the reason he became a teetotaller,” because “he realized he couldn’t control himself in public with a few drinks in him.”  Tatchell also said that when Biden married fellow law student Neilia Hunter, who was from an affluent Skaneateles, New York background, she had to &quot;overcome her parents\' reluctance for her to marry a young man with Joe’s dubious reputation.”</p>
<p>I can confirm the following:</p>
<p>◾Joe Biden did attend Syracuse University School of Law and graduated with a J.D. in 1968, 76th of 85 in his class. The next year, he was admitted to the Delaware bar. (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>◾Biden did meet Neilia Hunter while a law student at Syracuse. They married in 1966. In his autobiography, Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics, p. 37, Biden claimed that he had to overcome Neilia’s parents’ initial reluctance for her to wed because he’s a Roman Catholic. Neilia and their daughter, 1, were killed in an automobile accident in 1972.</p>

             The definition of “pedophile” is an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Hey, guy: age of consent was 7 in late 19th.c Delaware.  And when the lawmakers are evil you don't use their ever-changing laws as a standard.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have a real standard called biology. A pubescent girl develops outward physical signals of fertility like breasts and men see her as possible mothers -- his age is irrelevant biologically, and in our Anglo culture the general rule was double plus seven
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Currently we tolerate mass voluntary promiscuity of early teens, outside of holy marriage and procreation, AND condemn as sick pedophilia a successful 30 yo man marrying a fertile 17yo girl as (per your ambiguous definition of "minor beneath the age of consent")
           </p>
           <p>
            Worst of both worlds, fewer white babies=more chaotic diversity the Cabal thrives in.

             auralsects...........re. fewer white babies.......considering what western society , decisions made by elderly white men for everybody, has been doing for centuries, maybe fewer white babies won't be so bad.  founding fathers......think Thomas Jefferson was 49 when his affair with his slave , 14 , began. Lots of light brown children ensued.

              White men don't make the decisions, Jews do. Narrow your definition and I'll give examples.

              And Thomas Jefferson has not been proven as the father of Sally Hemings' children -- believe it or not there were other male Jeffersons in the household.

              Like all history that Jews teach us, it is to brainwash women like you into saying shit like you just did, you filthy anti-white CUNT.

            Always the Catholic connections. Watch the horrifying movie from 1976 called Alice Sweet Alice that is about murder and the Catholic Church. It has everything related to this type of stuff.

             Pedophellia premeates the Catholic Church whether you are a priest or not. This is why I hated Kavanbaugh’s appointment. I still believe that our government knows this and is the one behind it. I’ve been saying that Kavanaugh was Blasey Ford in drag. If he was, that means everyone knew. Sad that they would pick pedo Joe to be a Democrat candidate. They aren’t fooling anyone anymore, the American people are awake. We know the government not only allows pedophellia but they are the ones promoting it.

              "We know the government not only allows pedophellia but they are the ones promoting it." Reason hillary was chosen last time , joe biden this time...........the real powers, unelected, are pushing extremes in order to normalize. ........all across society, entertainment , media etc. ..................Instead the opposite is happening. People are turned off more and more by all of them.

            I trust Fellowship of the minds but a while back i watched a video by David Zublick and he said the same thing and also mentioned Bidens grabbing a secret service agents girlfriend by the breasts and they had to hold back the secret service agent from beating the crap out of the pervert. Zublick has had a lot of amazing videos but i wish i knew if he was legit because last week he said Martial law is coming very soon and the SHTF.

            Yep. 'Control himself in public' - makes you wonder what he does in private. Even public self-control doesn't work obviously though.
