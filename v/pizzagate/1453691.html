<p>then there is james brother LJ Alefantis</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljalefantis">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljalefantis</a></p>
<p>Now, Septime Webre who is the artistic director at the DC metropolitan ballet, and has proven to be very close with james alefantis and david brock.

<p>now here is where i need help, Septime Webre\'s is brother is (fishy character), Alfred Labremont Webre.</p>
<p>Alfred Labermonte Webre speaks at confrences with Dwight Eisenhauers great grand daughter, Laura Magdelena Eisenhauer
the reason i get confused is because Labremont Webre\'s personal testimony story involves being involved in time travel experiments to some extent, relating to a project involving Yale or MIT, where he claims he is a graduate from (although some speculate he is a hoax)
but back to the point.  At these conferences Alfred and Laura Eisenhaur speak at,  MK Ultra survivors, and Monarch survivors speak out about satanic ritual abuse, and all the related topics here.  anyone who as seen Alfred Labremont Webre on project camelot back in the day will know why this connection to Alefants is quite peculiar.  there has to be more to this connection i have to review alfred labremont webre person history and vet him myself, he may be a disinfo agent.</p>',

             <p>
              Because if you learned ANYTHING from the Daycare in UT, the Comet Ping Ping instagram, Comet-connected instagrams...you would already know the answer to that question! By contacting them like the amateurs we are, you royally fuck it up for ANYONE to follow and gather more info! YOU tip them off by contacting them. NOT SMART DUDE!!!

              Yeah I'll bet he was! He's hooked into this and a helluva lot smarter than you. HE BLUFFED YOU!

             <p>
              It wasn't a "blog"...which just proves the point that it was STUPID for you to contact him before images/comments/friends/connections/etc could be catalogued BEFORE you tipped him off.

               we have the right to post information on this forum for others to investigate, alfred is already a public figure and was already aware of the VOAT comments, so tell me the damage i did by contacting him, since his fb page is already archived...?

                Pizzagate &amp; AI Artificial Intelligence Entrainment - When I ran across my name Alfred Lambremont Webre as a target in a #Pizzagate conspiracy research website, I understood what #Pizzagate was about - AI Entrainment through AI transmission of a pedo Meme as state terror by CIA-backed WIKILEAKS disinfo PSYOP-"Leaks". This analysis below is from an actual #Pizzagate conspiracy research website. It is an exercise in AI entrained state fragmentation memes on the Truth Movement &amp; the work of Alfred Lambremont Webre. It is part of the AI Entrainment of the 3D body politic and the terraforming of 3D Earth into an AI planet as living Earth ascends into Love &amp; Unity consciousness-based portals in 4/5th density Ascension.

Alfred Labermonte Webre speaks at confrences with Dwight Eisenhauers great grand daughter, Laura Magdelena Eisenhauer the reason i get confused is because Labremont Webre's personal testimony story involves being involved in time travel experiments to some extent, relating to a project involving Yale or MIT, where he claims he is a graduate from (although some speculate he is a hoax) but back to the point. At these conferences Alfred and Laura Eisenhaur speak at, MK Ultra survivors, and Monarch survivors speak out about satanic ritual abuse, and all the related topics here. anyone who as seen Alfred Labremont Webre on project camelot back in the day will know why this connection to Alefants is quite peculiar. there has to be more to this connection i have to review alfred labremont webre person history and vet him myself, he may be a disinfo agent."

             I still dont think he has siblings, shouldnt this be the proof we need to have caught him in a lie since the story broke, he said those kids in the pictures were his nephews and nieces, now is that a blatant lie he can be called out on?
