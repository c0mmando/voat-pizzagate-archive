            : I need to remove this per Rule 3 and ask you to repost with a headline that clearly and accurately states your premise and how it directly relates to Pizzagate. It's kind of there, but all jumbled. Also, please use a double carriage return to break the text into multiple paragraphs. Thanks.

            I don't know why you're so quick to throw Joe Barton under the bus. You start off saying that Barton is an example of someone who was set up to be blackmailed which could later be used, and then you're tying him in with Maines who was found guilty of forward child pornography. Which is it? Or don't you know?
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if he had forwarded to Barton, we wouldn't know if that was further proof of "setting" Barton up by getting a read on his reaction. I'm sure that happens. You have to see if someone will take the bait and be lured into the cesspool. And a way more complete article states, the email was blocked by AOL:

            From what I've read, Barton was in a consensual adult sexual relationship and unmarried at the time. How he chose to act in that relationship is really none of my business. To me, this is either revenge porn or blackmail that was always intended to be used in some manner. The fact he sent a nude selfie and a video isn't pizzagate. The fact that it's being used to embarrass, humiliate, and get him to resign seems more a part of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, not sure where you're going with this, but it is worth discussing in terms of "Operation Brownstone".

             Usually employing a child porn addict at a senior position like Congressional aide is considered PG, and jacking off at work is textbook degenerate sex addict behavior.  Maybe stop at one glass of wine this early
