<p>I stumbled down this rabbit hole while I was looking into <strong>George Takai</strong> after his PIzza Hut ping pong superbowl commercial.  Takai was a voice in the movie &quot;Free Birds&quot; that in a nutshell is about how turkey\'s try to go back in time to The First Thanksgiving and have the pilgrims eat pizza instead of turkey.  In hindsight, the movie clip isn\'t all that important to my post, and if you want to save yourself 2 minutes just know that it\'s a weird clip showing a &quot;pardoned turkey&quot; gaining access to stay in some government housing and finally realizing his dream of ordering all the pizza he could ever imagine.  One thing to note are the panda stickers at the 0:27 mark...they look awfully familiar.  Here is the clip:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heW-FriVcsw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heW-FriVcsw</a></p>
<p>So I looked up who produced and distributed &quot;Free Birds&quot; hoping to find a theme of clips like this and that is where things started to get interesting.  The movie was distributed by <strong>Relativity Media</strong>, which has a rich history involving many players.  
</p>
<p>Relativity Media was started in 2004 by a guy named <strong>Ryan Kavanaugh</strong>.  The company has had a lot of ups and downs over the years, and many people have blamed Kavanaugh for the continued struggles and eventual bankruptcy in July 2015. </p>
<p>One of the more intersting players that helped resurrect Relativity Media was <strong>Ron Burkle</strong>.  It has been estimated that Burkle has invested over $800 million in Relativity, saving it from complete self destruction.  
</p>
<p>Source:  <a href="http://archive.is/gcHxm">http://archive.is/gcHxm</a></p>
<p>As many of you problalby know, Burkle doesn\'t just throw money at the film industry.  He is also notorious for his relationship with Bill Clinton during and after his presidency.  All in all it\'s estimated that he donated $10 - $15 million to the Clintons.  
</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://archive.is/53nvS">http://archive.is/53nvS</a></p>
<p>Here is a loooong article from the New Yorker if you really want to know the extent of the relationship between Bill Clinton and Ron Brukle:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/5K1rV">http://archive.is/5K1rV</a></p>
<p>A couple of quotes from the above article:</p>
<p>*&quot;Clinton stayed at Green Acres often enough so that a bedroom was designated for his use.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The two men decided that Clinton would become a partner in several of these funds, helping to find investors and projects. “I spent all my time with him,” Burkle said. <strong>They travelled the world on Burkle’s 757, clocking hundreds of flight hours</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In April, 2002, his wife, Janet, moved out of Green Acres and, the next year, filed for divorce. Around that time, Burkle was seen at an L.A. night club, with “two drop-dead-gorgeous girls, <strong>maybe twenty years old</strong>, one on either arm,” a person who was at the club said. “It was such a statement: I can do whatever I want.”</p>
<p>&quot;The New York Post ran items about Burkle carousing with** young models on his plane, which had customized sleeping quarters**.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Burkle claimed that Clinton was helping to facilitate others’ “investments in places where I just wasn’t going to do business”—like Colombia, or Kazakhstan. Burkle added, “I think the longer he was out of office it became more of a business. It became ‘Clinton, Inc.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also, his relationship with Clinton attracted the press. Reporters wrote often about his keeping company with <strong>young women</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Vanity Fair article, reporting on the wedding of Clinton’s chief of staff, Douglas Band, said that Burkle’s date was “an attractive blonde described by a fellow guest as <strong>‘not much older than 19, if she was that.</strong>&quot;*</p>
<p>One final quote from another Vanity Fair article:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Hq6Av">http://archive.is/Hq6Av</a></p>
<p>&quot;Burkle’s usual means of transport is the custom-converted Boeing 757 that Clinton calls “Ron Air” and that Burkle’s own circle of young aides privately refer to as “Air Fuck One.”</p>
<p>What is it about Bill Clinton and private jets?  Burkle sounds like a carbon copy of Jeff Epstein.  Which brings us to the next connection:</p>
<p>Dana Brunetti and Kevin Spacey.  Yep that\'s right, the same Kevin Spacey who is known to have flown on Jeffrey Epstein\'s Lollita Express.  Production partners Dana Brunetti and Kevin Spacey were to be made President and Chairman of Relativity Media in January 2016 but Spacey opted out at the last minute after realizing how much work he would have to commit. </p>
<p>Dana Brunetti (Spacey\'s partner) is known for producing the uplifting and inspiring film...50 shades of gray.  He has also been accused by a former employee of shooting porn in the studio.  
</p>
<h2>Source:  <a href="http://archive.is/WUCxN">http://archive.is/WUCxN</a></h2>
<p>I think that this final connection (or rather connections) is the most interesting and most important.  Ryan Kavanaugh (founder of Relativity Media) had a complete meltdown on twitter and blew up one of his fellow producing acquaintances** Brett Ratner**.  Here is a link to the tweets that were deleted soon after they were posted:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Xj3WG">http://archive.is/Xj3WG</a></p>
<p>A couple of highlights:</p>
<p>*&quot;Question do people believe #ratpack is some sort of studio? For real?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I end the casting couch if I both admit it\'s true but point to <a href="https://voat.co/user/BrettRatner">@BrettRatner</a> as the epitome of cating couch&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He\'s arguable the biggest sleaze anyone in Hollywood or a wannabe actress has met.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You. Yes YOU. There is no one to bust me. So yes I say it as it is. Period.  I don\'t give a &amp;<em>$</em>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guarantee he\'s at soho trying to get an 18 yr old.&quot;*</p>
<p>When asked why he went on the rant:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Honeslty I heard a story from another model of Brett\'s house and it was the last disgusting story I could hear.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In short, Kavanaugh is accusing Ratner of couch casting (see definition here <a href="http://archive.is/lV9gA">http://archive.is/lV9gA</a> ), using #ratpack as a code for something other than his studio, being a sleaze, having sex with a transvestite, picking up on 18 year olds in Soho, and doing something disgusting with a model at his house.  
</p>
<p>So who is Ratner and are any of these allegations true?  Brett Ratner is a successful Director and Producer who has worked with Relativity Media several times.  Several of Kavanaugh\'s Twitter allegations are surprisingly true.  Ratner did have sex with a transvestite when he was 13:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/8q43L">http://archive.is/8q43L</a></p>
<p>He also has a thing for young girls.  He tweeted <a href="https://voat.co/user/Morgane">@Morgane</a> Polanski: I love u more than Miley!!!  
</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/Iu1z3">http://archive.is/Iu1z3</a></p>
<p>This wouldn\'t be a big deal if Morgane Polanski wasn\'t 16 and Miley 17 at the time.  
</p>
<p>Ratner is also an avid Clinton supporter and donor.  He even throws rager parties for Clinton and her millennial supporters that are <em>&quot;almost like mini versions of the Playboy Mansion&quot;.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/23wJz">http://archive.is/23wJz</a></p>
<p>In the above article, one journalist writes:</p>
<p>*&quot;It\'s almost like all roads lead to Brett Ratner when you talk about Hollywood\'s social scene and Hollywood\'s nightlife scene.&quot;</p>
<h2>*</h2>
<p>Almost finished.  So far I have linked a few media moguls that have some very questionable actions pointing to sexual encounters with underage children with Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.  What about Trump?  Well there actually is a connection to Trump in all of this.  
</p>
<p>Remember the hashtag that Kavanaugh referenced when bashing Brett Ratner?  It was #Ratpack.  He said that #Ratpack wasn\'t referring to a studio.  Well what is Ratpack?  It\'s actually spelled RatPac and it\'s a motion picture production and financing company formed by 3 members.  
</p>
<p>The first member is Brett Ratner.  We already covered him. </p>
<p>The second member is <strong>James Packer</strong>.  He\'s an Australian, Scientologist billionaire who has been in the news most recently for breaking off an engagement with Mariah Carey.  You can read more about him here:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/pFArn">http://archive.is/pFArn</a></p>
<p>The final member of RatPac is the most interesting of all, and where this whole story comes full circle. It also leads to more questions than answers.  The final member of the RatPac is <strong>Steven Mnuchin</strong>, <strong>Trump\'s pick for treasury secretary.</strong>  Do a google search of Mnuchin and you will find countless articles bashing him and a multitude of reasons why he isn\'t qualified.  Among the reasons are a film fraud case while he was at Relativity Media.  I find the over-the-top bashing of Mnuchin reason to believe that he is on Trump\'s side. </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/LHXtz">http://archive.is/LHXtz</a></p>
<p>Trump\'s decision to call upon Mnuchin is puzzling given all of the connections he has to Hollywood billionaires...unless that is precisely the reason why Trump is bringing him into the flock.  There are still so many loose ends to clear up but my hope is that both Mnuchin and Kavanaugh are clean but are in the know and that Trump has called on Mnuchin to help bring down Ratner, Packer, Burkle, and the rest of them.  If anything this short investigation has opened my eyes to how twisted Hollywood really is.  
</p>
<p>Here is one last video interview with Ryan Kavanaugh, the founder of Relativity Media.  His answers in this video lead me to believe that he is clearly aware of a child trafficking problem, it is just difficult to decipher which side he is on.  I hope he is on our side.

           In short, Kavanaugh is accusing Ratner of couch casting (see definition here

           ), using #ratpack as a code for something other than his studio, being a sleaze, having sex with a transvestite, picking up on 18 year olds in Soho, and doing something disgusting with a model at his house.
          </p>
          <p>
           So who is Ratner and are any of these allegations true?  Brett Ratner is a successful Director and Producer who has worked with Relativity Media several times.  Several of Kavanaugh's Twitter allegations are surprisingly true.  Ratner did have sex with a transvestite when he was 13:

           Ratner is also an avid Clinton supporter and donor.  He even throws rager parties for Clinton and her millennial supporters that are

           In the above article, one journalist writes:
          </p>
          <p>
           *"It's almost like all roads lead to Brett Ratner when you talk about Hollywood's social scene and Hollywood's nightlife scene."

           Almost finished.  So far I have linked a few media moguls that have some very questionable actions pointing to sexual encounters with underage children with Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.  What about Trump?  Well there actually is a connection to Trump in all of this.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember the hashtag that Kavanaugh referenced when bashing Brett Ratner?  It was #Ratpack.  He said that #Ratpack wasn't referring to a studio.  Well what is Ratpack?  It's actually spelled RatPac and it's a motion picture production and financing company formed by 3 members.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first member is Brett Ratner.  We already covered him.
          </p>
          <p>
           The second member is
           <strong>
            James Packer
           </strong>
           .  He's an Australian, Scientologist billionaire who has been in the news most recently for breaking off an engagement with Mariah Carey.  You can read more about him here:
          </p>

            http://archive.is/pFArn
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The final member of RatPac is the most interesting of all, and where this whole story comes full circle. It also leads to more questions than answers.  The final member of the RatPac is
           <strong>
            Steven Mnuchin
           </strong>
           ,
           <strong>
            Trump's pick for treasury secretary.
           </strong>
           Do a google search of Mnuchin and you will find countless articles bashing him and a multitude of reasons why he isn't qualified.  Among the reasons are a film fraud case while he was at Relativity Media.  I find the over-the-top bashing of Mnuchin reason to believe that he is on Trump's side.

           Trump's decision to call upon Mnuchin is puzzling given all of the connections he has to Hollywood billionaires...unless that is precisely the reason why Trump is bringing him into the flock.  There are still so many loose ends to clear up but my hope is that both Mnuchin and Kavanaugh are clean but are in the know and that Trump has called on Mnuchin to help bring down Ratner, Packer, Burkle, and the rest of them.  If anything this short investigation has opened my eyes to how twisted Hollywood really is.
          </p>

           Here is one last video interview with Ryan Kavanaugh, the founder of Relativity Media.  His answers in this video lead me to believe that he is clearly aware of a child trafficking problem, it is just difficult to decipher which side he is on.  I hope he is on our side.

            Trump's reasoning for hiring Mnuchin is that he knows how to make money. He is not beholden to any billionaires like Hillary was.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is simply hiring the best people for the jobs. Trump doesn't owe him anything.

           <p>
            Trump is not part of the secret society in the elites though.
