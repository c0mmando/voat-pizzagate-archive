<p>Here is Delta Tucker Holdings Inc. 2014 Annual report</p>
<p><a href="http://ir.dyn-intl.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1514226-14-3&amp;CIK=1514226">http://ir.dyn-intl.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1514226-14-3&amp;CIK=1514226</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Our operations involve considerable risks and hazards. An accident or incident involving our employees or third parties could harm our reputation, affect our ability to compete for business, and if not adequately insured or indemnified, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are subject to investigation by government agencies, which could result in our inability to receive government contracts and could adversely affect our future operating performance.</strong></p>
<p>As a U.S. government contractor operating domestically and internationally, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to U.S. government contracting, as well as domestic and international laws. From time to time, we are investigated by government agencies with respect to our compliance with these laws and regulations. If we are found to be in violation of the law, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, the assessment of penalties and suspension or prohibition from doing business with U.S. government agencies. For example, many of the contracts we perform in the U.S. are subject to the Service Contract Act, which requires hourly employees to be paid certain specified wages and benefits. If the U.S. Department of Labor determines that we violated the Service Contract Act or its implemented regulations, we could be suspended from being awarded new government contracts or renewals of existing contracts for a period of time, which could adversely affect our future operating performance. We are subject to a greater risk of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities than companies with solely commercial customers. In addition, if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our reputation could suffer serious harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. If we were suspended or prohibited from contracting with the U.S. government, or any significant U.S. government agency, if our reputation or relationship with U.S. government agencies was impaired or if the U.S. government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, it could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.
U.S. government contractors like us that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Iraq and Afghanistan have come under increased oversight by the agency of inspectors general, government auditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and consequent reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of the allegations being investigated. As a matter of general policy, we have cooperated and expect to continue to cooperate with government inquiries of this nature. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering what we know about DynCorp\'s activities worldwide, it is truly shocking that they continue to be granted funding by the US government.</p>
<p><strong>Proceedings against us in domestic and foreign courts could result in legal costs and adverse monetary judgments, adversely affecting our operating performance and causing harm to our reputation.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are involved in various domestic and foreign claims and lawsuits from time to time. For example, we are a defendant in two consolidated lawsuits seeking unspecified damages brought by citizens and certain provinces of Ecuador. The basis for the actions was pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; however, on March 18, 2013 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia. The basis for the action arises from our performance of a DoS contract for the eradication of narcotic plant crops in Colombia. The lawsuits allege personal injury, property damage and wrongful death as a consequence of the spraying of narcotic crops along the Colombian border adjacent to Ecuador. In the event that a court decides against us, in these lawsuits, and we are unable to obtain indemnification from the U.S. Government, or contributions from the other defendants, we may incur substantial costs, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Many uncertainties exist surrounding foreign litigations and claims. We continue to assess such claims as they are made, however, it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome. An adverse ruling in these cases could also adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our ability to win future government contracts.</p>
<p>Other litigation in which we are involved includes wrongful termination and other adverse employment actions, breach of contract, personal injury and property damage actions filed by third parties. Actions involving third-party liability claims generally are covered by insurance; however, in the event our insurance coverage is inadequate to cover such claims, we will be forced to bear the costs arising from a judgment. We do not have insurance coverage for breach of contract actions, and we bear all costs associated with such litigation and claims. See Note 9 to the Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<p>The lawsuit is also discussed in this email from Wikileaks regarding Dyncorps participation in aerial fumigation activities aimed at eradicaitng coca plants in Columbia.</p>

<p>The Ecuadorian government claims that the Columbian/Dyncorp fumigation program has resulted in  significant adverse health affects for communities on the Ecuador/Columbia border. The claimants believe that Dyncorp used Monsantos Roundup Ultra which is banned for use in the US.</p>',
