            There is a mockingbird operation ongoing to make it look as though pizza = pornography. Very sly but people are disseminating the meme. Cheese pizza as we all should know means child prostitute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another mockingbird meme is "producing child porn" They make it sound as if it's legal when what they are doing is more acurately described as "filming themselves raping children."

            Please note: The perp was not an undercover officer, but a corrections officer at a prison. The undercover officer was the one who caught him by contacting him.

              After ‘cheese pizza’ post, officer arrested for child porn

            <p>
             NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Authorities say a New Jersey corrections officer has been charged with receiving images of child sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Federal prosecutors said Thursday that 37-year-old Stephen Salamak was arrested at his home in Lodi.
            </p>
            <p>
             Salamak has been suspended with pay from his job as a corrections officer at East Jersey State Prison in Rahway.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutors say an undercover officer first made contact with Salamak after he posted on Craigslist that he was looking for women and moms “that are into Cheese Pizza,” a reference to child pornography.
            </p>
            <p>
             After police executed a search warrant on his email, prosecutors say they found an email with five attachments showing nude images of young girls.

             This article is important, since it is proof that 'cheese pizza' is used as a code word for 'child porn'.

            Craigslist is becoming the seeker for Cheese Sleaze lately and also home for Crisis Actor Ads.  I have bought a few things on Craigslist but none of this.  Beware when placing anything for children.  They may contact you.  That's never happened to me, but there were women that have been attacked at their homes, etc.  Come to think of it, we have never checked for a bunch of Ads for Crisis Actors right before the Broward County School Shooting.  Hmm.
