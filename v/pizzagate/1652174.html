<p>Seaman posted this response about two hours ago: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651763">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651763</a></p>
<p>I removed it because there was no verification it was him (so the post violated rule 4).  I asked him to repost with some kind of verification it\'s him.  He <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651901">reposted</a>, but it looked like the same post with no verification (he mentioned a tweet at the beginning this time, but no link, so in my impatience, I didn\'t notice the mention).  So I removed and again asked for verification.</p>
<p>Seaman then tweeted this: <a href="https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/832293244532830208">https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/832293244532830208</a></p>
<p>He included an image of a Voat message (which seems to have never been sent, because presumably he was implying he sent this message to me, since I was the one who removed his post, yet I never received such a message).  The only way I was alerted to his tweets about the Voat post was through another Voat user\'s comment.  
</p>
<p>In the &quot;message&quot; he imaged in this tweet, he complains that I\'m asking for &quot;personally identifying info.&quot; LOL.  You\'re a public figure; all we needed was typical AMA-type verification (a photo of yourself holding something with today\'s date, &quot;Voat&quot;, etc).  Anyway, the tweet was sufficient verification, so I pinged him and told him he can repost and I won\'t delete.  Yet he still has not reposted (?).  Is he trying to set us up as looking unfair to him?</p>
<p>He also complained about us allowing <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1650713">the post</a> that had attacked him.  That post satisfied our posting rules.  This community is anti-censorship.  Again, feel free to repost your post with the same account (<a href="https://voat.co/user/David_Seaman">@David_Seaman</a>).  Please <em>link</em> one of your tweets about the post in the post itself, so other mods will not mistakenly remove it.</p>',

            Haha, I've seen this accusation thrown around, but no actual evidence. Just frothing conjecture and spurious speculation.

            And I have done so after having my character slandered
            <em>
             without evidence
            </em>
            of any kind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering all of that I have no issue calling people braindead retards, because as evidenced by their actions, that's what they are.
            <br/>
            I would be happy to engage armyseer in conversation about this topic, but instead of discussing it with me they simply banned me without interaction.
            <br/>
            These are the actions of someone who willfully refuses to act rationally.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And where has that happened. Go through my comments and show me where I have pushed that narrative.
            <br/>
            You can't because you're just as full of shit as the usual disinfo shills who come here to divide and create drama.
           </p>
           <p>
            You accuse me of being a co-opted paid for shill yet you provide no evidence for this and accuse me of "attack the user pointing it out".

            That's what this post did, sans stickying. Besides, Falcon has

            David's post in the meantime with an explanation. Make another one of these as a sticky, and it'll really come across as desperately trying to prove a point and pushing our own narrative. These posts oughta do it.

            I don't know much about the people here. Haven't been here that long, although I have been following PizzaGate for quite awhile.
I have no idea who runs Voat or how they make money, but I think the site offers a valuable outlet for PizzaGate research.
I like its layout better than some of the other sites Easier to follow.
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I gather David Seaman signed up as David Seaman today without proof that he was the real David Seaman initially.
Then he gave proof, but didn't give a link. Seems reasonable to take down the thread until it was verified.
           </p>
           <p>
            This site isn't about one person making videos about PizzaGate, but the research many are doing. I just don't see biting the hand that feeds you. It reminds me of Alinsky like tactics.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've wondered what would happen if the site is taken down. Where will all this good data go.
           </p>

            I take it you are a moderator here. What is the background of this site?

            Remember, the Satanist M.O.D. is and has always been DIVIDE &amp; CONQUER. They infiltrate every cause not in line with their agenda and destroy it from the inside.  Much like what has happened to the U.S.

            I am not discussing this particular case since I don't know the details: personally I dislike Seaman, but I also think mods have got to get over themselves around here. They are being a bit fascist. Every time I post about James Alefantis for example, I get my shit deleted and then I see other crap that stays up. Moderating seems unfair and unbalanced. Some people are on power trips. They need to relax rules a bit.

            I guess the short answer, after reviewing the comments posted below, is NO, David is not "smearing" Voat. He is sharing some facts about what happened here. Most of the community agrees that MF is the one giving Voat a bad name.

            Armyseer is a paranoid dick or a shill. They put me on that list as well and when I confronted them I got a piss poor excuse for it.Anyone can go through my posts, anyone's posts. At first armyseer accused me of being someone else using a fake alias. Well that didn't work. Have also heard I am cointelpro which is a laugh. I am a nobody on here, other than I post occasionally, particularly about ritual abuse as that affected people around me. We should all take a chill pill and stop acting like paranoid freaks. With Seaman, maybe he is an opportunist or a dick head but really, ask yourself, is he doing more good than bad. I would hope the answer would be good. Who gives a fuck, as long as Pizzagate keeps coming out. The more the MSM pisses on Pizzagate and uses it for an example of fake news the more people are looking. The morons fucked up. The Streisand effect. As for any involvement with Soros, demand an answer. Not making excuses for the guy but ask yourself, why would Soros be behind Seaman? For left-right control? If so, Seaman mainly rags on Podesta so would Soros be behind that? Just asking

            Couldn't you have asked him about credential and waited a little bit to see if it checked out, before you just delete the post?

           <p>
            I mean the big shit campaign that has been on Seaman the last few days here, he should have the right to defend him self.

             Normal procedure is delete and repost.  It's too burdensome to wait an unspecified amount of time to see if someone fixes their post.  Simpler to just delete and tell them to fix the problem.

            agreed. Voat mods did nothing but follow rules. David needs to link his verification. Tweeting is not enough– You need to link the tweet David lmao. It's not up to mods to search for it. And also, linking verification proves to readers its him too. I don't want to search for the verification, he must link it.
           </p>
           <p>
            david only attracts people who like sensational headlines. which is why they wont dig deeper to understand that the mods were just following rules. they will only agree with seaman claiming censorship.
           </p>
           <p>
            like someone else said, David is 80% fluff, 20% meat.

            How about I start a thread called is "MF biased and trying to divide Pizzagate?"  That would also fit the same definitions as this thread right? Lets see how long it lasts...  Edit, whatever. this is all counter productive bullshit.

            is a shill.  I have no opinion on whether Seaman is a shill (have seen nothing to make me solidly lean either direction on him).  This thing is possibly just a misunderstanding.  As I've told

             @David_Seaman

            , I'll delete this post (and write a new post explaining) if he issues a tweet explaining the misunderstanding.

             So now he has to jump through more hoops for you to delete this thread?  You should do that without asking and apologize publicly for making the forum you moderate look bad in a very public manner.

            <p>
             This whole thing is crazy...David is the most publicly prominent figure to visit this forum and you proceed to immediately bash him over the head with rules, when you could have shown a little discretion and taken the 2.5 seconds to see that he was simultaneously tweeting about

            Good lord, the bickering is extremely productive. Shattering credibility of an otherwise positively evolving investigation, one tear drop and one keyboard mash at a time. Focus on the facts, gents. Er, and gals.

             He didn't link any tweet or video in the post, so how was I supposed to know?  He also didn't include a LINK in his repost, so I didn't notice him mentioning at the top that he tweeted about it.  Then when someone in comments pointed it out, I immediately pinged him and asked him to repost.

            David is an unhinged, useful idiot (As you can see from the "hit piece" voat post on him from yesterday.)
           </p>
           <p>
            David did not post proof on the post. In the first post, he may have tweeted about it, but he never included it in the post. You asked him to provide proof next time, and deleted his post. Fair. Its the rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            What sucks is that David will use this to further his crying agenda. He knows that claiming "censorship" or crying wolf about getting killed soon gets more buzz than just posting research with facts to educate his folllowers.
           </p>
           <p>
            He made the video to smear voat, when in reality, you were doing your job and following the rules. David didn't link his tweet in either of the posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             FOR THOSE WHO SAY THE MOD SHOULD HAVE CHECKED HIS TWTTR HIMSELF:
            </strong>
            wrong. David needs to link verification so casual readers know it is him too! It's not just so the mods know, its so the readers know its him too. Not everyone follows david, or knows his twitter. Verification links is crucial and a part of the rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            David, quit your fuckin bitching. Quit crying wolf, you arent gonna get killed from podesta's goons when all you do is pout.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you would educate your followers with facts, instead of sensational tweets, you would do better for the movement.

             You are making it personal. Your post is a childish character assassination which is deflection of his Topic. This is an act of desperation that is text book Psychological Warfare. It also exposes your agenda.
Try not to make it so personal if you wish to hide your true intentions.
Good Luck.

            Millenial_Falcon, you are the only one smearing voat...and yes, you did let a lengthy attack post with multiple mysterious upvotes overnight stand while immediately deleting David's threads without bothering to check his Twitter feed that I linked to while he was simultaneously using Twitter...that is verification.
           </p>
           <p>
            David is a very public PG figure and is not familiar with the posting rules...it was clearly him and you could have verified that within about 2.5 seconds had you wanted to.  What's your beef with David?  And why are you singlehandedly making the forum you moderate look bad in a very public manner?  How did your heavy handed modding benefit this forum or the PG cause?

             Seaman isn't helping the reputation of voat either.  A shame, as this should be a symbiotic relationship.  Without a serious research community behind him like voat, all his protestations that 'Podesta is a pedophile' would amount to nought.   I hope we get the bar room brawl over soon and get back to work.

             Bullshit.  If you take a look at what took place, Seaman posted a rule-4 violation post with no verification it was him, then he reposted
             <em>
              mentioning
             </em>
             that he confirmed through Twitter (which I didn't notice at first because: no link), so I removed again (again asking for verification), then HE tweeted saying VOAT MODS UNFAIR.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guys, this thread is full of shills trying to smear mods (disrupt, deny, discourage strategy).

             David you are unhinged.  The mods may sometimes be unfair, but in this case you're being a bitch.  You need to work on your style and your persuasion skills.  You lost the status of "journalist" in many people's eyes because you are disorganized and hysterical and are therefore a toxic variable in this entire movement.  You are just a shitposter like the rest of us, you aren't anyone special so stop acting like the world is against you.  Infowars wouldn't even hire you because you are just too fucking bitchy.

             You're a fucking hack. You do no investigation, you just report on the same few bits of months old info over and over and most of your videos are just you ranting or shilling. You make the community look bad, especially now that you appear to be becoming unhinged.

             David, ignore the haters.  Just keep doing what you're doing.  You're shining the light on something that needs to be known to people.  We all have different strengths--some at investigating; some getting the message out.  We need everyone on board, even those whose approach we may sometimes disagree with.  I for one am grateful for what you do.

              Sorry, you can claim to be unbiased with regard to David, but I have seen you delete posts that linked to his videos, based on the rule that everything needs to be explained, whilst leaving non-David-related posts up that violated the same rule - and I mean these posts were submitted at the same time, roughly, so I have to assume there was some bias. Though this is not possible for me to prove.
             </p>
             <p>
              MF told David he needed to prove who he was in order for his post to stand. Then goalposts changed.
             </p>
             <p>
              I posted proof that was required, and that was deleted too, by MF himself, which is truly bad form since there is a conflict of interest (he was a subject of the video).
             </p>
             <p>
              Voat is going to quickly be outed as compromised unless you all pretend to be unbiased. None of us are, but you've got to fake it a little bit better.

                I can prove what you removed, but not the ones you let stand that were posted at the same time. And even if I did, i could not prove that you actually saw those posts.

                But you've already admitted that you no longer support david by claiming you once did. So you are not impartial and should probably leave these threads for those mods who are.

                  This is the problem, I feel the community would agree. You really should stay away from moderating posts by or about someone you are biased against. You know as well as the rest of us that facts can be spun either way, and it is what you leave out often times that makes bias a problem. The fact that you would argue for your right to engage here as a mod, when you e admitted to being against David (or, no longer on his side) reveals the exact problem, and why Voat is soon going to have a terrible reputation. David's videos can get 27K hits in an afternoon. I'm not in love with the guy, I'm stating a fact to support my contention that there are repercussions to the mods behviour here, and I would recommend staying on the side of caution and to refrain from engaging u less you're truly dispassionate, so you can think straight.

                 <p>
                  Please read all the comments here, and look at the up votes on David's comment. You and MF are in the minority. Do you care?

                   No, I don't particularly care. Popular is not necessarily right. I stand by my statement that you don't need to be opinionless in order to moderate fairly and according to a checklist. This post was violating rules. It was removed as a result. Had it complied with the rules, the post wouldn't have been removed, regardless of whether I agree with it or not. I would have, as a user and not as a mod, downvoted it, but that's as far as my expression of opinion would have gone. As far as opinions go, it is also my opinion that the board should be moderated according to rules, and impartially, and it is a stronger one than anything I think about Seaman. It is sort of a moot point to argue about this, though, as you're convinced I couldn't keep a cool head independently of my opinion, and I'm convinced I can. Cheers.

             Pot calling the kettle black.  Your Tweet calling us "unfair" and trying to make us look biased against you was completely unnecessary.  All you had to do was reply to me in a comment (no direct message necessary).  I also

             you after I saw your tweets, and asked you to repost, but you still haven't.  Issue a retraction tweet concerning your "voat mods being unfair" tweet, and we'll be all good (I will delete this post and write a neutral post about our misunderstanding).  And please repost your post.

              Nope...I agree with David...you delete two threads when it would have been so easy to check his twitter feed and now you want him to submit a 3rd thread?  Unfair was a fair way to describe it.

                 I meant more along the lines of providing the proof in his post, not on his Twitter feed. It's not a voat mods job to check his Twitter.

               I also understand, why David felt treated unfair, but Millennial Falcon tried to explain what went wrong here and offers a handshake. Now it's about David not to be unforgiving.

              Seaman is right, he did confirm the post was From him on his twitter. And here on Voat where we are against censorship, the man has a right to defend himself if you are going to let post after post attack him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: whether or not you believe he is a shill, does not mean he cant defend himself. He does have a job that relies on the veracity of his claims, and he should be allowed to defend both his career and his claims.

               Moderators have to remove dozens of shitposts from here every day; expecting them to be hanging out on twitter is unrealistic.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, Mr. Seaman is welcome to defend himself in the comment section of any and every post he wants to. He is free to explain or debunk any concern about him expressed by a Voater at any time. The opportunity to have that dialogue in order to get to the truth is why moderators volunteer hours of their free time daily to keep this subverse open and functioning.
              </p>
              <p>
               If we ever hope to drain the swamp our once democratic republic has become, we need to be able to freely critique our leaders and public figures and have an open dialogue. The fact that Mr. Seaman and many who follow him would rather wage ad hominem attacks against Voat moderators for holding him to submission requirements we require everyone to meet is telling.

                Well, it looks like you guys need to document everything to prove it to us.

                What's the next step for you guys? Unfortunately, although quite taxing, prove him wrong by documenting the fuck out of everything.

                You've made fair points for the most part. Don't misunderstand. My trust is waning with Seaman. But, I think the mod team has to shoulder the burden of proof. It's your platform he's using, after all.

               <p>
                Please, please, prove me and him wrong.

                 is the author of his own problems. All we have done is allow posts that satisfy submission guidelines, and remove those that do not. Seaman did not follow the submission guidelines by linking to anything to support the claims made in the headlines of his posts, the most basic rule of this subverse. His headline was "
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1651763">
                  David Seaman Here
                 </a>
                 ." Millennial_Falcon removed his post like he has done to hundreds of others for the same reason, and asked him to repost with a link that supported that claim. Seaman provided no link. He added more unsourced discussion of a tweet,
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1651901">
                  a single line of text
                 </a>
                 . Posts that fail Rule 4 -- unsourced discussion -- are easy to see because they are walls of text with no blue links -- exactly what Seaman reposted. So, Falcon removed it again, in the midst of the typical morning shitpost street-sweeping effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Seaman's post wasn't the only one that failed to meet submission guidelines, by the way. Neither did the the piece critiquing him the first time it was posted last night, with a headline claiming he was a "
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1650611">
                  Likely Mossad Asset
                 </a>
                 ". I removed it. The Voater reposted
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1650713">
                  an edited version
                 </a>
                 that complied with the guidelines, and it stayed. We applied the same standards to both parties.
                </p>
                <p>

                 will attest, it is not our job as moderators to remove posts because the subject discussed in them might think them "unfair." If the claims made by the post are linked to supporting evidence and satisfy all the submission guidelines, we must leave them up due to Voat's minimal-moderation anti-censorship policy. It's up to users to challenge one-sided or false-premise or poorly supported arguments in comments and with downvoats. That's how it is here. If one side doesn't want to invest the effort to defend its point of view, including by following the submission guidelines, then the other side will stand unopposed. For better or worse, that's how the system is set up.

                  We can go back and forth on this as much as you want.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Like I said in the beginning, the way to defend yourself is making a stickied post outlining everything in a complied, neat little post.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hold our hand through it if you have to. I don't think there's much wrong in urging you to go beyond the call of duty. It might seem backwards. I understand that, but your best defense is still gonna be going out of your way to prove him wrong. This back and forth between you and I will do
                  <strong>
                   nothing
                  </strong>
                  to maintain your credibility. This isn't a discussion
                  <em>
                   you and I
                  </em>
                  should be having, it's a discussion you and Voat should be having.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As a side note: I find it
                  <strong>
                   extremely
                  </strong>
                  contradicting that most people here are against censorship, but when I insist that the moderation team be transparent, even so far as to make a case for themselves using their moderation powers to make a post devoted to doing so, instead of sitting in the comments arguing with people, I see people jumping down my throat. My only point was to keep them honest. Also, it's certainly unwelcoming that you would bring other people into this with the sole intent of attacking my character. My claims are in no way invalid because of my recent participation. It's pretty telling, if anything, that people are now trying to shut me up.

                      I understand you think that. But, argumentum ad hominem is about claiming an argument doesn't have merit due to the character of the individual who purposed the argument.

                  Make a new post and sticky it. Make the title: "Exposing David Seaman" or whatever you want. But, in the post include his argument, your argument, and then provide the documentation to back it up. You're wasting your time waging war in the comment sections. If you're going to moderate, moderate. Don't bicker, it's a direct betrayal to everyone involved in this situation at every level.

                 <p>
                  At some point, someone has to should the responsibility of going through and proving it at every stage. Your mistake (if you keep ignoring it) will be not doing it first, especially if you keep dodging the opportunity to definitively prove yourself and instead continue this arbitrary bickering. Take the high road.

                   I don't see this as bickering. This is not your everyday rule-violating post that gets deleted and then that's it. He has tried smearing the mod team on two platforms, with a 100k+ following on each. As I see it, we need to address his points and then let the public decide for themselves. But if we don't react, then only his side of the story gets heard.

                    Great. That's the exact thing I've encouraged you to do!

                    Maybe I'll be more convinced that you maintain any integrity you once had when you actually fulfill that though, because, as of right now, you're still parroting the same shit I've seen from every other mod. If anything, that seems coordinated.

                Tbh it wasn't even your responsibility to seek out his tweets. Honestly even if you saw them but he didn't provide them to you you really could have not reposted his shit. So good on you for being a decent person, sorry people suck.

            I've confirmed that post was me, from my Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            I submitted it a second time, it was deleted by you, a second time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the posts here do not require a photo identification for them to remain up, correct? Why must mine?
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone published a baseless character attack against me, which seems to be designed to distract and divide. Why did you leave it up for a day, where many people saw it, yet my posts were deleted shortly after posting them?

             I can understand why this would be frustrating, but due to the nature of voat allowing any username to be claimed by anyone; would you prefer we let any monkey using your user name post? possibly misrepresenting you and damaging your cause?.
             <br/>
             Another user writing a post critical of you can be addressed, and should be, both in that thread and with it's own post.
             <br/>
             I'm unaware if you contacted any of the moderation team to ask what's the best way to rebut and ensure it gets the attention of the community?

             This has been happening from the beginning, and all of the mod team have long been targets for attack, here and in real life. We're also a very small team for a very big topic and it's very hard to keep a lid on the attack campaigns from very well funded agencies.

             How about we collectively use this platform to refute that attack? You're welcome to post a refutation and link it to any other web location (twitter/youtube etc) if this medium is insufficient to communicate your message.

             David, with all due respect, why don't you get a real job like the rest of us and stop whoring out Pizzagate on You Tube for Ad Sense dollars. And if you are going to continue to do so, BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE! Do some research and real journalism to forward our cause rather than just repeating research done by others. If its not that its all complaining and whining. You're being lazy, you have a big audience, do some real work, be a revolutionary and help us change the world and put some fuckers in cuffs!

             I've read plenty that MF has written expressing his opinion on DS. He dislikes the guy for some reason. Got a feeling it's ego based.

             The Mod has emotional baggage and is a conflict of interest. The interest is not making it personal. Failcon is why the medium is compromised.

             Edit: I find his tweet, and the way this played out rather suspicious, and it could just be a misunderstanding, but I have repeatedly offered him a way to de-escalate (as well as repeatedly pinging him before I posted this), and he instead chooses to escalate, saying I've "shown my true colors," and ignoring my peace offering.

              David Seaman has immense support and respect in the global pizzagate community. Best not to fight with the big league. Not good for Voat. If I owned Voat I wouldn't want you fighting with David Seaman. Take a break.  You sound like you need it.

               His tweets are increasingly turning people off due to his unprofessionalism.  So, to say he has such global support is a bit of a stretch.  We've been trying to tell him about the effect he is having on some sectors but he prefers to walk his own path.  That's fair enough but he's not taking many with him.

                So be it. Let him walk his own path. I see he has the ability to self correct/admit mistakes. The hostility toward him on voat has made me consider leaving this investigation for good as the level of animosity is insane. Can't reason with it. And I surely am not alone.

                 I think all this talk of 'hostility' is overdone.  Someone posted a thread about Seaman looking into his background, because he had created so much 'buzz' here on voat with his increasingly erratic posts on twitter in the last few days.  Maybe the language in the post was a bit inflammatory.  And not surprisingly, Seaman showed up to defend himself.  Now the miscommunication (which happens all the time here as most of us know) has blown up.  And Seaman is tweeting about voat in a way that I personally think is quite destructive.  Am i surprised ?  Absolutely not.  That is his modus operandi.  For sure, we have all sorts of shills in this forum.  But voat is definitely one of the better forums in its handling of the inevitable subversion attempts.  This is an adult forum.  Many of us here do not subscribe to blind adulation or look for 'movement leaders' or even 'thought leaders' as Mr. Seaman recently described himself.

                 I will explain to you what is happening now.  As with all infiltrated grassroots collaborative movements, TPTB will be trying to implode this investigation with arguments, tension, people being indignant and so on.  Usually that's enough  to finish off a forum like this.  But this time, I think the community is too strong.  So we have a little fight at the moment. Mr. Seaman can go back to his Twitter and Youtube accounts and we will get back to researching this filthy, corrupt system.

               He used to have immense support, including mine. Lately, though, it doesn't seem to me that the community unanimously agrees with you on this one.

                Well of course support is not across the board unanimous for David. And thank goodness. It would be terribly troubling if we all thought the same wouldn't it. We could have ended up with HRC as Pres and John Podesta or Huma Abedin et al as Chief of Staff. Yes we can fault him. We can call him out for his mistakes. He is human. And he is clearly, as I see it, working for the greater good. He's a great amplifier and he has an immense following. Blatantly attack him and you only weaken pizzagate and voat.

                 They're weakening Voat, but not pizzagate. We can all fuck off to another forum just as we did after Reddit.

             Stop forum sliding.  If your post breaks the rules, it will get deleted.  It's not that hard to follow the rules.
