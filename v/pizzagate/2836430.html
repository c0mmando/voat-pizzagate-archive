<p>Judge Who Facilitated Guatemala Illegal Adoptions was finally removed.<br />
Guatemala earned a reputation as a hub of illegal adoption, with many children going to live with parents from the US.  A 2010 analysis by the CICIG found that over 60 percent of processes for adoption in the country have irregularities. According to the report, demand from abroad has led to the formation of networks that threaten and coerce mothers, or take advantage of their vulnerable situation to steal or illegally buy the children.  Attorney General, Conrado Reyes, was removed from his post after accusations of ties to illegal adoption networks and drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Guatemala halted all adoptions due to political corruption</p>
<p>the Guatemalan prosecutors’ office for human trafficking found sufficient evidence to try Nancy Susan Bailey,  with taking children and illegally placing them for adoption. A report by Guatemala’s International Commission Against Impunity uncovered 3,342 “irregular” adoptions, primarily to U.S. couples.</p>
<p>The commission described networks of child-trafficking in the country for the purpose of illegal adoptions.</p>
<p>Adoption breeds corruption for several reasons. 
Demand for children to adopt keeps prices high, creating a fertile breeding ground for all sorts of illegal activity.  Combine that with very loose regulations and an almost complete lack of oversight and you have a powder keg for deception, child-stealing, and every transgression imaginable in order to obtain children to meet the demand.</p>
<p>The system has delivered 30k Guatemalan children into U.S. homes since 1990 - </p>
<p>The first step in the international adoption process is to apply and be approved by the U.S. government
 to do an international adoption.</p>
<p>ttps://www.adoptioninstitute.org/news/s-c-based-adoption-agency-official-pleads-guilty-in-court-to-fraud-and-bribery-charges</p>
<p>Global adoption is a big business, and profit incentives that have made it a target for kidnappers, human traffickers, and pedophiles.
Despite regulations on international adoptions, and with some countries even banning all foreign adoptions, the problem has continued. Kidnappers continue to fuel the trade, and adoption agencies continue </p>
<p>InSight Crime reported  that in Guatemala, “illegal adoptions continue to flourish despite regulations,” and that “the majority of stolen babies are sold for irregular adoptions or for their organs.”</p>
<p>Human traffickers also take advantage of natural disasters. 
“There’s no paperwork. What they do is they give you a power of attorney, that ‘here, you can enroll my kid in school, you can take him to the doctor,’ and that’s it. The kid’s gone,” he said. “And there are documented cases where these kids, they wound up with pedophiles.”</p>
<p>After they’re in the United States and handed off to less regulated forms of adoption, the children are more likely to face abuse.</p>
<p>“This is because children born in U.S. hospitals or to U.S. citizens benefit from reliable documentation that is often absent in international adoptions, which creates a greater risk of unethical conduct than in domestic adoptions,” the report states.</p>
<p>Even if the adoption goes through in Florida or New York, they’ll do the paperwork out of Utah.”
Opperman said, “There’s really no vetting done with these private adoptions whatsoever. Once they take place, nobody knows where these kids went.”</p>

            I think there must be a moratorium on all adoptions.  I believe there are enough children here to satisfy those with good intentions.  The problem is the screening and allowing just about anyone to adopt a child.  Russia had the right idea and we must push to stop it here as well.  Remember the European Adoption Agency that was raided in Ohio?  It had ties to HRC.  This must stop.  I am not a homophobic person but I do not agree with allowing gays to adopt.  This is a group of people that are about 2% of the population and we have had a huge movement for them to be able to have this right.  I think it is a huge mistake.  I think there have been pedophile couples that have adopted and we all know this.  They also can pay others to have their children for them, as Elton John and his partner did.  Knowing what we know about him, well that is frightening.  How do we start putting a stop to this, Idk.

             Domestic worker Alicia Lopez, 50, had been outside the home for hours trying to find out what happened to her autistic 12-year-old son who came to the center with a drug addiction. She said he had been raped there last week.

            <p>
             Another strange coincidence. NYT says all the dead in this fire in a children's shelter (in Guatemala) were girls, but that may not be the whole story. USNS Spearhead was sitting off the coast of Guatemala again when it happened. The shelter is inland, but accessible by helicopter.

             USNS Spearhead works in the area of humanitarian assistance as well as special operations support and does quite a lot of training in the Caribbean.

            Once you adopt a child, you become the legal guardian and sign off for medical decisions.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the law stands, if you have a diseased child, you can adopt a genetically similar orphan and legally comply the orphan to give up an organ, blood, marrow, or other genetically specific serums to cure their "siblings" genetic diseases.

            Caplan said an even bigger danger than having patients unfairly moved to the front of the line is the risk that the public would stop donating organs, Caplan said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why all of a sudden do we need So Many organs?  Why are people getting so very sick they need a kidney.  So many kidney transplants.  We did those posts about Organ Harvesting in Chicago and Globally.  This is extremely worrisome, with people being bumped up to the front of the line.  Very dangerous business.  As long as they are making so much money at it, they will get them from where ever they can. Even Little Children.  They are devilish and evil.

             I think the "why" goes to big agro and all the shit they put in food and water. Wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if "public health" measures are actually designed to enrich those who own the healthcare industry.

              The system is run on debt ...u will find no remedy except more debt to plug the debt inside the debt prison..
Its not rocket science ot deduce why they r administering flouride in water and toothpastr...when all the govt sponsored science paPers on flourine clearly point to floutine being a neurotoxin..
So then u ask why the dichotomy....
There is no dichotomy...they r giving u notice...
The public bodies are revealing tto u that our private actions of increasing the debt at banks is the reason they allow corporations that leverage more debt to poison the private citizen who is the source of the debt ..
Licence ...means the permissiin to do something that would otherwise be unlawful..
Medical licences are a licence given go doctors to doctor ur health..infinitesimally...
The govt lobbyistz make sure they drip feed poison form all quarters to have u end up at the carving table of the doctor...and surgeon..
             </p>
             <p>
              ..decrease the debt at ur own bank , not private banks..
Ure own bank is the treasury..
Sime solution to a massive problem of our own doing..
We r in complete control

              I agree.  Thank God no one in our immediate family has needed anything replaced.  I don't remember this happening when growing up, this started I would guess at such a pace, about maybe 10 years ago.  The saying, You are what you eat, sure is the best advice.  A diet of pulled pork and craft beers has taken it's toll.   Our bread has been totally overhauled and so many have allergies now.  All to drum up more business for these  nasty organ replacements.
