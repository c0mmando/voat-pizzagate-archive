Re: Brief analysis of primary elections of 5/18/10 
The narrative storyline of the media, primed by the Republicans, that the midterm elections of 2010 will be 
a verdict on incumbents (when the Democrats hold the White House and both houses of Congress), that 
the Democratic agenda will be repudiated and that voters will embrace the Republican Party was dealt a 
shock on Tuesday. Though the pundits cling to safe, generic and unthinking blather about the rebuke of 
"incumbents," the results disclose deeper consequences for the parties—especially the GOP. 
Regular Republicans were universally defeated—in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Despite endorsements 
from the entire Republican establishment, Trey Grayson was soundly beaten by Rand Paul. Republican 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who threw his weight behind Greyson, is the one particularly 
repudiated. Cheney also went out of his way to come to Kentucky to campaign for Grayson. (That's two 
for two for Cheney—Kay Bailey Hutchison was routed by Rick Perry for governor of Texas, Perry 
running hard to the right to the point of talking up "secession.") Rand Paul is personally attractive, but 
he is not a "conservative." He embraces the Tea Party movement and uses his platform to advocate 
byzantine conspiracy theories about Obama being in league with Castro and Chavez over climate change 
against capitalism, the Federal Reserve as a socialist plot, and other John Birch Society style nostrums. 
He may well run for the Republican presidential nomination—he won the majority at a stacked 
Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington this Spring—further discombobulating a party 
without an obvious frontrunner for 2012 and certainly without a Reagan in the wings. Undoubtedly, 
Paul would do far better than his father did and might even win states, such as New Hampshire. Rand's 
victory does not presage the restoration and renaissance of the GOP, but its continuing disintegration. 
The center of the GOP cannot hold. 
The defeat of Arlen Specter, a Republican senator for 29 years and Democratic one for only one, was the 
consequence of the internal transformation of the Republican Party. Specter left the party of which he 
was its longest and once most influential representative in his state precisely because he could not win

his party's nomination in a primary. He knew he would lose to a far right wing congressman, Pat 
Toomey, a darling of the Club for Growth, another "movement" operation, claiming to be "libertarian," 
that is a front for the narrowest special interests. So Specter leaped. Ultimately, he was pushed 
overboard by Democratic voters because he was not accepted as a Democrat. The turncoat could not 
camouflage his past. Specter's defeat was the defeat of a regular Republican by Democrats who, 
presented with the choice of a Democrat, chose the Democrat. 
The Democratic candidate in the special House election in Pennsylvania to succeed John Murtha, Mark 
Critz, a former aide to Murtha, was in effect running as the incumbent. He easily won, despite poor 
numbers in the district for Obama. The district, moreover, was the only one in the country that had voted 
for John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008. Critz's victory, therefore, was not merely a 
retention—in light of the McCain win, it can be claimed as a pick-up. 
Blanche Lincoln's troubles are specific, not the result of a widespread populist uprising. She did not support 
certain labor union issues and most importantly failed to back health care reform. Her problem is that, 
like Specter in a way, she is perceived by Democrats as untrue and disloyal. Without her advocacy of 
derivatives reform it seems likely she would have been trounced. 
Of course, Democrats have burdens in the mid-terms as a result of Obama's political and policy 
mishandling of his first year, continuing economic hardships despite the beginning of an upturn, the 
president's lack of rapport with working class voters, Obama's austere professorial style, and the near 
brain-dead, flatlined White House political and messaging operation—none of which I will discuss here. 
These factors, not to be dismissed, have nonetheless been overshadowed by the consistent voters' 
judgments about the regular Republican Party in the elections on Tuesday. 
The radicalization of the Republican Party, becoming more radical with every election cycle, is accelerating. 
(Reagan now appears in the distance as a moderate.) Coming into office, among his naïve illusions, 
Obama assumed that perhaps half to three-quarters of the Senate Republicans would easily be persuaded 
to support his programs, including health care. (Cass Sunstein confided this to me recently.) Obama and 
his team, moreover, never imagined that the Republicans would use the filibuster to render him 
ineffective and discredit him as they used that instrument against the Clinton presidency in 1993-4. 
Obama still cherishes a lingering though tattered belief in his postpolitical, postpartisan and postracial 
mission; that his election marked a conclusive break with the whole history of American politics; that 
the profound conflicts of American politics going back to the Civil War were simply the personal 
controversies of contemporary political personalities whom he had superceded. Throughout his political 
career, until he became President, Obama had no previous experience facing the Republican Party or its 
right-wing. In his one race for the U.S. Senate, he had no real opponent—whack-job Alan Keyes was 
imported from Maryland. Then he ran against John McCain, one of the worst politicians of his time, 
held in contempt by his party. Since Obama's election, his experience has understandably been an 
education, rather different from his happy time working amiably with conservatives as president of the 
Harvard Law Review; one hopes it is a learning experience. In fact, the national Republican Party is not 
a mirror image of the national Democratic Party, its members just happening to hold different views on 
policy. Since Nixon, the transformation of the Republican Party has been a dominant, if not 
the 
dominant factor in American politics. Tuesday's election was another milestone in its mutation and, 
since Reagan, its long-term disintegration. Obama and the Democrats have been given a breathing 
space. The opportunity of completing the work of the Clinton presidency is still there—it is always 
there—the long-term realignment of American politics by building a broad majority Democratic 
coalition. In the short-term, post-May 18 primaries, the splits within the GOP need to be highlighted; the 
takeover by extremist forces emphasized; the rejection of traditional Republicans within their own party 
stressed; and the economic consequences of the extremists—not least now, the gift of Rand Paul, the 
Republicans' new spokesman on the scene—who would shut down Social Seucrity, Medicare, student 
scholarships, and the interstate highway system—constantly targeted as a threat to economic recovery. 
Run, Rand, run!

 I HuffPost Reporting 
The Power Of Clinton, The Invisibility Of 
Obama
            <br/>
            First Posted: 10-12-10 02:37 PM I Updated: 10-12-10 02:37 PM 
LOUISVILLE -- I see that Dr. Rand Paul has taken out after Bill Clinton, dredging up Monica Lewinsky. And I know why 
Paul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far more 
potent and popular foe than President Barack Obama. 
On my first day working for The Huffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago at 
the 
Courier-Journal. 
The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stage 
interview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna Huffington. It was a tricky mix of professional 
incest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again 
out in the state. 
I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed: 
Like Voldemort's, Obama's is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats. 
At a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president made 
a stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without once 
mentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of 
government. 
To be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch Republican 
territory. "We're farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever," GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me 
yesterday. "President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak." 
Still, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats' confused, divided and defensive 
predicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you're 
a Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor. 
Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn't try to help. But 
his travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he's touting -- the center of 
attention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally's mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to the 
point, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They 
were glad to have him.

Re: Libya, Benghazi, Oil 
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Government, as well as the 
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services. 
I. During early December 2012 Libyan Prime Minister All Zidan and President 
Mohamed Magariaf concluded a series of discreet meetings with selected tribal leaders from 
Eastern Cyrenaica region (Barqa in Arabic), after which they agreed that the problem of the 
growing Barqa federalist movement is gaining strength and will again become a major issue in 
early 2013. At the same time National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al 
Mangoush warned Zidan that the Eastern tribes have rearmed and reequipped in the past three 
months and are preparing to reassert their desire for a degree of autonomy in early 2013. 
Mangoush also advised that the situation in the region between Benghazi and the Egyptian 
border may become increasingly complicated as Salafist fighters from Egypt continue to arrive 
in Benghazi. Mangoush reported that his staff officers have been advised in secret by aids to 
Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, General Mohammed al-Sissi, that, acting under instructions from 
Egyptian President Mohammed rvlorsi, military and security forces are taking steps to detain or 
neutralize extreme Salafist para-military groups and that a number of these fighters are fleeing to 
Libya. According to the Libyan commander, these Salafist fighters are comfortable in Benghazi, 
where many of them served with Libyan revolutionary forces during the rebellion against former 
dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, 
2. In the opinion of this individual. Zidan and Magariaf, after consulting with Minister of 
Oil Abdulbari al-Arusi, decided to move thrward with a plan dating back to the administration of 
former Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza dividing the National Oil Corporation 
''s (NOC) 
production and exploration divisions into two separate firms. With this in mind, al- Ai 
began 
discussing the matter with concerned parties in late November and early December. Included in 
these discussions were meetings with members of the local federalist council in Benghazi and 
tribal officials from Barqa. In these sessions Al-Acusi described a new structure managing all 
existing oil-related firms, while building new operations and raising funds from investors outside 
of the country. This firm will be divided into two branches, one in Benghazi and one in Tripoli.

Al-Arusi added that the cost of this project will range between fifty (50) and sixty (60) billion 
dinars. 
3. 
(Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, this concept came as a 
surprise to most of the local officials in Tripoli and Benghazi. This individual added that while 
the Western officials continue to have some questions about the matter, the Bengliazi/Barqa 
leaders were, in al-Anisi's opinion, positive, if not enthusiastic about the new initiative. 
According to al-Arusi, doubts on either side relate to the mistrust that remains between the two 
regions, but he is determined to move ahead in this matter and is supported by Zidan and 
Magariaf. According to this source, the president and prime minister are convinced that they 
must deal with this internal East-West issue before they can bring a stable security environment 
to the country and disarm the remaining independent militias in each part of the country. This 
individual added that in private discussions al-Arusi stated that the tentative name for this new 
oil entity will be the National Corporation for Oil Refining and Petrochemicals Industry, with its 
headquarters in Tripoli, and substantive offices in Benghazi. Like the NOC, the new firm will 
Fall under the Ministry of Oil and Gas.) 
4. 
In addition, this sensitive source noted that Al-Arusi is also discussing the creation of 
a company specializing in mechanical construction related to the oil and gas industry rhis firm 
would be based in Renglia7d. The minister stated in private that he believes such a company can 
be developed to compete with international firms in this very complex field. He also believes 
that such a firm must be managed by experienced. scientifically-qualified Libyans, with 
reputations for honesty. He noted that until as such a cadre is developed it may be desirable to 
use experts from Egypt to fill the immediate needs of the firm. AI-Arusi believes this firm 
should have offices in all of the oil fields and loading facilities. The minister also plans to 
establish an office in Benghazi, similar to Tripoli's oil institute, a facility that will train students 
looking to pursue oil-related studies. In addition, al-Anisi is making plans to reopen the Higher 
Petroleum Institute in Tobruk, which was closed by Qaddafi at the beginning of the revolution. 
He told a sensitive source that he expects the Tobruk institute to produce thousands of skilled 
engineers to provide Libyan managers for the future operation of the oil sector. Once the final 
details are set the Zidan regime will submit the entire package for parliamentary approval and 
financing 
6. (Source Comment: Advisors to Magariaf state in confidence that, in their opinion this 
comprehensive plan for the oil industry will face opposition from individuals with links to 
foreign oil firms, primarily foreign trained engineers who hope to see greater privatization in the 
oil an oil services industries in the wake of the revolution. According to a particularly sensitive 
source, Zidan is particularly concerned about this possibility, noting that these individuals see 
this issue in strictly business terms, not considering the political issues, and the East — West 
situation, that are all part of the overall picture in Libya At present al-Arusi believes that 
foreign oil firms remain concerned about the unsettled security situation throughout Libya 
however; he is convinced that this new plan will help address this situation. At present, he noted 
that the large Italian oil firm ENI is stepping up its operations throughout Libya, and, with the 
support of the Italian Government&lt; will continue to increase its investment in Libya in an effort 
to get ahead of the other foreign firms concerned in Libya)

             People ultimately need food, shelter and water to live.  And here's Big Brother stepping in and taking over the food supply, so that citizens become dependent on them.

            <p>
             I have started to notice how much food we consume here in America is made in a lab, not in a field.  It's scary actually..

            A search for 'Verizon' brings up a few emails regarding plans for installing / extending a telecommunications system at Hillary's Chapaqua residence in order 'that she can become more self sufficient at home'.
           </p>
           <p>
            The installation appears to have been planned over 8 continuous days so as not to involve 'a change of teams'. It involved cable laying, cable splicing, installation of equipment and testing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could this have been the installation of, or upgrade of, the private server and SAP set up?

             The private server was already being used for her 2009 presidential run and Bill Clinton's email and it was not State Department folks setting this up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Giving the long period of time it took for this installation and the fact that it was managed by the State Department, I would bet that this was the installation of a SCIF, a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility in her home.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know that she had one at Chappaqua.

               They are setting up a SCIF.  Why do we know that?  Because of the folks involved.  Specifically the folks involved are the folks that manage SIPRNET.
SIPRNET, also know as the HIGH SIDE is the US government's secure network for classified information.
              </p>
              <p>
               You cannot email from SIPRNET to nonsecure systems like state.gov. SIPRNET doesn't connect to the regular Internet. This is why no classified documents showed up on Clinton's server.  The issue with Clinton's server was about what they call spillage.  Spillage is when classifed info gets included in non classifed documents like emails on the nonsecure state.gov accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
               The process for the getting the SCIF at Clinton's NY house is Verizon has to lay the cables Then TWD comes in.  TWD is then the construction vendor needs to build out the SCIF and sets up the equipment.  Once the SCIF exists and has connection with Verizon, then it needs to be tested by IRM, the State Department's Bureau of Information Resources Management and DISA, the Defense Information System Agency to ensure it can connect with the White House Communication Agency.  Here's the relevant section.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                When can Verizon get into the house to start laying the lines/cables? We will probably need about'8 work days —for Verizon to lay lines, splicing - then TWD needs a couple days to set up the equipment, test it, then our offices in SES-IRM and DISA have to make sure that connection to WACA is right, etc.
               </p>

             I see the email chain is dated March 29, 2012, and mentions 'exhibits'

              Q: THERE IS SOMETHING THAT PUZZLES ME. WHEN YOU WENT INTO BARBADOS AND ME WITHTHESE TWO GUYS, THEY WERE GOING INTO YOUR COUNTRY TO INVESTIGATE?
             </p>
             <p>
              YES, THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF INVESTIGATIONS. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A CASE. THEY HAVE GOT THE EXHIBITS.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I found this email dated April 23, 2012 that talks about 'library exhibit' that is blanked out except for Hillary saying she found the exhibit material.  I wonder if 'exhibit' is code for something to do with child trafficking?

            Excerpt -----  "Without much fanfare, the State Department has released over 6,000 documents related to Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State, prompting speculation that it might contain explosive revelations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The State Department’s Reading Room website contains 301 pages, with 20 entries each, of emails released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rulings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since there was no official announcement of the data dump, conservative pundits that noticed it quickly began speculating that the cache contained compromising information about Clinton’s tenure at the State Department, during which she used a private email server located at one of her residences."
