            I get so confused with these freak music people. First, Selena is in a relationship with Abel from the Weeknd. His videos also portray the Illuminati symbols. His music is very sexual also. Abel &amp; Selena went public about relationship in Jan '17. 
Her music has gotten more &amp; more disturbing ever since. However, in Abel's song and video for Starboy, he seems to be calling out the powers who are controlling him!
            <br/>
            The whole Kidney transplant thing with Selena seems a little sketchy! First she was seen at different music festivals throughout the summer, and dancing backstage at the one at the Weeknds. She was photographed and videos of her &amp; the Weeknd getting on &amp; off planes going on dates ect.. all summer long!
Shit, when the hell could she have had a kidney transplant? 
Also, she looks drugged most of the time now.

             Most  A-listers' relationships are arranged by their PR Teams for mutual pap attention. Personal romantic involvements are usually kept separate and private. Furthermore lots of pics are taken at one time and then released very slowly to the paps. Therefore it looks like a faux couple are spending a lot more time together then they are in reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's well known Selena is a serious alcoholic and substance abuser who's been in rehab more than once. She's extremely petite and started partying at a very young age when she 1st entered the business. She did not scale back on imbibing due to her size. Therefore she needed a new liver or else. It was claimed that her girlfriend donated part of her liver. Not sensible as her liver wasn't in pristine condition either. Better to get a teen's liver who hadn't partied as much or as frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
             Child stars get used to being propped up by handlers so that they can be out partying instead of staying in bed recovering from illnesses or major surgery. Assistants handle literally everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             All stars have to do is smile for a few minutes in front of the paps, pose in an affectionate manner with their plus - 1 or set up boyfriend, sit there will makeup and hair are done for them, allow themselves to be dressed in clothing their stylist picks, consume a daily health drink and some water, and stay awake for part of an evening. That is it. Oh yes, and read a few comments given to them immediately before hand.

            Selena is role playing and following the "script" taking a figurative bite of the apple as seen in the video. She is a child just like the rest of them...the adults in power are more disturbing. Who financed? Who wrote the script and song about fetishes? Post those names and we will be helping Serena and the rest of them....

            At the end of the vid Selena Gomez walks into a hotel freezer. Recall another young woman was killed after being gang raped on live vid, and then placed in a hotel freezer so her organs could be sold. Selena Gomez the same month got a new liver.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate related for the focus on Selena showing off her child-like white cotton panties underneath a dress only a young girl would wear. Disturbing due to the adult male watching as if he were spying on her. Upsetting to watch as she's portraying a child repeatedly trying to commit suicide. There is blood. The scene ends with Selena walking into a freezer with the adult male still watching her kill herself.

              Did you watch it? The visuals especially the ending are what is so disturbing to me. Do you realize teen suicide is a very serious issue? Most common reason is a bad break up. Worse Selena Gomez is being portrayed as a young girl and not a teen or a young woman. Then there's the creepy, non-child looking adult male watching her the whole time.

               I did watch it and I agree with you.  It was terribly done and even aside from all you mentioned its just Selena flopping around spastically.  Something is not right there... drugs, message, or whatever
