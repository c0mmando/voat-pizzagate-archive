<p>A new report on the Catholic Church\'s child sexual abuse scandal provides damning evidence of the lengths the vatican went to cover up for abuser priests, effectively ensuring that many, many more children would be abused.</p>
<p>Link to article is above.  This is just sickening.</p>
<p><strong>From the article:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;... the report convincingly details how then-Pope and now St. John Paul II, who died in 2005, promoted McCarrick despite being very much aware of allegations that he was a predator who had sexually manipulated and abused seminarians. McCarrick denied the allegations against him in the past, but his attorney, Barry Coburn, has declined to comment since church authorities formally found him guilty in 2019 of sexual misconduct with minors and adults, &quot;with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power.</p>
<p>&quot;The report outlines how church authorities failed to take action as allegations mounted that McCarrick, an influential voice for the church internationally and a prodigious fundraiser, manipulated seminarians and male teenagers into unwanted sexual activity while serving as a New York priest and then as the leader of two New Jersey dioceses and the Archdiocese of Washington, DC. In January of this year, according to the Catholic News Service, McCarrick, who is 90, moved from a Kansas friary to a new location that has not been made public.&quot;</p>',

            According to James Grein, the alleged longtime abuse victim of McCarrick, the ex-cardinal went to St. Gallen in 1951 to visit friends of Grein’s grandfather, a venture that would significantly shape and solidify McCarrick’s career as he himself would relate to the New York Times in 2001. McCarrick’s visit to St. Gallen seemingly was connected with this communist training center that had been set up by the Soviets for the subversion of the Catholic Church.

            There is eye popping info in this article.  I have read others but there is info in here that no one has released before except since Bella Dodd.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a book written by a nurse that took care of a patient Jesuit priest that was selected to be the first infiltrator into the Society of Jesus aka the Jesuits.  This article has info from that book.  Astounding.

              Anytime I can help string those guys up I’m happy to oblige. Malachi’s Martin also wrote of the Jesuit Infiltration.  Someone claims that they spoke to a close friend of Martin and he died with sticks or twigs pushed into his brain. Of course others said different. What an evil world.

              So many out there. It’s sad. They are trying to kill the Church. The more they push into the priesthood the worse it gets. Good men know and now stay away. They don’t want to be raped by the Marxist infiltration.

            Francis may be painting others to take the stench off of himself.  McCarrick is friend of the CCP and is guilty of brokering the deal for Francis that sold off the control of the Chinese Roman Catholic Church to CCP.  Much torture and confiscating going on there.  Priests and Bishops etc. in hiding etc.  All while Francis is blaming others.  He played a greater roll in this than he will ever let on.

            "I see a lot of things happening that would really open many doors because President Xi and his government is concerned about things that Pope Francis is concerned about," said McCarrick, asserting the two leaders are of a similar mind on issues like "the care of poor, older people, children, our civilization and especially the ecology."
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes others may be involved but Francis bears the brunt of it.  He turned his head and looked the other way while McCarrick was busy selling off the Holy Catholic Church.  I am shocked he even bothered to release a report.

              McCarrick has Marxist ties in his early years in Switzerland.
