            : I am going to flair Wheeler's account 'Unverified', since there are no corroborating witness statements and the number of 8,000 to 12,000 babies in a single airport alone seems to be very high.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Fritz Springmeier, her co-author, has claimed he gets info from the 'Illuminati', and is respected by them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So while there are unfortunately indeed children held at airports and elsewhere that are being trafficked, her particular story might be disinfo (intentional or not).

             Very interesting. Looks like a lot of connections to Haiti, Epstein, Clintons, and Hollywood. A private airport could easily transport children for trafficking (slavery).

            This is disinformation 100%. It is that woman Sue Arrigo who claims to be a doctor and is not. She wrote this same disinformation under Cathy Fox and another name. She claimed to be a Presidential Model MK Ultra sex slave and that Obama raped her repeatedly at the White House etc, however, I found her real Facebook and email address and she is a 60 year old obese woman with 1980s style glasses and long straggly gray hair. She posts these things on multiple conspiracy websites and her sister wrote in to one apologizing saying her sister is sick with schizophrenia and doesn’t take her medication and that this is not true, she reads stuff online and reposts these accounts as her own stories. Time lines don’t add up on them either. I went down her rabbit hole, noticed a lot of inconsistencies and researched to find out who she really was. Sue Arrigo is her name but she uses so many different aliases even on here she posts with multiple accounts. Every time I call her out on this I get bombarded with rude messages from her accounts. It’s bizarre. Please do not fall for this story above, it is regurgitated info and made up accounts in her fictional story.

            A few months ago there were multiple copies of that book at archive.org and now most have been scrubbed. I recommend grabbing every Fritz Springmeier book you can find because they will all probably disappear. This is a lecture by Fritz.

             Could not access it.  Copied and pasted.  Comes up not found.  Already scrubbed?  If archived should pop up.   There are some books on ebay.  High prices mostly.

                haven't seen an attack like that in a while. Worried between this post + recent Sparkles posts that some serious sh*t is going to hit fan any second and Voat goes balls up again.

               <p>
                The info here is unbelievs. I was researching Sparkles pedo Bishop Uncle in Fl, but now have been majorly distracted by this.

                 Yeah, well there must be some serious information in those books by Springmeier.   they are not liking it one bit that we are putting info here about it.  Also if we start digging dig on MM it could get really HOT around here.

            I'm always skeptical of people that write fringe books under a pseudonym. Some people say that Linda "Cisco" hears voices, and is somewhat psychotic.

             I have the testimony of over 40 people that were mind control victims.  They always hear their other personalities when trying to reintegrate themselves back into one personality. It is normal and expected.

            This sounds identical to what Dr. Sue Arrigo describes she witnessed. I am fairly certain that you might be mixing information from two different books.  Below is Dr. Sue Arrigo's account of her experiences with shipping children by sea in shipping containers. Fascinating read.

                It sounds fake.  I mean, 3000 per week in electrified cages???  That's 150,000 a year.
               </p>
               <p>
                Think about the logistics of an operation like that.  Why electrified cages?  where are babies going to go?

                What I am saying is that you have to be careful what you hang your hat on.  Getting behind something so outrageous as these claims is a nice tool to discredit the whole PizzaGate movement once its relieved to be false and all the people bolstering  these claims are left with egg on their face.

                  Think about the logistics of an operation like that. Why electrified cages? where are babies going to go?

                  What I am saying is that you have to be careful what you hang your hat on. Getting behind something so outrageous as these claims is a nice tool to discredit the whole PizzaGate movement once its relieved to be false and all the people bolstering these claims are left with egg on their face.

                  Whose going to believe anything about PizzaGate after that?

                 I don't necessarily believe everything survivors say about their past experiences because the trauma often confuses their memories. All of Cisco's memories may not be accurate. I think she is a survivor because she seems to know too much about the process, but a lot of  her memories are probably jumbled into something she may not even be able to unravel.

               Uhm no.. just not everyone is so trusting and gullible. I’d expect that you were a follower of David Seaman too or that guy selling pizzagate clothes? People playing on people’s emotions to gain money, never heard of that before!

              - Has anyone attempted to estimate the actual size of the general public which may be pedophiles?  If we had an estimated size, you'd have to make some big educated guesses, but you could probably back out a very rough estimates of the number of children needed to supply their lust.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't doubt the existence of industrial-level trafficking.  The desert is a great place to stay unnoticed.

               I remember reading that 20% of the male population get aroused when seeing cp. These would be men that are soley attracted to children (the classic pedophiles) as well as men that mainly have sexual relationships with adults, but are attracted to children as well.

             Was a co writer with Fritz Springmeier that helped write How to Create an Undetectable Mind Control Slave. Book detailing how the government is using MK Ultra to create slaves in their program. Similar to Cathy O'Brien but book is more technical. You should have a look at Fritz's videos. Quite good/informative

              I think this person is disinfo. One of their biggest tricks, if they can’t keep the truth from coming out, is then to disinfo. This person is talking about the churches, so they are definitely disinfo. They are saying this started happening around 1940 with the churches—-no way!!! It was happening  centuries before that.

               Yes it has been happening for centuries, all over the world, but, the United States is a very young country historically speaking. It took a while for the mind control gang to become firmly rooted. Cisco is probably just speaking about her awareness of a concerted effort that she is familiar with.

               In the 1930s after the bankers fully captured the U.S. everything accelerated into what it is today, a cluster fuck.

            Sounds like China Lake.  I believe the recent fires in Northern California were to rid evidence from these god forsaken air bases / torture facilities.
