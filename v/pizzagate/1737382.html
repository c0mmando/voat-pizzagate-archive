<p>But what\'s more interesting is the fact that he said this, from the article - &quot;The majority are children in the foster care system who have been abused or come from broken homes&quot; according to Chuck Paul...</p>
<p>Then he says - &quot;It doesn\'t mean they were trafficked by their foster parents. It means that they would run away or have gone missing from their foster placement,&quot; Paul said. Hmm....we know through several cases that foster care systems have been caught trafficking children. So why would Paul say something like that? He specifically says &quot;it doesn\'t mean they were trafficked by their foster parents&quot; Sounds like he accidentally let the part slip. It wasn\'t a response to a question, just a statement following up his first statement. </p>
<p>How the U.S. Foster care system traffics children: <a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/2016/04/15/the-u-s-foster-care-system-modern-day-slavery-and-child-trafficking/">https://medicalkidnap.com/2016/04/15/the-u-s-foster-care-system-modern-day-slavery-and-child-trafficking/</a>   Why does Chuck Paul seem to not know about the Foster Care System trafficking kids? Surely a guy who investigates this stuff would know? How can he be so sure that the foster care system in San Antonio is 100% innocent? </p>
<p>But let\'s take a closer look into Chuck Paul, he spent 12 years as a child protective service special investigator. And now he is the president of the Alamo Youth Center: <a href="http://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/alamo-youth-center-would-help-sex-trafficking-victims-recover">http://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/alamo-youth-center-would-help-sex-trafficking-victims-recover</a></p>
<p>The Alamo youth center is also a non-profit organization: <a href="http://www.bccourier.com/Archives/News_detail.php?contentId=24175">http://www.bccourier.com/Archives/News_detail.php?contentId=24175</a> </p>
<p>Chuck Paul was also a U.S customs officer, is this how he gained experience on how to traffic kids across the border? Maybe that\'s why he operates in San Antonio, Texas? As we know, human trafficking is a big business in Mexico</p>
<p>This guy could be innocent, but we should still dig deeper into this. San Antonio is one of the major centers of child trafficking and the people trafficking humans are also the people who run these anti-child trafficking organizations.</p>',

            So this guy is building a youth center and it will be partnered with arrow.org I went to see who sponsors were..scrolled to the very bottom of page and saw that they are sponsored by Texas child protection and Maryland WtF? That's pretty odd to me...maybe I'm just hypersensitive now

            Everybody has a role to play in helping foster kids find God’s purpose for their lives. Yes, it starts with the dedicated family that takes a child into their home, but those families need all the help they can get. During a recent Regional Pastor’s Briefing, our Chief Relations Officer, Debi Tengler shared a few ways anybody can help. Contact us to learn how you can make a difference.

            Thank you for putting this together.  I wish more people would speak out on the corrupt business of Child Protective Services in this country.  If they only realized how easily it could be at their door next.  Here is a breaking story illustrating how easily it could be one of your loved ones next.  When it comes to CPS and the family court system, don't think your constitutional rights are worth anything in their eyes:
