            This board will tell you it's not fake.  I believe that article is a pretty good roundup of how pizzagate started.  However, I don't believe it was a necessarily a joke.  To some it may have been for lulz.  For others, I believe it was passed along with the intention of deliberately damaging Podesta and Clinton.  The places this started /pol/ and theDonald are hotbeds of conspiratorial thinking and filled with people who already thought the absolute worst of Clinton.   People actually will tell you she has been murdering people for decades.   Some may truly believe that.  I think many, many deep down do not believe it but very much want to believe that.  Lots of people who post her claim to be in fear as they post.   Motivated reasoning is an incredibly powerful thing.  Conspiratorial thinking is a incredibly powerful thing.  Once it was passed along, it might have brought along people who are simply and sincerely concerned about child abuse, however, when you get into reading this board, you will find that most of the posters believe many other conspiracies and thought this way waaaaaaay before pizzagate.  Infowars is repeatedly cited on this board, for example.  Pizzagate truly broke up went it was connected to Comet Ping Pong whose owner runs in weird, outsider, artsy circles.  People who believe pizzagate is real will say that he runs in weird outsider pedophile circles.  There's lot of evidence taken from social media, so it's not that things are not there and this is completely made up.  It's that the interpretation of what is there is hotly disputed.  What might be viewed a jokes among hipsters in a black humor vein are seen by others as sincere expressions of intention.  Search this site for the word killroom for an example.   The artsy circles that the owner of Comet Ping Pong runs in extends to his friend Tony Podesta who collects very edgy modern art.  And he is a lobbyist and brother of Hillary's campaign manager John Podesta.  Tony and John are big foodies into Italian food and pizza.  Or they are child sex traffickers and cannibals.  It's one of the two.

            Ironically I believe 4chan was one of the few places around that used the code Cheese Pizza for Child Porn because it was often traded there.

             Do you know about the psychological phenomenon known as priming?
            </p>
            <p>
             If you only read those emails after others determined they referred to child pornography, you will be highly, highly primed to use that same lens.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you walk into a store and see a coat is $199 and there's a price of $450 with a slash through it, you think this is a great sale. The truth is the coat always was $199 and they never ever sold it at $450.  It's incredible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Psychology teachers have done experiments with their class like Think of the last two digits of your phone number?
            </p>
            <p>
             Now write down the number of countries in Africa?   This something most people don't know, but when you look at the whole class.  People with high cellphone numbers guess a higher number.  This is a repeatable phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you really want to see what's going in John Podesta's email, read them in sequence and see if they strike you as strange.  Emails are not formal documents they are conversations, it's unreasonable to expect you would understand every bit of a conversation other people you don't know are having.

             <p>
              You don't need priming to think that sounds odd. While there's no solid proof that this is a code for child trafficking, there's some creepy stuff involved here. If anyone looks into Pizzagate and says "I don't know what's going on here, but some of this stuff is creepy"; that's a reasonable opinion.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are definitely pedophiles, and human trafficking is real. I can't say that's what these emails are about, but hopefully if anyone's curiosity is piqued, it can help draw awareness to a serious issue.

               If you think that email is creepy, you've been primed.  Odd does not mean creepy.  Yes, it's odd phrasing  But so what?  These are two old friends having an email conversation, why would you think you should understand all of their references?  There's nothing here to make you think it's some secret code.  There's not just no solid proof, there's literally zero evidence that this email relates to child trafficking and when you look at it, seems to relate to Christmas presents.

               By the way, I would do better on cheese.   Nowadays I eat too many carbs, I get hella sleepy.

               There are definitely pedophiles, and human trafficking is real.    Yes, and?  Should we randomly accuse people of being criminals to draw attention to crimes they didn't commit?  Should we be trawling through photos of people's kids and speculating if they have been abused?
