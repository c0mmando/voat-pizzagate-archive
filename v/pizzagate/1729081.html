<p>I am posting this link since another user shared it. It\'s long a whole 3 hours! But it is full of TONS of documentation and factual evidence that connects many of the same people we are investigating as well as some of the people who have tried to expose elite pedofiles. </p>
<p>Dr Steven Greer: is a UFO investigator. He seems to have stumbled upon some relevant information that might tie up a lot of our loose ends. Now remember that max spiers the UFO investigator may have been assasinated for investigating pedos in the military. 
<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3845622/amp/British-conspiracy-theorist-dead-sofa-Poland-investigating-alleged-Army-pedophilia-ring-just-death.html">https://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3845622/amp/British-conspiracy-theorist-dead-sofa-Poland-investigating-alleged-Army-pedophilia-ring-just-death.html</a></p>
<p>Now the reason I believe this is relevant is for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He explains the deep state who they are, what they do, how they network,  funding sources, and how they hold their power with documentation and names specifics names and front companies and government programs. 
So many leads!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He provides documentation corroborating the use of tunnels for human trafficking and even lists which bases are connected. Confirms the experiments going on und r ground at these bases. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He Refers to the CIA using a pizza shop as front with prostitution brokered out the back. He also explains the importance of drug trafficking to fund their operations. (Really interesting and eye opening backed names of contractors)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also has met with many of the persons of interest in the pizza gate investigation. Including John podesta. He discusses the old George bush as part of the deep state....and how jimmy carter was not deep state. ( this was confirmed by Cathy obrien who said he never used a presidential model) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also explains how the alien abductions are used to instil fear in the victims and are really government operatives. ( mk ultra )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He names a royal who confesses his bizarre satanic motivations that he meets with to cause the end of the world. He names him by name but I don\'t remember off hand....sorry . There are too many possible leads to list </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible that much of his information is false leads too. He has met with podesta for example. He also seems to get information from a 33rd degree mason. Is he naive? He might be because he seems to believe these high level officials do not have access to information that he has in his possession. Or he might be manipulating. I am hoping some of you might be able to shed some light. 
Can we vet this information? Does anyone know more about Steven Greer?</p>',

              There's your source you stupid cunt. He openly fucking bragged about it at one point. And I scrubbed my voat because I felt compromised you fucking retards. That includes you,

              . Jumping suspiciously on people before entering their claims into a search engine. Why? What I told you is true, yet the nonsense continues. Hold your fucking tongues for 5 seconds. I could tell you lots about it but now I'm not fucking bothered.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you were here often enough you would have seen the many submissions that will allow me to downvoat your asses for weeks. And by the way: aliens are bullshit.

            He also created a film called The Disclosure Project which I am yet to watch but is a video of almost 500 Air Force, Army, Police etc saying if needed they would swear on oath to congress they are telling the truth about suppression of aliens

            Out of sheer curiosity, I listened to a different two hour lecture of Steven Greer not that long ago. To be blunt, my takeaway was that he is on the whole unreliable. He comes off as credible for a time, and I believe he is sincere in his commitment to the subject matter, but the longer and more closely one listens, the weaker and more improbable the whole story becomes. The problem with people like Greer is that there's often just enough truth to their message to garner fast trust, but then one is dragged so far down a rabbit hole of fantasy that vulnerable people will end up groping for any kind of firm reality. There are logical inconsistencies and contradictions to his theories which causes everything he says to become suspect. The lecture I listened to did not delve into his thoughts on pizzagate, so I can't speak to that.

            I suppose the one element that he gets right is the idea that there are powerful and very well funded nefarious agencies that are manipulating what people see and hear in order to exercise control, but everyone already knows this.

             I agree, I am not sure if it is naïveté or he is trying to manipulate and plant false information. However, there were a lot of government contractors listed as well as army bases by name that uses tunnels. He exposes specifics names and places, with documentation. I suppose it would be easy to debunk if one knew how to foil, or investigate??? He also confirms that jimmy carter is not deep state. So it seems he is focused solely on the fact that he has secret knowledge about ufos, but the classified information seems to be credible. He even uses a pizza shop as an example at how the CIA conducts a prostitution ring. So there is some leads to be found. I plan on watching again my self.

              is a close approximation to my saying he's sincere in his commitment to the subject matter. I don't sense intent to manipulate or plant false information, but rather too much imagination and sheer conjecture about certain things, mixed into some truths about the deep state. I think I'd say his intentions are good. I'll try to find time to listen to this video for the heck of it.
