            I appreciate that, but does anyone read Pizzagatewhatever?

            Next time there is a music or cannibal related post, you could mention the butcher cover if I forget or miss it.  Obviously infiltration of the music industry is far greater than just the Beatles. It could be a whole wiki.

                 After 1966 when Paul died, possibly a bit before. They were too big an act for the British intel to not make use of. And lots of money involved. Paul was replaced by a talented Scottish studio musician William (Bill) Shears, who was a Freemason (he admits as much in his book but downplays it, also downplays his involvement in Satanism and the occult and seances etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Contracts via lawyers were signed by the other 3 that Paul would lead the band now and the direction would be more "counter-culture." The other 3 agreed under stress and they had no choice. The morbidity surrounding them was due to them wanting to drop hints in album covers and songs that Paul had died and been replaced. The whole thing affected the new Paul significantly too. Long and winding road ... I mean story. You can do a google search for interviews or get  the book "Memoirs of Billy Shears."
                </p>
                <p>
                 I seriously doubt any of them were pedophiles (though manager Epstein, who died at 32 and was homosexual) might have been. It's true they likely in younger days, bedded teenagers. That bloody babies butcher album cover was hated by most of the (young at that time) Beatles. John thought it was "cool," avant garde stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lennon was probably murdered for talking too much, there's some clouds surrounding Yoko too. Heather Mills is scared to death because she knows. Etc. Why'd you get me started on this?

                  Yeah, do tell! I don't know why I got you started, but I'm glad I did. But Epstein and Lennon had sex. What about Lennon and Jagger? There's a weird thing between the two bands. Remember when The Stones dressed up like The Beatles? That's very occult.

                   There's been some speculation about Lennon's sexuality. I doubt he was into men much but wouldn't surprise me if he "experimented" when he was wasted. Had big problems with heroin. "Cold Turkey" song is about that. Also the song "I'm So Tired" on the White Album." Listen to Lennon's song "Mother" and feel his heart break about his childhood. Some primeval "screaming" in there. Spooky.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I doubt Jagger was into men much either (though he reveled in being thought of as androgynous and loved wearing make-up for a while) but I do know Lennon and he were great friends and had same sense of humor. Jagger did "rape" Mackenzie Phillips while in her dad's house (dad was Mama's and The Papa's founder and wrote "San Francisco Flowers in Your Hair" and gave it away to his friend and lead singer Mackenzie who he named his daughter after). High on Arrival is her book, it's incredible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Paul (Faul they call him) says the Stones indeed are flat out Satanists ... but again, he dodges the question concerning his own involvement. Don't remember the Stones dressing up like the Beatles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This is such a deep rabbit hole, much more that would blow your mind. I'm no kook and it took me almost two years (off and on) to understand everything and finally grudgingly embrace it. I had to quit looking at it, just too heavy.

                    The Beatles had to be Satanic ... at least Lennon did. Wasn't he part of the Kenneth Anger crowd? Mick Jagger definitely was. And I believe Jagger was caught in bed with Bowie. As for MacKenzie Phillip, have no idea whether she was molested. I tend to believe accusations such as these, and she fits the screwed up kid that was molested, so somebody got to her would be my guess. There is a deep rabbit hole. I was doing some digging into the Kenneth Anger angle and it gets to be too much. You're right. I also connected some of what The Zodiac Killer did with The Beatles music. I can't remember all the clues. I assembled, or if they made sense, but I've always felt that Manson was either involved or knew. So many ways to think about this, but Lennon was definitely part of that crowd.

                     I don't know the name Kenneth Anger, I'll have to check him out. I like to have good sources, I don't like to speculate (the truth is crazy enough). Nothing would surprise me about Lennon, but I know he was a pretty unhappy person, and battled addiction. Sir Paul it appears, when he took over the band, led the others astray, though Lennon was pretty independent ... they all ended up hating Sir Paul. Sir Paul was, and still  is, into the occult. And I believe he is "handled" by intelligence. Don't know much about the Zodiac and the Beatles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I do know that CIA used Sir Paul and others (Mamas and the Papas) to infiltrate the Monterrey Pop Festival and distribute LSD to see the effects. Even JFK experimented with LSD through his mistress Mary Pinochet (book Mary's Mosaic) and Timothy Leary.

                     There was a very complex connection between Manson and CIA, the Beatles, and esp the Beach Boys who Manson stayed with and even recorded a song with. The Beatles lyrics written in blood at the Tate place were before the album even came out. The house belonged to Doris Day's son Terry Melcher who was a record producer, and of course all these famous people are involved, Polanski, Folger, Sebring, Tate. What a mess. I think it was a CIA operation, the murders. Manson always stated that he never killed anyone. He was a petty criminal who owned nothing till the CIA "enlisted" him.

                      I often say that what we're seeing is Charlie's War. He definitely was used by the CIA. He created "snuff films", and Polanski was into the same type of stuff. He filmed pornography and had a cache of it at his home. Sebring and Watson were connected by hair dressing. Drugs were smuggled in wigs shipped. Also Tate allegedly had no connection to Watson and yet he had use of her car. I'd say that was mighty generous of her to just handover her car for a complete stranger to use. Now you may call that speculation, but it's just getting real. Obviously, there are connections that media has never come forward in revealing and that's what I'm interested in. Anger is one of the biggest players in connecting the dots and spreading the Satanic doctrine. There was also another major player in LA and I'll be damned if I can remember his name. Was gay or transgender ... and was involved up to his eyeballs in this shit. Lots of creepy connections. Then there's your namesake David Lynch presenting to us the concept of punching a hole through the universe and creating a cataclysmic event so terrifying that others can go back and visit or "ride." Take "a" ride like Helter Skelter. Yup, it's all hidden in plain sight an that's what makes it so scary.

                       I am familiar w/ the Houston socialite played by Julia Roberts in the film. I have seen her River Oaks house. Charlie eventually went off the deep end.

                       "Shampoo" w/ Warren Beatty was based on Sebring. Helter Skelter was what the Brits called their roller coasters. That's what the song is about ... supposedly.

                       I doubt we'll ever get to the bottom of Manson rabbit hole, it's just too wild, too much. But fascinating. Mae Brussel was "on" the fact that Manson was CIA as far back as 1971. Weird.

                         Speaking of the Beatles that damned Sir Paul is taking a lot of the Beatles stuff off you tube 'cause he's a jerk, and wants recognition for what he's done (as William Shepard) before he dies. Ergo, the above clip is not the original from the White Album.

                           Linda knew who he was when they married, they were pretty tight. If he did abuse her it would have been risky, as she is Linda Eastman of Eastman Kodak fame. Both vegetarians BTW.

                           Poor Heather didn't know. Have no idea how she found out but it was NOT a good thing (obviously). Knowing Sir Paul, he was smoking weed one night and confessed, possibly. Then she blew a gasket. Or maybe through the grapevine and she confronted him (bad move). You should watch The Winged Beatle (maybe you have).

                           Here's Heather with her "insurance file."  And mentioning being "topped off" (killed).

                            Linda was promiscuous. I think it was partly the times, but she slept with pretty much everyone she photographed ... or met. She did the same with him and told many people he gave her crabs. Like I said, I think it was the times, but I'm putting it out there. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, she was from a rich family ... and is current wife i mafioso money. Maybe it's more an alliance for him.

                             Yeah, all that sounds right. She was pretty loose. She came from the wealthy Eastman Kodak (camera film) company family. And she was minimally attractive. But they did seem to get along (though yeah sounds like an "open marriage"). The best thing about her was that Faul could confide in her and tell all his secrets.

                             "Alliance" ... yes, his past two marriages I highly doubt were "organic." Why would he marry an amputee? (But why does Elton John marry a man when he could have, like Jagger, any woman he wanted ... go figure.)

                              Now Tate marrying Polanski ... WTH?!!!! Polanski must have been abusive and tore away at her insecurities. Then Polanski presented himself as some kind of genius and Hollywood went along with that. Whatever. But Rosemary's Baby? Not sure about that at all. That's another part of this rabbit hole. Mia Farrow has all those adopted kids and marries a pedo that the judge all but said was a pedo. She has the chance to bring charges and doesn't?

                               Polanski. Yeah I know. Nutcase. Beatle's song "Sexy Sadie" was about how Maharishi Yogi betrayed them all by hitting on Mia Farrow when they all went out to visit him in India. Just change the name "Sadie" in the song to Maharishi Yogi. That's the way it was originally written but Harrison begged Lennon to change it.

                               Of course Farrow said Woody Allen molested their daughter. Wouldn't be surprised at all w/ all the pedo movies he's made.

                               Song (from same album) "Dear Prudence" was about ...

                              <p>
                               "Dear Prudence [is] written in India. A song about Mia Farrow's sister, who seemed to go slightly barmy, meditating too long, and couldn't come out of the little hut that we were livin' in. They selected me and George to try and bring her out because she would trust us. If she'd been in the West, they would have put her away. We got her out of the house. She'd been locked in for three weeks and wouldn't come out, trying to reach God quicker than anybody else. That was the competition in Maharishi's camp: who was going to get cosmic first." - Lennon

                                I think he also hit on Patti Harrison. I think George was the most advanced thinker in terms of compassion. He admitted responsibility for neglecting his wife and didn't harbor ill will towards either her or Eric Clapton for getting together. I think he got the concept that ideals are ideals and the people who espouse ideals may be flawed. It doesn't change the ideal or make it wrong. I think he also could forgive, and true forgiveness, is reserved for a rarefied few. And Julia is a pretty song, BUT .... there's plenty of angst in there. A little boy begging his mother to come out and play when she's probably in there drinking or with a hangover or with another man. Very sad. Yeah, Mia Farrow ... Rosemary ... Sharon Marie Tate. Sharon Tate was supposed to play that part, but did she play it in real life ... ?

                                 Wow, haven't listened to "Julia" in a while, I should check out the lyrics. In that movie about Lennon as a boy there is suggestiveness of he and his mom being just a little too close. Yeah I liked George, the only one that stayed somewhat "grounded."  He was the youngster among them. Always seeking something.

                                 Sweet guy but as they say he didn't "suffer fools gladly." When intel infiltrated them manager Epstein told John to keep an eye on George, as George had a tendency to just speak the truth, "say what's on his mind." Probably why he was nearly killed also. One thing he couldn't beat was cigarettes.

                                  Speaking the truth was why I liked him. Now George, I'd be surprised as hell to find out he was anything but what was presented. Wrote some damn good songs along the way also.

                                   I agree. I believe, though he was a nervous wreck from the break-up and all that entailed (not to mention bitter), and it really shook him up and helped make the man he was ... I believe he was a pretty normal guy. What you see is what you get. Straight-shooter speaking about Faul (whom he cared not for).

                                       She's pretty gross. Never liked her. You see Harrison's reaction. Ringo says she and John were tight. But, there's too many negative rumors about her. In the Winged Beatle there's a quick segment showing the controversy where she says she did not know who Lennon even was upon first meeting him (she's always said that) versus she did indeed know who he was. I need to research it.

                                        She latched onto him. Definitely a handler. The Beatles did have money and power. She used him to spread commie ideas. The woman as nigg*r shit ... I'm not saying that woman aren't oppressed, they are in a lot of ways, but her? Nothing I hate more than a wealthy aristocrat helping out the poor and oppressed by pretending to be poor and oppressed. And did you see the shoutout he gave the CALIFORNIA DEM that backed Yoko's campaign (because it wasn't John's ... John admits he thought it was ridiculous, but then he miraculously got his mind spun around -- it's what a shitload of drugs and a handler can do. Remember: Nixon said that John Lennon was the most dangerous enemy. I always thought that was the most ridiculous statement, but then when pizzagate happened, I'm like, holy shit! Nixon was right. The part Lennon played was so clear and he even set the precedent for Obama's disastrous immigration program. And her saying she shot him? What was that supposed to be? The only thing I don't know is why. My guess was to make him a martyr and keep the legend of what he was alive. If people had seen he was a drugged up, duped, fucking idiot commie that fraternized with Manson and Satanists, he would have lost his luster. Yoko reminds me a lot of Killary and that is NOT a compliment!

                                         Right, people did not know the real Lennon, just what was presented to them. His song "Imagine" is a delusional dream. Communism glorified. One 'probably' good book about him is the one on his days in NYC, but again, who knows what's true and what's not. I'm trying to eventually watch this (below) don't know what will be true and what will be false though. Maybe you've heard of it.

                                          No, I have not heard of it, but am familiar with the narrative. It was that Lennon was this knight in shining armor trying to fight for the little people's plight and Nixon was "a crazy" who was delusional and hated Lennon for being uplifting the masses and spitting truth. Now that I'm thinking about this, Yoko was his mother. They look alike and I never even got the similarities. They looked alike, were both hooked on substance abuse, and he doted on both trying to please Yoko like he pleased his mom. It's probably why Yoko handled him like she did. Coming out and playing with him when being good and punishing by distancing herself when he was bad. It leads me to believe that the death of his mother was purposeful ... if not an incendiary event, it was used to get to him psychologically an place the worst person in the world next to him to guide his thought process and use him for the narrative they were trying to advance. It's all one big cabal and Lennon was dangerous and Nixon was right.

                                           That's weird, they did look alike, and she was very much like a mother figure to him, which he would have willingly embraced due to his mom's early death. Yeah, I think she wore the pants in the family. So there was probably more to George's disdain for her than just her "breaking up the band," which of course was the excuse for the break-up. She was a control freak - and maybe not just on a familial level...

                                            I'm sure not. And they all hated her. While people had problems with Linda's father, Maureen, Patti, and Linda did not cause friction with band members. Nobody wanted to quit except for when John started bringing that hag Yoko to practice. It all fits nicely now. Herd mentality. John wouldn't listen, but couldn't because it was a Mommie Dearest thing going on. Remember the famous shot of him nude and in a fetal position kissing Yoko? (Rolling Stone cover) .... and lookie this!!! Just found this while perusing in the dumpster.

                                             Whoa! No wonder the movie about his boyhood kept implying that. I believe it ... and I would imagine his mom indeed would have been quite the facilitator ... she was wild. 
Yeah, I had to cover my kids' eyes in the store when that nude issue came out - I thought it was pretty gross.

                                              It just goes to show how molestation and inappropriate sexual behavior can mess up a mind. Funny how this never even occurred to me before, but there it is ... and there is this faction taking advantage of it to advance an agenda.

                      Anger was Bowies manager in the beginning of his career, he was also deeply in love with Bowie, a kind of a father figure too. their relationship was cut down by David after idontrememberrightnow, he didn't really understand the route Bowie took artistically and whatnot. and also because David wasn't in love with him.

                       Thanks for this. I gotta run, but have you ever heard of Rodney BINGENHEIMER (sorry for all caps)? He was a big Bowie fan and I went out to meet him at his club back in '75. They were all crazy punk rockers. I was trying to be a star lol, glad I failed. They were crazy. Talk later.

               Mother was killed instantly by a car just after the young Lennon was beginning to get to know her (she had given him up and his dad was a seaman who never wanted Lennon either), she was quite a "free spirit," his auntie was raising him at the time, whose alcoholic husband abused Lennon, she continued to rear him, though they had lots of "fights" ... she later went on tour to America with him.

                Well, he was 17. That's a pretty long time to wait for his mother to come around. I just googled the death and she was killed by a cop? Really? At 17, the elite would know he was uber talented and smart. Incendiary event ... then a handler like Yoko Ono got her hooks into him.

                 A cop (maybe off-duty) ran over her. Sounds right. But at this point in time they were very much nobody's, so very doubtful it was anything but an accident. Paul's death in a car accident is speculated, whether an accident or not. There was a girl in the car, she was leaving home and had a suitcase, apparently he picked her up, she died too. Paul was unrecognizable, even by dental records, his parents had to help, the girl was identified by the belongings in suitcase. The song "She's Leaving Home" is about her, she was going to Sweden, running away from home.

                   Unfortunately. This has brought (below) Heather to the brink of suicide. You should listen to the whole interview, it's good. I tried to contact (original) Paul's daughter on facebook but she won't respond. I don't blame her ... another long story.

             They said Manson was CIA so maybe the song was a mk trigger for him. But I'm almost thinking that Paul and John might have done that Tate murder themselves. I don't know anymore.

              I'm absolutely certain Manson was CIA. And Lennon spent a lot of time out in LA. There was a story about him getting belligerent and into a fight. It was so out of character ... and I'm talking about the character that the press propaganda painted him to be, but, yeah, I don't doubt anything anymore. Lennon was a pig.

               Apparently he was invited to that Sharon Tate party but didn't show up (or did he?) and there's a quote of him saying he would float around parties and end up at somewhere like doris day's house. Sharon Tate rented Doris Day's house and that's where she was killed. I know, what to believe anymore?

                Yes ... there's no doubt he knew about that. How could he not? And he's in LA and Manson is listening to his music and Lennon never even hears this even though they know the same people and are swimming in the same pool? Come on ...

            The Beatles, like the Rolling Stones, et al, were essentially a creation of the intelligence services. The performers who refused to go along with the "program" were replaced along the way as the agenda got creepier. This continues to be the case with "pop" music.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was hoping that someone would mention this album jacket. I remember that it was recalled right away, though a friend of mine had a copy--it was revolting really--but looks so different in the context of #pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul was replaced around that time and this is commemorated by the SGT Pepper cover that came out afterwards.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 1967 Sgt Pepper cover is much more subtle but with a lot more embedded information.

             The graphics and evolution of the band and the music really makes sense if you accept the premiss that Paul was killed/died. Honestly I never really looked critically at Beatles work and album art before. I grew up with it around, but it was just mixed in with the rest

              Of course it makes sense, as you said. It was all planned by the intelligence services.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember well when I first listened to the Sgt. Pepper album and realized that everything had changed, and not for the better either.
             </p>
             <p>
              My friends and I stared at the cover and tried to figure out what it was and we decided that it was Paul's graveside service and the date of his death (on the bass drum) was September 11th--a date that has "come up" more frequently through the past 40 years or so.(though it also is the Pentagon building date of groundbreaking in 1942 as well.

               Alester Crowley had been dead twenty years to the year that the Pepper album came out that featured him. In the book, Faul admits this meaning of the line, "It was 20 years ago today, Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play." Faul loved Crowley and all the magic and symbolism and Lewis Carroll stuff and hidden code in words though he downplays it in the book.

                Lewis Carroll is another one-- a real pedo for sure.

                Most people do not realize that "pop" music of at least the last 50 years is written and controlled by intellignece services for their own purposes--it may go back further than that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Back then, it was promoting drugs and "new age" BS, now they've escalated to worse. Look at that Kay Perry video.

                It's like Game of Thrones--created to desensitize people to egregious violence and meaninglessness of their lives, while promoting  rape, incest, etc. It;s made of whole cloth probably at Langley, VA.

                 The Sir Paul book really gets into their fascination with the whole Lewis Carroll thing and Alice in Wonderland. That is largely what inspired their coded clues etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "Jabberwocky" in Alice in Wonderland has to do with "inverted" words and images, that's where they got the idea of holding up the bass drum to a mirror to read it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For sure, the brainwashing and desensitizing and instilling lust goes back to '50s rock and probably jazz. Some young people today would be shocked to see a clip of Jerry Lee Lewis playing the piano. They really started it all. (And of course Little Richard and Chuck Berry ... they were wild on stage.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yeah, the whole point was/is to propagate sensuality (and now worse) to the detriment of spirituality, making us no more than beasts (which of course fits well w/ evolution). If it feels good do it. Moral Relativism. A slippery slope to God only knows where.

                  I suppose you have heard of the Lewis Carroll Collectors Guild?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Guild was operated by David Lechton until he died in 1988 at which time it disbanded. It was a group that supposedly served those with an innocent interest in nudity. It published a newsletter called "Wonderland." It contained some nude photos of preteens (so much for an innocent interest.) It also had contact pages for pedophiles. It had subscribers from Japan, Mexico and Canada.

              Whoever deleted this post is probably a a very young and ignorant person, who obviously does not want anyone to connect the dots that lead back to the Intelligence services or a certain group of people. Yet they had lots of waste of space devoted to David Seaman, Alex Jones, Chernovich or other idiots, Reddit BS and TV guide stuff.

            Ringo was my first Beatle Love. Paul was my second  love and then I fell in love with all of them.  I swooned over them.  Little did I know that  I would suspect Paul of being one of those Royal Knighted Pedophiles.  I wouldn't see him now if they paid me. I use to love listening to John sing Woman and Imagine.  I don't know what to make of them now.  They have all turned out to be disappointments and worse. Just like all my other idols.

                Exactly. They would be very different people today. You just don't see things till you really look, like the height, Sir Paul is at least six foot, and very lanky. He's also five years older! (As you probably know.) People think I'm insane LOL. But I'm more than convinced. If you get the book it explains so much, Lady Madonna is a day by day account of the week the band learned of his death. They were running around crazy ... "see how they run." John was out of the country and they couldn't reach him. Man, I better go to bed. Here's how Paul would look today, ironically this guy gives tours of Paul's old home, people wonder if it's him, I doubt it but it's uncanny.

                 You are correct, I do know about the age discrepancy and much than what I have mentioned on this thread.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyway, I've seen that video before. I agree--it is uncanny as you say--that man has speaks like Paul for sure, not like Faul at all. I can't bring myself to watch it again--I don't know maybe I too am very tired or it creeps me out/ is sad somehow. Or it could be his brother. Dead or disappeared--the Sgt Pepper cover is a graveside service with Sept 11 as the sate of Paul's "death"/disappearance. Of course Paul had a brother, and do not think it is the guy they threw at us who bears no resemblance to anyone in that family--maybe a handler of some kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Paul was not from a wealthy family; he lost his mother when young and was close to his Dad, raised conservatively. Faul did not go to Paul's father's funeral! I think that is very telling. the press gave him a pass on it.

                  I share all the same sentiments, I esp understand what you're saying about the guy in the video, it is sad, sentimental, just too much to take. I know about the funeral too. We could talk endlessly, it's pretty neat when you meet someone else who has discovered something that you have also. It is confirmation and validation. This is a sad mess. I hope you get the book. Take care and good day, or evening ... BTW, I have actually been to the Mersey (River), near where the car crash happened as revealed in the MMystery Tour album jacket (it's all in the book). Bye for now.

                   Thanks so much. Yes, it's a relief to find someone who has a clue in all this. Confirmation and validation as you said.
I'll definitely look into the book.
I'm  taking a break for now too.
I'll leave you with this:

              WHAT?  You mean I made Chicken Maryland for nothing?  I would dream that he and I were eating it together. That was all a sham too?  I don't even know which Paul I made it for.

               Probably the original, decent one I like to think. Faul tried very card to copy him and was slightly better at when he was younger--now he just doesn't even bother to wear his contacts to have the eye color of the original Paul, which was brown, not green or blue like Faul.

                I remember that Paul had brown eyes.  Ah, I remember it well. I believe that whatever happened within the Beatles, it was all arranged.  The Psychedelic Period was when I left them. I think I will make Chicken Maryland, but not for Paul or Faul.  For my husband.

                 I can't believe how many people do not remember the real Paul. I'm glad you do. He was a charismatic person, not like the bum they replaced him with.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Maybe you remember how Jane Asher broke up with Faul right away, whereas she had been engaged to Paul.

                  Yes, I remember Jane Asher.  A duo named Peter and Gordon, Peter was her brother Peter Asher.  Us young girls were extremely jealous of Jane and so very glad when they broke up. Yes I do remember Paul, I remember also that he was more lively when interviewed and more personable.  Yes, maybe if they do not want to go along, they are replaced.  I wonder what happened to the first Paul?

              I don't think he was. I think they mkultra'd him and initiated him into the illuminati. Heather mills says she has a secret on him that would devastate and depress all his fans. I think it's the satanism and pedophilia he's made to do. His 13 year old daughter with Heather is transgender and expressionless and this fits the pattern.

               I know MKUltra can do a lot of harm to person, but I never knew they could significantly change height, shoes size, eye color, shape and size of skull, pupil distance, direction of hair swirl on crown of head, and voice. You do realize that recordings which have been analyzed show three different voices for Faul after 1966?
              </p>
              <p>
               I do not doubt that Faul is sold out completely and might well be all the things you said-- I couldn't care less about him. 
But I am certain that Faul is not the original Paul.
              </p>
              <p>
               I doubt Satanism would deter his fans--look at Katy Perry and the rest of them--more popular than ever. Someone just criticized a YouTuber who made a video about Perry's used tampon-like costume at the Met gala and got a comment saying her Satanism was fine, how dare he criticize her clothes:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gToZLt39CFE">

              </p>
              <p>
               People who do not remember the real Paul might not like to know he is an impostor, on the other hand.

                I've looked at Faul vs Paul a lot, and it looks like the same guy. Height changes because of heels, pupils can change with dehydration and smoking and drugs, same with eye color, his shape and size of skull, eh his face was thinner in 1967 and so was John's probably from the drugs and satanists coming down on them. The hair thing though, if his part was in reverse. I have a theory that once you get into the illuminati, they make you reverse your part. I've seen it in other celebrities after the sell out. Paul and Fauls ears and brow and nose bridge are the same to me. I don't expect you to change your mind on Faul, and hey you could be right, maybe it's that clone thing people talk about.
               </p>
               <p>
                And as far as fans, I don't think people understand that satanist really do and believe. I didn't a year ago. Heather has the truth on Paul/Faul probably so she can stay alive.

                 I respectfully disagree--no doubt personal experience is different as well, especially if you had seen them both up close.
                </p>
                <p>
                 All the things you mentioned such as heels on shoes, contact lenses, etc. have all been accounted for and the result is two different men. The Paul in 1967 was already Faul--his jaw shape and teeth were different as well--it's not a matter of "thinness". Faul had some plastic surgery also, and that is why he temporarily sported a mangy mustache and why they could not appear even in photos for a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A hair swirl has nothing to do with how you part your hair--it is the direction of follicle growth and cannot be changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How do account for an entirely different shoe size, shape of hands, or that suddenly Faul is playing guitar right handed by mistake--on video too--, when Paul only played a left handed bass?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, no one yet has been able to modify the cartilage of the ear successfully and that is yet another difference between Paul and Faul. In Germany and other countries, the right ear cartilage (not earlobes which change with age) is used to ID people more reliably than fingerprints.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pupil distance refers to the distance on the face between the pupils, not whether they are dilated by drugs or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Forensic studies have been conducted by specialist who realize that there are least tow different people we are talking about.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The voice prints on the later albums are of three different people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Paul was engaged for some time to Jane Asher--they had dated for long time and we planning on getting married. After Paul died, she broke up--without any explanation--with Faul.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Faul later married Linda Eastman ( some spooky background that one had) and much later the Mills character. Both of those slags were no sort of woman the real Paul would be caught dead with, no pun intended.

If a double can play and write songs that good, I'm very impressed. Maybe it was a secret twin, dunno. Sounds like you hung out with him/them back in the day and had first hand knowledge?

                   The new Paul was a talented musician, songwriter, and pro studio musician from Scotland. This explains much. Dad (he says) was a high up Mason, as Paul (Faul) is. Faul had his own band circa '63 like the Beatles, Denny Lane (not his real name) was in the band with him. (Penny Lane comes from a joke about Denny Lane and a girl named Penny.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Lane joined Faul later to form Wings after Faul left the Beatles. Below lyrics, Faul is hinting at and actually explaining this relationship with Denny Lane, and how far back it goes. Lane played guitar in that old band (leader of the band was Phil Ackrill which is another rabbit hole).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Lyrics from song Rock Show by Wings, notice the reference to Faul's old Phil Ackrill band, "Philly Willy" and his old friend Denny Lane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "What's that man holding in his hand?
He looks a lot like a guy, I knew way back when
It's silly Willy with Philly Band
Could be, ooh-ee"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Here's another band Faul had pre-Beatles, Billy and the Pepper Pots. That's where the album name Sgt. Pepper comes from. They even recorded some early Beatle hits.

                    It's hard to parse her thoughts but it seems like she is saying her family was bought in the 1800's by the rockefellars from the queen and every generation serves at their pleasure. Then she says her brother had her join a stock blog owned by paul mccartney and his son Kid Rock ran it. It dealt with stock price manipulation and trading slaves as penny stock, and she ckaims to have been a sex slave traded around. Lots of famous names thrown around

                   Everybody back in the day couldn't understand why all the Beatles grew beards at the same time LOL. Partly to conceal plastic surgery and partly just to deflect from any recognition. All the big bands knew about it. Paul (Faul) was big buddies with Keith Moon. How could they not know, they knew the old Paul personally.

               That's because Heather Mills was involved with Faul, not Paul. That was "secret" she was afraid to make public.
              </p>
              <p>
               I remember the original Paul--who did not have the same voice, appearance, height or even shoe size of the faker who replaced him. All of those things have been proven by forensic evidence, but were well known many years ago by those of us who took a great interest in Paul as a person. We knew after 1966 he was absolutely not the same, but no one asked us. the music went straight from love to drugs, and not all of us followed that path.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many of us who also noticed the drastic change in the music as well and didn't like them anymore were wondering what was wrong with this "new Paul" or Faul as George Harrison started calling him--they developed a very different, though almost as large, fan base.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have very old, rare recordings of Paul speaking candidly (fr. 1965). Anyone who saw the original Bealtels up close knows.
              </p>
              <p>
               No internet back then, so it was easier for them to pull it off. People who missed the originals may not realize that The Beatles never did anymore live performances after the real Paul was gone. Their manager, Epstein--a homosexual heroin addict--made that announcement in 1966.

                If Paul did die, I think they made that car accident happen. You ever see this?

                   They do not want you to know the truth, yet the "facts" presented do not make sense. This happens in all their programs from 9/11 to Sandy Hook on purpose, so people will be discouraged from doing real research on it.

                   They count on brainwashing a younger generation who has no direct knowledge of what went on.

                   Yeah, near Liverpool. The location is on the album cover (or album cover inserts) of Magical Mystery Tour. Faul was bummed that no one picked up on it. There's a video clip in Winged Beatle with the Beatles and a small car passing right through McCartney's head.

             obviously anyone who is Knighted is on the Pedo bus, (rewarded for violence and depravity) but I was surprised to learn of this photo. I've been reading up on Paul just now, and they were given royal honors in 1965, the butcher photo came just after. A commonality among many of these people are that they lost a parent at a young age. I suspect that makes them easier to turn or influence.

              Yes, it is true that they prey upon children of single parents or parents that are both working and may be poor.  What depraved morons.  I believe a lot of the stars after being spirited in, became MK Ultra and it just went down hill from there.  It seems once they have joined in that they never seem to straighten up or leave the fold.  They don't seem to speak out or if they do they have their brains scrambled or a mysterious suicide takes place. Now we also have parents  sacrificing their children to Hollywood.  That is why I say I am done with idols.

            The Beatles were a Tavistock operation. (see the original/real Paul's GF Jane Asher, daughter of Tavistock psychiatrist plus Crowley on Sgt. Pepper's album cover, etc.).

             I think the Beatles were among many raised and groomed in freemason/mi6/cia households after wwII, the talented ones move forward, they got big on their own music talents, the illuminati then decide to rope them in, the moped and car accidents were warnings to Paul, and when he disappeared with Mal Evans in 1966 he went full illuminati from that moment on and he never behaved the same way. I don't think he died really, just symbolically and they laid all those easter eggs to please the masters. I think Brian Epstein was sacrificed to Paul's benefit. Paul then suggests Allen Klein out of nowhere to manage their money, with Allen (who managed and probably killed Sam Cooke) intending to take all of their money. John may or may not have been indoctrinated, probably not as compliant as Paul, and satanist witch Yoko was sent in by the CIA to take him over with heroine and influence. Her reward was John's estate after the cia sent in mkultra operatives to kill him. I'm a huge Beatles fan and I don't want to believe any of this but my voice of reason is louder than my fandom and this and your tavistock theory kind of are making things fall into place.

              Good to see someone redpilled on this. Much speculation is now not so necessary, with the release of Sir Paul's book The Memoirs of Billy Shears, ghostwritten by a Mormon.

                I was a kid in 1969 when the story broke and we listened to a radio program ... couldn't sleep for nights after that. Kind of like after reading Helter Skelter. Stufff is still creepy (Paul).

                 I didn't realize how big and mainstream the rumor got until watching these old news shows on it. If it's not him it's remarkable the double wrote and performed all those great songs. He can be kind of creepy you're right. I'm going to read those books now thanks

                  Hope you do read them, you can start w/ condensed version "Billy's Back." It was a huge story, and was hard for them to stop it. It never really went away, and like other things w/ the internet, it's busted wide open now. And where there's smoke there's fire, usually (concerning rumors). OK I'll shut-up now :)

                   You don't have to shut up, i could talk about the Beatles all day. I'll check that book out thanks. It's crazy crowley's book is called Winged Beetle and Paul was in Wings and Beatles. And the book says to listen to records backwards. When i saw there were two pauls in yellow submarine and the other satanic stuff and the so many references to Bill, my hair stood up, and thought holy shit Paul probably has split personality disorder.

                    Mike Williams is good on this subject, here's a good interview.

                    They say Winged Beatle was actually produced by Sir Paul. Lot of never before seen stuff in there, but it goes by so fast. Of course Sir Paul's Blackbird was about his final escape from the Beatles to start his own band, Wings. "Take these broken wings and learn to fly, you were only waiting for this moment to arrive."

                    The book really explains a lot of lyrics. Why "She came in through the bathroom window, protected by a silver spoon." Jane Asher, born w/ a silver spoon in her mouth. On and on. "One and one and one is three."

                        should collaborate on a music/pizzagate related wiki because this thread is just a tiny crack in the beatles and their part in the larger picture.  I will add that everything related to Bob Geldorf rankles me to no end but this current thread is deleted and the subject deserves more coverage.

                         I think you or someone redpilled me on Geldolf. That guy is a huge phony pos cultist. Everything about him is totally messed up. I've definititely started looking into a McCartney trafficking link btw. I'll think about starting a subverse.

                         It does deserve more coverage, but it may have to wait as many other posts are in the wings still being researched.

                         There could be much better organization of the site, IMHO, but we have to make the best of it, and most of all not give up independent research.

                          yes, bringing up old musicians isn't going to expose current criminals. It just reinforces how much we are up against, seeing it with new pizzagate eyes is alarming though.

                         Hey would anyone believe ... Sir Paul was playing the role of Vivian Stanshall the whole time he was with the Beatles? Talk about mind-blowing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Sir Paul was a role-player and great musician. He could act. He was known as "the man with the thousand voices" in studio musician circles, as his song Fool on the Hill says, "The man with the thousand voices is keeping perfectly still."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This is Sir Paul! Below. Yes it is. Freak me out man. It's all in the book, and the author HAS to be Sir Paul, too much info.
